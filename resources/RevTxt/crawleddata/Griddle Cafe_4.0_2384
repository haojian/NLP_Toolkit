Wow! I have never seen a pancake that big in my life! Goodness! I literally planned one of my days off to come here and have breakfast. ÊWe arrived (myself plus 1) around noon and the place was busy! All the tables were filled up, I thought we were going to wait Êawhile to be seated but we were actually seated after 10 mins. Yes its very crowded but this is expected. Our server was on it! He took our order with accuracy and our food was out in a timely manner:) When our food came I could not believe my eyes, Huge portions. We ordered the Golden Ticket Pancakes which were soooo yummy, definitely hit the spot. We also ordered a chicago style scramble very tasty as well. We shared this between the both of us, yet honestly 4 people couldve shared this and it wouldve been fine. The atmosphere was very awake and lively. I loved it. Prices are great for the amount of food you get. Make sure you come with an appetite. I would definitely come back.

Yum! ÊGriddle Cafe has definitely become a go-to eatery during LA trips for me. I wish that I had gone to this place sooner because only being able to squeeze in two visits to GC during my stay didn't feel like enough! ÊHaving gone two separate times with a party of three, on each visit we were seated quickly (within 15 minutes) and received great service. ÊThe place is packed, but I enjoyed the hustle and bustle feel of the place because everything seemed well-run and organized. ÊThey must have it down to a science here because the food comes out quickly and they are able to turn tables just as fast. Now on to the food: anyone with functioning taste buds should be able to find something to enjoy at GC; the menu is extensive and offers an array of breakfast and lunch options. ÊSimply reading the menu item descriptions is enough to make your mouth water and give you a smile (some names and descriptions incorporate humor). ÊDuring our first visit, I ordered the "Mounds of Pleasure" pancakes, which is comprised of three stacked pancakes that consume their plate, and the pancakes arrived fully loaded (I posted a photo in hopes of capturing all of the yummy goodness of the chocolate, coconut, and whip cream, but it's something that needs to be experienced with your taste buds). ÊWhile I intended to eat the pancakes myself, you could easily feed a family with just one order of pancakes (lesson learned and noted to self). ÊWhile I was able to make a dent about halfway in to the pancakes, when I boxed the rest to take home, that was easily the heaviest to-go box that I have ever taken home in my life. ÊA friend and I also ordered their "Baja Loco" steak tacos. ÊThese tacos were so good that we ordered them again during our second visit. ÊWe were also huge fans of the freshly baked chips that came with the tacos. ÊAgain, the portions were plentiful, and we even found ourselves later snacking on leftover chips while stuck in LA traffic. During each visit, we were impressed with both the food and the efficiency of GC. ÊOne would think that with such a relatively small space for dining and the vast number of menu items to prepare that the concept would be a recipe for failure, but GC and the staff behind it make it a success. ÊAs a result, I consider GC a must-visit institution. Side notes: This is a breakfast/brunch/lunch eatery and closes at 4 PM, so make sure that you roll out of bed in time, make plans, conquer traffic, etc. early enough for your GC fix. ÊI can't speak for the men's restroom, but the ladies' restroom looks as if a tornado hit it. ÊOn both visits, there were a number of strewn toilet paper rolls on the floor and the paper towel dispenser was tilted and askew (but thankfully worked). Parking can easily be found across the street (with plenty of room, even for bad parallel parkers). ÊAfter your meal, you may feel like you need to be rolled down the street or lifted with a crane in order to get to your car, but the brief walk will help you justify your gluttony.

I came here on a Sunday at 10:30 for brunch. The wait wasn't terrible, only about 20 minutes. We got the red velvet pancakes and the Charlie scramble. The pancakes were deliciouss, I've never had something like it. Definitely get just one though to share between 2 people. It's hugee. I felt it was more of a dessert than breakfast. ÊDefinitely order a cup of coffee or a glass of milk to pair with the pancakes. ÊThe eggs were okay. Nothing too special, but still good nonetheless. Ê I will definitely come back to try the other pancakes, they all sound yummy.

I finally got to experience the Griddle Cafe. Although my experience is no different than everyone else's who came here and waited for up to an hour or more just to get seated. But while you wait outside against the wall, single file, there's the "George Clinton" guy who comes around with his fake rap songs dedicated to your name. If he doesn't have a good song with your name in it, he'll just put in another name instead. Trust me, give him a fake name like "Lord Voldemort" and he'll say...ummm your new name is Joe. That guy is fucking annoying. Anyways, the griddle cafe does deliver. It's hard to get a sample of everything since your plate will be too big to get another plate as a side. I ordered "The Golden Ticket." No, it's not the same golden ticket where you run home and tell the parents so you can go inside Willy Wonka palace. This golden ticket will literally prevent you from running. 3 whole pancakes that will put you to sleep in no time. The sandman got me after just 5 to 6 bites. He sprinkled on the sand like there is no tomorrow. Or in my case, sprinkled on the sugar as it traversed through my veins. Very good stuff, rich and decadent. I had to get bites from my friends plates to balance it out. The same goes for them. You definitely need something salty or meaty to get you through this behemoth. I wouldn't mind coming back, but I probably wouldn't go for the more extravegent stuff. Maybe the more traditional, bacon and eggs kind of deal instead of the all sugar and butter concoction found in The Golden Ticket.

I usually sit at the counter, a side table or one of the private rooms in the back - recently my son and I sat right in front of the kitchen. I was facing the cooks and felt I really needed to update my review to give that 4 man crew a shout out. They were seriously hustling! I'm always grateful when my chocolate chip cookie chips ahoy french toast hits our table but just watching these guys crank out all of these decadent breakie items gave me a new appreciation for this place. Still my favorite breakfast ever! In the words of my eleven year old son "this is the best pancake I have ever had in life" - he always orders one chocolate chip pancake with butter and powdered sugar - and always has some leftover for breakfast the next morning. I suggest going here during the week towards the afternoon. Most mornings and every weekend morning is a whole different story and somehow I am always in line behind someone super annoying. It's nice when you are able to walk right in and be seated.

We went around 11 on a Thursday, and didn't have to wait because there were only two of us. ÊLarger groups were still waiting. ÊI don't think there is a "slow" time here. My wife got the Red Velvet Pancake and nearly managed to finish. ÊShe said it was amazing. I opted for the Oreo Pancakes (I don't recall the menu name) and like a complete idiot got the full stack. ÊThey were served with a lump of something halfway between whip cream and Oreo cream that was possible the richest substance I have consumed in my life. I powered through one full pancake, and about half of that lump of cream. ÊIt was absolutely delicious, but by the end of it I felt woozy and was half convinced I'd just given myself diabetes. The portions, as big as they look when you see the plates carried by, are even bigger than you think. ÊI'm a guy who's been known to scarf down a 4X4 and three shakes at In-N-Out. ÊWhen I say these portions are huge, I mean it. Don't get a full stack unless you wish yourself serious bodily injury. The service was excellent, and very prompt. ÊThe waiter kept our glasses full and to his credit - he DID warn me the full stack was huge. ÊI'm the moron who didn't listen. Parking was a little bit of a nightmare.

Went there on Friday for breakfast with three other friends and was having a 4th meet us there. When we arrived they took our name down and told us that they would not seat the 4 of us until the 5th got there, so we said, ok fine we have just 4 then. The host told us that if a 5th showed up he would not be served, that they will not allow a chair to be pulled up! We waited for our friend, and when he finally showed up the jerk of a host have us a table for 4 Êand pulled a chair up for the 5th! This little twirp gets of on the only power he will ever have in his life, and that's controlling when he'll seat you! The above is enough reason to not return to a restaurant in my opinion.! We placed our food order and a Giant pancake to start with. All the food arrived pretty much at the same time even though the pancake was supposed to start us off, and since we had a table for 4 with a chair pulled up there was no room. I do have the say that the pancake was delicious (Best Item we had)! The rest of the food was OK at best. I would not return to this place unless it was to order a Giant pancake during a slow time for them. I'd recommend the owner or manager fire the hosting twirp, and spend a couple of dollars on customer service for the rest of the staff.

The breakfast I had here changed my life. ÊI have NEVER had pancakes this GOOD in my entire life and I am convinced that I will never have any that are better. Ê This was my first visit to the Griddle Cafe, and we went on a late Friday morning. ÊThere was a small line, but we did not have to wait that long. ÊOur server was very friendly and prompt, and the overall atmosphere was fun. I ordered the Scotch on the Rocks pancakes which had coconut, pecan, walnut, and butterscotch topped with a mound of whipped cream and powdered sugar. ÊAMAZING. ÊThe 3 pancakes were around 8-10 inches diameter and were cooked PERFECTLY. ÊI was only able to finish about 1/3 of my plate, but I devoured the rest over 3 subsequent leftover meals. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone as it has amazing food with a long list of selections. ÊMy only gripe: I can't come to this restaurant every day as I live in Ohio.

This review is only for the to-go food! The line was too long and we had a large group so we opted for take out. While waiting for take out, everything that came out to the tables looked really good and pretty ginormous! The sizes are hefty!!!! We got the banana pancakes and it was the size of my head! And there's 3 of them!!!! We got the french toast also. The food itself is good. Not to die for good, but just good. I think the ginormous portions are what people come for?

When it comes to breakfast places, I rate on a scale of 1 to Griddle. A true sign of a great place, to me, is when you're stuck on one item on the menu and you will never get to try the other things, because what you've found is the best possible version of that dish. The Griddle's French Toast is that item. They close in the afternoon so I rarely get the opportunity to go but it's fantastic. Bonus points for playing Boomerang with it's Hanna Barbara cartoons on the televisions for perfect breakfast ambiance.

This place is loud, fun, and tasty. Ive been twice now, and wouldn't hesitate to go back. The only reason I haven't given five stars is the noise and the waiting time. other than that, this place is bloody delicious. The pancakes are the size of the moon! Ok, not that big, but approximately 12 inches in diameter and half an inch thick. Do ÊNOT underestimate them. They come in threes as standard. This is not for the faint hearted - may I suggest that you just order one? :-) Favourites so far: the Lemon Barry, Bananas, and the almond Joy. Also - they do french press coffee. YES. Down sides? The egg and bacon based dishes are totally underwhelming. Come here for the sweet breakfast based stuff, go somewhere else for the savoury. And finally, a word of advice: Do not plan any rigorous exercise after eating here - you will need a gentle walk and a nap.

I've been here several times and over the times with my bf, bf and his friend, my parents, me and my bff, etc it was getting a little old and eh. For the first time I had a non breakfast menu item here and it was the shrimp pesto melt. and HOLY SHIT, it was SO good. It was an absolutely enormous portion and I only ate half of it for breakfast/lunch. The combination of capers, spinach, mozzarella with pesto and huge fresh shrimp on their super thick french bread was just gah @T@ (Puking rainbow) They also added new menu items like red velvet pancakes and stuff. I also tried some of that (which is just okay) and the cheesecake french toast which tasted amazing! Yeah... I'll be coming back, definitely a turn on again!!!!

If you're a pancake lover, you've hit jackpot! The pancakes are humongous here. AND they're layered so get ready to pack on the pounds! I'm not a huge fan of pancakes so I didn't go gaga over this place but I can see why it's sucha hit with yelpers. The portions are huge and the food is good. Simple as that. I got the Banananas pancake and the Charlie scramble and they were good but just very overwhelming. The pancakes could feed like 4 people so come with friends! I also really liked the eggs because it was a medley of all sorts of things. They all mushed together very nicely. It's also a very hip and trendy place. A great spot for brunch with friends! I did come here for lunch on a weekday and it was packed but still got seated immediately at the bar. For parking, you should just park at the plaza two blocks down because it's free and just a short walking distance! The service isn't that great here so be willing to wait!

Well I am not a really big fan of American breakfast. It's like eating dessert in the morning, but once in a while it is nice when you know that you have a long day ahead of you and need to energize yourself up. I had the mom's French toast and so far this was the best French toast I have had in the US (I am alway entertained by these names, mom's sth, Grandma's sth. My mom and Grandma never made such things). It came it two giant pieces. I was able to finish one and a half and fell pretty bloated after. Sweets fill up me fast. The place is located in West Hollywood, and you can expect three things: difficult parking, limited dinning space and good looking people pretending to be sophisicated speakers. This cafe has actually ok parking because it shares the parking lot with Rite Aid (at least it was what they told me and I didn't get a violation ticket). In the future when I go back to LA, I don't think I will be going back to this place since even the food was pretty good, nothing really sang.

ÊThe pancakes are 12 inches across and completely cover the plate. I won't bother with photos as they are all online already. ÊIf you are in LA this place is worth the wait.

ÊWe're going back in two days for the French toast which we heard was the best from the wait staff AFTER we ordered our pancakes. ÊPeanut butter crunch french toast here I come! Bonus, you get your choice of mild, medium or dark roast French press coffee and they bring you the French press. Best coffee I have ever had at a breakfast spot.

Who lives in LA and never eaten Griddle before? You are not angles then haha.. I love their peanut baba french toast, mom's french toast, and the potato skin(forgot the name). The pancake is HUGE in 5stacks!! I don't recommend to order it if you just come with 2 or 3 people. You won't be able to finish it. Their red velvet pancake is just okay.. I didn't find it super good or memorable but it depends on your preference haha :p One of the server recommend me the banana pancake but I don't feel it special.

What's more exciting to start your morning than having a humongous yet scrumptious brunch? My girlfriend and I decided The Griddle as our first Fourth of July destination to pig out. Having read numerous reviews about the restaurant, our expectations were high but you never know what your dining experience would be until you get to have a chance to taste the food. Here's what we ordered: The Red Velvet Pancake - This big-O' one-of-a-kind dessert-like pancake came up short to our standards. The cream cheese frosting was too sweet to go along with the pancake and one would need to have an extreme sweet tooth to bear the taste. My word of advice: your pancreas would go nuts producing insulin as an overly abundant source of glucose went going through your bloodstream!!! (No offense to any of the 'Red Velvet' super fans out there.) 'Going Fishing' - This dish is definitely worth a try. This savory concoction was composed of shrimps, red and green bell peppers, egg whites, and a little touch of capers sprinkled around the top. The ingredients came along pretty well and the egg whites were amazingly light. If there was anyone who would be worried about having an calorie-overdose, 'Going Fishing' could be the option. Mom's French Toast - NOW THIS IS WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT! My girlfriend and I were singing our prayers as we took our first bite from this baby. The toast were mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm TASTY! The butter adds a smooth and rich texture onto the toast and The Griddle's one-of-a-kind maple syrup kicked this dish up to a whole new other level. Without a doubt, this was by far one of the best french toasts we have ever ate. Irish O'Cream Latte - This drink paired up the meal pretty well. Bailey's cream were added and the bitterness of the Latte soothed the level of satiety within our stomach. If your stomach expands like a hot-air balloon after the meal, the Irish Latte could be the solution. Enough said, The Griddle deserved 4 stars based on their gargantuan servings of God-like french toasts, solidly-cooked egg whites, and Irish latte. We took a star away based on our disappointment upon the Red Velvet Pancake. We would definitely be back for more. Courtesy Reminder: Before ordering any dishes, please be ensure that your stomach will eventually get stuffed!!!

First day of my vacation, and the brother insisted that I take him out to breakfast. We wanted to try this place in Long Beach, but sadly they were close on Mondays. So looked on Yelp for breakfast suggestion, and Griddle Cafe was on the top of the list. Walking up to the place, we saw a line. Being that it was Monday at 830am, that must have meant it was good food! Thankfully since it was just the two of us, we were seated at the bar. Seated and ordered my coffee to start. You get your own French Press pot, and the coffee was delicious which makes me happy :) Onto breakfast, I ordered the 'Some Like It Hot" egg scramble with a side of potatoes (instead of the chips that it usually comes with) while the brother couldn't decide on the pancake or french toast, so he got both the "Addicted to Noisella" and their famous "Red Velvet Pancake" The food was delivered quickly and hot. My scramble was very yummy. It had a nice kick of heat that was not overpowering and the potatoes were the best. I think I love the potatoes more than the scramble. Had a bite of the brother french toast, and although it was good, it was too sweet for me. But he loved it...was very hesitated to give me a bite. We barely made a dent in the pancake. He was too involved with his french toast and me with the scramble. But the bites that we did taste we understood why they were known for it. It was not as sweet as I expected, so it was good for me. Portion are HUGE here, and Êyou definitely get your moneys worth cause you don't leave hungry. It's street parking, so that's a pain, but you can always parking on the surrounding neighborhood, just remember to read the posted signs. Overall, it's a nice, friendly, great breakfast joint that people looking for good, huge portion, breakfast place, should try.

Wow! Must-haves: Red Velvet Pancake [B+], Charlies Scramble [B] Skip: the line! Go after 3 I knew there was a reason why every time I pass by this place there is a line! The Red Velvet Pancake was super tasty, mainly because of the cream, but there are some things to consider when ordering it. You should treat this as a dessert to share. If you order one all to yourself you will likely get sick from the sugar overload. The sugar overload comes from the cream so if you do want red velvet pancakes you don't get sick from, have the sauce on the side. Charlie's Scramble was also very good. I loved the combination of the ingredients. The amount of bacon they used was just enough to bring the plate up another level. Bottom Line: YES! Try this place out! You'll love it.

Word of advice: if you are not a sweet tooth, don't bother going to The Griddle. Luckily, I love dessert and was a fan of their pancakes. I came with a group of friends and decided to order family style, a wise choice considering each dish was too sweet to eat continuously. We ended up having to take a lot of food home simply because we could not eat any more dessert. Red Velvet Pancake: This is what they are known for, although it is honestly more like cake than a pancake. This was delicious but I had difficulty eating more than a few bites. I felt the powdered sugar and intense frosting on top was a bit excessive. Yellow Brick Road Pancakes: These buttermilk pancakes with walnuts and caramel were absolutely amazing. The stack of three pancakes was sweet without being too much like the red velvet pancake. I definitely want to come back to try some of the other stacks of pancakes. Shrimp omelet: The egg dish we got was pretty standard. It tasted good, but similar to other places I have been to.

Charlie's scramble is a crowd pleaser if you want something with eggs. The Benedict was mediocre. You can find better Benedict's elsewhere with sweeter hollandaise sauce. Banana nana pancakes are awesome if youre craving a banana bread type of pastry. Peanut buba is also a favorite if you're in the mood for a mouthful of peanut butter. Tis the season is a really good pumpkin pancake that is not as sweet as the other choices on the menu. The "Hear me Roar" pancakes definitely bring back the kid inside you with the strawberries and frosted flakes

"This is one of the reasons why you are getting fat." The statement recurs in my head every time I think of Griddle Cafe. Sweet and savory, just simply scrumptious stuffs. My first visit here screams "Woohoo! As good as it gets!" The restaurant is located on the bustling Sunset Blvd near Fairfax intersection in the heart of West Hollywood. It is an unquestionably hot spot for breakfast/brunch/lunch spot as well as a celebrity sight-seeing every now and then. TIK TOK TIK TOK: You've probably read or heard of their horrendous line, yes, it is true. What do they say, "When there is a line to order, the food must be good." Well, if I have plenty of time of the day, I wouldn't mind that. However, I wouldn't bother coming at peak hours on weekends. I came on a weekday and did not have to wait for my table. Also, if you want to stop by after 3pm (they close at 4pm), I believe there should be a shorter wait time to no wait at all. FOOD: First of all, the portion is gigantic. Their signature pancakes are bigger than my face and there is a stack of three per order. I saw a lot of people ordering pancakes but ended up finishing only 1/4 to 1/2 of the portion and not even bothered togo-ing the rest. I was thinking either the portion was too big or the pancakes were just not that great. So, we went for poached y papas benedict and mom's french toast. Wow! I had a bite of the french toast and it was magical. It ate deliciously well. On the other hand, my friend enjoyed his egg benedict, two halves of English muffins topped with ham, bacon, poached eggs and delicious Hollandaise sauce. I rarely order cocktails while having brunch, but my friend suggested to try the bottomless mimosa. That is definitely a great addition to our meal. Brunch wouldn't be brunch without a bottomless mimosa, would it? PARKING: I've read about a free parking lot behind Rite Aid on the corner, but there is a tow warning if you do not shop there. Skeptical, we went on a street parking hunt instead, luckily, we found a free parking about 100ft away from the cafe on Hayworth Ave and there was no time limit whatsoever. SERVICE: If you don't buy the quality of food they serve here, there must be some serious things going on with you. However, in case you don't. you must swoon over the male waiters, oh my gosh, they are hot. I mean, most of them are quite good looking. Service is stellar, the waiter occasionally checked on us to make sure we were satisfied with our meal. Griddle Cafe is definitely one of the places where it is highly likely that you have to wait in line to be seated. Nonetheless, the wait is totally worthwhile. And watch out, you are about to go into food coma.

This was our next stop on our food tour and there was only a 10 minute wait. I really wanted to try the hot chocolate french toast, but they weren't serving it that day. :( You're supposed to follow them on Twitter to find out the secret passwords to the off-menu items...oh well. The portions are huge! I couldn't finish what i got and since we had 4 more food places to go...I was saving room!

Pure. Pancake. Goodness. Word to the wise: don't be selfish here and share your damn plate of food! There is no way in hell a single person can finish off one plate of Griddle's gigantic, scrumptiously layered pancakes covered in powdered sugar with a helping of tasty syrup on the side. To some, Griddle Cafe can be seen as an overrated breakfast diner that's simply known for their huge portions. ÊOn the other hand, I like to think of it as a haven for pancake enthusiast myself to try out unique blends of fluffy flavors while possibly dining next to a celebrity/YouTube star that maybe one person in the small restaurant would have seen before. My favorite pancakes: Oreo and Red Velvet! ÊBot hare out of this world, and the five of us in our party had to take a good chunk of it home. ÊWe also ordered an omelette to share and some fries and nachos on the side. ÊAll of the hearty, savory food delivered, so combine them with your pancake of choice and you will be set. If you feel a bit classy, the $7 mimosa can get you going. Pinky's up! Thank you Griddle Cafe for another awesome breakfast experience. ÊYour lines may be long, but your pancakes seal the deal for me. ÊIf only you had a larger location to accommodate more customers at once, but I guess the novelty of having people waiting in line does bring in more business. Parking is available in a small private lot behind the cafe. ÊYou'll have to get your ticket validated inside the restaurant before you leave.

This stuff is bad, in the best way. The Oreo Pancake is as absurd as you might imagine it to be, but somehow even better than that. Theres three to a stack so order for a group and share those things family style. Our last trip, the wife had a shrimp sandwich with pesto, and I had some cheeseburger with jalapenos. Both were delicious. Its fortunate that Griddle Cafe isn't really local to me, because I'd go all the time.

Flavor is amazing, but a word of advice: if you're a group of 4 chicks, as we were, DO NOT order 4 servings of pancakes. Maybe get 2 different kinds and call it a day. They were stacked 3 high - couldn't finish 1. Also, pancakes tend me overly sweet, so get something a little lighter to pair with something flavorful. ÊI'll be back, and next time I'll do it the right way!

The place never fails. Food's incredible - if you're vegan or looking to shed that freshman 15, stay away. But if you wanna stuff your face with some tastiness, hit it up and take home the leftovers for a pancake dinner. French Pressed coffee rules. It's def crowded inside and out, but it's part of the deal. Servers are average, but that's an LA thing. ÊThe dude working the list is awesome.

The line here is no joke. On my first attempt to eat here I foolishly came at 1 on a Saturday and ended up eating at The Counter across the street. Although disappointed, I vowed to return. The second time I learned, and came much earlier. Even though I got here at 10am, which is pretty good for a college student on a Saturday, I still had to wait a good 30 minutes. This place was PACKED. They really utilize every square inch of the restaurant to jam as many paying-customers in as possible. Everything on the menu looked delicious and detrimental for anyone on a diet. To that I say: YOLO! After perusing the menu, my friend and I settled on: Irish Cream O'Latte: This came in a huge cup and was perfect for sharing. You can DEFINITELY taste that irish cream liquor. I found it too strong for my tastes, but my alchy-of-a-best friend loved it. Golden Ticket: 3 huge pancakes filled with caramel, walnuts, and streusal, Topped with a very unhealthy heap of whipped cream, caramel, and streusel. This is a one-way ticket to delicious carb heaven, aka diabetesland. No one person should be able to finish this. My friend and I were both ravenously hungry and we didn't even manage to kill half of this monstrosity. I found out later on that you can order just a single pancake for $3 less. If you're not intending to share, I highly recommend you order a single one. Hashbrowns: We ordered these simply so we'd have a salty balance to our sugary pancakes. The potatoes weren't as cripsy as I would have liked. These were fairly underwhelming and I probably won't order them again. This place is a must-try for any breakfast-aficionado with an insatiable sweet tooth! Be prepared for lines and do not overestimate your stomach capacity! I look forward to my return.

Ok here's the deal, I usually only give 5 star reviews when the meal is one of the best I've ever had. I've only done a handful of 5 star reviews, and Griddle Cafe is the first breakfast place to receive one. I wouldn't necessarily say my all-over meal at Griddle was one of the best in my life, but I definitely ate one of the best tasting things in my life, and that's a fact. This is how it happened; a friend of mine was visiting from out of town and it was her last day here. We wanted to get an amazing breakfast before I took her to the airport. I was frantically scouring the Yelp world to try to find a good place before the masses all woke up and left for breakfast at the same time. Among the contenders was Griddle Cafe. I've heard from a lot of people that Griddle Cafe serves one of the best breakfasts in all of LA so I decided to check them out. While looking at their website I noticed they had red velvet pancakes. Done! We both jumped up and ran down to my car in a flash. The area around Griddle Cafe is by far one of the worst for parking. The residential streets are all permit parking and the increasingly expensive meters only last two hours. However, we were lucky enough to find parking in the shared lot behind Rite Aid (hint hint). When we got inside, we gave our name to the host and he told us to stand in line outside against the wall. There's two different lines on the sidewalk in front of the restaurant -- one is for tables of two, and the other is for tables of 3 or 4. Make sure you get in the right line!! After 20 minutes or so the host came and got us and led us to our table. The dining area inside is just as loud as it is cramped. They have small booths, smaller tables in the center, and a communal bar that stretches around the kitchen. When our server handed us our menus we didn't even look at them. We told him immediately that we each wanted the red velvet pancake. Easy peasy. We waited 40 minutes or so for our food to come, but it wasn't much of a surprise. The place was absolutely jam packed with people. It was so loud my friend and I finally had to resort to shouting across the table to each other. The pancake came huge and was bigger than the plate it came on. It was thick and moist and sprinkled with the perfect amount of chocolate powder and powdered sugar. The best part though was the cream cheese frosting that came in a swirl on top. After just the first bite we both looked at each other with the biggest smiles you'd ever see. Absolutely. Freaking. Amazing. Griddle Cafe is also known for having delicious syrup. I tried one bite of my red velvet pancake with syrup and it was great, but it didn't even need syrup. We each finished about half of the large pancake and ended up taking the rest to go. (Due to my friend's long flight I also got her leftovers, score!) Griddle Cafe is at the beginning of the Sunset Strip and is infamous for its long waits. It's not uncommon to drive by and spot the ridiculously long line stretching down Sunset. However, the red velvet pancake, like I said before, is one of the best things I've ever tasted. That alone is worth the wait. Griddle Cafe is truly a must try for anyone living in or visiting LA.

Came here on a sunday around 11, got nervous seeing the line but due to the highly efficient person that does the seating.. I waited no more then 20mins! It's pretty cozy inside, so be prepared to really get to know your neighbors haha I highly recommend looking at the menu before you go, there are sooooo many selections and EVERYTHING looks good! I got the Black Magic which is crushed oreos on three gigantic pancakes, def was not able to finish it! The black magic was good but after a couple of bites the oreo's became a little overwhelming.. Next time I go, Im going for their red velvet (thats what their best known for) and the person by me got it and they finished most of it! On a side note, all the employees are men! No wonder the women's bathroom was not in the greatest condition. Haha and my server Michael looked kinda familiar then my friend placed it... he stared in a film called Road Trip 2. Of course we didn't bring it up to him but thought it was pretty funny... Friendly and efficient staff! Cant wait to go back.

This place serves a pretty awesome breakfast once you get past the parking and the waiting and actually get in... The wait on the weekend can be long, we waited for 45 minutes at noon on Sunday. ÊDon't write your name on the waiting list yourself, and don't arbitrarily get in the back of a line as there are multiple lines depending on the size of your party, check in with the host/hostess directly as they can be persnickety... Parking in the area can be treacherous, I didn't heed the advice of my fellow Yelpers to park in the RiteAid lot and wound up with a parking ticket around the corner on the residential street; Êturns out that you can park for only 1 hour (?) unless you have a residential permit... Customers are overflowing onto the 5 or 6 sidewalk tables from the packed seating inside, elbow room is tight with inside seating. ÊThe portions tend to be large so adjust your appetite... The Poached y Papas Benedict with extra avocado was marvelously done. ÊA generous slab of seasoned baked ham was adorned with two perfectly poached eggs, Êan incredible Hollandaise sauce, and (extra) avocado slices. ÊAll of this was sitting on top of a couple of slightly hollowed and crispy baked potato skins, their take over a traditional English muffin. ÊThe eggs were particularly done well, once the tender membrane was pierced, Êa golden lava of egg yolk gently drizzled over the top to combine with the rich buttery Hollandaise sauce and the salty savory ham. ÊA separate side of potatoes isn't needed with this dish as the skins suffice... http://www.yelp.com/biz_É I wasn't going to let Mrs. L. steal the entire show with her Benedict, even though we always share. ÊI had the Strawberries and Cream Waffles. ÊThe Belgium waffle had deep crevasses to hold the Vermont maple syrup, the best kind in my opinion, just pure sweetness. ÊThe waffle also had a brown sugar sour cream topping that added another element of creamy sweetness to the dusting of confectioners sugar and the fresh strawberry slices. ÊJust going through the different layers of sweetness to get to the crispy fluffy waffle was rewarding and fun... http://www.yelp.com/biz_É French pressed Coffee is particularly rewarding and worth the short time to allow it to brew in the individual press pots. ÊThe coarser ground releases more intense coffee flavor and oils using this method that is otherwise trapped by a conventional paper drip filter resulting in a deeper tasting cup of coffee... http://www.yelp.com/biz_É The service that we received from our waiter Mark was congenial and attentive, especially considering how busy it was. ÊHe came back twice to check if we were ok and to refill our coffee. ÊI even forgave our mecurial host for the terse lecture I initially received when I was ignorant of the waiting system when we first arrived as his demeanor seemed to soften by the time we were led to our table, By then he seemed friendly as time heals... Armed with the knowledge that there is better parking and that I can forgive the wait for the terrific food we had, I could raise my rating to a five star the next time we make it out here...

Abundant Amiability ! Don't let the line deter you its worth the maybe 10 min wait!! Walk in and see and smell the goodness.. FULL FORCE breakfast with overflowing signature pancakes and frre flowing french press coffee! We had the too cool Hayden as a server that walked us first timers through the process. We took both of his recommendations the "some like it HOT" eggs tequila infused sausage and the Mamas French Toast( no syrup required). Lots of food tons of flavor yummy . French toast a party in your mouth.. He hit the mark. Topped off with cranberry mimosas. For such a busy place we were well attended .. only negative .. was that we werent as hungry to finish the super delish larger portions.. its your favor to savor this treat !

I usually try my best not to jump on the 5-star bandwagon but we truly had an incredible experience for 3 reasons: 1. NO WAIT. We came at prime time and the joint was absolutely packed... but we were seated immediately. How? I have no idea. But being a celebrity has its perks, I suppose. 2. Not only were we seated immediately, we got the best seat in the house! (big corner booth right by the windows) and the waiter was supper attentive, friendly, and quick. 3. THE FOOD! I literally couldn't eat for the rest of the day because I was so full. I got the "Cobb Sandwich" burger (avocado, green onion, bacon, lettuce, tomato, and crumbled blue cheese) and my mate got the "Golden Ticket" which was 1/2 eaten before we had to get it to go. ALSO - thank the Lord someone finally has steak cut fries instead of these skimpy ones restaurants seem to always serve. There is no other breakfast restaurant ÊI would rather eat at.

WOW this place was packed for Saturday brunch. ÊWe were lucky and only had to wait about 20 minutes to get seated because we got there at 10:30am. Latte - delicious. ÊI'm not a big coffee drinker so the added foam and sweetness made this easy for me to drink. Coffee - Jaimin S. had the coffee and said it was pretty good. ÊI thought it was cool that it came out in a french press. Ê Red Velvet Pancake - this was the main reason we decided to come here...I just had to try this pancake. ÊIt was a huge relatively thin pancake with swirls of warm cream cheese on top. ÊIt was pretty delicious, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel a sugar/sweetness overload by the time I was 3/4 done. Say Cheese Eggs - hubbie had this for breakfast and said it was pretty good. ÊHe didn't like the potatoes that came with the eggs though and I don't blame him. ÊThe potatoes were a bit hard/clumpy and would have been much better if they were crispy with some seasoning!

This place is just so so. The pancakes are huge and have ok flavor. There are lots of ridiculous flavor combinations but I have only tried the strawberry and cream ones. In a word--inedible. How do you screw up strawberries and cream? It wasn't whipped cream or Bavarian cream, it was some sort of minty concoction. The second time I went I had a plain pancake and decided I probably will never return. If you go, ask for one ot two pancakes because the regular serving of three pancakes is too much for 3 people.

My friend and I were looking for a yummy breakfast place and came across the reviews on Yelp. The pancakes are definitely the highlight of this place because they are the size of your plate and super fluffy with a ton of selections! My friend got the red velvet pancakes with "cream cheese", which was good but a little too sweet for her palette. I got the blueberry pancakes, which I opted for whole wheat batter and was still delicious. It came with a scrumptious sour cream blueberry sauce so it was the perfect balance of sweetness. Get the coffee there! You get your own individual French Press coffee and they have soy milk as well. Only con would be their shrimp scramble. My friend ordered it and was just a few shrimp and vegetables, nothing too special but not bad either, just not something I'd order over the pancakes. Quick and friendly service. Our food came out fast so not much to complain about. Additional tips: Order the short stack because you will have a hard time finishing one pancake (pretty dense), park on the street if you can get a meter, and go early because the place gets busy real quick.

oh, griddle... i wanted to love you. i really did. but there were so many things about you that just made it impossible.... 1) the line - i'm sorry, but there is no food in LA that is good enough to deserve a 1-2 hour wait in a single file line outside the restaurant in the direct sunlight for breakfast. i mean, the griddle breakfast is great, don't get me wrong, but i know i could get an omelet just as good at a number of other other brunch spots for Êunder a 30 minute wait. the whole appeal of eating at the griddle is just to tell people you ate at the griddle. to me, that does not make a 90 minute wait worth it. it's like buying a designer dress that doesn't fit properly just to say you own a designer dress, rather than buying an off the rack dress that fits properly and costs less money. 2) the environment - good luck eating without spilling on yourself due to people trying to walk by your table and constantly hitting your arm/chair as you try to take a sip/bite of you drink/food. there are literally people walking right.next.to.you the entire time you are trying to eat as they try to make it to the bathroom/door/their own table. horrible. 3) we had a party of 9 and were therefore forced to sit in a room in the back made for large parties - the table was barely big enough for 6 people, let alone 9, and we weren't able to fit all of our food on the table at once. people had to get rid of their coffees and teas - which we paid for - just to make room for the food. it was a nightmare. just imagine how many glasses of water spilled on the table while trying to fit all of our plates on the tiny surface. oh yeah, and the lights were so low we couldn't even see our food. ridiculous. 4) sub-par service - the waiter acted like he was the gateway to heaven and that WE should have to please HIM for the honor to eat at that precious table. gimme a break, buddy!! 5) the WORST breakfast potatoes i have ever had in my life. they were like hash potatoes (not quite hash browns, not quite mashed potatoes... somewhere inbetween) mushed and formed into a baking pan, baked, and squared of it scooped out. HORRIBLE. Ê the only reason why i gave them a 2 is because the coffee is french press which is nice, and the french toast was the best french toast i've ever had. otherwise, save yourself the trouble and eat somewhere else

READ THIS REVIEW BEFORE YOU ORDER THE RED VELVET PANCAKE. Decent. A solid 3 stars. The bacon is thickly sliced and flavorful - A +. Being a red velvet devotee, I had to try the red velvet pancakes. To my surprise it was only a stack of a SINGULAR pancake. If I'm going to pay $8.95, I better be getting at least 2 cakes. The pancake itself is fluffy and slightly chewy which was awesome. However the batter is not as deeply red as I would have liked and the pancake must have only contained a trace amount of cocoa powder as the classic red velvet flavor was missing. Also the pancake itself was only ever so slightly sweet. They make up for this of course through a decent sprinkling of cocoa powder and powdered sugar on top. All of this is finished with a spiral of cream Êcheese butter frosting type stuff. Overall I was not impressed. I bake and cook frequently. ÊThe sweetness and signature red velvet essence should be found primarily in the pancake batter itself - NOT the toppings. Additionally, pancakes are something that should be accented lightly with a sweet topping. The swirl of cream cheese stuff would have been sufficient to top the pancake with. Or rather a dollop in the center of the cake and at least some dry pancake surface with which to enjoy some delicious maple syrup. Some of you may disagree, but that is how a true red velvet pancake should be made and served. NOT, unfortunately, how the Griddle Cafe makes them. It's worth going maybe once, if you're already in the area. Don't go out of your way to eat here.

Wow, this place was amazing. ÊI went in search of a great place to take my family for brunch before we went on a tour of Hollywood. (yes, had to do the touristy thing, they were from Illinois!) Found Griddle Cafe on Yelp and was drooling at the pictures. Ê We went on Friday around noon and there was a line waiting to get in. ÊHoping it would be worth the wait we stuck around. We got in within 20 min and ordered some of their fancy coffees. They were all good, but my coconut mocha was the best! Then we all agreed on 4 plates to split. ÊCreme de la Creme French Toast, Apple Cobbler French Toast, Peanut Bubba French Toast, and the Baked Potato Omlette (with bacon added!) The omlette was def everyone's fav, so amazing. I am a huge baked potato fan and a huge omlette fan. Why had I never thought to combine the 2?! So Good! ÊI got fruit on the side Êso I dipped it in the Cheesecake topping of the Creme de la Creme, nom. The Peanut Bubba was served with a huge hunk of real whip cream....it was ridiculous. My mom loved the apple cobbler, the baked apples were perfection and the toast was extra crunchy. We stuffed ourselves silly, then still took half home for round 2. What kicks the rating up to 5 star, the guys who work there look as good as the food does. ÊNearly every waiter had a sweet smile and a friendly personality to match. How can u not love a man serving scrumptious breakfast delights? Can't wait to go back!

I came here on a Sunday morning to meet a friend and this place was packed. There was a line of people waiting, however the staff has a system down and gets people in quickly and served quickly. They were so efficient and friendly, I was highly impressed. The restaurant has the tables placed as tightly as possible and it does get quite loud. The portions are huge and I am very happy I only ordered one "Hear me roar" pancake. The pancake was fluffy, the strawberries were fresh, and the frosted flakes added an extra crunchy texture. One of the best pancakes ever! I also had ordered a side of bacon, which wasn't the best quality so I passed on eating that.

Griddles was just a fun place to people watch and enjoy some breakfast. Their pancakes were awesome. I saw one person who could not make up their mind on pancakes and they ordered both the Red Velvet Pancake and Peach Cobler. I had the blueberry and special omelet. Expect the cakes to be huge and the quantities more than enough. Just be careful that there can be a line, but it goes pretty quickly. I am pretty confident that Saturday and Sundays are slammed but its worth the wait. The service was great too. The selection is fun and of course we are in Hollywood so its named after actors and actresses. Gotta go kina of place.

The only bad thing about this place and like many other places would be the ruhtarded ass long line went here on a sunday morning had a party of 6 and waited around 30 minutes, with the smaller parties i had no idea if they're waiting longer or what cus when i looked over at that line it never got smaller or bigger, it just stayed the same size. service was pretty good considering the wait didn't feel that long, waiters were enthusiastic and could rave about their food all day long I ordered an omelet, i forgot the name but it was very distinctive because it had blue cheese, the omelet was alright i think the vast amounts of bleu cheese is what got me to not really like it I also tried my sisters PB&J french toast and my cousins' pancake that had frosted flakes in them. First of all the pancake was hella mofuckin huge and it had freakin cereal in it!! A+ for creativity and A+++ for getting what you paid for. The pancake was at least as big as my head could've been bigger and it was hella good!! ÊThe PB&J french toast didn't even seem like it was a breakfast item, it was hella rich that it could've been freakin dessert. Ê if you're planning on getting pancakes or the french toast (which i highly do recommend on getting) i suggest you share it with someone One thing i hate about this place is that its only open from like 7am-3pm...... i think it would be more perfect if it were 24 hours so i can get at that after a club or for dinner

This place is incredible, time and time again. I FREAKING love their pancakes. They are all so delicious. I've tried all of them by now. I say if you want something heavy and rich get Scotch on the Rocks or A Time to Love. If you like a less sugary pancake, go with Black Magic or Hear Me Roar. Their sandwiches are yummy as are their waiters. Seriously. All the waiters there are so dreamy! (Don't tell my husband I said that!) Anyway, I say go earlier in the day because they ALWAYS have a wait list and I've waited almost 2 hours one time. Call me a weirdo, but it is totally worth it.

The Griddle Cafe is great!! The red velvet pancakes are my favorite! Everything I have tasted in this place is delicious!! I Êjust hate that it is always loud and packed. The fact that it is always packed shows how great this place is.

SO GOOD. Come here if you wants awesome pancakes, awesome hash browns or amazing coffee! Long lines on weekends BUT the waiters are all super cool and friendly and get you served pretty quickly. Also pretty small and crowded inside the actual restaurant but totally worth it for some of those pancakes.

FORGET THE PANCAKES IT'S ALL A HOAX. IT'S A TRAP. Don't let those gargantuan portions of pancakes fool you. You'll just end up belly-achin' with at least half of those pancakes leftover to go. And trust me, you'll never want to see those leftover pancakes again. The pancakes are really just a smart marketing ploy to reel them customers in - but I guess it works since they have developed strong customer loyalty over the years.. that is, of course, only after they have experienced Mom's French Toast in all its fluffy glory. I personally hated French toast all my life, but Griddle's French toast is life-changing. So don't be fooled, skip the pancakes and just order the French toast. (I just saved you a couple bucks and a bellyache)

Came on a Tuesday I believe, hardly no one there. Me and two other people enter and we're just waiting for someone to greet and seat us. Server comes hands us menus and says "just sit at that booth." Okay, strike 1. Our server comes and puts down water, my bf asks if he could get some straws. Server catches attitude and says, "I'm gonna get them i'm putting down your drinks so my hands are full." Proceeds to rudely drop the straws and throws his hands up. Really? It's that serious? So, we decided to leave immediately. Terrible service equals terrible food.

After a good hike my friends and I decided we wanted some breakfast food. I heard about a place called griddle cafe. Once we got there, we were seated right away. We didn't have to wait long, so that was awesome. I had a hard time choosing what to get because the menu was filled with a lot of great food. My friend and I decided we would split items so she got their famous Red Velvet pancakes and I got the Peanut Butter French toast. It was so good. I'm not really a big fan of pancakes, but red velvet hits the spot and Peanut Butter on French toast was amazing. The French toast had a nice glaze to it. Next to us was a couple and they were curious of what we got. We ended up sharing food with them. I've never shared food with complete strangers, that was pretty awesome. This is a spot to hit up if you're ever in L.A/Hollywood area and craving breakfast.

Got up early today, so figured I'd drive to the spot since I always see lines out the door before it opens. Came here about 15 minutes before opening time of 8am on a Saturday and there was about ~20 people ahead of us. Luckily, we only waited less than 5 minutes after 8am came about. Grabbed a seat at a counter vs. a mini table (booths usually for parties of 4+). The place gave off the vibe of a diner you'd see in SF bay: cozy feeling. Since it was only two of us, counter is better so you won't have people always passing you and kicking you/your companion/purse that has no place to hang. I had a feeling this place would be overhyped if there's a line before it opens. Quantity over quality----absolutely! The description of the menu will make you go ooohhh and aaaaahhh over, but whenever you see breakfast descriptions that entail sugar coating on top of sugar topping mixed in with breakfast batter, that usually results in overcompensation of sugar. I ordered the Eyes Wide Open: espresso and chocolate chips pancakes. Again, with so much sugar on top of sugar already in the pancake batter, it resulted in a fairly sweetened pancake that didn't even need maple syrup on top unless you're aiming to have diabetes. In ~20 minutes, I ate half of my monstrosity, which was ok, but it wasn't all that impressive. Anytime you mix something in on top of regular ol' pancake batter, it usually results in gooey centers that isn't too good. The outer crust of the pancake was cooked perfectly. Meh... I guess if you're a fat ass, you'd enjoy this place for the novelty of ginormous pancakes that you can fill your social media platforms showing that you're a fat ass. But for taste wise, it misses the spot. I wouldn't personally wait for such "quality" of breakfast, but if you're aiming for QUANTITY, well, good luck and wait. Guess the long wait would make you famished, which would result in you needing to each such a huge portion of pancake/waffles.

Came here on Memorial Day and for a party of 6 we waited for about 30 minutes. Not bad considering all the hype this place gets. My friends and I lucked out and got the dark VIP-ish room/booth toward the back. The main dining area seemed very loud, so it was nice to have a bit of privacy. It was extremely dark in there but thankfully for our flashlight apps on our iPhones we were able to read the menu. I will say that it was super awkward when random people would move the door beads that gave our room privacy to peek inside. WTF? Mind your own business folks. There were probably at least three people who did it. Maybe they just didn't have any common sense. My friend and I split the muscle bound eggs and red velvet pancake. I really liked the food. I also got a caramel latte which was delicious! My other friends got the Black Magic pancakes, essentially Oreos, which was yummy! Kudos to the employees that work here. In the room next to us, this group had a bunch of toddlers running around. One kid came went into our room a few times while we were eating. To make things worse, the parents were walking out of their room and the employee was like 'Umm you forgot one." By one he meant a child. The woman almost forgot her child! Her response was, "Oh, I thought you were with ____." Really? They left the room a complete mess. There was sh*t everywhere. If you're going to bring small children to a restaurant, have some common courtesy to keep your children disciplined and at least make a decent effort to pick up after them. The employees are not your maids. So kudos to you Griddle Cafe employees for having to deal with crap like that.

We were looking for breakfast in LA and found this with over 2000 reviews!!! You gotta be kidding me!! Must try!!! Did not disappoint! We were quite lucky. got there just before the rush. A rush on Monday morning??? Yup!!! Long lines when we left. I feel so lucky..... My huevos rancheros were pretty good 4 stars. Not quite as large a proportion as I thought it'd be considering the size of the pancakes I saw coming out but large enough fill me up. The french toast was AWESOME!!! Up there with THE BEST I'VE EVER HAD!!!! 5 stars!!!! ÊI will be back when I visit LA. Wanna try the omelets and the pancakes..... Wish I was there right now..... Prices are fantastic also considering middle of LA with awesome fod. Just a curious observation.... all the workers (kitchen, waiters, everybody) are male.

Two years after placing Griddle Cafe on my mental bucket list, I had the joy of experiencing the hype for myself a few weekends ago. SO WORTH IT. Long story short: If you consider yourself a TRUE Angeleno, you must eat here at least once. All the stories you've heard/read/encountered...are all true. Yes, the pancakes here are more like dessert and are richly indulgent. Yes, their plates are bigger than the size of your head. Yes, everything tastes amazing. Go. Just do it. Short story long: No wait at 1 p.m. on a gorgeous Saturday?! Our lucky day! The three of us were seated at the counter and promptly handed drinks and menus. (If you want a table, you'll have to wait - but the counter is fine, and it's nice to be near where all the cooking/serving action is.) We ordered: 1. The red velvet pancake (of course) - 3.5 stars We had to try it. It was essentially a thicker, denser red velvet cupcake in the shape of a huge pancake, smothered with cream cheese frosting and powdered sugar. I'm not really a fan of red velvet to begin with, but this was pretty good. Be forewarned, it's very sweet - but it doesn't taste grossly artificial, and the cream cheese frosting is good quality. If you like red velvet, it's worth a try. 2. Yellow Brick Road pancakes (butterscotch, streusel, and walnuts) - 500000 stars MY GOD. You know when a dining establishment has that one amazing dish that you remember the flavor of and crave time and time again? (Or not...maybe I'm just a Fatty McFatty.) ANYWAY, THIS WOULD BE THAT DISH AT GRIDDLE CAFE. 3 huge, dense-but-still-fluffy pancakes chock-full of butterscotch chips, fresh crunchy walnuts, and light streusel. I love how the Griddle Cafe doesn't skimp on ingredients - if they say that something's in there, there's going to be a lot of it. Everything in these Yellow Brick Road pancakes went together deliciously. They heaped a mound of fresh whipped cream on top, which promptly began to melt from the heat of the pancakes. It's worth noting that Griddle Cafe isn't just about stuffing insane, dessert-like ingredients into pancakes. They do that. But they're also pretty gourmet. The stuff they use isn't some cheap grocery store crap that they cover up with an excess of sugar. Everything tastes fresh and high quality. AND AMAZING. 3. Caballero breakfast burrito - 4.5 stars Stuffed with scrambled eggs, pico de gallo, mounds of avocado and chorizo, rice, and cheese. I could have skipped this dish, but the guys wanted something savory to go with our pancakes. The burrito was excellent - not too salty or greasy, hot and fresh, and easily over a pound. It came with a side of perfectly hot, crunchy, and delicious tortilla chips. I really appreciate chips that aren't smothered in salt, grease, or - God forbid - a soggy combination of the two. No gross finger wiping necessary. These chips were clean, crisp, and legit. Service is amazing. Despite the 2398429387429 million that frequent this place daily, they manage to get your order out quickly, efficiently, and nicely. We never felt pressured to rush our meal or afraid to ask for anything. These guys know how to make you feel welcome and happy even before the food comes out. (They're not ogres, either - definitely spotted a Nick Lachey circa 1998 lookalike, and 98% of the employees look like less-buff Abercrombie & Fitch models.) This is probably my longest review ever, but then again, I've literally waited for years to try this place. I'd go again in a heartbeat - an artery-clogged heartbeat. I suggest eating nothing but lettuce for a week before AND after your visit, and eat your leftovers during Spinning...you will undoubtedly have leftovers. With tax and tip, the three of us each spent only around $11, since we split the orders among us. Not bad for LA, and definitely a great deal considering the quality and portions of the food. AND free parking with validation. I mean, does it get any better?!

I am a huge fan of Red Velvet flavored anything so of course when I found out about Griddle Cafe's famous Red Velvet pancakes, I knew I had to try them! I convinced my friend to make the hour drive with me to LA to wait another hour to be seated on a Sunday morning. It was PACKED inside. They somehow managed to squeeze a person every square inch. It was well worth the wait for the HUGE plate of red heaven drizzled in this cream cheese syrup. For me, it was perfect because I have a big sweet tooth but it was a bit too decadent for my friend. However, she did enjoy the spicy "Some Like it HOT Scramble". (Note: share your food! The portions are huge). PARKING: We didn't have a problem with parking. There was a nice parking lot in the back of the diner with plenty of spots available.

I remember seeing this place listed on a Top Ten list for LA food. ÊMy co-worker and I decided to give it a go on the last day of our business trip - a sunny Saturday Morning. ÊWe arrived and it looked like there would be quite a wait. ÊThe place was packed. ÊI'm not sure how we had so much luck on our side but we got in immediately, last table open in the joint! Ê Just looking around you could see how humungous the portions were. ÊThat didn't stop us. ÊShe wanted the "Red Velvet" panCAKE and I wanted the "Peanut Bubba" Crunchy French Toast. ÊWe didn't stop there. ÊWe decided to split a side of hashbrowns, and by "side" of hashbrowns, I mean a brick! We had to wait a little bit for the food, understandable, the place was packed both inside and out. ÊWhen the food arrived we had almost no room on the table to set it. ÊWhen I say the portions are gargantuous, that is an understatement. ÊEverything looks delicious, I know, but I highly recommend splitting a menu item with your breakfast/lunch companion. If you're in the area, I think it's worth giving this place a try, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again. ÊThat's nothing against the restaurant, I mean it has plenty of eye candy to look at with the wait staff and line cooks - the food was almost too rich and heavy for my taste.

One of my favorite breakfast spots in LA. The food is always excellent and the portions are ridiculous. ÊI typically order the Say Cheese Omelette with bacon. It is a large, fluffy, and tasty omelette served with potatoes that I like just as much as the omelette. ÊI can never get anywhere close to finishing the plate. Since someone at my table is bound to order pancakes and there is no chance in hell they are finishing them, I try to get a few bites of the pancakes before I get too full from the omelette. ÊGotta satisfy that pancake craving! ÊThe only downside is the place can get packed and you may have to wait a while in a line on the sidewalk, but the wait is worth it.

Without question, this is THE BEST place for breakfast in Hollywood. A friend suggested we try it, adding that we might see celebrities there. The only stars we saw were the items we had for breakfast: - The original french toast. Best french toast we've ever had. Thick bread that seemed basically marinated in their creamy vanilla batter. Lots of sugar and the syrup was delicious. - The Chicago Charlie. A MASSIVE plate of eggs, meat, onions and more. What I liked about this place was the number of unique menu items. This ain't Denny's.You can go here and try something you've never had before and will probably come away very impressed. If there's a flaw, it's that there will probably be a wait that will force you to wait in a line outside, potentially for 15-20 minutes. It's just part of the deal there and you have to stick with it if you want to eat here. It's very much worth it.

YIKES - This place is crazy!!!! The line is at least 30 mins and it seems as though the line is never-ending. There are tables inside and outside, and the place is small! We were led to a booth and we ordered the following: -Large coffee: Came in a large press. The coffee is good and didn't leave an aftertaste. -Red Velvet Pancakes ($9): I'm not a huge fan of red velvet, but this pancake was delish. Tasted like cupcakes. I had to request additional frosting since I didn't feel it had enough. -Muscle Bound Scramble ($12): On soft egg whites. I enjoyed this entree because I'm a health freak. We ordered it with turkey, which was too dry. -Chicago Charlie's Scramble ($12): The Italian sausage gave the scramble great flavor. Tasty. Portions are HUGE - so share away! The service is fast and friendly. Don't expect to sit for long and chit chat because they will kick you out. It's a good and bad thing I suppose...

Another overly hyped restaurant. Line is ridiculous on a Sunday morning. Restaurant is small, cramped, and loud-don't expect to be able to hold a conversation with anyone at your table because you won't be able to hear them! I had the Mom's french toast which was good, a tad too sweet. I could probably eat it alone without the maple syrup. Bacon strips were decent but nothing extraordinary. My friend's apple cobbler french toast was much too sweet....the french toast was sweetened (and sprinkled with powdered sugar) served with sweet apple pie filling. Pour some maple syrup on top and you will be bouncing off the wall with a sugar high. The size of the pancakes are gargantuan large plates of diabetes waiting to happen. If you like to eat dessert for breakfast, you may like this place. Otherwise, pass.

We got to The Griddle at 9:30AM on 4th of July and only waited for 10 minutes for a party of three. the entire place was fairly small and we were seated at the bar. We ordered french press coffee for 2 which was fantastic! Loved the coffee. We all shared an order of the Oreo Cookie pancakes (given I was with my two loves who are sweet tooth) and the protein scramble for my salty taste. Pancakes were very fluffy and the scramble was ok maybe because I went the healthy route. Our server was on top of our needs. Overall, the experience and the food is worth visiting again.

Give a man a fish, and he will eat for a day. Give a man a stack of Griddle Cafe pancakes... and he will have pancakes for breakfast for the rest of the week. I suppose I should have been tipped off as to the portion size when my boyfriend and I each requested the cinnamon oat pancakes, and the waiter paused for a moment before writing the order down. When the food came to the table and I found myself feeling terrible that no one else would ever be able to eat pancakes again seeing as how the world supply was sitting in front of me on my plate, I realized... Oh. I probably would have paused, too, if two people had felt the need to order more than one small land mass of carbs. ÊI'm not sure that any set of circumstances could make eating a stack of these things on your own in one sitting necessary or desirable, but they were nonetheless delicious. Wait, wait. Delicious? No, I'm sorry. What I meant to say was that they were absolutely fan-bleeping-tastic. If I was comfortable using expletives in a public forum that my friends, family, and employers have access to, this may well be an instance in which I would have done so. I don't even like pancakes. I mean, they always sound good in theory, but they never quite live up to their own hype. These, though? These were made of dreams and fairy tales. If life was a game, and hunger was a pokemon, you could throw these pancakes at it... and they would be super effective. Also, the service here was fast and entertaining. As soon as we laid eyes on our food and it became overwhelmingly obvious that we were going to be taking most of it home, we asked for some boxes... which our waiter handed us with a scoff. "Here are your give-up boxes." He said, then corrected himself. "I'm sorry, I mean your failure boxes." He also went on to claim that someone just earlier that day had eaten a whole order of these pancakes by himself. Dan replied with a whole hearted, "I don't even believe you." The tea here also deserves an honorable mention. It came in its own decent sized pot, with some cream on the side... no tea bag baskets or little tubs of non-dairy creamer. It was pretty great. The restaurant itself was loud and kind of cramped, but I really liked this place, and I'll definitely be going back. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a pancake dinner waiting for me downstairs.

Simply the BEST breakfast spot in the world! Ê I have been coming here for years and their amazing food is still consistent! Their fresh coffee is still consistent! ÊThe great service is still consistent! ÊEven the donkeys you will stand next to while waiting for a table are still consistent! ÊThe early bird gets the worm here! It pays to arrive before 9am or don't bother coming unless you enjoy long waits and donkeys. The Food: The "Mom's French Toast" is the best French Toast one will ever experience, so good it will spoil your taste buds and you will never eat French Toast anywhere else! Ê Words cannot describe how amazing this dish truly is. ÊYou will want to crawl under the table and eat it like a dog so that no one disturbs you! Ê Their "Uncle Buck" sized pancakes are out of this world and will satisfy any stomach! ÊEVERY Pancake dish on the menu is outstanding, even the "Bailey's & Kahlua"! ÊBut seriously, they are bigger in size than a toilet seat, just order 1 single pancake instead of the usual 3 and you still won't finish it. What amazes me the most about The Griddle is that they pride themselves on serving the best of everything, even down to their bacon. ÊTheir bacon is THICK and MEATY and perfectly cooked every time, the BEST bacon one will ever taste! Ê They DO have a secret dish here that is only available to those who whisper the secret word into their server's ear......however if I told you the secret word, it wouldn't be a secret anymore. ÊThose that figure out the secret word will be rewarded with an over the top sweet tasting French Toast dish that resembles more of a dessert. Their coffee is always fresh and brought to the table for the customers to press themselves. ÊThey have 3 different styles of coffee to choose from and they are ALL incredible! ÊIt is almost worth the long wait for their coffee alone (almost). The bottom line is The Griddle is without a doubt, the best breakfast restaurant in L.A.! ÊWhether you are an Angeleno or just a visiting tourist, this place will please every time. ÊThose that rise early will be handsomely rewarded, those that do not.....will be waiting for hours while being surrounded by donkeys and guys attempting to give the quick "Kiss Off" to their now regrettable dates they woke up next to. ÊEnjoy!

mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm I thought I had to start off my review with that :D Anyhooooow, I came here with my brother & cousins ...wait can be hell if you don't kind of tell them before hand or show up late expect to wait ! It's also sooooo crowded in there && extremely loud , they need a bigger place , but my review for 5 stars as always is for the food . The server was friendly so that was great being that it was kind of cramped & food was delicious so let's get on with it ! Banana nana pancakes (3.5): Server said this was one of the best sellers && very popular , honestly this was my least favorite thing , because I can easily make this at home :( && compared to all the other fantastic things it's not very interesting ! Should have tried the red velvet !!! Definitely will get that next time, but it's ok we all shared so it's not like I ordered it just for myself ! *Special* Oreo French Toast (5): Usually they only do this with pancakes but they were having a special, again we all took a part of it since we were sharing, omgggggg best french toast i've ever had, so unique & yummy tasting, the oreo was like inside && I think they tried to replicate the icing inside and used that on the french toast, it was sweet but such indulgence good thing I didn't order one myself ! Yes MOST things on the menu are sweet, that's why it would be wise to order a bunch && share from different parts of the menu , I think that's why we had a great experience ! Huevos Rancheros (4): Yummyyy this is one of fav breakfast items, && it didn't dissappoint, everything was on it, but I also think they had waaaaay too much cheese, but 2nd best huevos rancheros I've ever had in my life so that's good ! Also got tea which was yummy , came in that cool modern tea steeper they now have ! Great place for a different kind of breakfast you won't find around the corner, unless you live in the heart of LA (then I'm jealous) I will be sure to check out more of their crazy menu items next time since the special turned out so great...looking forward to red velvet && CARROT CAKE mmm !

The wait was ridiculous. ÊA lot of bad luck trying to get seated, so when we finally were seated at a table, expectations were up there! ÊUnfortunately, the Griddle Cafe was disappointing. ÊPerhaps I was let down because I didn't follow the advice from the Yelp crowd and should have ordered the Red Velvet Griddle Cakes. ÊInstead I ordered the BLUESberry Griddle Cakes. ÊThe sour cream mixed with mashed blueberries didn't taste like anything; they really had no place on my griddle cakes.

FINALLY decided to try this place since it's insanely popular and nothing is better than breakfast food on a weekend afternoon. i'd been avoiding this place because of horror stories about the wait time. but we came at around 230pm on sunday with two of us and chose to sit at the counter, which meant no waiting at all. score! also thank you random stranger who said that you can get just one pancake, even though on the menu it only shows short stacks (3 pancakes.) one is WAY MORE THAN ENOUGH for two people...theyre HUGE. the red velvet was amaaazing the poached y papas benedict was soooo good..a thick delicious slice of ham and poached eggs, hollandaise sauce, on top of perfectly crisp baked potato skins. i made it a conscious effort to get a little bit of ham, egg, and potato in one bite. soooo gude decent prices, especially for the quality of food. i suggest coming with one other person to minimize wait on weekends and getting one pancake along with one other dish to split!

Talk about a sugar overload (in the best way)! My girlfriend and I felt like indulging ourselves to kick off the week right, so we finally went to the Griddle. We've heard amazing things and got there early to beat the line. The variety of pancakes on the menu was insane, and I settled on the Scotch on the Rocks with coconut, pecan and butterscotch chips. Our waiter was super considerate. He could tell my eyes were bigger than my stomach and suggested I order just one of their 12" diameter pancakes instead of the three I would have ordered had he not warned me. I couldn't finish the one pancake I was so full, but my word, that pancake was so good. The crispyness of the coconut baked into the pancake along with the warmth and salt of the butterscotch, plus the coconut-infused whipped cream, made this one of the best pancakes I've ever had. Reaffirmed my love for coconut in the best way! My girlfriend's blueberry pancakes with blueberry sour cream were also some of the best I've had. All in all, for $7.95 for a huge, flavor-filled pancake that's kept me going all day is a fair deal to me. I'll be back (and wait out the line if I have to)!

Worlds best French toast, hands down. If that was the extent of it, this would have been a 5 star review. However, if you get an order to go, BEWARE! They will attempt to secretly send you off with their andromeda strain generic aunt jamima pathetic excuse for syrup, even though they have real maple at every single seat. Even in the bathroom. They literally have more than canada, and yet they refuse to offer it unless requested. ÊThe fake awfulness will completely ruin what would have been the most heavenly egg, sugar and bread experience of your life. It's like buying caviar and putting it on a saltine. Or beef jerky. It makes the breakfast you just spent $20 on taste like eggo waffles. Failure, without question.

So you know the end pieces of a loaf of bread that almost everyone never eats and ends up tossing them away in the trash? Well that's the piece I got for the cheesecake french toast. My bf ordered this dish but I was quite disappointed. I expect to have at least a decent slice of bread to be used for my french toast. Instead I was stuck with the end/nobody ever wants piece of bread that was both dry and lacking in flavor. The cheesecake that topped the french toast was indeed good, but ONLY for the first couple of bites. It gets to be so sweet I had to turn this dish away. Yes, it was HUGE, but honestly, quality over quantity guys. Good thing I went on a weekday and only had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated, otherwise I think I would be completely dissatisfied with this place. I had the golden ticket pancakes. It came out looking beautiful, topped with whip cream, caramel and who knows what else. The first bite was heavenly! However, like the french toast, the crazy amount of sugar that they pack into their items is insane! The whip cream also melted so quickly that it soaked the pancakes leaving them soggy and rather gross. This dish came with 3 pancakes, yes huge, even larger than the plate itself, but I did leave the place still hungry because I could not bring myself to eat anymore because the sweetness level on their items is simply too overwhelming.

I'd give this place 5 stars for the food (3 for the chili), but it's getting 1 star for the crappy service!!! ÊThe wannabe actor waiters take their dandy ole time. ÊThere have been several occasions where my empty cup of water hadn't been refilled the entire time I was there, even after I asked for a refill! Ê But even worse - on MULTIPLE OCCASIONS the waiters have added more tip than the 18% I had given them!! ÊI had to call my credit card company to reverse the charges. ÊSeriously, who does that?!

"Pancakes the size of my steering wheel. No--bigger." This was the first thing I ever heard about Griddle Cafe, and I was certainly not disappointed! This place is loud, bustling, and certainly great for an outing if you're not looking for the world's most immersing conversations. Thankfully, you won't need very much conversation, because you'll probably spend a large majority of your time trying to dig your way through their 3-pancake platters. My friend and I ordered the "A Time to Love," which involved a sinful amalgamation of pumpkin puree, butterscotch, pecans, caramel, and the obligatory whipped cream and powdered sugar. We finished a grand total of...wait for it...*one* pancake. We are hungry beasts, really--just not that beastly. I'm not sure I would go back for the food unless I'm looking for a serious way to drown my sorrows in a deeper sorrow of diabetic bliss, but it definitely is a place to experience at least once!

The food was pretty good, but oh so bad! I indulged in their huge french toast with strawberries and loved it but my stomach did not agree with me. It's pretty interesting seeing the crowd that surrounds you. I went on a Saturday morning and I was surrounded by tons of people wearing what it looked like to be their party clothes for the night before. I had to wait an hour for a table and another hour for my food. All the waiters were pretty good though, pretty good looking that is! The typical LA servers that all look better than you because their striving actors/models. This place is constantly talked about and visited by stars. Pictures of them at the restaurant are all over the restaurant. I would go again but not anytime soon.

Very cool place in terms of design and experience. Extremely loud and busy, it is only open till 4pm daily for breakfast and lunch. The line is usually very long on the weekends, so grab a coffee across the street at the coffee bean for an hour you are expected to be waiting for your table. 4 stars is due to the food quality being little more to be desired, but most people don't come here to eat healthy, so consider this review as a 5 star if you are one of them. Highly recommend: Irish coffee (Coffee + Baileys = OMG:))))

I love this place, I've heard about it repeatedly since moving here a year and a half ago but I just never tried the place until this past week. ÊWe found street parking directly in front of the door and there was no wait but I hear that that can be rare. ÊThe staff that seated us was really nice as well as the busser. ÊWe then had a very friendly server come by, he was helpful in answering our questions about the menu and always prompt. Ê I ordered the shrimp, spinach pesto sandwich with a side of fruit and it was AMAZING. My boyfriend had the chicken, avocado melt with fries which he thought was really good but I also found to be absolutely amazing. ÊThe bread is so good. His dad was with us and he had french toast which looked fantastic, he said it was great. ÊI chose not to steal a bite as an excuse to go back another time. The boyfriend's mom had a scramble with shrimp and spinach in it that she was was really good as well, it looked to healthy for me to care about trying :p The only thing that this place could do to make it much better in my eyes is to add some type of insulated pads or something to the walls to help absorb some of the sound, the music was playing at a decent level but the sound of people chattering reminded me of being at a cheap cafeteria. I will go back time and time again, this is a place that I'll show to coworkers and friends and family when they come from out of town to visit me. ÊI have heard that going on the weekend is a lost cause unless you really enjoy waiting so I'd recommend going during off-peak hours during the week. Enjoy!

Touristy spot. I enjoyed my time but I won't go back unless someone is in town that wants to go. Waited at least 45 to get a seat, but we expected that. Pancakes are huge, not very good though. The eggs Benedict was a heart attack on a plate, but not too bad! Their trademark seems to be making everything ridiculously huge.

Massive pancakes - check. Having lived down the road at the Mondrian for some time, this place became somewhere I went to all too often. ÊLaptop in tow, a table outside, and yummy food that could fill up any sports team in its entirety. The pancakes here should mention that one dish feeds 4 people. No lie. ÊThey have some pretty amazing pancake combinations, although I haven't tried them all, and my personal favorite dish is an egg white omelet with shrimp and avocados that's too die for. Ê There's almost ALWAYS a wait unless you're that early bird that arrives the moment they open, but it's always a good meal and totally worth the wait.

I can only make it here on weekends, and I will only go if we can make it there by 8am. After that it's a zoo and there's a chance you'll get line jumped by Stanford from Sex and the City. However, the pancakes are incredible. You can make your order more reasonable by ordering one or two (instead of the default three). The Golden Ticket is the very best. The real maple syrup makes the heavens part. The coffee is good, but seems like a racket. If one person orders coffee they bring a french press and charge $5. If a second person orders, they share that same french press and pay $5. Come on, baby, just charge per french press, not by who gets a cup. My only service complaint is this: They tend to rush you out. Because there's 4,000 people in line behind you, they're pretty quick about clearing the table and getting you on your way. So don't count on leisurely conversation over your $5 coffee.

Let me just start off with a warning: the portions are ENORMOUS. My roommate and I came here for breakfast and ordered the raspberry-lemon pancakes and the Omelette "My Soul" with steak. We were astonished and defeated by the portions. The pancakes came in a stack of three. Although they were just sweet and tarty enough, neither of us could finish even one pancake. And then there was the omelet... It was beautifully made, and there was so much steak inside, which made me feel like I got more than my money's worth. I loved that it came with fresh sliced avocado, too. Such a good complement to the egg! Also, we chose to get the omelet with fruit and toast (two sides), but we were already so full halfway through the omelet. It was difficult to tell who was an employee and who was a customer... The employees wear caps and t-shirts, nothing out of the ordinary from what any customer would wear. I suppose the only difference was maybe an apron on some of them... In any case, our server was friendly, but took a while to bring the check, the toast, and the water, even though initially there weren't that many guests (at 8:30 a.m.). Heed Yelpers' words and park in the Rite-Aid parking lot! It's actually partly the Griddle's, too. I definitely will come back. But I will be much more mindful of the portions...

Best brunch experience ever in my life. I trusted fellow yelpers and ordered the top 3 brunch dishes as recommended. (1) peanut bubba french toast - so crunchy and peanut butterish as promised! The whipped cream went really well with the toast! I really liked this dish - one of the best French toasts ever savoured in my life!! (2) eggs benedict y papa - an abstract version of the traditional eggs benedict. Baked potato + thick, big slab of bacon + generous layer of hollandaise sauce + two nicely poach eggs! The different pieces of the dish did not look that appealing ... But when placed all together into the mouth, it was so mad satisfying! (3) finally ... Moving onto its red velvet pancakes! The pancake was so fluffy! The red velvet choc taste could be more accented ... But I could not ask for a better ending to my brilliant brunch experience! Was seated immediately when my party of 4 walked in at 11am on a Friday (was lucky to have one booth empty). The diner was really crowded and loud - lotsa nice-looking people around. The portions were large and all below $10. Such an affordable experience for a new yorker who is so used to overpriced and hardly adequate brunches. If I live on LA, I will come here every week.

How can I forget to review about this place!?!?!? Went here last month with some of my favorite people to have Sunday brunch. Of course, the line was ridiculous but some things are just worth waiting on. Since that was my first time there, I wasn't quite sure if it was worth it. Boy was I wrong..... Service was absolutely great. Our waiter was very helpful, very friendly, and very accommodating. This review is actually going to be really short since it's OBVIOUS, this place has won the hearts of many people! I really enjoyed going with a group because I got to try a lot of dishes, all in one sitting! So what is worth getting 1. Red Velvet Pancake 2. Eggs Benedict 3. Tequila Sunset Ê 4. French Toast with Strawberries 5. Gone Shrimping 6. Orange Juice Food Coma at its best!

This place is just ridiculous. ÊBut I don't mean it in a terrible way. After a long wait, we were finally seated at the counter! ÊOh boy! ÊI've been excited to come here.

CHICAGO CHARLIE'S Scramble - Italian sausage, potatoes, bacon, bell peppers, mozzarella cheese, garlic basil, onions and served with garlic bread! This was good...I"m glad we got one sweet and one savory. Ê I don't know if I"ll ever come back here. ÊThis place was yummy, but ridiculous. ÊIts a bit overwhelming even for me, but I'm glad I tried it. ÊIf I ever do go back here, I'd get the single serve red velet pancake.

I have been coming here for years. There's a story of how I found this place. I know when I burst into story mode I get 50/50 reaction half loathe it while others can't get enough of your-not-so-standard-yelp-review. Anywho, the first time I found this spot was with this girl who I was head over heels for but we weren't "official." I wanted to grab breakfast and her suggestion was somewhere in the Valley BUT my quickly reacted with a stern "No, it's the mf-ing Valley!" So I scoured through all these yelp reviews and forum talks, all and this was before Yelp had the features you take granted today. That is how I came to find this place. Well that girl is no longer in the picture but I still frequent this place a couple times a year but I spread out my visits throughout the year because I don't want to burst at the seams. A couple times a week is overkill, a couple times in a month is plenty and a couple times in a year is still unhealthy but you could say you had enough will power to go on about their life and not just laze around in a catatonic food haze. You can say I like the food than I did that girl. Too harsh? IDGAF(http://urbandictionary.cÉ if you're out of touch) Would I be back? You bet your red velvet pancake ass I'll be back!

I heard this place had amazing pancakes for years now but never been to try it. My friends and I went here after a brief hike nearby. I ordered the velvet pancake. I expected three layers but I guess the velvet pancake only gets one. But thats ok, it was TOO sweet for me. It felt like I was eating a giant cupcake with a ton of frosting. The first couple bites were good though. Next time I'll get something less sweet. O yeah, try to come early. it gets packed.

We stayed at the Andaz West Hollywood, and woke up early on a Saturday morning craving a big breakfast. My trusty Yelp app led me to the Griddle Cafe, and I started salivating as soon as I looked at the menu: red velvet pancakes? I must have died and gone to heaven. The BF and I realized that eating nothing but sweets for breakfast was probably not the best idea, so we decided to split a pancake and an omelet. We both enjoyed the pancake but after a few bites we realized that it isn't exactly a breakfast food -- more of a breakfast for dinner meal -- but I'm still glad we ordered it. But we were both disappointed by the omelet -- I've had iHOP omelette's that I thought more of and when the couple next to us got their eggs benedict I had pangs of jealousy, at least until they sent it back to the kitchen because it was cold. The atmosphere made the trip worth it but if you come, go for the pancakes, and maybe think about waiting for brunch or dinner.

We love you and we wish we can have you here in New York. French Toasts will never taste the same on this coast. Beware, pancakes are humongous! but delicious. The french pressed coffee, to die for!

I am a serious pancake aficionado -- second only to tacos, it's easily one of my most consumed food groups. Now, call me plebeian, but up until my visit here, I thought the best readily-available pancakes in LA were found at the local IHOP. How wrong I was... A friend introduced me for a Sunday morning breakfast. It happened to be Easter, so the place was PACKED, with a line piled down the block. Still, I get the impression that this is the norm on weekends, so expect a wait. Being a party of two, they were able to seat us almost immediately, but big groups might take a while. The place is absolutely dizzying inside -- loud, crammed, with close quarters to your fellow patrons and all the harried waiters running past. Personally, I didn't mind it, I like a high-energy atmosphere in the mornings, but it's a little counter-productive to conversation -- not that you'll be doing much chit-chat anyway once the food arrives. The reason this place is 5 stars is for the sheer variety and inventiveness of its pancake menu -- the only place that comes anywhere close is Shopsins, and NY is a little far to go for brunch. Each order comes in a stack of three with no sides (which turned out to be fine, considering these 'cakes are the size of Frisbees), and are topped with homemade whip cream. I had some walnut/caramel/banana concoction that was absolutely delicious, melt-in-your-mouth. The pancakes are thick and stuffed -- filling and oh-so-satisfying. The coffee comes in a press, and holds about two and a half cups. Given the hectic nature of the restaurant, the service is more than adequate, but it's definitely the kind of place where you need to make smart use of your server's attention. If they're at your table now, ask for EVERYTHING you'll need for the rest of the meal, cause you might not see them again. I usually like to drown in coffee, especially when tearing through such a heavy pancake breakfast, so this was probably the only major drawback for me. Still, it's a must for breakfast lovers -- great taste and great value for those special breakfasts where IHOP just won't do.

AHHH I am in love with this place! I had brunch here with some of my friends and one downside is the larger the party the more time you have to wait, but it was worth it! I ordered the Red velvet pancake and it was massive! It was fluffy and moist! Although the frosting was a bit to sweet in my opinion. I also had a few bites of my friends creme de la creme french toast and I sort of regret not ordering those! It tasted like heaven! And surprisingly the cream cheese frosting wasn't overly sweet as I thought it would be. It was packed inside but the service was great and I think some of the waiters are like part time models because they were hot! Since i am a cheese lover I am on a quest to try things made with cheese, so next time I go back I will definitely be ordering creme de la creme french toast!

I hardly ever go out to eat breakfast, but this place is delicious. My 1+ and I ordered Red Velvet Pancake, Baked Potato Omelette, and Poached Y Papas Benedict. My baked potato omelette was okay. Definitely loaded with baked potatoes & it came with different sides. I choose to have the sourdough & fruits. I love fruits for breakfast. It really opens up your appetite and not make you feel as full. The dish was really starchy, which I hated. My fault. The omelette was even better with the hot sauce they had on the table. I tried my boyfriend's Poached Y Papas Benedict, and I was sitting there, across the table, jealous the entire time that his dish was 10x better than mines. It came with really really yummy ham drenched in Benedict sauce with eggs. We were both extremely full. He was barely able to finish his dish and I had to take some of mines home. We definitely didn't really get to the red velvet pancake. However, we did have a little taste. Yummy. Overall, this is a really great place for breakfast. Griddles gets an A+++ but not 5 stars. They need a bigger place. The servers were nice & friendly though :) ** By the way, we came in around 10:30am. It was packed & we had to wait about 15-20 minutes. Not bad, but come any later & the lines will be too long. The entire place was already packed out. Next time, I think I will wake up earlier. Parking isn't too easy to find either. Good Luck.

Forty minute wait to get seated and another thirty to get my food? Honestly, I don't know how good the food really was because by the time I actually got to eat it, I was so hungry, anything would have tasted good. Don't get me wrong- I'm not complaining. The place is crammed with people, so I get that it's busy. From where I sat, I had a clear view of the kitchen, and I could tell the cooks were working their asses off to dish out the food as quickly as they could. Mad props to them. The food was definitely well proportioned. All the plates I saw were heaped with food! I think it would be best if you come here with a few friends, and share the food so that you could try a bit of each dish. My friends and I shared one red velvet pancake, Gone Shrimping eggs, and the Poached y Papas Bendict, with the bill totaling to be about $40. The pancake was good, but the icing was a little too sweet. Gone Shrimping was okay, but something in it tasted funny to me. I loved the Papas Benedict...yummy potato skins! I don't think breakfast should make a $40-sized hole in your pocket, but Griddle Cafe deserves a try!

Griddle Cafe is one of those places that's small but always packed. They have about 5-6 booths of various sizes, 4-5 tables inside, 3-4 outside, and a large diner style counter. The wait time varies depending on the time you go, but noon worked well for me both time I was there. The food: Visit 1: Curious as to what the red velvet pancake tastes like? Super sweet...but delicious! Three of us shared one, and we weren't able to finish it. I had a Tequila Sunrise, and it was very bland. Seriously bland. I can't remember what else was ordered.... Visit 2: A friend and I split a Baked Potato Omelette and a seasonal pumpkin pancake. The omelette was fantastic-- gooey cheese and bites of potatoes wrapped in fluffy egg and sour cream. The pancake was very buttery, but yummy; we barely made it through a third of it. I gave Griddle Cafe 5 stars based on the fact that it was an experience just to eat there. I felt like I was in a different world the moment the door closed and separated me from Sunset Blvd. Maybe I've been to too many Asian establishments in my life, but American ones are always interesting and fun to me. Though the food wasn't the best thing I've tasted, it was different and I can appreciate that.

We came to the Griddle on our last day in LA, and joined the massive line of people anxiously awaiting some early morning carbs. ÊWe felt slightly guilty going in for a large breakfast while the LA marathon was going on and hungry runners were passing us as we were devouring treats from the griddle. ÊThey are very organized here, they have quite a comical host, and he did a great job of seating everyone. ÊI ordered a stack of their original pancakes, and they added pecans for me at no charge which i applaud. ÊHonestly the pancakes are great but the portion sizes are too big, i really wish the waitstaff would warn people, because there was a lot of unnecessary waste. ÊI probably ate about a third of mine, and i felt bad that i was throwing away so much food. ÊThe batter was great, the pancakes were fluffy, and toasty because of the pecans. ÊMy sis ordered the Griddle waffle, they had a great crunch, and the addition of the cinnamon was unexpected but really nice. Overall, The Griddle has a great vibe, the prices of the food are really reasonable, and the next time i visit LA i will definitely come back.

At 11AM on a Saturday, we showed up prepared to wait at least an hour. ÊWe got seated at the bar in less than 10 minutes. ÊLesson learned: ÊAlways be prepared for the worst!! I got the "Gone Shrimping" dish, amazingly delicious. ÊA friend got an order of single layer red velvet pancake and an order of steak omelet - I forgot what it was called but it was recommended by the waiter. The service was tremendous.

Thinking this place was a major hype, I didnt have much high hopes for this place but WOW did they prove me wrong! They are known for their amazing breakfast, and great lunches, & let me be the first to say that I am sorry Griddle Cafe for doubting you! Our Breakfast/Lunch:::: * 3 words: Red Velvet Pancakes! Their most famous dish at this place, and they even have a mix where you can buy and take home to make. Let me say that this pretty little red pancake was amazing....super sweet but didnt mind it at all. Remember to ask for the icing on the side because i perfered it with maple syrup. * Peanut Bubba Crunchy French Toast: Do you guys remember your mom's homemade french toast? Well this french toast will make you forget all about mom's...sorry mom! I was in heaven with all the peanut butter crunch and whip cream on top! YUM! * Scotch on the Rocks: Who loves coconuts?? These pancakes are loaded with coconut, pecans, butterscotch chips, and topped with whip cream! Drool..... * The Broken Heart: First off, let me say that I never seen a burger with artichoke hearts. Burgers come with a choice of patty (chicken breast, turkey burger, garden patty, or Beef patty) & sides (fries or fruits). I loved this burger!! Not only did the artichoke hearts give it a new taste and texture, the scallions, parm cheese, and spicy aioli is a great combination with the beef patty. Drinks:::: * Coffee: Yes it is fresh but wasnt that great. But we arent coming here for their "amazing coffee" *Orange juice: Freshly squeezed appearently but I really dont notice the difference between this and the store bought stuff. Maybe I am not much of a Orange juice fan :) My friend and I loved everything we ordered. This is his favorite place to come and have breakfast and now I can see why! Would love to have this place be a chain and replace IHop forever! Sorry Ihop, Dennys, and Mcdonalds breakfast....this is my new go to place for breakfast!

Come for LUNCH, DURING THE WEEK!!!! The food is amazing, but when my stomach is growling a 2 hour wait is NOT HAPPENING! ÊThis is why I decided to finally try The Griddle for the first time on a Wednesday afternoon at 1:30! ÊNo wait, great service and I finally got to try those pancakes everyone is always raving about! Yes, they're huge and Yes, they're delicious! 3 people could probably split the pancakes and be stuffed, but of course I ordered them all for myself! My Mom ordered the french toast. ÊIt was delicious, but very thick and rich, so prepare yourself! My Dad got a spicy scramble, very large portion and very good! I got the blueberry pancakes. I have 3 words, pint of blueberries! ÊI swear there were at least of pint of real, delicious blueberries in this giant stack or pancakes and they top it off with a blueberry sour cream, so good!

So this place is extremely popular. Its always pretty packed & Hollywoodish. If one day you wake up & think I want to be gluttonous... this is the place for you. I'm just not into the whole lets eat ridiculous amounts of food that is all too sweet for any human being. Ordered Mom's French Toast & Fiesta Scramble. TONS of food. I could see how this could be a great place if you were extremely hungover. I do love the fast, attentive service & I've only eaten outside during a nice day or at the counter. It's pretty pricey...considering we ate there for breakfast.

We found out about this place from a friend who brought in a picture with a giant, delicious-looking pancake and said it was cooked with Kahlua and Bailey's and topped with whipped cream. We went on a Saturday at about 2:00 and only had to wait about 10 minutes, although I'm sure you should prepare for more if you go at a normal breakfast time. And based on some reviews, we decided to get one sweet and one savory dish and share. It was perfect! We got a plate of scrambled eggs, sausage and potatoes and then the French toast stuffed with Nutella and topped with whipped cream. It was all very delicious! We missed the signs indicating that you can't park, ever, at any time, in West Hollywood's side streets and got a $58 ticket. So watch out for that!

To say this place is overrated is an understatement. ÊIf people were honest they would admit its the humongous portions of food thats the draw. ÊOne dish can easily be split between two people. ÊThe different flavors of pancakes is clever but it doesn't hide the fact that the pancake itself is tasteless and dry. ÊIf you want REALLY good pancakes you have to go to DuPars with their melted butter. Ê Simply no comparison. Ê The inside is crowded and noisy, and the few tables on the sidewalk force you to sit where you're stared at by the passing homeless and the twenty or thirty people waiting to get seated during prime time. Ê The coffee is served in a french press which only gives you a couple of cups and there's no way to keep it hot. ÊSo by the time you pour another the coffee is lukewarm. ÊI was never asked by the waiter if I wanted more coffee so I can only assume that there is a charge for a refill. ÊWhen I'm eating breakfast I want HOT coffee and the refills to keep coming!!! All that being said the food is good and adequate. ÊI mean how can you mess up eggs and ham? I have not had anything else as far as sandwiches or salads so I cannot speak to that. ÊI can only tell you that if its breakfast you're after there are many other places to go to that are equally as good with a lot better ambience. ÊOf course there's a mind set of 20 something hipsters that flock to this kind of experience Ê- but if that's not you, you really won't enjoy it. ÊJust sayin.

Forget the red velvet pancake here. It wasn't all that as it's hyped up to be. I like Cinnamon's in Kailua, HI red velvet pancakes better - try it if you are on the island! What I really liked here was the Peanut Bubba French Toast. Never had anything like it, so good! Peanut buttery crunch on the outside, soft as pillow bread inside = perfect combination. Definitely order this instead of the red velvet pancake. Oh yeah, their bacon is really good too! Enjoy!

Yum. 2pm on wednesday and we waltzed right in. The Griddle waffle looked a lot bigger than it was, I easily ate the whole thing, and I'm one of those tiny asians that can never eat more than a few bites of her food. My friend and I had mimosas as well, nothing too special, but alcohol is alcohol. They had a long list of Soju cocktails that I'd love to try sometimes though. I also saw a "noisella" french toast on the menu which I assume is nuttella. They have quite a funny menu and I want to come back to try everything. My side of bacon had pieces that were so thick, I was afraid it was Canadian bacon, which I'm not a fan of. but it was surprisingly crunchy and satisfying. One fell on the floor and the waitress announced that there had been a suicide piece, and came back with a new piece. That waffle. I dream of it.

It is way too packed & loud. They r always busy even on Monday morning.... at least you don't have to wait much. The male staffs are pretty friendly, but it is definitely NOT a place for a peaceful breakfast/ brunch/ lunch place. My friend & I had to get out of the restaurant to communicate. Though, the portion is HUGE and the pancakes are better options here. Me & my girlfriend's score? 2.5 We will go to other fancier, newer, cleaner, brighter, trendier brunch place next time.

LOL wtf!! I'm still in shock over the size of these pancakes.. My brother and I came here this past Sunday around 3. Since it was kinda late in the day, we only had to wait 5 minutes or so for a couple of seats at the bar. (Btw, I recommend you sit here, the service is great and they really take care of you, I'll explain that later.) Our waiter/bartender was a cool dude who was nice enough to give us plenty of time to look through the menu after ordering a couple of mimosas. It was hard to choose what kind of pancakes or food to get; everything looked so good, and everything everyone ordered around us looked so good too. Finally, we settled on Mounds of Pleasure pancakes and the Hoagie Omelette. As we waited for our food, we sipped on our mimosas, which were bangarang by the way, they didn't skimp on champagne. ÊThe place was loud and had a cool, home-like feeling to it, it reminded me of a brunch place in my hometown of CT. The decor was like...50's style I think? And they were playing Blues music in the background? I don't know, I wish I could remember better, but I was transfixed on my view of the kitchen from where I was sitting. They were using an enormous spatula to flip these gigantor pancakes, it was crazy awesome. Finally our food came our, and we were like whoooaa. The Mounds of Pleasure pancakes had tons of shredded coconut all over it with thick whipped cream on top. Chocolate haters beware - these pancakes were oozing with melted pools of chocolate, and I don't mean measly chocolate chips, I mean REAL globs of warm fudge all over. They were absolutely divine. The Hoagie Omelette was amazing as well. The cheese and sausage inside tasted delicious, and it all came together with the fajita onions and peppers. They even made their own version of Texas Toast, and I couldn't stop eating it, regardless of all the carbs from pancakes. The griddle potatoes were a nice touch as well. Our waiter was the best. No more than a second passed when I set down an empty bottle of ketchup was it replaced by a new full one. We had just finished our mimosas, and he gave us another round, on the house. Maybe he was in good spirits, but I'm sure it helped that we were sitting directly at the bar, and he was generous enough to give everyone another round who was sitting at the bar too. I also loved the fact that they had a full array of hot sauces available on racks every few seats. I can't tell you how tired I am going to place and getting the old standard Tabasco. But not here; they even had my favorite habanero sauce which was a more than a pleasant surprise. When I'm back in LA for a visit, I'm so hitting this place up again. So many pancakes, so little time...

Easily the best breakfast I've had! I had the normal two egg breakfast with turkey sausage and one banana pancake and my girlfriend had one red velvet.

Long line out the door that literally wraps around the building, but was it worth it? YES. Sometimes one must sacrifice for the greater good((er) breakfast). The wait went by pretty quickly and they definitely have a system that works. It was a busy Sunday morning--prime time I'd say--but they got me and my boyfriend seated pretty quickly. So, do not be discouraged fellow Griddle conquerors! We ordered the Red Velvet Pancake (this dish is only ONE pancake--hard for sharing, but love is selfless, right?). And Warning: ordering this may cause your boyfriend to have pancake envy as he sees the 3-stackers go by. It seemed like most pancake dishes came in 3's. Not to worry, I've already been informed that we will tackle a 3-stacker when we go back. Our other dish was egg-y and forgettable, sadly. :( I'd say the pancakes steal all the attention at this place, and rightly so! It's ok, eggs, while you provide us with more nutritional value, you are just no match for those pancakes.

This place is AHHHHMAZHING! Deliciously yummy huge-ass pankcakes bigger than my hand, face, or torso... maybe not torso. But still huge. If you want an intense breakfast experience and you're willing to wait for it (because there's always a crowd), Griddle Cafe is totally the place to be! And of course, especially in a place where they give you large portions, keep in mind that sharing is caring. =) And it means you get to try more things from the menu.

Please do your self a favor and go try the RED VELVET PANCAKE! I didn't know such a thing existed until I went for breakfast this morning at 9:am. Fair warning the place is very busy and there is usually a 5 min wait & up depending on how big your party is. I love food and trying new places, so trying the griddle cafe and really enjoying something as unique as a Red Velvet Pancake was a real treat! It is very sweet so splitting it with someone and getting scrambled eggs or home fries to share is probably the smarter way to go. Service was friendly & quick & my water was never left more than half empty. Come here with an appetite and your sweet tooth :)

First time at the Griddle Cafe and I'd say it was worth the wait :) For a party of 7, we waited 40 minutes and the entire party needs to be present in order to be seated. I ordered the strawberries and creme waffle (which all our food came out pretty fast) and it was okay. I tried my friend's peanut bubba crunchy French toast and that was really good. Definitely order something from all the highlights on Yelp lol We also ordered a pitcher of mimosas and that was refreshing. The service was excellent even if the servers are busting their asses for this crowded restaurant. They are so sweet (and hot lol) that they saw we were there for a birthday brunch and brought out a chocolate chip confetti pancake for the birthday girl :) it so thoughtful even though we were all really full from their ginormous portions. I'd recommend this place for any breakfast fans who loves big sizes of pancakes, waffles and eggs :)

Kudos to the Standard Hollywood staff who directed us to this delicatable little vixen just blocked away... Now in all honesty, I was pretty skeptical given the "Hype" on the Standard and my large disappointment there, but this place punched me in the stomach with a fistful of bliss... Now I'm not a religious person, but you better give me at least 2 Hallelujah's on their Chicago Omelette and French Toast.... The fact that we went on a weekday and got sat immediatley along with reasonable pricing was sugar on top..... the only downsides I see with this place is (1) the wait (2) it can't be healthy and is like a cross between pepsi, slurpees and crack in terms of addictivness and (3) they don't have one in Toronto Would definitely go out of my way on my next LA trip to hit this joint again!

The concept of giant pancakes with random goodies stuffed into them just wins them points right away. The red velvet pancake is overrated. It's like eating sugar by the spoonful when you were a kid - seems good at the time, but you get tired of the taste fast and it's stupid in retrospect. The red velvet pancake is the same, you think it'd be great to eat something that tastes like a cake for breakfast but halfway through you realize that's just way too much sugar. Also, you only get one red velvet pancake while the other pancake orders come in stacks of three. The best dish I tried was my sister's "Creme de la Creme" cheesecake french toast. It tasted like cheesecake and french toast. Which is a spectacular combination. Don't order bacon, it's mediocre and it's like $6 for four slices. Minus one star for being ripped off on bacon.

This little joint holds a place right next to my left artery. Mmm, oh pancake indulgence. I don't even like sweets much but the pancakes here are my indulgent treat I crave every so often. This place isn't too close to my living arrangements so it's definitely a once a year-ish thing. It gives me time to settle my stomach from all the food too. I've had their breakfast tacos before and they're awesome. And no doubt their speciality pancakes are goodness. My friend today ordered the chicken sandwich which looked amazing even when I'm a vegetarian. They have parking in the back of Rite Aid. I found a space at 1pm on a Sunday. The wait was about 1.5 hrs though. I still think it's worth it. Smaller groups of two get seated way faster.

Great food!! Based on Yelp reviews we headed to griddle cafe at around 9 am on a Friday. Walked in to a full restaurant. We were a party of 5, so they sat us in the VIP room in the back of the restaurant. It was super cool to be sitting in an area frequented by celebs. The comfy seats and flat screen tv weren't bad either. Now to the food, which was great. My husband got the tequila sunrise and practically licked his plate. My kids got a chocolate chip and original pancake and were not disappointed. I ordered the classic French toast which was delicious. Overall our experience at Griddle Cafe lived up to the Yelp reviews and then some!!!

I've been wanting to try this place for a while now and finally got the chance to go this past week. Ê As far as parking goes I got really lucky and found a spot directly in front of the place literally 5 steps from the front door. ÊMind you this was a Wednesday at noon, but still great luck, right? Anyway the place is a typical diner style with a sort of old-school feel to it. ÊI ordered the Apple Cobbler French toast, bacon, and egg whites. ÊThe french toast was great, the bacon was thick and the egg whites were egg whites. I wasn't completely blown away or anything but the food was good I would probably come back when I am in the area to try their pancakes. ÊAll I know about their pancakes is that that guy sitting next to us at the place had the biggest, buttery-est delicious looking stack of pancakes I've seen this side of Dupar's at the Grove Farmers Market. ÊAs far as I'm concerned Dupar's is the gold standard of pancakes so I will have to come back and give The Griddle's cakes a try.

Went here today at 8:00am and there was no wait! It was actually somewhat slow, but the service was abrupt and lacking, but that's fine. It's a breakfast joint so I'm not expecting the best service - No stars marked off for that. Onto the food: Baked Potato Omelette - SO GOOOOD! Add the cheese. You will not regret it. Red Velvet PanCake - You know how they say you can't have too much of a good thing? The red velvet pancake doesn't apply to this. At first, it was soo good but two bites in and I was sick of it. Mom's French Toast - My boyfriend got this and could not stop raving about how delicious it was. He says it was MOUTH WATERING. Overall, my boyfriend and I had a good experience :) If we were ever in the area again, I would definitely come back for the Baked Potato Omelette, Mom's French Toast and I'd like to give the Strawberry and Cream waffle a try.

I had the french toast with fresh strawberries and brown-sugar sourcream topping. I was good, rich, and gluttonous. Would I go back? If I was hungover, definitely.

ÊI also mooches off some ginormous golden ticket pancakes. ÊThe first few bites were awesome but soon, it was too much. ÊThere were like million walnuts which are supposed to be good for your brain but too much for me. ÊWe ended up finish just a quarter and took the rest home. ÊWe also got the Irish latte and the mocha latte. ÊMocha latte is sweeter and masks the alcohol flavor pretty much completely while Irish latte was a great blend.

Griddle = heaven. There's really not much more you can say about it. We ALWAYS get the "A Time to Love" Ê- it's just too good to try anything else (I have had the oreo and red velvet prior to finding this one, both of which are amazing, but I do not think they compete with A Time to Love!) We went the other day (yet again) and I also ordered the Caballero.. which is a HUGE egg burrito dish.. I definitely recommend this if you're not in the mood for something sweet. Totally savory, and perfect to share if you also want the best of both worlds! Another friend got the "Apple Cobbler French Toast" which I thought rocked! THe apples are just like an apple pie filling and on the side, so it doesn't make the french toast soggy. I have not gone to dinner here, and don't think I ever will... because, seriously, how can you go and not get a pancake?

Great breakfast location with unique pancake choices, but be prepared to wait! // LOCATION // The Corner of Sunset and Fairfax. Ê Ê +Parking: Park in the Rite Aid parking lot. Entrance is off Fairfax. There is no attendant either. You can enter though the back of the restaurant directly from the parking lot. // WAIT // Went on a Monday which was also the MLK Holiday. Waited approximately 15-20 minutes in line at 2 pm for a party of 2. Your name is written down on a pad and you are instructed to line up in one of two lines (1 line is for parties of two and the other line is for larger parties) // SERVICE // Friendly, fast, and polite. We noticed everyone working here was male, strangely enough. // FOOD // Ê Ê +Red Velvet Pancake: Soft, moist, sweet, and delish. This pancake was like eating a large thin slice of red velvet cake! It was dusted with cocoa powder and drizzled with a generous helping of cream cheese frosting. The frosting that adorned the top became cloyingly sweet towards the end. Ê Ê +Blueberry Pancake: Amazing. There were so many blueberries strewn throughout the batter that you got some with every bite. The blueberry cream dolloped on top of the pancake was also a winner. Ê Ê +Hunger Pangs: 3 eggs, griddle potatoes, and ham: The eggs were perfectly cooked and you were given your choice of toast. The ham was salty and on the fattier side but helped to complement the sweetness of our pancakes. The griddle potatoes were dense and not your ordinary hash brown variety, but still tasty. *tip: Each pancake is huge. One pancake is big enough for two people to share. Therefore, DO NOT order a stack of three and instead order individual pancakes. That way you can try a wider variety of pancakes and not explode after.

Food: - Gone Shrimping (http://www.yelp.com/biz_É) - $12.90 Shrimp with egg whites, avocado and tomatoes. Sounds like something i make at home. Nooo.... it was surprisingly very bland. Tasted like they forgot to add salt and seasoning.. - Cobb Omelette (http://s3-media1.ak.yelpÉ) - $11.95 the way the made this omelette looks super fluffy. I was deceived again! It's almost like they put all the salt from the Gone Shrimping dish and put it in here instead. SUPER SALTY!! - Eyes Wide Open Pancake (http://www.yelp.com/biz_É) - $9.95 BIG pancakes! Espresso flavor with semi sweet chocolate. Didnt taste any espresso at all. Overall, poor quality pancake. Price: Price reasonably for breakfast food. Overall: Never coming back again...

ÊThe prices are reasonable, about $12-$15/dish, drinks extra. Portions are super duper huge. I've had A LOT of this menu and it's a big menu. ÊMy wife always gets the Benedict, served on potato skins instead of english muffin, and I ALWAYS wish I had gotten what she got. ÊThe banana pancakes are A+, the French Press coffee is the best in the city, and the stuffed French Toast are to die for. ÊI highly recommend going here with a group and everyone being willing to share. ÊThe person who gets the Benedict will need to do a blood oath, however, as she will undoubtedly lie about sharing and keep it all to her lying-self.

The Griddle Cafe is the sort of place that needs no introduction, you either know about it as part of living in Los Angeles, or you don't. It's not that the place is pretentiously hidden, or somehow cordoned off from regular society like the extravagantly surreptitious bungalows at Chateau Marmont, in fact it is smack dab on the infamous Sunset Strip. No, the Griddle cafe is quite simply the place that you hear about from friends that stumbled in one morning after and found themselves in the middle of a stack of pancakes covered in caramel, butterscotch, and whipped cream. Not knowing what to do with themselves after the gluttonous experience they tell you that you must see it for yourself, because the five lbs of pancakes in a crisp white box aren't proof enough of their daring adventures. You come to Griddle for breakfasts that cartoon characters eat. One would expect to see the Mad Hatter eating the Red Velvet PanCAKE, with delicately swirled cream cheese frosting and a Grandma's fistful of powdered sugar, at one of his pre-tea party brunches. The other pancakes are equally, and delightfully absurd. In fact, the RVP is probably the most manageable of the lot as all of the other pancakes come in orders of three and are approximately 12" in diameter, meaning that only the sumo wrestlers that happened to stop at the Griddle with a tour bus from Tokyo can actually finish their plates. If you want to attempt to be somewhat healthy you can order any of the pancakes whole wheat, and I actually prefer them that way. Have them mix pumpkin pie mix into the batter and slather it on with whipped cream, and you'll be eating a kind of pumpkin pie/cake that makes about as much sense as peanut butter and jelly. The rest of the pancake menu appears to be straight out of Alice's Wonderland, or some Disney film, with all manner of crazy combinations designed to put you into a sugar coma. Despite some other reviewers qualms, the blueberry sour cream mix makes for a light topping to the thick pancakes, and can serve as a pleasant antipode to your girlfriend's caramel and butterscotch monstrosity. Unless you are diehard American though, you would do well to steer clear of any menu items that do not contain either the words "pancake" or "french toast" as their Tequila Sunrise (i.e. huevos rancheros) was simply a large glob of cheese and beans, with some overdone eggs, and a sauce with a slight tang to it, but absolutely zero heat. The tang of the sauce is more like the orange flavored drink that they apparently drink in space than the kind you want with your huevos rancheros. However, I am an admitted snob in this area, and that isn't really what the griddle is about. If you want finessed, finely done huevos rancheros the Black Cat serves them just down Fairfax. No, The Griddle is an old-fashion American institution that does what a place like IHOP wished it could do: actually deliver a down-home meal with a seriously gluttonous absurdity that pulls you into a fairytale for the duration of your meal, and at rock-bottom prices (1 order of pancakes could feed some dozen wannabe models that one so often finds roaming the Sunset strip like lost cats). Their individual french press coffee is also lightyears beyond the swill that most other diners, and pancake houses are dishing out. The Griddle is the stuff of Los Angeles legend, and in that sense, I would prefer to spend a day at this Mad Hatter's table than at any of the theme parks in the area.

This place really is a no BS kind of place. ÊI love that about it. ÊThe guy taking names down was pretty helpful. ÊI asked for outside seating and he gave us the first table available. ÊLuckily I came pretty early, around 9AM, after dropping my dog off for a grooming, or else I would've been stuck in the ridiculous line that spans both sides of the restaurant. Ê I order the Poached Y Papas Benedict and my boyfriend got the Mom's French Toast. ÊI really liked the crispy potatoes on my benedict. ÊI thought it was a great way to utilize every ingredient to it's maximum. ÊThe center of the potato was probably scooped to make steak fries and the remainder was used to make my dish. ÊMy one complaint was my eggs. ÊI thought it came out a bit over cooked. ÊThe eggs weren't as runny as I'd like. ÊAlso, there was nothing on the plate to soak in the egg yolk. ÊNormally a benedict dish has an English muffin or some other kind of bread to do that job, but none here. ÊThe ham was delish though. Ê My boyfriend's Mom's French Toast was good, but we've had better in SF, the mecca of brunch food. ÊI think next time we should probably try the pancakes instead.

GARGANTUAN food portions do not necessarily = GOOD FOOD! The omelette we got was just scrambled eggs over "omelette filling" - Oh so not appealing! We got the bleu cheese and something else omelette. Unmemorable at best. Some people don't care because they think that food goes in and comes out the same everytime! Some people do not care because they get their money's worth! Not me! I am into presentation and this was NOT an omelette! The Nutella French Toast was really, really ridiculously good though! Yes, I would write home about it. Then again, I am a Nutella fiend haha - so maybe the review of this is very biased! The portion was gargantuan! French pressed coffee here! Nice touch! This and the Nutella French Toast make this place a 3 star experience! This place is a three C's place! Crowded, Crass and Cramped! If you enjoy being a sardine at breakfast time come here! If you are not a morning person you just may get into a fight! Really, if you love your fellow human beings come here - if not - spend breakfast with Snap, Crackle and Pop! The decor isn't terribly interesting. Parking can be a problem, so expect to walk a few blocks. Sounds like a really fun thing to do in the morning huh? There are long waits for this place btw! What is it with Americans and their love affair with breakfast? Eggs are so MEH!!!!

Meh. ÊMostly underwhelming. Ê This place is like the popular breakfast spot version of the Hunger Games movie. ÊYou want to be blown away. ÊYou want to love it. ÊYou want it to be epic. ÊBut instead you walk away feeling somewhat disappointed and you're not exactly sure why. ÊI mean, it was really good. ÊThe portions were huge and it wasn't terribly expensive. ÊI mean all these sheep seem to wait outside for their coveted table without a second thought. ÊIn the end, all you end up getting is some sugary sweet goodness that leaves you feeling a little heavy, but otherwise empty inside. It's simply nothing special. If you do convince yourself you need to try this place, wrong as you may be, go mid morning on a weekday. ÊAt least that way you'll spare yourself the indignity of being lumped in with the herd of other aspiring reality TV stars.

Oh Griddle Cafe, your wait is long, your servings are huge, and your prices are fairly reasonable.. this all together makes a 3.5 star rating. I'm sure everyone's read abt the long wait here but never fear, they have a number of different lines: one for parties of two, one for parties of three, one for parties of four, and I think another for parties of five or more. Since it was just my friend and I, the wait was about 40 minutes -- which is exactly what the dude with the waiting list clipboard told us. He knows what he's talkin abt so definitely listen to his estimate and decide from there if you're willing to wait. When we finally got seated, it was a good thing we had already decided beforehand what we would get. About 15-20 min later came our food: Poached y Papas Benedict - I don't know why more people don't do this. The potato skins were AWESOME and crispy, which were perfectly complemented by the sweet ham and soft and yolky poached eggs. YUM. GET IT. Red Velvet Pancake - This tasted neither like red velvet nor like a pancake. Tasted more like cake mix in the form of a pancake topped off with regular ole icing (as opposed to the promised cream cheese). Maybe twas an off day for us but I'd say based on my experience, skip it. I was torn between 3 and 4 stars but the Poached y Papas Benedict was so good, the Griddle Cafe warranted another .5 star. Oh and the validated parking behind the restaurant helped with the 3.5 star rating as well. Come hungry, wait 40 minutes-ish, order the Poached y Papas Benedict, and leave happy!

As the famous Admiral Ackbar said, "It's a (tourist) trap!" ÊLike a fly caught in Venus, I was lured here by the titillating tease of Griddle's famous red velvet panCAKE. ÊAfter waiting for what seemed like light years, my group was led to a private wampa cave in the back of the caf. ÊThere we feasted on a plethora of breakfast foods, French toasts, and hotcakes with a myriad of toppings. Bring with you a Jabba the Hut-like appetite because the portions here are wookie-sized. ÊGriddle Caf has jedi-mastered its red velvet pancake topped with cream cheese icing, which is as sweet as younglings. ÊThe rest of the foods here is Jar Jar Binks forgettable.

Where I'm from, there are two breakfast joints known for their pancakes. I can barely remember the names of these places because I'd much rather have my next pancake at Griddle instead. We went on a Wednesday around 11. Luckily, we had no wait. Parking is behind at Rite Aid, easy to find. We were seated quickly, greeted by a nice waiter and immediately honed in on the Oreo pancakes. Black Magic. HOLY CRAP I NEVER WANT TO EAT ANOTHER PANCAKE AGAIN! It's fluffy, Oreo-y, doesn't even need syrup. I'd want that as my birthday cake. Coffee comes in a French press, which I love. Our Mexican omlette was awesome, I'm a sucker for green chiles and guac. Next time I'm in LA, I'm going back.

Amazing breakfast.. the banana pancake (we got 1 pancake to split not the normal order of 3). You should really look into getting smaller portions and trying more things. This was amazing and tasted like bananas but was moist and fluffy. We also got 1/2 order french toast which was a large amt...maybe too much butter on it but you can remove the blob. This was also perfectly cooked on the outside crispy and then moist everywhere else (we got the normal french toast). We didn't want any of our dishes to be insanely sweet. We got a side order of the bacon (crispy..thick slices...a large portion). We got orange juice and cofee too. Cofee comes in a french press and gives you about 3 cups? The waiters were pretty damn good looking and there was still a wait at 2pm..but by 230 you could walk and get seating.

Always seen the lines but avoided the hype until Jillian from Good Day LA aired them. She is to me what Opera is to middle aged women who watch daytime tv. Back to the point - I was lucky enough to avoid the lines and I must say it was the best breakfast in town ! Not sure if I would entertain standing in line though. Most people wouldn't mind but I'm just ADHD when it comes to lines. With the exception of waiting at a taco truck late nigh. That I believe is part of the experience. Must try!

Well well well... I must say I had super high expectations, especially since this place was listed as one of the Top 10 restaurants in the Yelpiverse. Here's the good, the bad, and the ugly: Seemingly the top 2 dishes were the RED VELVET PANCAKES (can you say NOM?) and the Crunchy Peanut Butter French Toast. So... my girl and I ordered them respectively. They both tasted really good but I have to say that it was too rich & sweet for our blood. Total sugar overload when paired with one of their delicious vanilla lattes. Imagine getting a dessert at the Cheesecake factory followed by a slice of Cheesecake for dinner... that's how I felt. Recommendation: Order 1 sweet pancake like the red velvet one and share it among 2 or 3 people. Then get a dish with eggs & sausage perhaps. In the end you will still get the pleasure of All American goodness without the diabetes. Starfox over 'n out. I sometimes miss the N64.

It was our lucky day. - We found parking in the street, since parking is super expensive. They know you'll pay. - We got there early so we got seated fast! People after had to wait to get a table for quite a while. - Food was really good! - Service was efficient and friendly. The coffee was good, depending on the brew you can have it with different strength. I ordered the chocolate chip and original pancake, I couldn't finish it, they were so big but oh my... so good! The egg dishes were also really tasty from other members of the party. So if you decide to go there, get there early to avoid the wait, then you won't be disappointed.

WOW... this is considered "breakfast" food?? I ordered "A Time to Love," thinking it was "The Golden Ticket" but doesn't matter anyways because it was soooooo delicious. I'm personally a waffle person, but the top layer was perfectly crispy. TIP: you can ask for one instead of getting three since they are literally bigger than the size of my head (or anyone's head). I do get headaches sometimes if I eat REALLLY sweet things, and I have one now but it was SO WORTH IT. I loved my (pan)CAKE. Last tip: We went at 12 and there was no wait! It actually took us longer to figure out how to get out of the stupid parking garage across the street (sensei, luca, wells fargo). Don't use that one!

Couldn't help but try this place after seeing 1,980+ reviews at 4 Stars.. Pretty Solid and a must try in my book! Besides they offer a plethora of Breakfast Entrees! Family sized individual orders to share with the neighbors!!: Peanut Bubba Crunchy French Toast: An Enourmous Pair of Toast that was almost completely covered with powdered sugar and a fat scoop of whipped cream then sprinkled with some peanut butter crumble looking bits on top. Moist, Quite Sweet (even without the maple syrup) Êwith an abundant amount of peanut butter spread. Not bad but it wasn't something I'd order again, a little too much for my taste. Red Velvet Pancake: Just 1 single pancake. I'm glad we were able to order just one, a giddy couple sitting next to us informed us of the behemoth portions at the place. 1 pancake equals like 5 pancakes at IHOP! The pancake covered the whole entire plate, a big plate! It was topped cleverly with cream that they swirled around like those hypnotize tunnels. This was pretty good better than what I expected. Not too sweet and a mild familiar red velvet flavor. Only negative was the pancake wasn't cooked evenly. As I sliced from the outside towards the center of the pancake, every bite started getting softer and more moist. Overall, a good choice and I say one should be enough for Most People.. Decent sized parking lot in back was a definite plus, Service attentive and quick, Prices fair, more in terms of quantity than quality and Atmposphere was relaxed although busy. Not bad, I may come back to try other dishes.

Breakfast gluttony. My friend and I each ordered two eggs, bacon, breakfast sausage, and griddle potatoes, and we shared an order of red velvet pancakes and an order of mom's french toast. Everything was delicious, but just way too much food. I really suggest coming with at least four or five people willing to order something different, so you can try everything without feeling like a pig afterwards. A bit overpriced for breakfast, but what do you expect for a trendy joint?

The Griddle is always a good bet after a night out. Just bring your drug of choice to get you through your epic hangover in case there is a wait... They have some creative twists on comfort food. I've tried the more interesting items (like Red Velvet Pancakes) however I've been more impressed with the way they whip up classics like French Toast. My rec: skip the crazy items and go for the standard fare... which is by no means standard.

Chocolate chip pancakes the size of a frisbee all for $10. Order one and share, but make sure you try the other pancakes. Located in a prime spot on Sunset, the Griddle is a great spot to start the day right. Make sure you get there with time to spare because you'll be in line for at least 30 minutes--it's worth the wait; trust me.

Based on the superb reviews on yelp, we decided to go check this place out for lunch last week and I was expecting to experience some over the top food, but unfortunately, this was not the case. My wife ordered the chicken sandwich and I went for a burger. Honestly, both of our meals were very greasy, almost to the point of being overwhelming. Furthermore, both of our meals tasted very bland. Not sure if I went in on an off day or what, but the food was not at all impressive. Maybe, this place is known for their breakfast and I may go back again just to try the breakfast, however, as to getting lunch, it is a definite skip.

Los Angeles is a breakfast town. There is no doubt in my mind about this. I mean, we have our share of excellent dinner locals, after all we do boarder the Pacific and the sun goes down on her every night, but when LA rises at whatever time that is, breakfast is what defines. After 40 years of this morning ritual, I have narrowed the top spot to two places; The Original Pantry at 9th and Fig, and The Griddle Cafe. Two entirely different places, but the legendary status both have over breakfast unite them. Forget that one is an old school diner-come-steakhouse for a moment. And let us focus on The Griddle. After all, this is their review. My usual morning here is spent devouring the all too delicious "Cobb Omelet." No, it is not named for "Roy Cobb" but for the salad. It shares many of the wonderful items found on the salad, save the lettuce. What is not to love about whipped eggs surrounding blue cheese and bacon crumbles with chunks of chicken and more gooey melted cheese? And don't forget the awesome hash brown/potato cake!! When I am here with my brother, we will often split the omelet and an order of their larger than the plate pancakes. I swear, if the almighty eats pancakes, these are the ones. On a recent visit, I ventured out on a culinary branch and ordered the Red Velvet pancakes. Let me just say that they do not disappoint this foodie!!! You have to try them, they are so friggin' good. Coffee of course in also an experience. French Press with your choice of strengths? Who still does this? I always go for the dark, and am never sorry. Okay, now for the ones who do not like to wait, I say, plan your schedules better, get up earlier, or go someplace else. Good food in this city is worth the wait every time. If you really are going to take away stars for the wait, then you have missed the whole point of a gem like this. The Griddle is a place to luxuriate over your breakfast with friends as you enjoy the lazy start to a lazy day. If you want fast, then head over to 9th and Fig in downtown for breakfast, just get there before I do!

Be sure to bring your appetite! You'll probably still need to take some food to go. Huge portions and deliciously sweet. We had the "Time to Love" and "Red Velvet". We also had to order a side of french fries because of all the sweetness.

I was afraid that I was going to get hit by some kind of hour long wait like the reviews warn, but coming at about 2:30pm there was no wait time at all. I'll explain my "A-OK." rating for this place (I'm kind of cringing at since I know it could be a "Whoohoo!" rating). It was still packed when we got in, and service was super hectic. We got our food pretty quickly but after that service just completely vanished. We completely drained our big cups of water by the end of the meal and no one stopped to refill them (actually I didn't see anyone's cups being refilled). But wouldn't have been too big of a deal if the food was amazing. I ended up getting the "Some like it HOT Scramble", and it was just alright the 3 stars is mainly for the food. It wasn't spicy, and it was actually somewhat bland. I'm coming back for the coffee and the MONSTROUS red velvet pancakes (these were bigger than the platter they were served on) though, had I gotten those I'm pretty sure I would be raving with the 2100+ people here. I should probably go on a 3 day fast before attempting the pancakes though.

I come from San Diego just for the food. Its near my sister's house and lets jsut say I visit alot more often now that I know about thace. I hate the wait and the service is hit and miss. Alex, the short guy at the counter is hands down the best host at doing his job. Although the waits are long, it would be worse if it werent for him keeping people in line. I love the fact, if you have four and not all four are there, you dont get a table. The pancakes (yellow brick road, golden ticket, red velvet and plain are the best pancakes I have had. The french toast is awesome, I dont liek coffee but my wife and brother and law swear by the french press coffee, but its $4 but all you can drink. There are a bunch of great places to eat in San Diego, including Broken Yolk, Hiram Walker, pancake house and some more, but none come close to this gem. I was at Hiram Walkers, and after we ate their pancakes, the waitress showed off the guaranteed best pancake rule (if they are not thebest ever, your pancakes are free), I asked her if she had heard of the Griddle, without an answer, she said all the pancakse were free. She realized the greatness. She said that is the #1 restaurant people mention when they say they are not the best. TIPS: Go EARLY, they open at 8, lines start around 9. Or eat lunch Êor midweek. if you eat after 9 am on saturday or sunday, expect a 40min wait, but I've waited 30 minutes for friggin' Denny's not a big deal. Get the Ham steak ($5) and fries ($3) and sides instead othe usual bacon/sausage, hashbrowns. The hashbrowns and the bacon/sausage are mediocre at best and expensive and small. The ham is a FULL STEAK about 12in diameter and you can asked to chop it for you, The fries are regular frozen steak fries, but they ahve good seasonsing (in house seasoning, the fries are like Red Robin's) and they have Beaver Honey Mustard which is awesome for the ham and fries. Don order omlettes or other Êegg dishes. not really good and you just waited 40 minute, get what they are famous for, teh pancakes and french toast. Mimosas are sorry and $7.50. Split a pancake ($10-13)order per 3/4 people. Its gluttonous if you dont, they are huge and its wasteful if each person orders an order. Be nice to Alex at the door and he may try to get you a table sooner and direct traffic for him, there are seperate lines for 2, 4 Êand large parties, keep people in the correct line, he reacts to teh help. Enjoy the food, it is worth the wait. PLEASE OPEN IN SAN DIEGO, I'll give you my first born!

You'll never leave Griddle Cafe hungry. I had so much food left over once that I offered my untouched pancakes to a bum but he wanted money instead. So much for being generous...

Bluesberry Pancake: Can't go wrong with this and their blueberry sour cream. Not so hot: Black Magic pancakes: Oreo... good in ice cream not pancakes.

Wait time wasn't bad but we went nearer to closing (2). We waited longer to go to the restroom. We had the baked potato omelette, kicking and screaming bfast tacos, French toast, Cobb omelette. Definite YES-es are the baked potato omelette (egg whites only, w cheddar) and French Toast. The french toast was some of the best I have had. It was rich, thick, on delicious brioche bread. It was super flavorful and of course came in a giant serving size. The baked potato omelette really tasted like a baked potato, and would satiate The Rock it's so huge. Service was fast, the host was amazingly friendly, servers were pretty good and covered each other in true teamwork fashion! Park behind the restaurant in the Rite Aid parking lot (if you got late enough, you don't even need validation, although the Griddle will give you it). Yummilicious Factor = A-

11:03- Put our names in. Given 15 minutes wait. 11:07- Lined up on the wall. Host Man gives us the rules. (You know, be good, tip well and ladies should hit on him.) 11:17- Seated a whole minute early. 11:25- Order placed for french press coffee, black magic pancakes (for me) and red velvet pancake (for CP). 11:37- Coffee comes out and we are told to let it sit 2 minutes before pressing. 11:39- We press, it rocks our socks off, we drink with gusto. 11:45- Food arrives. 11:46- CP "I could literally eat this non stop for the rest of my life." 11:50- CP "I lied about non stop... Unless I had an extra stomach to contain it." 11:55- CP "Oooh starting to slow down. This shit is heavy." 12:00- CP "It's turning on me. It's like a bad trip" One last bite... CP "Yeah F*ck this. I don't even want to think about this pancake." At first I couldn't understand why there was 3 pancakes in my oreo pancake pile and only one pancake in CP's red velvet pile but the truth was, oreos or not, the red velvet is truly so heavy. She's soo heavy. It's literally like eating a delicious breakfast cake. It's good but rough. Definitely not a solo person experience and percentage wise we both ate the same amount of our plates. For you smarties out there I'm sure you realize I ate 3 times what CP did and I was happy about it. The Black Magic was awesome. It wasn't overwhelming and didn't need syrup. Just a regular old pancake with oreos in it. As you can see by the time stamps this was both breakfast and lunch so hold your judgement. About half way through I ordered a side of sausage to prevent myself from getting a sugar migraine. The staff was personable and efficient. Even though it was so busy we were piling out onto the curb, I never felt rushed. We left a ton of food behind and that makes me sad but I do think they need to reconsider their serving sizes. It's really just not sound. Regardless, they have so many specialty pancakes I can't wait to give it another go but this time CP and I are sharing.

Gone Shrimping ($11.95) + 1 Only Red Velvet Pancake ($8.95) + 1/2 Apple Cobbler French Toast ($7.95) = $31.37 with tax This place definitely lives up to it's reviews. I went with two other friends after we hiked to Hollywood Trail and got there about 12:30 p.m. or so. There was a long line outside, and the wait was about 20 minutes. It was efficient though. The host separated the lines into 2 people and 3+ people and was fully aware of the order of people in which they came. Inside is cute. I'm not observant of the surroundings enough to describe it, but it's definitely crowded. We sat down, were promptly greeted by the server who retrieved our drink orders and placed our meal orders in a swift fashion. Food took about 15 minutes to come out. Gone Shrimping: we needed a salty dish to counter-balance all of the sweet. I would have gotten something with bacon in it; however, i got up fatty and red meats for Lent. This was a nice alternative. It wasn't heavy and had just enough salt that you can add hot sauce without getting overloaded. The shrimp was small but had a plump crispy to it when you bite down. The color was also a healthy light pink, which definitely added appeal. I love the pesto sauce which wasn't too over powering and the capers to add a little extra flavor. Red Velvet Pancake: tastes just like a cupcake but denser...a pancake form. I liked this much more than the other sweet dish we got because it wasn't as sweet but had just enough to make me satisfied. Definitely a trademark of this place. Apple Cobbler French Toast: my first bite was a goo of sweet deliciousness. Then I found the Lemon Butter that they had on the side and it was an explosion of flavor in my mouth with the mellow and spiced apple cobbler, the deep, dense french toast, and the zing/zest of the light lemon butter. This dish definitely started out as my favorite, but after eating finishing my portion, it was too much sweetness for me. I would still get it again because I love the combination of everything on the dish.

For my 200th review it's LOVE at first bite!! I figure it's should be a restaurant in yelp's 2012 top ten list that I haven't been to but have been dying to try. So here it is Griddle Cafe. I've seen this place featured on different foodtv shows and was excited to see it make it on the yelp list. This place happens to to be my sweet's favorite place so he planned a day date for us today, Thursday for a late breakfast (to avoid traffic). Got here at 11:30 and there wasn't any wait and sat by the counter. My sweet ordered banana nana (brown sugar banana), I ordered Creme de la creme (graham cracker crusted french toast topped w/ cheesecake) and we needed something savory so we ordered griddle potatoes. Banana nana was real good! It was 3 huge pancakes that were tender and moist and flavorful bananas in ever bite. It was good. I can see why their pancakes are so popular!! My Creme de la creme french toast was the best I've ever had!! The thick sliced french toast was surprisingly tender like the pancake. Wow, it's good and the cheesecake topping was creamy perfect in consistency and didn't lack in cheesecake flavor. It is not a necessary topping for future french toast consumption! There's nothing like having high expectations and still being blown out of the water. Great place and can't wait to come back and try something else. If and when you ever decide on opening a 2nd location please come to the OC ;)

Ever heard of "Early bird gets the worm"? well this is very true as it comes to Griddle Cafe! The parking lot is behind and shared with a rite aid. Be sure to get here early because the line does build up, when i arrived that morning with my boyfriend we came in from the backdoor so we saw that the whole restaurant was packed! We were lead to the front of the restaurant and saw there were 2 different lines on opposite sides. One was for groups of 4+ and the other was for singles or couples, and we waited for about 30-45 minutes and boy was it worth it! We got seated and many people around us were just as eager to sink their teeth into their gigantic pancakes or decadent french toasts or savoy omelets. We ended up ordering the "Creme De La Creme" which was like CHEESECAKE french toast Êit was crusted with graham cracker crust and boy was it satisfying! and we also ordered the "Chicago Charlie" which were eggs with italian sausage, potatoes, bacon, bell pepper, mozzarella cheese, onions and it was served with garlic bread. Each dish came out sooo huge that it was impossible for the both of us to finish! but it was soo good. I definitely had a food baby afterwards (: I will be returning to try more of their good eats! highly recommended!

I came here with my beau and we weren't sure what we were going to get. Staring at other guests seats, and hearing about the splendor of their waffles and pancakes... What to get? What to get... We opted for one Sweet dish and one Savory dish. They got so many different batters of pancakes... and they look HUGE! We almost got the red velvet pancakes, but when I asked our server... He said that the French Toast is what really makes them famous... By goodness. THE BEST French Toast I have EVER had in my life. I understand the hype, the line, and the price. That French Toast is OFF the CHAIN! If you're coming here for one thing, and one thing only -- Take it from me, the FT will not disappoint you. Coffee is groovy, as it comes in it's own filter, and the other breakfast goods aren't bad either. For our savory dish we got the "Some Like It Hot"... Was more like Nachos and breakfast... Chicken Tequila Sausage, eggs, tequila-spiked sauce, and tortilla chips! Yum. 5 stars since this place is "AS GOOD AS IT GETS?" For that spectacular French Toast.

The Griddle Cafe (TGC) has been on my bookmark list FOREVER. I finally got to check it out. I'd have to say, TGC really lived up to the hype! and the portions are ridiculous! Decor: This place is really cramped. ÊI was getting claustrophobic in here. Everything here is soooo close together! I could see and hear EVERYTHING. Food: 1) Red Velvet Pancakes - Warm, Fluffy, Cake-like, Heavenly. What's great is that the cream cheese icing wasn't too sweet. It's so hard to find places where you don't feel like you're gonna get diabetes from the icing. http://www.yelp.com/biz_É 2) Creme de la Creme French Toast - Graham cracker crusted French toast with cheesecake topping. If you're not used to sugar, BEWARE. I had a HUGE SUGAR RUSH after this. It was AMAZING. I can't usually handle sweet dishes, but after having one bite, I just had to keep taking more even though I was already bloated. http://www.yelp.com/biz_É 3) Poached y Papas Benedict - Pretty much a Potato skin with ham and eggs benedict. The potato skin was a little too thick for my taste, but the eggs were poached perfectly and the hollandaise sauce was DELICIOUS. I think the dish would've been better with hash browns instead of the thick potato skins. Parking: Street parking if you can find some. There's a lot behind TGC. Overly stuffed + sugar rush is not a pleasant feeling.

The breakfast they serve is delicious and incredibly filling. They take the cake in pancake quite literally. Some plates come out with three inch-thick pancakes that are spilling over the plate. It's rare that I finish an entire serving there, which leads to formidable doggy-bag breakfasts for the next week. If you're coming with friends, which you should (since the atmosphere lends itself perfectly to that), expect to stand in line for a while, especially during the weekends for brunch time. But the wait is ABSOLUTELY WORTH IT!

Mmmmmmmmmm! ÊThis was delish! ÊWhile in LA this past weekend I was craving some good breakfast and found this place on yelp and I was not disappointed! We got there not long after it opened and it was busy already but were seated right away at the counter and within 10 minutes the joint was packed. It's divey alright, as another yelper or two mentioned, but I liked that fact, but what I liked even better was that the crowd was a total hodge podge of edgy hipsters to yuppy-ish families, couples, etc...everyone seemed to fit in just fine. Oh, the waiters were all pretty tasty too. Ê:) ÊI could have stayed for a 3rd pot of coffee just to watch them work.

ÊWe shared some bacon....mmmmmm, meaty goodness. The COFFEE, OMG, loved it. ÊYou pick your roast, mild, medium or bold and they bring you a french press all for yourself, it was really great coffee, such a nice change from burnt diner coffee that you get at most breakfast joints. Ê The next time we're back we'll definitely hit this place up again. 4 stars only because it was a bit pricey considering you're ordering pancakes which I make all the time, from scratch, and wow, their markup is up there!

PROBLEM: Bored to death with breakfast places. SOLUTION: Griddle Cafe. Ê You are General Zaroff from Richard Connell's short story, "The Dangerous Game," but instead of hunting humans because hunting animals got boring, eating breakfast got boring. Now I have an affinity towards breakfast, but breakfast is repetitive. ÊIt's all hash browns, eggs, bacon, waffle/pancake/french toast. ÊMy friend, what you need is a MAN VS FOOD challenge! ÊYour need to poach humans can be equated to... *pause for dramatic effect* "Griddle Cafe." YOU WILL be greeted by mutated size pancakes for a reasonable price. YOU WILL eat a fourth of this mutation and start food coma-ing. YOU WILL regret ordering this plate for yourself and wish you shared and proceed by not taking home the rest because old pancakes are never good. ÊIt's places like Griddle Cafe that make me feel like a douchebag for throwing away my leftovers instead of feeding them to hungry kids in Africa. I ordered the Tis the Season, a delicious pumpkin pancake smothered with pumpkin pie filling and whipped cream. ÊThe significant other ordered a blueberry pancake with banana mixed in. ÊThe syrup is probably the best I've had, but it wasn't enough to push us to eat past 1/4 of this beast. ÊI'm usually a QUANTITY vs QUALITY man but the Griddle did it in for me. ÊAfter awhile, I got tired of eating the same consistency, the same flavor, and all that sugar. Ê Yup. ÊAt this point, hunting for a nice 4 legged beast seems better than trying to tackle this pancake that I named "Sanger Rainsford." ÊI need a nap.

The food, service and experience definitely lived up to expectations. We went this morning during the LA Marathon and still only had to wait about 10 minutes for a booth. The service was quick and helpful - our waiter took time to explain the menu to us, giving us his recommendations when he realized we were having a hard time deciding between all the amazing options. Between the three of us, we got the Banana Nana pancakes, the Nutella French Toast, and a steak omelette. Out of these, the french toast was by far the best. The omelette was good but definitely not their specialty, which is obviously french toast and pancakes. Huge portions, so I'd recommend ordering different types of dishes and sharing to get the full experience. The place was crowded and noisy, but not in a distracting or annoying way. More like you're sharing breakfast with 100 other happy diners.

Ok I went here yesterday morning..love it! i am a such a stickler for customer service. ok parking sucks but in that area i was honestly expecting that.. i honestly lucked up on a broken meter so i was straight. ÊI had never been here before but was meeting a friend who wanted to come here. ÊI walk up and just stand in line. ÊThis guy comes out and he is putting people in line so he asks do i want to get on the list i say yes. put name down, well turns out our party had more people than i knew anyway i had to tell him to add. point is we had to move to another area, but the guy was super nice called me by name and politely told Ême we were on the wrong side. Ê After about a 40 minute wait we go inside, since i party was large we were led to the back room (champagne room!!!) no for real it was really dark, crushed velvet booth with beads for the door, but who doesnt want their own private room in a restaurant so it was a ok with me and after seeing how squeezed in people in the front room were i was glad we were in the back, private room, plenty of space. I ordered red velvet pancake, pork sausage, coffee... I didnt taste any Pan in that Cake just tasted like cake but it was delicious...did i finish it? of course not!! it was way too big, sausage yummy, french press coffee, reallllly yummy.. i was happy with my meal. My friend didnt like her turkey sausage and didnt/wouldnt eat it so i tasted a piece and umm yeah something wasnt right. it was chewy, had a funny taste and was almost gamey like it wasnt turkey hmmm something to think about. i also tried a piece of that nutella french toast ..didnt like it...maybe it was the nutella?? ive never had nutella before and dont know what it taste like but ive have french toast before thats why im blaming the nutella lol our server was super cool. his name was Michael, he was real chill. ÊThe guy who does the names thing also really cool and laid back and nice. ÊEvery time I ran into him during my time there (omw to b-room or to my car and when i left) he called me by name like oh excuse me ____, bye ____, like i said im a stickler for customer service. anyway def worth checking out.

If you're hungry enough to eat the proverbial cow for breakfast (and a yummy one at that), look no further! I've come here a handful of times and I've yet to be disappointed. The portions are HUGE (three pancakes that are 16" in diameter and stacked 4" high). I recommend the cheesecake stuffed french toast, two huge slices of bread with cheesecake topping and powdered sugar. Also terrific is the Tequila Sunrise breakfast, complete with flour tortillas, eggs, sausage, cheese, sour cream, avocado, and a wonderfully spicy red sauce to smother everything. The pancakes are a staple but are simply impossible to finish by oneself. If you're ambitious enough to try an order, make sure you agree with a friend on a flavor and ask for a second plate. The coffee comes in light, medium, and dark roasts and is served in a french press with unlimited refills. The menu is large enough to keep everyone entertained. The place is relatively small so try to show up before 10-11 am to ensure you won't be waiting in line on the street watching everyone devour their foody goodness. You run across celebs. The service is fast, attentive, and everything I desire from a breakfast place -- just the facts, I came here to eat! Overall the food is amazing. I would highly recommend coming here wether you're a local or visiting Los Angeles, try the Griddle!

Service: 5 Food: 5 Price: 4 Cleanliness of bathroom: n/a There will be a wait. But it will be worth your time. Park in the Rite Aid parking lot (Griddle will validate up to three hours), get your name down on the wait list, and go across the street to The Coffee Bean for a cup of coffee. Come back at an appropriate time with your entire party and be seated. Order. Drool. Get food. Eat. Be full and satisfied. There are some wild specialty pancakes - red velvet, oreo, butterscotch-filled goodness... ones with liquor mixed into the batter. Really, go crazy. The pancakes are also ginormous and will be enough to satisfy two people. We ordered the Scotch on the rocks, which was delicious even though I don't like butterscotch, the Poached y Papas Benedict (hollandaise sauce was so great), the Mamma Mia burger and the original French Toast. The french toast was delicious. Delicious. My companion commented on the hipster-ness of the place. I can see that. It's definitely Hollywood, with diners ranging from the preppy to the goth punk to the muscular body builders. It's also quite loud, but this will only aid in waking you up. It's not like you need a quiet, soothing, romantic place early in the morning, anyway. You do? That's strange... but think of it this way. Once the food comes out, all your attention will solely be on it and on no other. You and your french toast will be in your own little world. Even the hipsters can't ruin that.

The parking does kind of suck, and the wait can be long and annoying, but damn it's worth it! Well, since I came on Sunday I sure was in the mood for some mimosas. When 3 of us ordered one, our server suggested we get a pitcher instead, because there was a buy 1 pitcher get one free deal. How the hell could anyone resist that?! Even though it turned out to be way more mimosas then necessary in the end, it was definitely a good deal overall lol. I ordered an omelette with chicken and I can't remember what it was called sorry! You have your choice of adding meat, shrimp, or chicken. I wish I could've added all 3 but I chose the chicken, and it came with a big piece of avocado and a side of sour cream. The chicken was really delicious full of flavor and very juicy, not dry at all. The avocado and sour cream went so great with this omelette. The potatoes were also really good. Everything was really fresh and very delicious. I love red velvet cupcakes so when I heard there was a pancake, I just had to try it! It was so delicious!!!! I would definitely consider it more a treat or a dessert then an actual meal though, so I'm glad I ordered other food too. It was so soft and fluffy and the cream cheese on top was just perfect, I did not need to put extra syrup on it. At the end of my meal I was so full and pretty drunk after finishing 2 pitchers of mimosas, but very pleased! My only compliant is that the service was kind of shitty, but got progressively better. The server was very busy but still acted very annoyed and snooty in the beginning. ÊWe also had 2 extra people in our party that were late, and they repeatedly told us that they would not be able to order if they did not order with us. In the end our server did let them order and was very accommodating. So overall parking sucks, long ass wait, service was so so, but food was bomb! I'll be back!

A great brunch spot as long as you're willing to deal parking, lines and less than mediocre service which I will get into later. ÊI came here with a friend the other day around 11 and it was packed. ÊWe had to wait about 15-20 minutes to get seated and then some more for our waiter to even to say hi to us. ÊI would recommend showing up here around 1 after all the brunch/lunch traffic. I ordered the "Some Like it Hot" Scramble and it was practically gone within minutes. ÊIt's chicken tequila sausage, jack cheese, with tequila spiked ranchero sauce and the spicy chipotle sauce, topped off with avocado and pico de gallo. ÊNow, anything with avocado gets my vote! ÊI do like hot and it wasn't spicy at all but the ranchero and chipotle sauce was amazing so I can't complain. ÊI just got a little help from the Tapatio man and everything was all bueno. The food here is definitely 4-5 star worthy here but seriously I can't let go of bad customer service. ÊSince we already had to wait for some time before eating, my friend and I were worried about meter. ÊHe asked one of the waiters if he could exchange a dollar for quarters. ÊAnd the response he got back was "Sorry, we don't have a register" ÊSeriously.... a restaurant with no register?! C'mon at least come up with a better excuse. ÊThen just as my friend was about to ask another waiter, the waiter shouted "I don't have your quarters!" WTF?! In the end, we had to resort to exchanging for quarters that someone had left as tip. ÊI can forgive mediocre service but I don't know about this.

I hate leaving a place that I want to love with disappointment. Sadly, that's how I felt when I walked out of Griddle Cafe today. I'll get straight to the point, the service was disappointing. Yes, I understand this place gets a high volume of foot traffic, but why should us hungry patrons take a hit when it comes to service that we expect at other restaurants?! Our waitress had our waters ready for us quickly after we were seated, but it went downhill from there. I asked for a side of lemons to accompany our waters; we never got it. Our waitress just didn't look like she was having the time of her life serving us. I mean, yeah it probably would suck spending your Sunday morning serving at a busy breakfast joint, but at least look like you somewhat enjoy what you're doing rather than looking like a helpless actress trying to make it in LA! I don't think she even smiled once. Geez. She came back once to ask how we were doing, but my mouth was too full to request for my side of lemons. I let it go and was thinking that we'd get our water refills sometime before we finished our scrambles and red velvet pancakes. I guess we were asking for too much because she only came back with our check and didn't even over to fill up our glasses with water. I mean, they were both empty. Just because we're done eating doesn't mean we're not thirsty! Other than our poor service, the food was appetizing. The portion sizes of the scrambles were filling. The red velvet pancakes were delicate and satisfy the sweet tooth cravings, but I'll admit that I've had better red velvet pancakes at Babystacks Cafe in Las Vegas (handsdown!). I was a bit disappointed that I could only upgrade my side of muesli bread for some fruit rather than red velvet pancakes, even though their menu claims they'll try to accommodate special requests or substitutions as much as possible. We ended up having to pay the full price for the red velvet pancakes (comes with one pancake only). Don't come to Griddle Cafe expecting the best of service. I probably won't plan to come here anytime soon and will choose my other go-to brunch options before coming back here.

My absolute favorite place in Los Angeles. I wish they would extend their hours. I dont even know where to start.. listen, I've had just about everything on their menu-- Its all delicious. The portions are larger than life, the service is prompt and attentive (once the initial wait is over) and the quality is consistent. Do yourself a favor and just chose this place over whatever other breakfast joint you're considering. You wont regret it. Actually my favorite time to come is during the LA Marathon you can sit outside and watch everyone run by. Good times.

My Lord, there are some attractive people here, gently shoving crazy amounts of food in their faces. But it's a friendly vibe, with a good degree of noise and action. Portions, of course, are huge. ÊI tried the banana specialty pancakes of the house. Ê(Be sure to clearly tell your server if you don't want the gloppy butter puck and powdered sugar bath on your pancakes.) The pancakes are firm and tasty, not too sweet, and way more than you can handle. More good news: they travel well. Also tried the Mom's French Toast; very tasty. Not too sweet. The coffee is French Press, which three varieties. It was a bit weaker than I prefer, but it could've been just an issue with timing. Wanted more flavor, and I ordered the medium blend. Parking at the Rite Aid in back. Get validated.

Oh my god, chocolate hazelnut (NUTELLA, pretty much!!) spread in between two pieces of french toast? Kill me now cause I have died from sheer bliss. Wait, kill me after I have stuffed the entirety of that plate in my mouth, plskthx. Amazing, just simply amazing. I had a bite of the red velvet panCAKE and that was also delicious! I don't know how my friend ate half of it though, one bite was enough to satiate my taste buds. I went back to my french toast like a fat kid to his cake after having veggies, albeit delicious veggies. Anyway. Technical stuff here now. Expect a wait, although imo it's not that long of one if you're in great company. Came here at 2pm on a Sunday, got in at 3. Smaller place than the pics show but still roomy and I like that they have booths. Parking is a bit of a hassle though. Find street parking but check signs. Or park in the Rite Aid behind the restaurant for validated? parking.

After a long night of festivities, drinking, and lack of sleep, Jen B. her boyfriend and my boyfriend and I decided to venture out to conquer The Griddle Cafe on Sunset Blvd. We had heard great reviews of this place and after waking up at 2 PM and hungry as ever, we decided to give it a go! The parking was a little confusing at first but luckily The Griddle Cafe (as well as its neighbor Rite Aid) offers free parking behind the restaurant in the back). Thank God! Sunset Blvd. is the worst place to park. Upon entering, the restaurant itself is quite small and compact, but it smelled too delicious to walk away - even with the small wait time. The cafe offers only breakfast/brunch food (think pancakes and eggs) and seeing as to how we felt from the previous night, we were ready for this. After all, my favorite meal of the day IS breakfast..even if it is at 3:30 PM. We were seated momentarily and luckily received a booth (there are not that many in the restaurant). We were seated next to the kitchen and could see everything they were cooking. Let me just tell you - marvelous! The aroma of various sweet, gigantic pancakes (comes in a set of 3), waffles, french toast, omelettes, tacos, salads, burgers, sandwiches, and a variety of egg dishes. As delicious as the pancakes looked (I will definitely be trying that next time I go), we all ironically decided on egg specialty dishes. I ordered the Gone Shrimpin' dish. I felt like being particularly healthy...well, as healthy as an egg dish will allow...don't judge me! This dish came with plenty of egg whites scrambled in with shrimp, basil pesto, scallions, and tomatoes. It was topped with capers, and I opted for toasted wheat bread instead of the garlic bread. I loved this dish! It came out piping hot and the basil pesto brought out the flavor of the shrimp and the saltiness of the capers took the dish home. I gobbled the whole thing! Joe ordered the Some Like it Hot Scramble. This one was spicy! It came with chicken tequila sausage, their tequila-spiked rancheros sauce, pico de gallo, avocado, and spicy chipotle sauce. It was served with their homemade tortilla chips. I was obsessed with the tortilla chips - they weren't extremely crispy or too soft...just the perfect kind of chip for me! I had a few bites of his dish and it was pretty spicy so I didn't touch it again. Jen ordered the Chicago Charlie's Scramble and it had Italian sausage, potatoes, bacon, bell peppers, mozarrella cheese, garlic, basic, and plenty of onions. It was served with garlic bread. I love the bacon and sausage in this dish. Yummy! Ryan ordered the Caballero Scramble. All of the ingredients were packed into a giant flour tortilla! It had scrambled eggs, chicken chorizo, cheedar, green chiles and potatoes. It was topped with sour cream, salsa and avocado. This thing was huge.. so be warned! He finished the whole thing - what a trooped. I had a bite of it and the chicken chorizo was delicious! Overall, it's a fun experience - especially since celebrities have been photographed coming here. We didn't see anyone ... although there WAS someone with their sunglasses on..Hm. Then again he could have just had a rough night like us. Who knows! Come here!

Occasion: Lunch with friends from UCLA, UCSD, and USC Ê What I Had: "Hoagie" Omelette 'Tis the Season' flapjacks Food Review: The "Hoagie" Omelette includes Italian sausage, mozzarella, grilled onions, and bell peppers. The plate also comes with Griddle Potatoes and a French roll. The omelette was delicious: thick omelette skin and completely melted cheese. To be honest though? I was more impressed with the potatoes and French roll, and for good reason. The potatoes were made in a way that landed them somewhere in that happy medium between hash browns and mashed potatoes, so they didn't have that almost burnt taste of Denny's hash browns but had some crunch to them unlike mashed potatoes. The French roll was pre-sliced in half and was begging for a filling, so I ate it with some grilled veggies and potatoes in between the buns. If this is the same bun they use for their burgers, I know their burgers would be amazing. The bread is slightly chewy on the outside and extremely soft (almost plush!) on the inside, making the buns even softer than In-N-Out buns. My ideal burger buns. 'Tis the Season' flapjacks are pancakes mixed with pumpkin pie filling, topped with whipped cream and powdered sugar. They are available year round. I have never seen a pumpkin pancake in my life! Two of my favorite things all in one absolutely enormous, homogeneous stack. Service Review: We waited for more than 1.5 hours to get our table for 7 people, but as it was a holiday (MLK Day), the most popular breakfast spot in LA, and we had an unusually large group, it wasn't surprising. Plus we were pretty satiated from eating so much last night and there was a Coffee Bean across the street where we killed time hanging out, so the wait was bearable. Food was out relatively quickly and our waiters were friendly, but HIGHLIGHT: Since we had a larger group, we got to sit in one of the private rooms in the back of the restaurant. Halle Berry's private booth. Pretty awesome! Venue Review: There wasn't anything particularly special about the venue. We managed to find street parking not too far away without any trouble. Overall Impression: Fabulous food, biggest pancake portions I've ever seen, and although not the best place for large groups on weekends or holidays, it was well worth the wait.

Parking can be expensive, so find a side street and do a little walking. I ordered their super hyped Red Velvet Pancakes, southwestern omelette, and coffee for two. Their coffee comes in mild, medium, and strong. I ordered medium. Medium is strong. Unless you are a fan of the overly dark Starbucks taste, I would stick with medium or skip the coffee altogether. Its decent, but its expensive. You're in Hollywood, much better coffee is extremely easy to find. The Red Velvet Pancakes taste like...red velvet pancakes. Really sweet, really red, and really artificial tasting. Imagine play dough but fried. The icing was sickeningly sweet, and the batter was really heavy. Unless you're taste buds are like that of 5 year olds, I would skip this. I would highly suggest ordering their other pancakes. On the other hand, the Southwestern omelette was amazing, one of the best I've had. The eggs were fluffy, buttery, and perfect. The steak was cooked just right, and their refreshing salsa complemented the smokiness from the roasted peppers. They were generous with the avocado and cheese. It was definitely satisfying. As for the service, its ok- typical L.A. waiters, meaning if you look attractive or generous with tips, they'll try a tad bit harder to pretend to care. Expect a crowd.

I love Red Velvet anything. Red Velvet cake, cupcakes and now pancakes. The Red Velvet cake craze never really took off in Montreal, my guess is that because it's Southern and was never introduced properly there. So when I found out that Griddle Cafe serves up Red Velvet pancakes, I made a beeline to breakfast here and try it out for myself. Jesus, Mary and Joseph! I got a humongous pancake covering up the freakin' entire plate with swirls of cream cheese frosting, whipped cream and icing sugar. There is so much sugar here that you need to share this with someone and get something savoury on the side just to offset the sweetness. ÊNonetheless, it was high, fluffy and delish! You know a place is better than good when you make it a point to dine here a few times before you leave town. I spotted Peanut Butter French Toast on the menu and vowed to try it before I left LA and I managed to do just that! Light, fluffy huge slices of French Toast bread, slathered with peanut butter, whipped cream and peanut brittle - I nearly died and barely made a dent to my plate and had to take the rest to go. Griddle Cafe has all the usual breakfast options of eggs, bacon, toast and homefries but I love trying out places that serve up one-of-a-kind types of items which you can't get at home. if you're in the Hollywood/Sunset strip area, make it a point to at least try this place once. Weekdays are far easier to snag a Êtable than on weekends where apparently waits can last over an hour.

There's a lot of hype that comes along with this breakfast spot. I live just two blocks north of the restaurant and have been several times, mostly with visitors from out of town who have this on the top of their "to do" list. I've tried the best the menu has to offer according to yelp and the servers at Griddle: the famous red velvet pancakes, chocolate chip French toast, hoagie omelet and a few others. When I have gone, it has been on weekends and there is normally a line at least 25 minutes long (anytime after 9am at least). If you have a sweet tooth...VERY sweet tooth, this place could be a good fit for breakfast. The portions are large and the food selection is a bit on the sweeter side. The items I ordered were very good the first three or four bites, but after that it became too sweet and too filling for me...and this comes from a girl who loves her sweets. For people like me, the food portions Griddle offers is a tough sell. I don't need an entire stack of pancakes topped with a tube of icing sprinkled with sugar-it's too much. Aside from not being very impressed with their menu, the place is pretty busy and each time I've gone I've felt a bit crammed and rushed by the servers who are trying to get everyone in and out as fast as possible to keep the line under control. The noise level is loud and the space itself seems a bit dirty. I find this place to be a bit of a tourist trap. If you want to go to a breakfast spot with half the wait, variety (healthy items/sugary items) try Blu Jam or Taste on Melrose or Doughboys on 3rd. Both have indoor/outdoor seating. I frequent those two places and find the experiences a bit more enjoyable. Their menu has a good variety of brunch foods and the staff is friendly at both.

Servings are of epic proportions here. ÊSuper crowded, even mid-week. ÊExcellent for brunch, I must say. ÊLuckily, we scored a meter right out front. ÊThere is a lot of permit only parking round here, so beware. ÊI wouldn't say we waited more than 10 minutes, but we were there around lunchtime so this was only a short wait. As for the food, sharing an entree here was the way to go, thankfully my friend was of the same mind. ÊWe went with the Nutella french toast. ÊNom nom noms and it was gone. ÊIt had 2 ginormous pieces of french toast with nutella in the middle, then huge dollop of real whipped cream atop with more nutella drizzled atop. ÊCan't get enough nutella, this is definitely the dish for you. ÊFor sides, we had a scrambled egg and griddle potatoes, respectively. ÊEgg was good, needed cholula but none to be found. Ê There were a variety of hotsy sauce options though, options are good. ÊThe griddle taters were tasty too. ÊThey have french press coffee too, if you are into coffee. ÊI brought my own tea bag cause i'm el cheapo like that, but I still got a lovely large mug of hot water. ÊA ++. p.s. ÊWe both agreed afterwards, that a side of bananas or strawberries would have been excellent with this dish. ÊDefinitely keeping that in mind for next time.

Fully packed at 9:45 am on a Thursday morning may just tell you how popular this place is. ÊMy friend and I ordered the Red Velvet Pancake and the Addicted to Noisella French Toast to share with each other. They were both delicious but we felt a little sick after about half of our plate...luckily we were able to wash it down with some yummy mimosas (which is available by the PITCHER! WHOO!). ÊI was impressed with the food though with that much sugar, it's hard not to enjoy it to some gluttonous degree. Let's just say that breakfast is about the one and only meal in my day that I could care less about. I'd rather eat sushi or buffalo wings for breakfast rather than actual breakfast food BUT I had such a good experience at Griddle that I would come back here and try their other dishes (including breakfast items). If you know me at all, that is saying a lot. Ê Parking is available in the Rite Aid lot, as well as some street parking. When we left around 11:30, there were maybe 20 people waiting outside (remember, it was Thursday). ÊService was attentive, we got seated right away and they were nice enough to put us next to two guys that were easy on the eyes.

My wife and I finally got to try the Griddle Cafe this past weekend for the first time. ÊThe food was excellent and definitely worthy of the hype. ÊThe experience was a bit strange, yet tolerable. ÊMost importantly, we had a great breakfast. We decided to give it a try while the LA Marathon was going on thinking that the crowd would be minimal since traffic was blocked off in the area. ÊMy wife came up with a plan to park a couple of blocks away and walk in order to avoid the congested roads. ÊWell, there was almost no traffic, and the Griddle has validated parking right behind it that was still accessible (the lot is shared with the drug store on the corner). ÊWhen we did arrive, we were greeted by a crowd of people waiting in three different lines. ÊWe didn't know what to do, or where to stand, so my wife went inside to check while I waited in one of the lines. ÊShe was able to put our name down, and we were directed to stand in a different line against the wall. ÊWe figured out while waiting that one line was for 2-person groups, another was for groups of 3-4, and the line on the other side of the door was for parties of 5+. ÊNo matter which line a group is designated to stand in, it is important to check in at the front first. ÊThey will also not seat a party unless everyone in the group is there. While we waiting in line, the host from the front came out a couple of times and let everyone in line know that he didn't appreciate being yelled at, and that everyone in line would eventually be seated. ÊApparently he had a few people upset with his process of seating people, and he had enough of it. ÊHe was a tiny guy the epitomized a Napoleon complex, and he went too far yelling at everyone when he could have addressed it with the individuals that were in the wrong. ÊThe ironic thing is a few minutes after his second rant he came outside and was asking for our names to determine where we were at in line. ÊWhen we gave him our name, he said that we were not on the list! HA!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ÊHe had crossed off our name when he seated another group, and we could have easy been there forever without being called after his rant....and I would have still yelled at him for that if we would have not discovered the mistake! We finally got seated after waiting for about 45 minutes. ÊThe seating inside is tight, and we had several people rub against our table and the back of my chair while we were eating. ÊWe took our time going through the menu and I decided on "The Golden Ticket", a side of bacon, a side of potatoes, and an orange juice. ÊE-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G was good! ÊNot just pretty good, but just about one of the best breakfasts I have ever had. ÊThe portions were ginormous too, and I only was able to finish about 1/3 of my food. ÊGood thing they have large 'to go' boxes, because most of my food came home with me. Ê Eating at the Griddle was an interesting experience with great food mixed in. ÊThe food was worth the wait, and lived up to the hype. ÊIf I can figure out a time when this place is not crowded, I would love to eat here again. ÊHopefully my next review of the Griddle will be more about the food and less about the experience.

I checked out this place because it was conveniently close to the hotel I was staying at during my visit to L.A., but little did I know it was a popular spot. I yelped for breakfast places nearby and came across Griddle Caf. After reading several reviews on the long wait time and parking issues, I was almost discouraged on going there. Good thing my main concern was the food quality and decided to go. The food was GREAT. BTW, this place allows you to park in the Rite Aid parking lot next to it, but don't forget to validate your ticket. Apparently people don't notice they can park here for free, but now you know. Griddle caf's exterior is not impressive and that corner is known to have many hobo's wandering, so don't sit on the outdoor tables unless you like people (waiting to be seated) staring at you while you eat. The wait was about 20 mins for 4 people and a stroller, but the wait was worth it. Yes the place is touristy, but I wasn't looking for an experience, I was looking for good food. The portions are generous and the service was great. The bare-brick interior dcor is clean and although it has an open kitchen, you don't come out stinking of food. Our server Jason could have been putting on good act, but he seemed genuinely interested in pleasing us so the attention was warm. I looked around at other tables and I was not an isolated incident as other tables seemed happy with their service as well. The servers are clean cut, lean and without attitude, so I'm sure the ladies will appreciate that. Your coffee comes in a French press which makes it not only tasty, but convenient for refills at your own pace, instead of having to flag down your busy server for a refill. The OCD in me noticed the ketchup and hot sauce bottles looked brand new, with no slimy guck on the tip. For some reason I associate an establishments cleanliness with this small detail. There's nothing worse than a messy re-filled ketchup bottle with black curd when you unscrew the cap. We had: 1-'Mom's French toast', which was perfectly cooked and yummy (but don't mistake that slab of butter on it for vanilla ice-cream). 2-'Too hot to handle' burger, which was perfectly cooked with fresh tomato and jalapeos, but indeed too hot to handle. If you are a fan of excessive heat, then get it. 3- 'Two eggs' with pork-apple sausage and home fries, which was nothing less than magnificent. Total for four hungry persons was $75 and change. Their generous portions were well worth it. Although I couldn't sit there because of the stroller, the seats in the back are nice, so try to get seated there.

The food is incredible here. ÊI have visited on multiple occasions and have never been disappointed. ÊThe portions are ridiculous. ÊI always wonder why I insist on ordering my own french toast or pancakes...because I barely finish 1/5 of the plate.

Ê The cheesecake stuffed french toast is great and I also recommend the pancakes with banana and caramel-I think this one is my new favorite.

OMG THIS PLACE IS AMAAAAAAA-ZING to be honest, i had planned to come here a while back..but decided against it because i was just a "little" freaked out by the ginormous portions and the "crazy scrumptious border line gross" pancakes. BUT, I decided to come here recently for a get together w/ some girl friends and boy am I glad I did! knowing that portions are huge, we ordered mom's french toast, bluesberry pancakes, and the chicago charlie's scrambe- all of which were muy delicioso!!! yes, after reading all the descriptions, its reeeally hard to decide what to get...some were a lil TOO much for me...so we got more of the"normal" pancakes. I loved that the bluesberry was full of blueberries- a problem is that most other places don't put too much blueberries but griddle cafe does not skimp! LOVE! and its topped w/ blueberry yogurt. mom's french toast- how this place got real famous- really simple and GOOD. fluffy, light and just really satisfying. I could have ordered 2 of these... the charlie scramble exceeded my expectations...i love that it had everything- sausage, onions, bell peppers, etc. AND basil. yeah- great flavor to add. and it also comes w/ garlic bread. -this was finished within 5 minutes so we ended up ordering another HAHA overall, this place is probably on my list of fav new b'fast places. yes, the lines are long..but when you're w/ good company, it goes by fast! and the portions and price are totally worth it. although i had no idea they were going to automatically add tip to parties of 5 or more..usually it's 8 or more....but anyway, really solid menu and everything is delicious!! now THAT says something!

I hurt so good, that's how much I love The Griddle. My friends tease me for being so boring because I always order the traditional "Old Fashioned" pancakes. But you can't beat the flavor of the pancake without any syrup or butter on it (my way of testing how good a restaurant's pancakes are). ÊDelicious. ÊAdding syrup and butter makes the experience more happy and scrumptious. Ê I was also surprised by how unbelievable the french press coffee is. Wow. Not something I expect from a loud, fast-paced diner. So go for the outstanding food and coffee. ÊDon't expect to have deep, meaningful conversations over a leisurely breakfast, though.

The wait time is cah-ray-zeeeeee. We came at 1:30 pm and still waited thirty minutes, at least. My friends and I shared the yellow brick road pancakes. It's sweetness to the max! ...which actually means it's too sweet and was overwhelming. Keep in mind, these pancakes are gargantuan. Smaller than the red velvet specialty, but even so, we ditched probably a fourth of the pancake we ordered....despite the fact that there were four or five of us there. Couldn't do it. The Chicago Charlie's Scramble was great! Who can do brunch without eggs, really? The staff offered helpful recommendations and was amiable, making an effort to small talk our group. Haha, I remember he affirmed our suspicions that the location Griddle occupies used to be a sushi restaurant. Parking here stanks! There are sooo many tables and you are, noticeably, only three feet away from another table, dining. The verdict? Solid brunch food, probably not worth the hassle.

If I come here starving and STILL can't eat a full plate, then we have a winner. I ordered some sort of breakfast abomination of nutter-butter-coated French Toast with a 1/4 lb of whipped cream on top, with some eggs and sausage on the side and that was insane. The eggs were scrambled perfectly, the sausage was hot and juicy, and the french toast was...on some other Êlevel of diabetic nightmares. but it was incredibly delicious. This place is frankly one of the most filling food spots in LA, and definitely one of the best breakfast places. Even if you don't order one of the 45 different pancake or french toast varieties, there are still monster omelets, and I hear there is even a lunch menu somewhere. I've tried coming here at 10am on a Tuesday and there is still a line in front of this place; THAT'S how good it is. I don't want to be redundant here, but it's definitely reached a "must-take" for out of town friends/family in my book.

Hi, I'd like to live here. Thank you. They have a HUGE menu. It's pretty ridiculous. I don't know where to begin.. how about with the pancakes I ordered... BLUESBERRY. There's 3 gigantic cakes stacked on each other with blueberries everywhere. It's topped with blueberry sour cream, but it tastes like blueberry yogurt. I definitely was loving every bite. Surprisingly, I was able to finish about half of the plate. I also did get a side of bacon, which were deliciously devoured in 2.5 minutes. - ok ok I took my time with them.. The mimosas were ok, but I did enjoy the French pressed coffee. I was lucky enough to arrive 5 minutes before the crowd got there. Servers are definitely on top of it, and are really helpful with picking out some food.

After hearing about the greatness of the Griddle Cafe, we decided to give it a try one Friday afternoon. I ordered "A Time To Love" and was amazed to see the size of this pancake. It was pretty much like PANCAKE ON STEROIDS in terms size and flavor but in the end, I only finished less than half of it--not because it was heavy but because it was WAY TOO SWEET. On a sweetness scale of 10, my pancakes were 15. The sweetness was just too overwhelming for my palette. However, I do like the Griddle's idea of creating out-of-this-world pancakes and would like to come back to try the Red Velvet pancakes (maybe I should've tried that in the first place)! But for sure, plan on splitting an order with someone. I don't see myself coming back here on a regular basis because the flavor was that intense so A-OK for me!

When I went to Hollywood from Boston the Griddle was recommended. I have never received a better food recommendation for Breakfast. I got the "Cream DE la Cream" my mouth just watered thinking about it. The flavor of the graham cracker with the cheesecake ice cream is out of this world. We went everywhere but we all knew we had to return for the french toast. My fiends got other french toast specialties and said they were great. I really didn't care as i chewed threw my Cream DE la Cream" I would do anything to find them in the Boston area, the State, Maine even!!!!!!!!! Anyone know any Establishment that makes this Magic Wonder????

Mmm, the diabeetus. Finally, M suggested a breakfast place that was NOT a diner, although I did have my reservations when it was announced we were going to "Hollywood" to eat (another one of those groan-inducing establishments?). Short story: Not so. The good thing about being an early bird is eating breakfast everyday, and not having to wait. Ordered one Tis' the Season (Original pancakes stuffed with pumpkin pie filling) and a Chicago Charlie's Scramble. The waiter was bemused. "Your first time, eh?" Me: "Yeah, why?" "You ordered 'One' Tis' the Season." Me: "Uh huh?" "You should get 'one pancake', unless you want to die." (laughs) Me: "O-okay..." Well, the thing came out and it nearly killed me in full-blown deliciousness, sweetness, and Holy-Mother-Of-Butter the portions! (Exhibit A: http://www.yelp.com/biz_É; Exhibit B: http://www.yelp.com/biz_É ). Griddle Cafe may have the exterior of a manly bar, but the inside is Willy Wonka's home away from home. Also... All-male waitstaff. Teehee cute.

I went for breakfast this morning with super high expectations and was disappointed. ÊTo be fair, I didn't try their pancakes which I believe they are known for. I will write an update once I do. Luckily we didn't have to wait and were able to sit immediately. We ordered Mom's French Toast, Gone Shrimping and a side of the Griddle potatoes. The French Toast was pretty tasty, it was sweet enough that I didn't need to put syrup on it. I'd definitely eat it again. ÊThe Gone Shrimping I ordered because I read a yelp review about it and the person raved about it. ÊI shouldn't have gone in with such high expectations because I was super disappointed. ÊI had to add salt to flavor it. I put ketchup/Tabasco on it too. ÊThe Griddle Potatoes tasted pretty good. Overall I do think there is a lot of hype to this place. But, I will go back and give it their pancakes a shot. ÊSo far, since I moved to LA a few months ago Cici's Cafe in Tarzana has been hands down the best breakfast place I've been.

I lived in LA for a little under five years while in college at USC and during that time the City of Angels provided me many excellent dining experiences. ÊMy last trip to LA, for USC's homecoming game, gave me a little taste/reminder of what my college years were like - late nights, binge drinking and The Griddle Cafe. The Griddle Cafe is a popular hangout in West Hollywood that often has a line out the door and around the block - Monday at 11am provided us with a 20 minute wait. ÊAs my stomach turned with thoughts of the previous two night's escapades my taste buds surprisingly started salivating at the smell of pancakes wafting through the open front door. ÊI would have waited any amount of time to get a taste of what was creating that smell - and I did. Ê45 minutes later we were sitting down getting our first cup of freshly pressed coffee. One of my finest memories of The Griddle Cafe in college was the greasy spoon "Chili My Soul" that they served up daily. ÊChili My Soul is not an authentic Griddle dish as they import around 10 different chilis per day from Encino. ÊThese chilis range from vegetarian to full on carnivore with a scale of spice that ranges from 1 to 10. ÊChef Randy Hoffman, owner of Chili My Soul, was often seen at The Griddle Cafe hob-nobbing with the patrons and trying to convince them to take on the Demon - his spiciest chili made with 6 of the World's hottest peppers. ÊI was distraught, to say the least, when I found out that in the past 8 years Chef Hoffman had passed away and in tribute to his life The Griddle Cafe was no longer selling chili - of any kind. ÊRest in peace Chef Hoffman - your contributions to our palate will be greatly missed. The Griddle Cafe did not skip a beat though and my mind started racing around the menu driven by my stomach's desire to get something into it. ÊAs I reviewed some of the classic pancakes like The Teacher's Pet, three buttermilk pancakes with cinnamon apples baked in, or the Yellow Brick Road, butterscotch with walnuts and carmel, I decided to try something new - three lemon raspberry stuffed pancakes. ÊExamine the picture closely as words can not describe how delicious the experience was. ÊMy friends and I also shared an egg dish called Chicago Charlie's Scramble - delicious as well. ÊThe Griddle Cafe definitely gives you bang for your buck. ÊAll three of us ate off two dishes and could not get even close to finishing them. As I stumbled out of the restaurant, stuffed to the brim, I realized how much I appreciated The Griddle Cafe staying strong and providing me access to a time machine every time I visit my alma mater. ÊIf you are ever in West Hollywood stop by and give it a try - you won't regret it! ÊNow all I need to do is figure out how to stock plates big enough to serve these pancakes on le truc!

Griddle Cafe's menu is amazing, no joke. Their food is definitely on the sweet/unhealthy side, but its nice to come here once in a while, especially when you're super hungry because their portions are huge! I had their red velvet pancake swirled with cream cheese, and I have to say that all the hype about it is well deserved! I really can't say anything else about it other than try it the next time you come here. The red velvet pancake is probably their only pancake dish that is reasonably sized. I came here with a group of friends and those who ordered the other pancake choices could only finish a third of it. Yes the portions are really that big. I also recommend the "Banana nana" and "Eyes Wide Open", a coffee flavored pancake. A lot of their choices are way too sweet/heavy/filling though, like the Apple Cobbler French Toast and Yellow Brick Road. The sweetness is almost sickly... Also, I came here with a group of 10 people, and they sat us in a strange, dim room in the back. So try to come here with 4 or less people!

I absolutely LOVE breakfast food, and Griddle seems to pander to my every craving. Ê I have now been twice and have had each the red velvet pancake and the "peanut bubba" french toast, and I am in love. ÊThe portions are quite huge, so be prepared to take something home. Ê They do serve more than breakfast, such as sandwiches...but I haven't tried those yet. Ê Average item is maybe 9-12 dollars, so can be a bit pricy for breakfast food. Ê There is always a bit of a wait, but I find it to be worth it. ÊI will be back!

I finally found a great breakfast spot. I've introduced almost every family member to the greatness of The Griddle Cafe. Its a perfect place to take someone who has a sweet/salty craving. I always order the Mama's French Toast and every time, I leave this place with a smile! But beware, this is not for calorie-counters - everything is made here with a tub of butter, and topped with whip cream. The place is reasonably priced and has a diner-like feel. Also be prepared to wait at least 30 minutes to be seated. This place is a hot spot at any time of the day. It's only open from 9am - 4pm, so don't plan on going here for dinner. If you're going here on a weekend, also be prepared to spend some time looking for street parking. Bottom line - You'll walk out a couple of pounds heavier, but I say, unbuckle those jeans and get ready for a tasty breakfast feast.

Almighty Red Velvet Pancake HEAVEN! Holy shitzu! This is a must try once in your life, decadent, magnificent, greedy but oh-so-good pancake. Share it with a lover, a friend, your dog (kidding), because it is H-U-G-E! And yes, it tastes as good as it looks! Their other breakfast food is awesome too. These guys don't mess around when it comes to generous portions. There can be a bit of a wait (you'll understand why if you wait) but the staff are great guys who are very accommodating! Doesn't disappoint! There's usually a game of sports on their multiple large screen TVs and the noise level is very chatty and loud. Tip: Parking lot entrance is on the west hand side of Fairfax in the Southband lane farthest to the right. It's just south of Sunset Blvd in the same parking lot as Rite Aid. :)

I don't know why, but every time I go to The Griddle, which is once a week, there's always this actor sitting in the corner. You know that tiny little white haired guy who played the newspaper editor in "The Help" who gives Emma Stone her first job with the funny voice. He is always at The Griddle! You know that look you do when you live in LA and spot someone quasi-famous, kinda a sideways glance like you don't care and are looking off into the distance. Hey, what's that spot on the wall right behind that actor from "The Help" who is reading his newspaper? If it's good enough for that guy from "The Help" it's good enough for me. I like the Kicking and Screaming Tacos with the chipotle cream sauce. Just awesome!

Overrated. Got the nutella french toast and the poached y papas benedict. The nutella french toast I felt like could've just gotten french toast from Denny's and slap on nutella. The poached y papas benedict had waaaaaay too much hollandaise sauce that it overpowered the dish. However all the stuff in their menu is very mediocre and the hype is just that it's "so LA" ie: huge pancakes that you can't finish. I wouldn't wait here just to eat breakfast. I'd rather go to BLD. Got here around 9:30am and just missed the breakfast crowd. The waiters were also typical LA...super super casual.

Holy eff. ÊThis here's freaking fantastical French toast!!! ÊThick, rich, sweet, fluffy... totally bad for you. ÊTotally amazing. I think my blood type is now syrup. ÊOr butter positive. Ê Go to The Griddle, expect to eat a meal like it's your last (it may actually be) and stay away from anything with beans in it, for obvious reasons, AND because their refried beans are a bitch slap to just about any Latin country. ÊDry and overcooked, not just re-fried. My hubs had the breakfast burrito (Caballero, $12) which was ok but he shouldn't have ADDED beans. I triumphed with my selection of Mom's French Toast ($11). ÊProbably the best french toast I've had! Coffee is served in an individual French Press... and it's much better that way. Ê Service was quick and diner-esque. Parking is in the neighboring Rite Aid lot and The Griddle validates!

I mean really, is this red velvet pancake not the most delicious thing you've ever had in your life. Perhaps you were like me, wandering around life thinking that red velvet was best in cupcake, perhaps cake form. Alas, you are so utterly wrong. The soft airy fluffiness of the red velvet pancake will leave your mouth in heaven while your waist line bulges. Very busy, try to get in early in the morning but oh so so worth it. An LA institution, you must try these pancakes once in your life.

Hovering around 2000 yelp reviews, there is very little that hasn't been said about the griddle, but I think I've actually got something fresh to add... and some other comments. Many items on their breakfast menu, while delicious, are probably going to give you (get ready to channel Wilford Brimley) the diabetes if consumed regularly. The caballero, which is advertised as being "HUGE!" is actually smaller than a chipotle sized burrito and (in my estimation) slightly less caloric than the average thing on the sugar overload menu. You may get sugar overload and the diabetes, but wow... their sweet stuff is really fantastic. And now, I present to you, something that has not been mentioned! You cannot buy a T-shirt on Monday. It seems the key wielding manager is not there on Mondays and the general public's collective desire to advertise the restaurant on their chests simply goes unsatisfied. The shirts are also $25 when available... which this kind of steep. Excuse me, it's now time for my insulin shot.

I hate pancakes. THERE-- I said it. I know hate is a strong word, but I sincerely cannot eat pancakes even if it means the death of me. Griddles have turned me into a believer. This star-studded brunch place didn't really seem like it would be worth it during our endeavor here. Ê - Absolutely no parking Ê - Long lines that wrapped around the building Ê - People cutting and bypassing the oh-so-solid hostess' list Ê - Waitress gave our table away to someone that responded to our name further up front. (GAHH) I swear, I have never been so close to stabbing anyone in my whole life! Upon seating, we were being pushed off by people because Laker's Rick Fox was IN THE BUILDING and so was the girl from Buffy the Vampire Slayer. No biggie, whatever. I didn't make a big deal. I just wanted my goddamn breakfast after what seems like I was descending into the 7 (is it 7?) layers of hell!! We ordered some normal breakfast items: eggs, bacon, sausages, potatoes. All was fine, well, and deliciously decent. Then comes the PANCAKES. We opted to get only one order of pancakes for 6-7 people. In my mind, I told myself "That is not enough for 4-5 burly guys plus 2 females, but then again, I probably won't eat the pancakes so..." Literally, the pancakes were wider than my head, that includes height. It was sooo... FLUFFY DELICIOUS MOUTH WATERING SAVORY FLAVORFUL I literally had tears coming out of my eyes... oh the beauty! We ordered the Cookies and Cream Pancake and it was topped off with some sort of cookies and cream whipped cream thing that made everything even more delicious. I have dreams of heading back to LA to fight the crowd and get some pancakes again.

ÊWe ordered Some Like It Hot which was a huge plate of scrambled eggs, cheese, chorizo, topped with fresh pico de gallo, avocado and a chipotle cream sauce. ÊIt was wonderful. ÊIt came with either tortilla chips or chili toast. Our other dish was a pancake dish called Scotch On The Rocks. ÊThat was buttermilk pancakes with butterscotch chips, coconut, and pecan pieces.

If you love breakfast food then this is your place to be. came here about a year ago when I first heard about the hype about their giant plate sized pancakes. Parking was a bit difficult and wait is definitely long if you come brunch time on a weekend. ÊWe ordered the golden ticket and a breakfast omelette, 1 order of the pancake can feed at least 4, deliciously satisfying, YES! But at the end of the meal, the boy and I were fighting for the omelette just to have something salty to balance out the sweetness. Overall I think the food is just average, service is good but can be a bit slow. But if you love pancakes, you got to try griddle cafe at least once.

I've been trying to go to this place for years and finally did but not for breakfast :( (that's what they are known for). I already had my breakfast that day and ended up coming here randomly. I love my breakfast but having 2 in one day would be a bit much. Anyways, I got the grilled chicken breast sandwich called "Mama Mia". This thing has roasted peppers, mozzarella cheese, and garlic-sauteed tomato for $10.95. The BIG sandwich also comes with fries. The sandwich Êwas amazing and made me smile. It was soooooo juicy that it made my special sandwich bun moist. That was the only downfall, a moist sandwich. I can't wait to come back here for some breakfast action. Who's down to come with?

Nothing says brunch like a steaming pile of flapjacks (I love the word "flapjack." it makes me giggle... flapjack... heehee). I know few people who can resist the call of those light, fluffy, browned discs of joy, particularly hungover at 11am on a Sunday. And let's be honest, it is classic starving artist food - cheap, filling, and just as easily acquired at 2am as 2pm on any given day. But not just any pancakes will do. Oh no. I take my pancakes seriously. Since I can make killer pancakes at home, if I'm going to go out and spend money on someone else's, they better be so good that I would slap a baby to get them. Before I will consider ordering pancakes at a restaurant, there are three things I look for: 1) whipped butter, 2) real maple syrup, 3) creative pancake options. So far I have discovered one place in Los Angeles that meets all three of my criteria and that is the Griddle Cafe on Fairfax and Sunset. All of their pancakes are plate-sized monstrosities. They are most famous for their Red Velvet variety, topped with a cream cheese frosting swirl. Divine. I'm a big fan of "Sow Your Oats", which are oatmeal, honey, and cinnamon. Hearty and delicious - totally my thing. I've also sampled "Yellow Brick Road" - butterscotch, caramel, and walnuts. Sinfully rich. And guess what: at every single table there is a bottle of pure Vermont maple syrup. Clearly they are trying to get into my pants. The best part? The pancakes are all under $10. Sow Your Oats was $7.95 for a stack of three - THREE plate sized pancakes. I ate maybe a quarter of the plate and took the rest home for two more meals. Starving artist heaven. Though I confess I'm perplexed as to why they only give you one Red Velvet pancake while all other varieties come in a stack of 3 with no difference in price... odd... While we all love weekend brunch, you're guaranteed to wait at least 45 minutes on any Saturday or Sunday. Madhouse. Totally worth it, of course, but if you can swing it, I would recommend a weekday after 10am. Same great food, but much more chill. Whenever you decide to go, you are guaranteed a phenomenal pancake experience.

The food was really good, not overly sweet like most breakfast places. Wait wasn't too bad, we went around 10a on a Sunday. We had a celebrity sighting! The lead from LMFAO was there. He had a salad of some kind. I had the apple cobbler french toast with turkey sausage. It was delightfully done with a good meld of all the flavors. The turkey seemed less fatty which was unfortunate because I was expecting something a bit more sausage-like. Also the fried banana on top was actually a pad of butter which I got a mouthful of. It was somewhat off-putting for the rest of the meal but it was still delicious. (o: I have to say though, I'm not.. *accusing* them of anything, but I'm just saying that it doesn't seem like their system of seating and feeding is entirely.. 'orderly'. I don't know what order they are going in but I'll just say some people were seated before others and some people were definitely served before others. Maybe they were famous and I didn't know, but yeah. ...

Okay first of all the place was absolutely packed! Our wait was "short in comparison to other people cause we knew the manager...even then it was about 30 minutes. ÊPortions are HUGE which is always a plus but it not like they are cheap so I guess you paying for the size. A dish with two giant pancakes was on average $12 which is a little pricey considering how cheap the cost of pancakes is. Also one egg was like $7 or 2 for $9. So everything is ala carte but definitely worth it. The pancakes are pretty good. My favorite thing was the red velvet pancakes...they were so good and the cream cheese frosting was delicious. The banana pancakes were also very very tasty. I enjoyed the hash browns too. However, some of my joy went away when I walked into the bathroom. It was dirty, unattended and plain old. For such a successful restaurant I expect better restrooms. Even Denny's restrooms are better! To me it is a big deal not just for the obvious reasons but also because it reflects on the staff and overall cleanliness of the place or how much its owners/managers care about customers safety. Honestly it was a turn off for me...I hope the kitchen isn't near the conditions of their restrooms. Because of this I am generously giving them only 3 stars.

ÊThe guy running the line is SUPER efficient and makes sure no one cuts in line. ÊHe gets people in and out in a very timely manner. I had been studying the menu while waiting outside and had my eye on the Bluesberry Pancakes. ÊA friend told me that I had to get an egg dish of sorts along with the potatoes. ÊSo my bestie and I decided to get two sweet dishes and one egg dish to share. The Bluesberry Pancakes came out and I just started laughing. ÊMy bestie said it best "the pancake is bigger than your head!" ÊEven better, there were THREE of those bigger-than-my-head pancakes. ÊI tried to eat as much as possible, but I only got through about a quarter of the pancakes. ÊOne thing I did NOT enjoy was the sour blueberry yogurt thingy they put on top. ÊI just scooped it all off and put it onto another plate cuz it was messing with my taste buds. I didn't even get a chance to try the eggs, bacon, or potatoes since I was so focused on trying to finish the pancakes. ÊI did, however, have those as a lunner (meal between lunch and dinner) snack. ÊThey were still really good and hit the spot. ÊI also tried to save some of my pancakes for later, but I know that pancakes don't really taste well reheated. ÊSo, I decided to forgo the reheating (also cuz I don't have a microwave at my new apartment) and ate cold pancakes. ÊThey were STILL freakin good. I will definitely be back to try some of the many tasty looking dishes on the menu. ÊGet there early, and park in the Rite Aid lot (right behind). ÊDon't forget to get your ticket validated.

I've been here plenty of times, and they never disappoint. ÊSadly, without Chili My Soul, they don't have the rotating chili selections. ÊBut they still have the best breakfast and lunch around. ÊGo early, since they close in the afternoon. The breakfast here centers around pancakes. ÊA whole page of unique pancakes. ÊThey're thick like the Pantry, so you will be full and in a carb coma at the halfway point of a single pancake. ÊI go for the scrambles, particularly the Chicago Scramble. ÊBut again, go for anything breakfast. ÊNothing dull... except the Griddle Waffle, which is really good! ÊAnd definitely try one of their microroasted coffees, which come in a french press. The burgers are not up to par with the new LA burger bars, so I recommend you walk across the street to the Counter if that's what you're looking for. ÊI used to get the chili burger, but again, no crazy chili selections, so not an option anymore. As for the non-burger sandwiches, these are freaking amazing. ÊI really like the shrimp pesto sandwich; the bread is a little thick, but it soaks up the pesto sauce and keeps all the good stuff in. ÊI like the salad with onions and blue cheese dressing, much better than their steak fries. ÊI will say the seasoning salt is good, I just don't like the fries' texture. You can park in back of the Rite Aid, no problem. ÊBeats Sunset parking. It's small and cramped, so expect a wait outside for groups bigger than, well, two. ÊThey have a couple of big tables in the back, which we take when we have big groups and kids with us.

We waited over an hour in line. I know this isn't something they can really control, but maybe they can invest in some kind of system where you put your name and number down and leave and come back later?? The 5 of us ordered an egg dish each for brunch AND three sweet things to share: red velvet pancake, pumpkin pancake, and the Nutella french toast. I got the Tequila Sunrise egg dish and wasn't very happy with it. It had way too much sauce and WAY too much cheese. I knew I was going to be full after eating here, but I would rather be full from pancakes than a blanket of melted cheese, so I didn't eat any of the cheese. After eating the eggs and what I could find of the beans in there, I was ready to move on to the pancakes and french toast. The pumpkin pancake was good, the red velvet was really good, but the Nutella french toast was amaaaaaaaaaaazing. I could eat that thing for the rest of what would probably be my shortened life. The waiters were nice eye candy too while we waited for our food. :)

The Griddle Cafe is a tad overrated. ÊJust a tad tho. ÊThe food is pretty awesome, and you definitely get what you pay for! ÊThe wait gets insanely long during brunch time on the weekends, so I would avoid it (unless you have 3 hours to kill). ÊI went today (thurs) around 11am, and only waited 15 min. Ênice! ÊPark in the shared lot with Rite Aid around the corner, can't beat FREE LA parking! My favorite pancake is 'Tis the season. ÊThe chilled pumpkin pie filling & whipped cream tastes like heaven on the warm fluffy pancakes. ÊA lot of their other pancakes are just overkill. ÊWhen it comes to pancakes, the simpler the better. ÊCan't go wrong with the banana or the blueberry one either. Ê Everything on the menu is pretty good I'd say, maybe not the best in LA, but can't beat it for the price!

Since my first visit a few weeks ago, one thing comes to mind every time I drive by: the gluttony. I ordered the blueberry pancakes, and I think it's fair to say that the mountain of pancakes that came back--I would guess at least a pound--is grossly excessive. I don't think I finished a quarter of my plate. One serving could probably feed three to four people comfortably. Of course it's embarrassing to send back three-quarters of your food when you're gut-bustingly full, so I took the leftovers home and promptly dumped them in the trash. Who the hell eats leftover pancakes? And am I going to eat them for my next three meals? *** self-righteous rant (abbrev.) *** We have an obesity epidemic and Starvin' Marvin at the buffet with Cartman. What's up with the megaportions? Eating here is like driving a Hummer. *** end of rant *** The second thing that comes to mind is the filth. Diner counters are not always pretty, but this one was gross. The floor was filthy looking, too. It looks like they don't clean up if something is dropped on the floor during service. I know this stuff can be kept clean because I've eaten at very busy diners that do just that. If this is how the eating area looks, I doubt the kitchen is any cleaner. Other thoughts: 1. Service was slow and rude. Don't joke about how much food I didn't eat. It just makes me feel like more of a sh*thead for wasting so much. 2. It's very loud. I could barely hear my neighbors at the counter. There are better ways to convert dollars to breakfast. My fave is Square One in Los Feliz. Very awesome service, very high-quality food. CaCao Mexicatessen in Eagle Rock is another winner. Their blue corn pancakes are amazing.

2 words Breakfast Overdose * Enormous pancakes, best to share with your partner and order an omelete as well, because the pancake alone is too much sugar for one meal. Pretty crowded on weekend morning, expect to wait about an hour or more if you have a party of 4 or bigger. I always get lucky im seated within 20 minutes since we're only 2.

Holy Griddle!!! Ê Ok, this place is FAR and if you don't live anywhere near the sunset/hollywood area, you'll have to fight through congested traffic to get here. ÊI had no idea exactly where it was located and figured it'd be better to try this place on a weekday. ÊWhen I got there, the parking was shared by RiteAid. Ê Note: ÊFree parking up to 3 hours with validation stamps. ÊIf you're parked for over an hour, ask for additional stamps from the restaurant to get your free parking. Ê1 stamp=1 hour Ê 2 stamps=2 hour Ê3 stamps=3 hour Good thing we didn't have to wait before getting seated. ÊGranted, it was busy busy busy and packed! ÊThe servers are extra cool and customer service is top notch! Ê ÊYep, I see why this place is so well known to many LA residents! ÊWord got out about their food!! We ordered the French Toast, Waffles and Cobb Omelette. ÊAlso got the French press after reading a whole paragraph about their coffee. ÊMust be special! French toast and Waffles were covered in powdered sugar. ÊNothing fancy....literally it was HOT off the Griddle!!! Êlol ÊHUGE portions so be aware! Ê They also give you a slab of butter that can clog your arteries after finishing your meal. Ê This is not for yoga addicted pilates craving gluten free vegan fanatics! ÊIf you are on a diet, don't come here. ÊEach plate is like 100000 calories! ÊYou will probably gain a pound or two from all the starch, butter, sugar that's generously put into their dishes. So why is it so good? ÊBecause it's so BAD for you that makes it taste oh so yummmy! Ê I really shouldn't be eating this kind of food but after hearing so many great things about their pancakes, waffles and french toast, I just HAD to try it! ÊGood thing I did because I'll be coming back here when I get a craving for some 100000 calorie french toast! Ê BTW, get the French toast. ÊIt was much better than the waffles. ÊThe omelette was ok. Nothing too special. ÊAgain, five stars to their FRENCH TOAST! ÊServed all day!!! Ê Good coffee that's big enough to share with two people!

This place is pancake and french toast heaven! Decided to check out this place with a few friends for the first time and this place did not disappoint! Everything we ordered was delicious! My favorite was the creme de la creme french toast, the bread itself is crusted with graham crackers which gave it that extra crunch when you have your first bite. Then there's the creamy cheesecake topping that just puts this dish over the top! It's definitely a must try for all you cheesecake lovers out there. A useful tip to those who are planning to try this place is to definitely share with someone because their portions are HUGE! This is definitely a good brunch place to come with friends!

If you go on a busy day like saturday brunch time, you will suffer LONG wait.. 5 of us went around 10am on a saturday and had to wait about 40 Êminutes to sit down. However, the food didn't disppoint us. Good food, HUGE portions. All of their dishes are pretty good, and if you don't know what to get, ask the waiter and he'll tell you what are the more popular dishes. You can trust him on it :) The food isn't very delicately displayed on the dish and the ambience is blehh compared to Blue Jam Cafe or Bungalow, but if you and a group of friends are just hungry for some GOOD breakfast food, Griddles is the perfect place! The place gets pretty loud and unsettling, so we didn't stay too long. Tips: - come with more than 2 people, since the portions are HUGE - If you wanted to have a chill brunch and talk, this is not the place to be - parking sucks. try to get street parking in the residential areas. even so, watch out, because some might need permits.

Boy ... am I hungry. ÊIt's been weeks since our last post, mainly because we don't love you anymore. ÊIt's not us, it's you. ÊYou got Ê... ya know ... clingy. Wow ... I was totally just joshing you. ÊYou should have seen the look on your face ... you were all like ... crying and everything. ÊOkay, this is getting as weird for me as it must be for you. ÊBut seriously, you miss me? ÊYou hungry? ÊYou ready for the return of the GRUB? ÊWell too bad ... because here she comes ... And what better way to make a comeback than a two time suggested GRUB spot? ... The Griddle Cafe. ÊOur Grub-buddy John B., of Good Grub fame the likes of Prizzi's and The Oaks Gourmet, was the original GRUB-suggestor ... but it was our other Grub-mate Alexis S. who demanded that we hit it up ... now. ÊAnd who are we to withhold deliciousness from the masses? ÊSo we put on our Grub face and set sail for Sunset Blvd. A good sign for any great eatery ... line is out the door. ÊCheck. ÊThere's a guy free styling with a boom box for tips ... um, check? ÊThere are giant pancakes the size of a small kiddy pool ... triple CHECK! ÊLet's take a moment to revel in the miracle that is the pancake. ÊFor starters ... it's a freaking cake. Second off, unlike a traditional cake, people don't look at your funny when you order it breakfast. ÊWe went for the Golden Brick Road ... lions, and tigers, and butterscotch ... oh yeah. ÊSpilling over the edges of a giant plate, these bad boys are dangerous. ÊLoaded up with caramel, butterscotch, and walnuts ... it's impossible not to freak out (see picture below) while eating these fluffy, decadent circles of joy. If pancakes weren't enough ... we also tossed in some "Peanut Bubba" Crunchy French Toast and "Kicking and Screaming" Breakfast Tacos. ÊSorry, did we just lose you ... yes, "Peanut Bubba" Crunchy French Toast ... let the little kid inside of you completely lose your mind and dig into these Nutter Butter dipped slices of glory. ÊTake that Frenchie! ÊU.S.A ... U.S.A ... U.S.A! ÊBut we couldn't let this glutinous feast end there, so we also dived into the aforementioned "Kicking and Screaming" Breakfast Tacos. ÊForget the breakfast burrito ... it's taco's time to dominate the morning. ÊLoaded onto some seriously tasty, fresh, warm tortillas goes a medley of eggs, pico de gallo, and avocado. I don't know if it was the sugar high we were on from the rest of our meal, but I could have just gone on eating ... and eating ... and eating. ÊOkay, I'm still there right now ... tell my family I'll miss them. ÊBut seriously, this place was something else. ÊSo hit up the Griddle Cafe ... but be warned ... as the tears stream down your cheeks as you microwave a bowl of oatmeal ... breakfast will never be the same.

There are three rules you must know when you visit the Griddle (according to the host): 1. Parties of two on one side of the side walk, parties of 3+ lined up on the other. 2. The waiters make their livings off of tips. Adjust your bill accordingly. 3. The host is single! The wait for breakfast was crazy, but the ridiculously large banana pancake that was plopped in front of me 45 minutes later made it worth the wait. Warm and cooked to perfection, this place makes a killer pancake. And be sure to come hungry, this portion size is a gut buster for sure! Funny, my favorite part of the Griddle wasn't the pancakes, but their coffee selection. When ordering, you are offered a choice of three roasts. And to top it off, your coffee comes in your own personal coffee press! As busy as it was, this was a special touch that I - and any other coffee snob - can really appreciate. Though the wait was long, I'll probably be back when I'm jonesin' for something beyond a Denny's short stack. This place really does make a good pancake.

I would have given a better rating perhaps, but I wasn't in a good mood the day I went to Griddle Cafe. I had just gone to the Rite Aid down the block to renew a prescription, and I found out my health insurance had lapsed. The pharmacist said I had to pay full price for my meds ($412!!) but I needed them so I had to fork up the money. I try to pay with my debit card, then my credit card, but both are denied. I had no clue why because I had money on both. Then as I'm leaving, I get a call from Bank of America fraud department saying that they saw unusual activity on my account so they blocked my card. I asked what the activity was and they said someone tried to buy something at Ride Aid for $412. No DUH! That was me! So I sort that out then go back to the pharmacy (I have to wait in line again!) and pay for my meds. When I left I was hungry so I went to Griddle Cafe down the block where the service was excellent and the food was amazing.

As soon as I landed in LA, I was whisked away to the Griddle Cafe for breakfast and mimosas. My friend had heard that they have the best mimosas in LA. Someone had misinformed him. There was a short wait, which was interesting given that it was Wednesday morning at 10am. We were seated in a booth and given their massive menus. I chose banana pancakes and my friend ordered the omelet. Our mimosas came first and they were just horrible. I would skip them if I were you. Our food came out and I was too busy chatting it up with my friend to notice the ginormous plates of food being served all around me. I am not a fan of ordering and paying for an amount of food that you cannot possibly eat in one sitting. And this happens to be the case at Griddle Cafe. I felt defeated as soon as the pancakes came into view. I was super annoyed when I had about three bites and was full. The pancakes were good and the omelet was better, but I hate that there was so much food left over on both of our plates. I kept hearing my grandmother in the back of my head saying "Eat your food, girl! Don't you know children in Africa are starving?" It seems like an absolute waste and it seemed a bit gimmicky to serve that much food. This inside is quaint and a bit grimey, but this is the look they are going for. I recall fans, I am not sure if they had air or not. That would make a big difference for me in the summer. Our bill was $80 + dollars for two people! Not a good look for breakfast food and a couple of mimosas. I would go again, but I would make sure that they served me portions I could eat and I would not pay.

It has taken me so long to write this review because every time I look at it I become reminded of the rude service and how unbelievably angry I was. There needs to be more 1 star reviews. I don't know how they receive anything more than 2 stars. I have never been so angry before. The manager needs an attitude adjustment. I waited over an hour to get seated. I'm completely fine with that, heck I expected it, but I did not expect to be treated so poorly. I was on the list for a table of 5, the server called us in and asked, "Where's your fifth?" Me: "She's coming. She just went to the riteaid to use the restroom. She'll be right back". Then he said, "If you're lying I'm kicking you guys out." I was soooo surprised and pissed off at the same time. I just told him calmly, "Dont worry. She'll be here. Shes just around the corner." He then said okay follow me. Then he literally took off without waiting for us. Dude, its my first time here. I dont know where the heck he went. I went into a corridor and i was completely lost. There were several doors, I had to guess where he was. Seriously now. I understand that its incredibly busy but there was no need to walk off and loose your customers!! Third strike: He rushed us into taking our orders. Four of us already put in our order and the fifth was still deciding. So i asked him if he could come back. He said, "No, you need to give me all your orders now or I wont put it in. Its all going together and im closing the check. So order whatever you need to order, order it now." Woow. Really?? Someone really needs to teach this man some manners. My poor friend felt so rushed and pressured to order she just picked anything from the menu!!! She ended up changing her order but told another person because she didn't want to deal with our server. Our food came in a timely manner and our bill came quicker than we expected. Our waiter came in twice to asked us if the check was ready. Each time we said no because we were obviously still eating. The third time he came in and asked for the check he also gave us "a heads up" that there was a party of 15 waiting for our room. We finally decide to put down our forks and check out the bill. 20% gratuity added to the bill for a table of 5?!?! Really? I honestly seen restaurants with a 20% gratuity maybe 3 times in my life, but not NOT for a table for FIVE? My friends and I have don't have any qualms paying a steep tip IF the service was really good. In this case, it was really far far faaar below average. We asked someone to get the manager so we can lower the gratuity because we felt their service and our waiter's attitude did not deserve such a large tip. And of course, our waiter comes in, with a smirk and said, "I heard you guys wanted to talk to the manager. Here I am." Let's just say we got into an argument with him. Even after we told him our story about the way he treated us. He tell us this is a business and its very fast paced. So things have to be rushed. My friend told him that he himself has worked in this business for several years and understands how stressful it can be, BUUT that does not warrant the servers or managers to be so rude to the customers and rush them through their meal. At the end of the argument. The manager still refused to see anything wrong with the way he treated us and refused to take off the gratuity. He said its already on the bill and you have to pay it. All in all. The owner needs to fire the manager. He's hotheaded and rude. They have way too many patrons than they deserve. And apparently this warrants them to be *beeping beeps.

I came with 3 friends a few months ago and we shared 4 items despite the ginormous portions because it was so hard for us to narrow down our options. Everything just sounded so good! We got: 1) Poached Y Papas Benedict. The whole thing was kinda soggy and bleh but I really liked the potato skins in this dish! Those potato skins = redemption. 2) Gone Shrimping - eggs scrambled with shrimp, basil pesto, scallions, tomatoes, capers. We all enjoyed this dish. But I didn't think it was anything amazing. 3) Barry Yellow - Raspberry & Lemon Pancakes. My roommates are huuuge berry fans and love tart fruits so they loved this dish. I, on the other hand have more of a sweet tooth and I don't like pancakes so I didn't think this was that great. 4) Nutella stuffed french toast - my favorite!! If you're a nutella fan, you will love this! Overall, a great breakfast place with HUGE portions so you definitely get your money's worth! Park in the back where the Rite Aid is.

Pancakes as big as your body? Yes, please! And they're really good too! The default order is a stack of 3, but you can also order individual ones. I wish I had known that before I ordered because I was only able to eat a small fraction of the mound of pancakes on my plate. That said, I took them home where they were devoured by my appreciative family. I got the Teacher's Pet which is apples and spices, and was really yummy. But my friend got the Fall special pumpkin ones that were to die for. It seems that they do a bunch of seasonal variations on top of their extensive regular menu. While we had our hearts set on pancakes, our server suggested the french toast as the best thing on the menu. I guess we'll just have to come by and try them another time. The line can be daunting, but it moves relatively quickly. Be prepared to wait 45 minutes, easily. It is worth it.

"Poached y Papas" Benedict is simply amazing here and one of THE BEST.

ÊI was blown away and when I come back, this will definitely be an option. Ê I was here on a Sunday afternoon and there was line and the wait took a good 30 minutes but it seemed a lot shorter.

Hubba hubba Bubba! Lying in our hotel bed with only a slight hangover, I began to peruse Yelp for a breakfast spot within proximity. It only took a second to decide on the Griddle Caf. I mean, really! At almost 2,000 reviews on Yelp - Angelenos dig it, therefore I'm thinking we will, too. I inform the BF as we're nearing checkout time that there might be a wait and he says 'Oh yeah,' already familiar with the place and knowing the line can wrap around the building. Ê We arrive and pull into the Rite Aid parking lot, which has validated parking if you are eating at Griddle Caf and proceeded to walk on up and wait. Oh yes, there are lines alright. There's a shot caller for said lines walking around with a notebook that will take your name and number of peeps in your party. Important! Get on the list or you could end up waiting even longer. There are three separate lines. One for parties of 5 or more, one for parties of 3-4, and one for solo diners and parties of Êtwo, definitely the easiest and shortest way to a full belly is choosing to dine with no more than one or two pals. We ended up waiting a little longer than the 20 minutes initially suggested by the shot caller but it was a busy Sunday and close to noon and oh man, we were eyeing dishes as they made their way outside, served to patrons dining on the "patio" area. (I say patio with emphasis because it isn't really one but there are several tables set up outside on the sidewalk.) Our name called, we make our way inside to a table built for two and immediately order coffee. French press. Ahhhh... I love the way coffee tastes when steeped in a press. And it better be - damn near $4 a person for coffee is a little STEEP, in itself. Having read several reviews and checked out posted pics on Yelp, I knew I wanted to order the "Peanut Bubba" Crunchy French Toast - French toast dipped in a peanut butter crunch, grilled and then topped with powdered sugar and whipped cream. WHAT???!! I also knew that I needed something non-sweet to palate cleanse between sugary bites. (Usually the only sweet I have in the morning is in the form of the sugar free sweetener I use in my coffee.) The BF agrees to split the Bubba with me and we both order eggs. Him - two eggs, scrambled with a side of turkey maple sausage. Me - the Omelette "My Soul" I substitute egg whites in place of reg eggs and order it with shrimp. It also comes Êstuffed with green chiles & jack cheese, topped with sour cream, fresh avocado, and salsa. We both order hashbrowns and toast. The Bubba arrives first. Of course it does. Oh my GOD. It's huge. And so delicious that I AM SALIVATING RIGHT NOW, writing a review about a meal I had yesterday! We both have a bite. Sweet, crunchy, sweet mother of GOD!! -it's good. I had to put my fork down and down the glass of water in front of me. A few times. We were so immersed in coffee and French toast that when our egg plates arrived we totally forgot about our toast, which our server also totally forgot. My omelette was delicious and HUGE. Fresh ingredients, cooked perfectly and tasty! I didn't even season with pepper! (A rarity for me.) We both ended up boxing up at least half of our egg plates and if that French toast woulda survived a reheating I would have boxed up that, as well. I really dig this place. Sure, it's a little noisy and a little chaotic and you have to mentally prepare to waith in line... but I promise you! It's worth it. And seeing the burgers come off the line as we succumbed to food coma... we both agree - we are definitely coming back! For lunch!!!

Griddle Cafe reminds me of why I'm weary towards breakfast food, because honestly, who can finish a whole order of those pancakes? I tried a bite of the blueberry pancakes, which got old after a couple bites. After that you're just basically stuffing yourself with cooked pancake batter. I had the nutella french toast, which was great but way too much! It was just swimming in a puddle of chocolate and cream by the end. The BF had the scrambled egg whites, which was the only dish we could finish. Not bad, but nothing we couldn't make ourselves. I also had a bite of the chicken sandwich that was pretty good. I feel like this place is way overhyped? I feel like the main driving point of this place would be the sheer portions, but I think we can all agree that quantity is not as important as quality. I wanted to love it, but alas, it wasn't meant to be!

Did you or did you not order the pancakes as large as Texas!! You're Godamnned right I did!! In the world of breakfast there is the median and at the fringes lie the exceptions. This place sets the pace. Why else would you wait 45-60 minutes for a pancake? It's because it will change your life - mostly because it will cost you additional gym time to be sure. You've read the reviews and seen the pictures - all true. Place is very small, but the food is worth the wait. Unlike some other places with hype and no juice, is one has the juice. French pressed coffee by the cup and a wait staff that really pays attention and gets service, even though they probably don't have to. Good star sighting in this place too if you're into that kind of thing. Seriously, for all the buzz, I parked three blocks away, in the rain, downhill, and would do that and more just to get my big gnarly breakfast on again.

Simply the best location for breakfast in the Los Angeles area. Portions are great, waitstaff is fantastic and funny despite how busy the place tends to be, Êand the food is to die for. My friends and I went on a Saturday around 1:30. There was a small line and we waited about 15-20 minutes. Once we were seated and we ordered, our food arrived within 7 minutes. Perfection! We shared the red velvet pancake, the Omelette "My Soul," and the breakfast tacos. You honestly cannot go wrong with anything you order.

Great place for breakfast off sunset without the hassle of parking. You will walk out of here stuffed because the portions are so huge! And expect to have a long wait always on the weekend. All of their dishes are fabulous, as I used to live down the street from here about 3 years ago and would frequent here often... I've been happy with everything I've tried. Overall, it has a great uplifting but busy feel-- a nice way to start energizing your weekend morning or to cure that hangover.

Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day. The Griddle has the BEST French Toast I've ever had. Ask for the Secret French Toast which isn't even on the menu. I liked this place so much that out of the 7 days I was staying in LA, I ate here for Breakfast 4 times. It's simple breakfast food that isn't fancy, but definitely has some secret homemade recipes and tastes great!

The family & I stepped in only because it was conveniently located en route to our destination.... It was early in the morning, and we were in the mood for a breakfast joint so we thought we might as well.... SOOOOOO GLADDD WE DID!! We didn't have to wait at all... and based on the reviews I just read, we got lucky I guess :-D The reason we loved this place is two fold: (1) Good tasting breakfast joints are hard to find especially ones with healthier alternatives & substitutes. Ê(2) Even when you do find a good place... they're either known for the egg based food items or specilaize in pancake/french toast type stuff (like Cici's) ... ÊThis place was great with both! Here's what we ordered :) 1. Banana-nana pancakes - topped it with fresh strawberries 2. Omelette "My Soul" - with steak 3. "Baked Potato" Omelette - with jack cheese. All three tantalized our tastebuds :-p Order them! Yumm! Next time, we'll be trying the red velvet pancakes...... can't waaaaaaaiit!!!!

BEST PANCAKES IN MY LIFE! I have been here over a dozen times and I still have my griddle cravings from time to time. I will never get over this place! There is shared parking in the back w rite-aid.. You might have to wait a lil for someone to leave and its usually not too bad, even on weekends (but this is coming from an LA driver, so my standards for a good parking situation is quite low. At least they have some parking besides street right!?) Sure not the cutest atmosphere.. Its cramped and usually has a long wait (esp on weekends). but its soooo good and worth the wait! Portions are HUGE. The Golden Ticket is the way to go. I have tried to branch out on the pancakes..the oreo, chocolate chip, the banana-nana.. It is all about THE GOLDEN TICKET. It may sound too rich, all the banana butterscotchness.. It is absolute perfection. Trust. You def don't need syrup tho. Good to share w the table. You can ask for a smaller or single stack if you wish, not the same effect though. Ive taken it home and surpringly still good when reheated in small toaster oven or microwave to have alongside some chai.. yes, its THAT good. I'm gunna try the red velvet one of these days.. These reviews make it sound amazing (I doubt it'll beat TGT but we'll see..) The tequilla sunrise is my all time fav scramble there! The one with the tortilla chips is good too. They have good fries if you do lunch. The strawberry french toast is goot..Good coffee, Great mimosas (can't go wrong with a sunday pitcher!) Bon Apetit! The waiters are chill. The guy taking names up front has been there forever and somehow remembers everyone!

The golden ticket pancake was definitely my guilty pleasure, and satisfied the sweet tooth indefinitely. Very humongous pancake, three-layered with walnut, topped with whip cream. I'm personally not a fan of whip cream, but thought it wasn't too heavy and complimented the pancake very well! Yummy freshly squeezed orange juice. Only wished they added ice though. Otherwise I got my daily dose of vitamin c in! Went here around 11am on a Saturday and the wait was approximately 45-1hr! The wait didn't feel too long and the line moved rather quickly :) Great server with the SF giants hat!

if you're a lover of the sugary sweet kind of breakfast, Griddle Cafe is the perfect place for you. ÊWell known for their e-n-o-r-m-o-u-s portions of pancakes / hot cakes / flapjacks (whatever the difference is between these), their menu is packed with a variety of unique options - such as red velvet, Oreo, Bailey's + Kahlua, pumpkin pie, coconut + chocolate, and more. I came here with a group of 6 hungry girls. ÊWe decided to eat "family style" and all shared the following: (1) "Black Magic" (Oreo-filled flapjacks topped with whipped cream and Oreo cookie pieces) (2) Red Velvet panCAKE (topped with swirls of cream cheese) (3) Chocolate Chip Cookie Crusted French Toast (4) "Gone Shrimping" (Egg whites scrambled with shrimp, basil pesto, scallions, tomatoes, & capers - served with garlic bread) (5) Side of fries (6) Pitcher of Mimosa As much as I love to proclaim that I'm a hearty eater (for a girl at least), I am disappointed to report that I failed miserably on this particular morning. ÊEach plate was massive, heavy, and over-the-top filling. My absolute favorite was the "Black Magic." ÊI liked that the dough was fluffy and not too sweet. ÊTherefore, the overload of whipped cream and Oreo cookies didn't make each bite too overwhelming. ÊThe crunch from the Oreo bits also created a nice layer of texture. As for the Red Velvet - which is one of their most popular orders - it was too, too, too sugary! ÊI guess it's a unique concept, but I didn't think it was worth all the hype. ÊSame goes with the Chocolate Chip Cookie Crusted French Toast. ÊI was too sick of sugar by that point to enjoy anything after the "Black Magic." The eggs didn't even taste like anything because my mouth was still coated with cream and dough. Moral of the story is - this place is a must try but remember to order accordingly. ÊFor savory lovers out there (like me), just share 1-2 pancake orders and remember to get bacon, eggs, and your usual preferences. ÊFor sweet tooth's out there, this is your heaven.

I'd come here once in while to satisfy my sweet tooth cravings with their ginormous pancakes. A half stack (one huge slice) is enough already but since there's only a few dollars difference, we end up getting the full stack (2~3 slices), indulge as much as we can and take the rest to-go. The last time I was there, I tried the "Mounds of Pleasure" pancake, which was filled with coconut flakes and chocolate chips. The whipped cream on top was melting and oozing, making a puddle of guilt but it sure tasted good. But not for too long. I managed to kill maybe about 1/8 of the layered stack and I was KO'd. The french press coffee is a must if you're digging into the pancakes. Sips of bold and bitter definitely neutralizes the sweetness in your mouth. Ê The day after, the pancakes that we took home were consumed little by little. Since it was refrigerated, what was once melted chocolate chips were now hard and crunchy. It was almost like eating a completely different dessert, like a cake! A cold pancake isn't actually that bad... lol I've also ordered "The Griddle" Chop salad a few times and it was the biggest salad bowl I've ever had. I don't know how they do it, but they really stack up the veggies until it becomes a mountain. It doesn't start falling apart until you stick your fork in it, so it gets pretty messy. Anyways, everything here is over-sized. It's more about the quantity than quality. But I think the food is decently good and the coffee is excellent. I'm just weary about waiting in line for more than half an hour or more, pretty much every time I come here. Prompt service and eye candies are guaranteed.

My friend and I came at around 10:30 on a Sunday, and expected the line to be massive. It wasn't too bad and we got seated in about 15-20 minutes. Ê Servers were quick, prompt and friendly. Red Velvet Pancake was delicious! A tad too sweet, but there's a reason why it's called the Red Velvet Pancake, right? My friend ordered the Good 'ol Fashioned pancake, and holy moly! We didn't expect for it to be so big! It was a stack of 3 pancakes, while the Red Velvet was only 1. Both orders of pancakes were delicious! I will definitely be coming here whenever I'm in the LA area.

YUM!!!!!!!!!! I went at about 10am on Sunday with a friend of mine. I got their signature red velvet pancakes, with a side of potatoes and eggs. my friend got the waffles with bacon. I posted a pic of the red velvet. let me just say - OH EM GEE!!!! they were so moist and sweet and creamy and deliciousness!! im glad i got the side of potatoes and eggs because the salty/savory helped to the cut the sugar onslaught. the wait was not very long and although the guy at the front could not get my name right at all, he was super cool about making sure everyone was being sat and also very fair. service was cool (we got to sit at the bar) and price was decent. for the red velvet, side of potatoes and eggs, waffles and bacon it was $30.

Have you seen the size of their pancakes? HUGE. Delicious. Share with someone. I'm usually a savory breakfast kind of gal, but we got one savory dish and one pancake dish to split because you cannot pass up the pancakes at a place called the Griddle Cafe. Big, fluffy, delicious. Coffee and chocolate, butter, powdered sugar. So So So good. Too much food, though. They bring you coffee in your own individual french press. You have a choice of how bold you want your coffee. There are an insane number of people that go here on weekends for brunch. There is a line, but if you can get in at the counter it's faster and it's totally worth it.

If you're looking for good food, awesome portions, variety, great service, a unique experience, this is the place to go! Ê I went there on a Sunday morning with girlfriends and we all had such a blast. ÊOur server was super friendly n' funny, and despite the packed place, we were treated kindly and taken care of. I had the red velvet pancakes ... it's 1 huge pancake for $8.95 and well worth it. ÊThe bread was light, fluffy and not so sweet, and it's then topped with a sweet cream cheese frosting. ÊWhen put together it's the perfect combination. ÊI wasn't able to eat the whole thing, but it was good to know I'd have leftovers to take home. A helpful tip that I got from another review was to park behind the Rite Aid and get the ticket validated; that way didn't have to figure out street parking or pay in the meters. Ê This was definitely a great experience that I won't forget.

Hands down the best breakfast I have ever eaten in my entire life. Yes, there's usually an hour or so wait, especially on the weekends but it is beyond worth the wait . When I came here I ordered the "A Time To Love" pancakes which are pancakes filled with streusel, butterscotch chips, drizzled with caramel on top, topped with a huge mound of freshly made whipped creme, and pumpkin pie filling on top of that. I am a lover of all things pumpkin and holiday like and the butterscotch chips, caramel and streusel were all added bonuses. They give you three ginormous pancakes, stacked one on top of the other and it takes up the entire plate. I came here starving around 1:00pm on a Sunday, this was the first thing I had eaten all day and I didn't even finish a third of my plate. The pancakes were beyond amazing. Words can't even describe how delicious the "A Time To Love" pancakes here are. Like literally, this was the best breakfast I have ever had in my life. My friend order "The Golden Ticket" stack of pancakes which are "Banana Nana" pancakes filled with caramel, streusel, and walnuts. I am also a big fan of banana bread and these pancakes tasted just like my mom's banana bread, but better, and on crack. ÊThey were amazing... just not as amazing as my "A Time To Love" pancakes which in my book are above all other things breakfast. We also ordered A Coconut Choco-Latte which was pretty good.. a chocolate coconut flavored latte topped with whipped creme, chocolate frizzle, and coconut flakes. If you're looking for the best breakfast in LA, look no further than The Griddle. My best suggestion is to share an order, even if you're starving. I took mine and my friend's left over pancakes home, knew I would never finish eating them before they went bad so kept 2 meal portions worth in the fridge and froze the rest and I kid you not, I had left over pancakes for 3 months. To reheat them, I defrosted them and heated them in the toaster oven and they still tasted amazing. A++ for The Griddle!!

I went during a very long wait. The wait was on the sidewalk with nowhere to sit... It isn't very spacious inside, so it's not good for groups. Recommended 2 ppl. It also gets pretty loud so its hard to hear others. Also, we were told that the servers ran on tip only (no wage?), so tip well or feel bad... Pancakes are HUGE; you pay for what you get though. ÊOther breakfast food isn't any different than other places like IHOPs and such, so its not too special. A disappointment to me for spending a lot on something I can make, or get at a cheaper price. The jumbo pancakes were ok though. Overall pretty pricy. If I somehow magically ate here again, I would just get pancakes if I feel like spending some money. Parking is in the back behind CVS, very small and you need it validated.

Love breakfast foods so I definitely had to come to Griddle! We came as a party of 3 around Sunday noon and waited in line for about 20 minutes. Line was outside and a bit confusing if you've never been there before. First, the menu is pretty extensive - which kept us thoroughly entertained while we were waiting. Mom's French Toast - heard they were pretty good and indeed they were. The portions were large and I ended up taking some home to finish later. Blueberry Pancakes - friend got this and it was pretty good. I'm usually not a big pancake fan but I enjoyed the parts I had of this. French Press Coffee - I am an avid coffee drinker and I definitely appreciated my own french press with unlimited refills! Delish. I loved the atmosphere! The servers were nice and this is a place I would bring a friend if they were visiting LA! Although next time I would probably try an egg dish since the French Toast got tiring after a while.

So if you have a sweet tooth, this place is the mecca of sweets. All the breakfast entrees are so wonderfully decadent. The french toast and pancake entrees are huge and can easily be split between 2-3 people. The wait can be long on the weekends and the place is pretty small, so it can be a tight squeeze. Overall, I love this place, and I would go here more often if I didn't care at all about my health.

this place is pretty amazing. there is a reason why they have thousands of reviews! the food was great! we ordered the black magic oreo pancakes, golden ticket pancakes, creme de la creme french toast, and an omelet. everything was great except for the omlete. it was very bland. not much taste...the only thing good on that omelet was the salsa...it had a good kick! the pancakes were exactly what i was expecting! yummy and HUGE! even though we shared, we still took most of it home! parking sucks and the wait sucks. but for such a busy place all the time, they got the long wait in a very organized fashion!

Maybe because of all the excellent reviews I came with high expectations. It was just OK. A little bit of a wait, but not to bad (it was Monday lunch time tho). Service was OK and as for the food: I had the eggs and papas benedict. I give it a 3 starts. Maybe 2.5. I like the idea of potato skins instead of english muffins, however the hollandaise sauce was pretty bad... Tasted more like pure mayo. And there was a lot of it! My bf had the french toast and it was very good... Very loud place and a lot of people standing around the tables and walking around. Not a very pleasant environment. But looking around at all the food people were having, everything looked pretty good. I would give it another shot and maybe I will get lucky with my next order!

I was telling my kids as we drove up - "I love to find the place that looks like a dive but when you walk in the food outshines the environment." That just about sums up Griddle Cafe. It opened at like 8am - and it was already packed. We ate at the bar - which was GREAT. Wait-staff was extremely friendly and easy going - never trying to rush you off. Coffee served as french press style - WITHOUT asking!!! My kind of place already. My wife and I chose the Fritata - which was odd, because I didn't know she ordered it until the food Êcame - ahhh...we were meant for each other, still...after 20 years!!! :) Kids: Red Velvet Pancake - awesome. moist, swirl icing of - was that cinnamon??? yum. French Toast - downside is that you only get 2 thick slices - the upside is that 1 slice can feed the family!!! The bread is CRAZY big and really globular - like there wasn't a pan side. On the way out we passed by the loaves of bread and it looked like they got maybe 10 orders per loaf...maybe less. FREE PARKING Quick Tip: parking in back in the Rite-Aid(?) (or was it CVS or Walgreens) either way, take the ticket, tell the attendant you are eating at Griddle Cafe - go through the back door, get your ticket validated and get there EARLY!!!

All right, after getting to know some servers who work here, I just had to try the place out. Supposedly a bunch of stars come here to get their breakfast fix every so often, so if you're lucky, you'll get to witness Rihanna or Brangelina lick sugar off their plates. But be warned, wait times can get pretty ridiculous here with lines going out the door and around the corner, but mostly just on the weekends with wait times up to 2 hours long. ETA: Friday @ 11-ish Wait time: 5-10 min (surprisingly) I had some time to kill before my photoshoot that morning, so against my typical modeling routine, I decided to EAT right before my shoot. And so I decided to see what all the hype was about at The Griddle. I arrived solo, but coincidentally, I was seated at the "bar area" with another young lady, and perhaps she's the reason why my first experience at The Griddle was so memorable. Long story short, put two personable strangers together at a friendly and lively breakfast restaurant, and you get not only two very satisfied customers, but instant Breakfast BFFs! The Service: Our server, Kristen, was very friendly and helpful throughout our whole meal. She suggested we share an order of the Red Velvet Pancake and the French Toast, not knowing that I had just met the pretty lady sitting next to me. But even after knowing each other only 10 minutes, we both felt comfortable enough to share a breakfast. After all, the portions were humungous and I was more than willing to try multiple entrees. Anyway, my review on the service may be a little biased since I know several of the servers here, and who all stopped by to check up on us and say hi. Thanks to Eric and Tony, and the several other people I met that morning. The Main Course: ÊSo I ordered the French Toast and it was delicious! Two whoppingly ginormous slices of toast drizzled with syrup, butter, and sugar. Typically, I would not have ordered such a "common" breakfast dish, but Kristen was right on the ball when she said it was one of their best dishes. And I don't even like French Toast, but it was sooooo yummy that The Griddle officially made me a fan. The perfect amount of sweetness. My lovely companion, Jill, ordered the famous Red Velvet Pancake. And OMG! The first thing I thought was, "how is this massive thing supposed to squeeze into my tummy?!" It was literally like a foot and a half in diameter. No kidding! It was like a medium sized NY style pizza of red velvety-ness with a sweet icing on top. No syrup necessary. I must say, I loved every bite of it, but it's definitely a dish you need to share with another person, or two, or three. A little over the top with the sweetness, but it was tasty and perfect as a dessert dish. I'm definitely glad that we split two entrees. The Price: About $15/entre. But the portions are HUGE! I had enough leftovers for dinner and late night meal. In fact, I don't suggest eating the entire plate in one sitting. I wouldn't doubt that each plate had lbs of sugar sitting on top of it. Diabetes on a plate, is what I like to call it. The Ambience: Crowded and loud, but it'll wake you up in the morning. And the people, even the workers, all seem to be having such a great time. Very friendly, personable, and fun! The Verdict: Not a place for people with no self control when it comes to sweets, but great for a once in awhile dine in place, only because of the mountains of sugar on every plate. But the ambience, and sugar addiction, will definitely keep you coming back for more. The Griddle must have a whole storage room dedicated to holding just the sugar they use daily in their yummylicious dishes. Or they own a sugar fairy who magically refills their sugar stash every hour or so... and she better be getting paid overtime. I suggest ordering a glass of milk with your food. But regardless, The Griddle is high on my favorite restaurant list. Have a taste, and if your server happens to be Eric or Tony, tell 'em Kristine said they're the best servers ever!

I had read a lot of good things about The Griddle Cafe here on Yelp, so I decided to give it a shot. Unfortunately, this place really disappointed me. First off, let's start with the price. A order of not so fancy pancakes (cinnamon ones), bacon and cup of coffee set me back $21 bucks! The pancakes were good, but not earth shattering. The bacon was really bad. Not very good quality, and as limp as a 70 year old man's erection (my apologies to all you virile 70+ year olds out there). It is cool that they serve real maple syrup. On the bright side, my server was very helpful with the menu selection, and was prompt, friendly and courteous. I notice that in the back of the place they have a whole wall full of Griddle merchandize for sale. Maybe the should concentrate on serving better food, and less merchandizing. I'm rarely disappointed by a place on yelp that has so many positive recommendations. I won't be returning.

I'm not sure if it was the excitement from the sheer size of my breakfast, the taste of the food, the good service, or some combination of factors, but I would return to Griddle Caf. To avoid a wait, I would come closer to opening time. The Good Ol' Fashioned Pancakes were bigger than the serving plate, wider than my waist, and topped with an ice cream sized scoop of butter. Compared to pancakes from Du-Pars and Twain's, the pancake batter tasted less cake like and a little more salty. Despite the enormous size, they were light (unlike Du-Pars) and became a little mushy and fall apart towards the hotter, center. The maple syrup wasn't as thick as molasses or as viscous as iHop syrup, but closer to the consistency of a thin soup. The syrup was rich and flavorful, and didn't glue my pancake to the plate.

So my sister has been on my back about trying this place. She knows that blu jam cafe is typically MY spot for pancakes and french toast, but she has insisted that I try the griddle for at least a year. I've attempted to go several times, but each time the wait was 40 minutes. Airik Brown waits for nothing. Immediate satisfaction is my motto. Well today, with my sister in tow, I made the trek again to the griddle. I was pleasantly surprised to see the place was half empty when we arrived at 1 this afternoon. We were seated immediately and our server was with us within 2 or 3 minutes. I ordered coffee and orange juice while looking over the menu. I eventually ordered the chocolate chip pancakes, one egg, and a side of bacon. Ok...where do I begin? I soooooo wanted to love this place. In fact, I can see why so many people have given griddle 4 and 5 stars...but not today. So they bring the coffee and orange juice, and the coffee cup is FILTHY-DIRTY. No big deal right? i didn't think so either. But it took our waiter 10 minutes to come back around for me to let him know. He politely exchanged it, but no sooner than I poured my coffee did our food arrive. For me the coffee is what I wanted to drink while waiting for food. I know some, maybe most, like to drink coffee while they eat, but that's not how I roll. That wasn't really a big deal either. There were two problems with the coffee, one which could be controlled, one which was a result of where we were sitting. Problem number one: we sat directly under the air vent, which was strong enough to blow all the napkins off our table in 1.3 seconds. The A/C immediately cooled off my coffee. I took two sips of hot coffee before my coffee was cold. Ok...we were sitting in the wrong place. Fine I'll accept that. Major problem two: there were torn off packets of sugar in my coffee. Not one, but two. Even my sister sitting across from me was like "what the hell?!" when I pulled the packets out. Not a good look! Fuck it...I still have my OJ and breakfast on deck. As you all know, the pancakes are HUGE! Great I'm starving. The chocolate chip pancakes weren't bad. They were a bit rich for my taste, but I was feeling risque. When in Rome...! I wasn't extremely satisfied with the pancakes, but I'll take partial claim for ordering shit I wouldn't normally eat. The chocolate chips make the already heavy pancakes even heavier. I barely got through 1/3 of my pancakes before I was over them. But let's talk about the bacon! Oh sweet Jesus, let's talk about the bacon. The BEST bacon I've ever had in my 30 years on earth. Bold statement? Perhaps...but I stand by it, and I'm not wrong. EAT THE BACON!!! So I say all that to say this...I wasn't impressed with the griddle...at least today. I think it was more so the experience than the griddle itself. ÊI wasn't pleased with the coffee, I ordered the wrong pancakes, and our waiter, though friendly, was barely around, especially when he was needed most. I actually like for the wait staff to not smother me, but ours wasn't around at all. The griddle will be visited again, simply for the fact that my sister insisted today was an anomaly, and I trust the reviews on this site.

The Moma's French Toast is amazing! ÊFar and away the best breakfast place in LA! ÊThe egg dishes are great, Êfavorites include the, Ê"kicking and screaming tacos", Êand the "some like it hot. " ÊEvery thing is better shared as the portions are huge! ÊLast but not least they have the best and hardest working host in the biz, ÊAlex.

Hello, you had me at "red velvet pancake!" The idea of 2 of my favorite sweet things combined together made me willing to wait in line for brunch here. ÊIt's crazy busy and super loud once you get in, but the food comes pretty quickly. It's a unique breakfast place. ÊIt has the usual eggs, pancakes, omelets and French toast, but the creations they make with their pancakes and French toast is what makes them memorable! You want Oreos with your breakfast? ÊYou can get it in your pancake. ÊHow about red velvet? Well they've got that too! If you're tired of plain French toast (you can't be... It is AMAZING here - I stole some for hubby's plate), you can jazz it up with Nutella and peanut butter. So what's the verdict in the $9 red velvet pancake topped with icing sugar and cream cheese icing? ÊIt's definitely tasty but a bit too sweet for my liking... Had to scrape off some of the icing and balance it out then order of eggs, sausage and hash browns! ÊThese were just okay. Added touches are real maple syrup and French press coffee. Solid 4 stars and I think everyone should come here at least once just to try some of their unique pancake creations!

If I could give 6 stars, I would. They've got the formula down exactly right: Ênondescript exterior and interior, looks a little rough around the edges, nothing too shiny or fancy or glamorous except for what's served up for breakfast. I had the opportunity to try the butterscotch pancakes (nearly the size of hubcaps, no joke) and the Cobb omelette. ÊI have never ordered pancakes in my life but these were borderline divine. ÊNot too sweet, lighter than air, and addicting. The Cobb omelette was very, very good. ÊThey must have used six eggs, easily, and it was stuffed, in fact, overflowing, with bite size pieces of beautifully-cooked grilled chicken, bacon pieces, green onions and blue cheese which melted over all the interior ingredients and made every single bite a delight. We also tried a side of bacon which was clearly top-notch stuff and excellent. Yes, the French press coffee is very good, but 2 orders will quickly add $7 to your bill, so fair warning. For the quantity but mostly for the quality, the prices are not bad. ÊThis is seriously well-prepared and well-thought out food. And if you don't want to fight the crowds, plan accordingly and come on off days and/or off hours. ÊJust think ahead, folks, just like if you were going to Disneyland. This is the type of place you would seek out if you were visitng another town. ÊThat's what you need to know.

I love eating pancakes from time-to-time and my best friend brought me to the Griddle Cafe earlier today for lunch. Our waiter, Joe, warned us about the portion sizes and although my friend had already told me the pancakes were huge... I did not expect them to be GINORMOUS! We ordered the 'Tis The Season' and the 'Baked Potato'. The Tis The Season pancakes were delicious, a great combo of pumpkin pie and pancake and unless you don't like potato, cheese, eggs, and sour cream... you really can't go wrong with a Baked Potato omelette. Although delicious, it was an intense amount of food. I think we ended up only eating 1/3 of the pancake and 1/2 the omelette... Service was great, the only reason I give it 3 stars is it's a bit pricey for me and far away (~$24 for total meal) but the portions are LARGE so you do get your food's worth in money!!

I know this has been conveyed a million times over but DEAR GOD their red velvet pancake is EXQUISITE. . Think fluffy, rich, deep-red annular heaven-send immersed under a swirl of sacchariferous cream cheese icing. I honestly could not stop eating it. Yes, it. Each order is merely one pancake - but don't you worry, it's COLOSSAL. In fact, the pancake is larger than the plate it's served on. We also ordered the teacher's pet pancake (stuffed with cinnamon apples) in order to balance out the sinful confection that is red velvet. This maaaybe would have worked if I could have paused for even a moment between red velvet bites. Oops. Service is laid back and friendly but the wait can be torturous. Come early & park in the back (Rite Aid) lot Oh and coffee comes French press style. Need I say more?

Best pancakes and waffles I've ever had. Minus one star for the wait. Unless you get there before 10am on the weekends, expect to wait 30min to an hour. And they do NOT take reservations. Highly recommend the Golden Ticket, Creme de la Creme french toast, and Strawberries and Cream waffle. Hint: A normal serving of pancakes comes with 3 humongous flapjacks! Ask for 1 or 2, if you're hungry. 3 if you're sharing amongst 2-3 hungry people!

If you want a BIG and HEARTY breakfast, Griddle Cafe is definitely the place to go! Didn't know what to expect other than they had really good red velvet pancake (yes, I said red velvet pancakes)! The line was long but host was totally working the line so it went by pretty smoothly and quick-ish (~15 min wait). We ordered the poached y papas benedict and the red velvet pancake of coz. I wanted to try the french toast (so badly!!) but it looked REALLY BIG and there was only 2 of us. So better not. I'm glad we didn't because we couldn't finish our red velvet. I think mainly bc it was too sweet. SUGAR OVERLOAD. The benedict on the other hand was DELICIOUS!! I loved it (not the fried potatoes that it came with) but the poached eggs and bread...when it melts in your mouth...dang-a-dang-dang! YUMM!! I totally recommend the benedict but not the red velvet (unless you LOVE sweets). Definitely would not mind coming back and getting that french toast! The pancakes and peanut buba looked good too (AND HUGE).

Can you say addicting? I've been here twice since May (NorCal resident) and think about this place ALL THE TIME. I know good breakfast and this place is frickin awesome! If you plan on going here for breakfast or lunch, come early- do not come when you're super hungry because it will be torture waiting. I've been told that some people wait up to 2 hours...yikes! It's worth it though, I tell ya! I've been lucky though. The first time I came here was on a Tuesday morning around 11am-noon and we were seated right away. The 2nd time was around 2:00 on a Sunday afternoon and we waited about 20-25 minutes. Not too bad... Okay, so to the food...I get indecisive when it comes to food sometimes (especially when there are soo many choices). The first time I came here, my friends were ordering pancakes. Since I've heard of the huge portions, and knew we would all try a bite of eachother's food- I ordered the "Addicted to Noisella" Stuffed French Toast (recommended by our waiter). The French Toast was stuffed w/Nutella and was mind-blowing! If you're a fan of French Toast and Nutella, trying this is a must! You will not be disappointed. The 2nd time I came here, I wanted to try something different so I ordered the "Kicking and Screaming" Breakfast Tacos. Amazing! They were tacos that had scrambled eggs, jack cheese, pico de gallo, a creamy chipotle sauce topped w/avocado. Delish! Check out the pictures I posted. :)

IN THE MIX: Pancake review with special guest Carrie Benton This weekend I was fortunate enough to have Carrie Benton, Vice President of Business Development at Allied Integrated Marketing, join me as a guest reviewer for Ma'amCakes. I FINALLY got to visit the infamous LA hot spot, The Griddle Cafe - in case you're unfamiliar, The Griddle has a reputation as being one of the best places to eat breakfast in Los Angeles. In fact, the two times I'd gone previously, I've never seen the wait under an hour and a half. Well, write a blog about pancakes, and you'll be sure to get special treatment ; ) Just kidding! Carrie and I went around 10am on Saturday, and didn't wait longer than twenty minutes. However, when looking at the menu, twenty minutes seemed like an eternity!! I mean... need I say more?! As you know by now, I typically post a photo I take of the menu; however, because The Griddle's pancake options are so intricate, I wanted to do the menu justice, and display how awesome these choices are by posting the menu directly from their website. Where to begin?! Well, from the second we walked in, Carrie immediately said "it smells SO good in here," so I knew I at least brought her to the right place. But having to choose one dish from a menu like The Griddle's, is like asking Charlie to choose one piece of candy in The Chocolate Factory. Upon seeing the dish "Hear Me Roar," Carrie was instantly drawn to the Frosted Flakes on the pancakes. "Frosted Flake Pancakes," she yelled, "oh wow, I think I have to get that, oh my God!" I bet Tony would approve of this dish, and say they're "Grrreeeatt!" That being said, Carrie decided to go with the "Red Velvet PanCakes," as she was actually looking forward to these pancakes once we decided upon The Griddle. As per the recommendation of the manager, I decided to go with the "Banana Nana;" in fact, this is The Griddle's most popular pancake. As many restaurants are adapting the trend of the 2+2+2 (see review at Jinky's Cafe), Carrie and I asked if there was an option for such dish, so we could get our pancakes and eggs. While The Griddle does not have this option, our server suggested we have one pancake (as our pancake preferences come with three pancakes), and order a side dish of eggs and bacon. Perfect. And for Perfection: This single Banana Nana pancake, which could barely fit on my plate, caused my mouth to water the second it was placed in front of me. This pancake was incredibly delicious, and the perfect combination of everything - the brown sugar, bananas, powdered sugar, and butter was enough to make my mouth re-water as I'm writing this review. And the best part - I didn't need a hint of syrup. Once the Red Velvet Pancake was placed on the table, Carrie's eyes lit up. "I'm so glad I only ordered one!" I was too. "This is amazing," Carrie said, "even better than I expected." While both pancakes were fantastic, the only downside is they are very filling. Carrie could only finish about a quarter of the plate, and after having a bite, I agreed with her when she said "I think it's the cream cheese." As I myself could only finish half of the Banana Nana, I can't imagine how much food The Griddle has to toss on a regular basis! Overall, the pancakes at The Griddle were beyond my expectations as far as taste & creativity, but just a bit too heavy for my liking. That being said, I would 100% recommend this hot spot to anyone visiting LA. When asking Carrie what her runner-up pancake dish is, she replied "definitely the Hear Me Roar!" Thank you so much, Carrie, for being a part of Saturday brunch with Ma'amCakes!

Eat It OR Beat It? **EAT IT!!** This place is not hard to miss especially with the amount of people waiting outside! When I got here, it took about 20-30 minutes to get a seat. Upon entering the restaurant, almost immediately you can smell the delicious buttermilk pancakes! And let me just say, an order of pancakes can honestly feed 3-4 people! These pancakes are HUGE! Be cautious of over-ordering! "Golden Ticket" Pancake: ABSOLUTELY the best pancake I've ever tried. You'd think with such an enormous pancake, the quality would be down... but not with Griddle Cafe! The "Golden Ticket" was very fluffy and the fillings were perfect: bananas, caramel, walnuts, and streusel! SO VERY tasty, I can't tell you how great this was. I asked our waitress some of the most popular menu items and she recommended this one! CONCLUSION: This is definitely a MUST-TRY and afterwards, a nice hike to Runyon Canyon Park is perfect to burn off all those well-worth calories! Again, I caution against over-ordering because a couple next to us ordered two pancakes and a breakfast side. Just by facial expression, they were overwhelmed!

You gotta say no to the diet if you want to have a proper experience at the griddle. Fresh french press coffee-check. Most unbelievable carb creations- check. Egg dishes that can eat you alive- check. Mix in a little west hollywood and you get one hell of a dining experience. I highly suggest coming with several people. ÊThis way, you can order a bunch of stuff and share. ÊI usually come with my mom. ÊShe orders the bad and I order the good. ÊThat's to say that she chooses one of their many crazy pancake or french toast dishes and I choose a more healthy morning choice such as an egg white omelet. We have tried: Yellow brick road- butterscotch, caramel, and walnut filled pancakes, black magic- oreo filled pancakes, and their mom's french toast. ÊNothing has disappointed us. Together, we achieve morning food coma with plenty extra to take home. Ê This place is always packed but they are quick at getting people in and out so waiting is not so bad.

YUM! Pros: Good food, huge portions, super large pancakes, fun atmosphere, nice service, large menu with fun options, good people watching, cute waiters, great coffee. Cons: Looooong wait on weekends, parking issues... on weekends, nothing on the somewhat healthy side to eat, those horrid back rooms they put you in for larger groups (kind of weirded me out to being eating in what looked like a tiny, funky painted conference room complete with wires hanging from places where tvs should be)! Will I go back? Hell ya! IT IS THE GUILTIEST of guilty pleasures. Will I go with a party of five or more... no, and maybe not on a Sunday.

I live in America. ÊIt's the greatest country on Earth. ÊThat being said, the size of ONE of these fucking pancakes is the reason why people hate us. ÊThat, and people from West Virginia. Ê Get it the fuck together guys. I'm not kidding when I say that the portions here are so wildly out of proportion to what a normal human being can and should eat, it's not even funny. ÊMost of the time when a waiter brings out a super-sized portion of food I laugh and shout, "EAT SHIT YOU LIMP-DICKED FRENCHY FUCKS" before cramming an entire rump roast into my mouth at once, but when these pancakes came out, I felt kind of angry. ÊIf each pancake was even half of its original size, then the plate might have approximated what Oprah could eat in one sitting during a binge-eating competition. ÊIt's too much fucking food, and I imagine most of it gets thrown out because it doesn't keep well. That said, they were delicious fucking pancakes. ÊThey also serve their coffee in these little french presses, which is a remarkably personal touch (not unlike the touch of my drunk step-uncle Rick).

From the looks of the place, I'd say this is somewhat a neighborhood gem. It's always packed. The food is, well, HUGE. Everything I have ever ordered or seen ordered looked like it was made with the incredible Hulk in mind. We're talkin' serious calories. But if you come here to eat this food, who cares? It tastes great and you'll have lots of leftovers. The atmosphere is not newly renovated, but it has some sort of old Hollywood charm, in my opinion. And the staff is absolutely great! Both times that I have been, they were always friendly, fast, and appropriately attentive. There is lots of variety on the menu, something for everyone, and I believe that they serve breakfast all day? Which is always a plus. My first time I had some sort of spicy cobb salad with chicken. Just thinking about it, to this day, makes my mouth water. It was so good. The second time I went for breakfast and just ordered two sides. I got the granola and ham, both of which were not disappointing in size or taste.

Solid 3.5 for Griddle Cafe. Sometimes I'll pass by and see a crowd of people waiting to be seated. ÊNot the case for a weekday around noon! ÊParty of four was seated immediately though service was a tad bit slow (I'll let them slide for that). The menu is orgasmic. ÊEverything sounds amazing and I couldn't for the life of me decide what I wanted to order. ÊI finally settled with the Gone Shrimping Omelette, but there were so many others that I wanted to try! ÊOur party also split a Red Velvet Pancake and it was pretty damn good. However, I wasn't thoroughly impressed with this place. ÊUpon getting our food, a party across from us seemed to be dying in heaven when they took a bite of their food. ÊThat didn't happen for me. ÊAnd while I did enjoy the Red Velvet Pancake, I wasn't out of this world in love with it. ÊMy Gone Shrimping Omelette wasn't too bad, the only miss I thought of it was that it was drenched in liquid (I guess from the tomatoes and whatever else in the dish that was liquidly?). Oh, and I realized they never brought out our sides to our dishes. ÊNever got my garlic toast and the other dishes in my party didn't receive their side dishes either. ÊI didn't even notice this until I left the restaurant and relooked up the menu online.. But nice ambiance! ÊReally reminds me of a family run diner; it's cool how you can see a view of the kitchen and the food when they set it out to be served...though we were able to see that one of my friend's dishes was sitting there for the longest time neglected. ÊWe had all received our dishes and hers was just sitting there waiting for a waiter to bring it to us. ÊYeah, no bueno. But Griddle Cafe is still a place I'll revisit. ÊThis time to try something new and get some French pressed coffee!

I had the pumpkin pancakes and my gf had the eggs Benedict (*on a freaking POTATO, which is even better than it sounds) The waiter challenged me to finish the pancakes and I got about 3 bites from doing it before wanting to die. But it was AMAZING. I would love to go more often, if I didn't think I would die and/or explode. Great place and worth any wait.

A couple of guy friends and I visited the Griddle Cafe for a spontaneous breakfast adventure. We met up in Alhambra at 7:30 on a beautiful Saturday morning so we could carpool over to this famous eatery and to beat the crowds. We pulled up around 8 and saw that there were only a few tables taken so we quickly grabbed a table and began strategizing over the menu. As we decided what to order the restaurant began filling up. Between the three of us we ordered the following: Bluesberry (Blueberry Pancakes) - these things are HUGE so be careful how many stacks you order... 1 Stack = 1 Jumbo Pancake. The pancakes had the perfect texture and amount of blueberries. Addicted to Noisella (Nutella Stuffed French Toast) - I don't know where they find bread that big, but the french toast is also huge, however, being loaded with whipped cream and nutella was somewhat overkill for me Omelet My Soul (Steak Omelet) - the omelet was cooked nicely and was served with some super yummy Griddled Potatoes Some Like it Hot (Chicken Sausage Scramble) - the tequila spiked rancheros sauce was really good and is the perfect accompaniment for the sweet pancakes and french toast. Even though I had two guys with me, we were not able to conquer all of the food put before us, so we ended up boxing up more than half of the french toast and about a quarter of the pancakes (which we foolishly ordered 2 stacks of) And apparently there is parking in the back, however, if you get there early enough you might be lucky enough to snag a spot right in front.

This place is the definition of decadence...the food is very rich and will probably give you a stroke if you eat there too often. HOWEVER the food is very good.

Go here on a weekday, at some off time of day, seating takes only a few minutes. Go here on a weekend, and the line is down the street. Park in the back lot that's shared with Rite Aid (if you can find a spot!) and walk through the restaurant to put your name on the list in front. The food: Pancakes are huge. I think if you could feed four kids with one order! They have a variety ranging from red velvet to bananas and walnuts. French toast is good too (but pancakes are better) My favorite though, is the eggs benedict. Probably the best I've had. Service is friendly, though can be a bit slow when they are busy. The tables for two are also too small to hold the huge plates of food, glasses of water, and coffee. It can feel a bit cramped. It also gets very loud inside. But the food is awesome, and they give you a lot. Be prepared for leftovers.

Griddle combines two things I love: excellent brunch food served by ridiculously hot servers (I'm looking at you, Trotter). ÊBe sure to arrive early for breakfast unless you really enjoy long waits. ÊAnd trust me, the wait is worth it. The menu is quite large and diverse and you'd be hard press not to find something you like. ÊTheir legendary red velvet pancake is without question sinfully sweet and delicious. ÊOne pancake is more than enough even for my voracious appetite. ÊMy friend's Caballero was flavorful and enormous. ÊPortion control is obviously not a factor here, though you'd never know it looking at the hipster, gorgeous clientele. Ê We sat at the wrap around counter which made for great people watching. ÊService was friendly and efficient. ÊPrices are fair considering the quality and quantity of food you receive. After one visit, you can see why Griddle has a cult following. ÊThose hot servers may lure you in, but it's the fantastic food that will keep you coming back.

OMG! OMG! OMG! OMG! That describes several things. ÊFirst, the line of people on the sidewalk to get in is a first OMG. ÊLuckily, I was by myself, so one of the 23 counter seats got me seated ahead of this huge crowd. ÊThe 2nd OMG is for the size of the pancakes I saw and a 3rd OMG because there are 3 per plate. ÊGo to your dish cabinet and pull out the largest plate. ÊYou are holding one pancake. ÊNow pull out three plates and there is your meal. Having seen that before ordering, I knew what I was getting. I ordered the Papas and Poaches. ÊIt's two poached eggs, a thick slice of grilled ham on top of 4 potato skin halves. ÊHollandaise sauce on top with some avocado slices. ÊI also ordered one plain buttermilk pancake. Ê A 4th OMG is they use a big coffee press for every order of coffee. ÊYou get your own. Ê The pancake was ordered just to see it and feel it's texture. ÊAs I thought, it's a basic soft pancake with no crust. ÊIt's big, but not texturely gourmet. ÊI paid $6 for that one pancake which I took a few bites and sent it away. ÊMy focus was on the eggs. ÊThis was a very good meal. ÊThe skins were crunchy, the ham was sweet and savory, the eggs gave it that liquid gold yolk and the hollandaise sauce was exceptionally good. ÊI can tell they use Best Foods mayo which is simply the best. ÊNow I know why they almost have 2000 Yelp posts and people waiting up to an hour to get a table.

This place has a long list of yummy foods on their menu. They're known for their french toast, which I must admit was pretty damn good. There's always a long line from what I read on here and I can attest to that since we waited almost an hour for a table. Don't make the same mistake we did and pay the meter to park on the street, there's actually a parking lot in the back shared with Rite-Aid (Doh!)

I don't care about the location of this place, way too overpriced for mediocre breakfast. The BF and I both got omelets, both of which had ingredients that weren't properly dispersed in it. ÊIf you're gonna charge $12 for omelets, it better be damn perfect. ÊOoh, and there was absolutely no seasoning in them, don't know if that was on purpose. ÊThe omelets come with one side, a choice of potatoes or fruit. ÊI opted for the fruit. We also ordered the nutella french toast. ÊHe loved it, I thought it was just ok. ÊThat also was around $12. With tax and tip, our total came to around $45. Ê Definitely not worth $45 for eggs and starch.

SWEAR, the Red Velvet Pancake is the perfect taste combo of red velvet and pancake. That sounds like a really dumb statement, but I expected it to taste straight up like red velvet cake. Not the case, though! It was definitely true to its pancake self. The first time I came I made the mistake of splitting the Red Velvet Pancake and opting for the Nutella French Toast for myself. Don't get me wrong, both were hella bomby but talk about sugar overload. I could not for the life of me finish the french toast (which was SUPER Nutella-y, dense, and delicious) and had to scarf down some of Elisa C.'s Poached y Papas Benedict to get rid of the feeling that all my teeth were getting cavities. (Hollandaise sauce = awesome.) Came here a second time and split the Red Velvet Pancake between 4. I kept my first experience in mind and got the Chicago Charlie's Scramble (which I watched cool down for 10 minutes on the counter until a waiter finally got the picture when I kept glancing at the plate, then at him). Presentation sucked, but it tasted fantastic. I love how every bite was its own and you could really taste all of the ingredients in it from the sausages, bell peppers, garlic, onions, etc. It was big enough for me to save for breakfast the next day, too :). Total around $20 each time. I craveee for Griddle now. Great breakfast/brunch that, IMO, is completely worth it.

I'll make this review short, simple, and sweet just like my experience with the Griddle Cafe! Food: DELICIOUS and unique despite the dishes being just pancakes and just french toast and just eggs. My red velvet panCAKE was just the right amount of sweet, bigger than my head, and very filling. It was topped off with a generous amount of powdered sugar and cream cheese. The griddle potatoes had bits of onions of them which made them all the more yummy! My boyfriend had one of their egg specialties, and it started a wildfire because the women who sat at the next table all asked him what it was and ordered the same. Seating: Very, very close since the restaurant itself was tiny. Difficult to walk through. Price: A little on the expensive side, but very well worth the $$! Wait: We arrived early morning, and we still ended up waiting about 20 minutes. People were pouring out onto the streets since there's no wait space inside. Service: Extremely friendly, but a bit rushed. Parking: We parked on the streets since we didn't know where else to find spaces. It was easy to find, and we only had to walk 2 blocks to the Griddle Cafe. Follow them on Twitter for special deals/promotions! This is a MUST try for people who love sweets and breakfast dishes!

I don't get to eat breakfast in LA very often, so when I took a day off last week, I decided to take advantage and check out one of the breakfast joints I've had bookmarked. The Griddle Caf did not let me down. ÊNot only was it not crowded (7:30am on a Thursday), our food came out quickly and everything tasted great. Clara L sold me on the "Some Like it Hot" Scramble, so that's what I ordered. ÊI guess I can trust her taste because I thoroughly enjoyed this dish. ÊThey're not shy about quantity here, that's for sure. ÊAnd the scramble is hardly lacking in flavor; it's got such a nice balance of ingredients, including the avocado on top (I think avocado, just like bacon, makes everything taste better). My friend had the "Poached y Papas" Benedict, which is a hefty meal in itself... and also delicious. ÊI'm not a fan of ham, but stacking a piece of that with some egg, potato and the Hollandaise left me feeling quite satisfied. We saw someone else's (HUGE) order of pancakes waiting on the counter and I want to get that next time I'm there; I'm sure it tastes good, but I mainly just want to see if I can finish the whole thing myself.

Yummmm... We came in on a weekday morning and it was paaaacked. Doesnt anyone in LA work? haha. Anyway, luckily there were seats at the counter so we sat there. "Chocolate Chip Cookie" Crusted French Toast- Huuuuuge, unless you're starving this should be shared. Its not as sweet as it sounds. Its sheer genius and I wish we were able to finish it. "Some like it HOT" Scramble- Let me just tell you, I'm not a fan of spicy food...but I am a fan of this. Get it with chips rather than a tortilla. Its awesome.

The GC's food is to die for.... for about the first few bites. But as you keep on shoveling those bigger-than-your-head pancakes into your mouth, your sugar-induced dopamine has long since peaked and the whole dish is just too much (seriously, the pancakes are great if you're trying to eat all your month's carbs in one sitting). And those pancakes sit happily in a to-go box for days following that (days and days...) but they're just too much to even think about at that point since your last nuttela-inspired carb binge was just too much to handle... I definely concur though; there are all kinds of aspiring actor "eye candy" to visually devour before your mount everest of pancakes arrives. (it's no wonder you get full so fast...)

The only thing slightly better than experiencing the Griddle are the Yelp reviews for The Griddle. lol! So much has already been said about a place that the bf and I enjoy frequenting that I really can't say much more. ÊJust keep doing what you're doing there and I'll keep coming back. ÊIn the meantime, here's a little ditty I cobbled together in honor of the Griddle Cafe. *Sing this to the tune of Spongebob Squarepants* Are you ready kids "Aye Aye Sherie" I Can't hear you "AYE AYE SHERIE" Ohhh...... It sits in my middle the food from The Griddle, Pancakes French Toast How I eat all that food is just such a riddle! Pancakes French Toast Food is so wide you need another box for your side. Pancakes French Toast So unbutton your pants and swallow your pride! READY Pancakes French Toast Pancakes French Toast Panca-kes French To-ast! ***** On second thought, I would like to add the following: If you don't arrive early enough in the morning, plan to wait AT LEAST an hour during their rush. ÊHint, wear comfy shoes and your elastic waist banded pants. Or a mumu, whatever you prefer. Park in the lot behind Rite Aid. If you're dining with friends, drop them off first so they can put your name for the queue. ÊUsually you check-in with the guy with glasses (What is your name? I'm totally blanking!) The GWG (guy with glasses) is like a general - loud but very amiable, and will start sorting and organzing the line for two reasons - to keep the sidewalk clear for ADA and firecode compliance, and to sort people into group sizes. ÊHe's also got a couple of rules while you're standing in line: 1) Keep the sidewalk clear. 2) Once he sorts you out and places you in line, you can go grab a coffee or take or walk or something. ÊMost folks opt to wait it out. 3) Ladies if you're interested, he's single so please feel free to come up and introduce yourselves. =) True story, he actually said this when I was there last weekend! The pancakes are GINORMOUS, bigger-than-your-head big and they give you three of them in their specialty pancake orders. ÊI highly recommend that you and a friend order one sweet dish and one protein laden dish. Ê My bf usually orders the golden ticket and I get an either the protein omelete with chicken and a side of bacon or the cobb omelete. Trust me on this recommendation - Êyou'll have enough pancake leftover for the next two days and a carb coma overload that'll put you right to sleep for the first of the two days. ÊThat is unless you're a sumo wrestler or a marthoner carbing up before the big race. Ê=D nom nom nom nom.... Ê Plus you can always come back again to try their french toast and other goodies. ÊOh you can order coffee too but they give you your own french press dispenser...yes I said dispenser, not cup. Ê Mmm....the Griddle - a good screw-the-diet brunch option in the skinniest town in the land.

Their pancakes are amazing but there are a few rules you need to follow to enjoy them. First never go on a weekend or holiday, you will wait a long time and you will feel like you are being rushed through your meal. Second the pancakes are more than enough to share, I usually go with 1 or 2 other people and we get one order of pancakes and a side and share. Third, the parking is in the lot for rite aid and there is a back entrance there. If you follow those rules you will enjoy your experience much more.

This is obviously a dieters worst nightmare and a gluttons heaven. Myself being within the latter category, drove two hours just to have a plate of their fluffy pancakes. I ordered "A Time to Love" which was basically the love child of every fall flavor you can think of and Christmas morning all on one plate. The pumpkin pancakes were stuffed with mini butterscotch chips, sprinkled with streusel, caramel, pumpkin pie filling and a healthy dose (probably around a pound) of powdered sugar. What really put these pancakes over the edge was the amount of spices they used and I'm convinced there's nothing better than the smell of warm cinnamon and nutmeg at 8AM in the morning. My friend ordered the Red Velvet Pancake and although it did taste similar to red velvet cake, I found it a little bland. The way the cream cheese was put on the top was also pretty sloppy and made it look unappetizing. While I wouldn't go back for the red velvet, the pumpkin pancakes will be in my dreams! Be sure to arrive early with your best stretchy pants on in order to indulge in their delicious creations of breakfast nirvana.

My experience at the Griddle Cafe was heart stopping (almost literally). I was a little overwhelmed with their menu, because almost everything I read sounded freakishly delicious. I probably spent 10 minutes going back and forth between different items on the menu and weighing out the pros and cons. ÊI finally decided on "A Time for Love" because the words "pumpkin" and "caramel" and "butterscotch" kept calling my name. And as you can tell from the review and the pictures, the food portions are BEYOND huge. It was my party's first time at Griddle Cafe and we naively ordered our own items. Yes, we did get the opportunity to explore and taste a variety of items from the menu. But, a word to the wise: BRING SOMEONE TO SHARE YOUR FOOD WITH. My friends and I were ambitious and tried to finish our own plates, only to ask for boxes that were almost filled to capacity with our leftovers. Another word to the wise: try not to get sugar overload. I have a big sweet tooth, so I felt like I could handle the monstrosity of "A Time for Love." Half way through eating our food, we ended up ordering a side of fries, not because we were hungry for fries, but to balance all the sugar we were eating. And you can only imagine how many refills of water we got. All that being said, I realllly enjoyed my flapjack. Pumpkin pie, caramel, butterscotch, whipped cream, powdered sugar?! You can't go wrong with that. Even as leftovers, although it lost some of its pizazz, it was still pretty darn good. With my previous experience in mind, I'm ready to tackle another enormous flapjack...with a friend of course.

Nearly 2000 reviews don't lie. ÊThis is the bees knees. ÊDrove all the way up from OC to check out this little joint. ÊWe waited about half hour and were lucky enough to get a seat on the patio/sidewalk/whatever you want to call it out front. ÊI know some people may not appreciate it, but after seeing the STUFFY inside, I wanted to be OUTSIDE. ÊPlus, it was a typical sunny gorgeous day in Cali. The entire menu looked amazing. ÊI need to come back about 15 times to try everything I want. ÊI ordered Mama's French Toast, which the waiter convinced me on. ÊI don't really know how to put this...I wasn't disappointed by any means, the french toast was FANTASTIC, but with all the wild things on the menu, I really wanted to try something a little more out there. ÊI can only fault myself for being the world's most indecisive person and going with someone else's suggestion, though. ÊAnywho, it was great! ÊOur server was really good, the food was amazing, and we left fat and full.

This is one of the best places to go for breakfast! ÊWent here with the roommate and waited about 25 minutes for a table. ÊIt was extremely packed and busy! Ê Make sure when you come here you are starving because the portions are HUGE! ÊI ordered the ham and eggs and the ham literally covered the huge plate that it comes in. ÊMy roommate ordered the same thing and we looked at each other and said that we should have just ordered one and split it. ÊIn addition to that, the pancakes are huge but extremely fluffy and buttery. ÊSO good! ÊThe ham was cooked perfectly with just enough burnt stuff along the edges (which I like) and the hash browns were browned nice. ÊEverything was cooked the way a good breakfast should be. Ê The servers are extremely friendly and will take care of you even though the place is packed. ÊThe only downside is if you want a bit of a private meal, this isn't the place to go. ÊYou get to meet the people at the next table or even see their food because you're thisclose to them. ÊLOL! Ê French press coffee was amazing and I can't wait to go back! Ê You can park in the Rite Aid parking lot and go through the back - which was extremely convenient because this place is right on Sunset and parking there can be quite a hassle!

Right off the bat I will tell you that this review is not based on the food at Griddle Cafe...because unfortunately I didn't eat anything here. Actually my experience the at the Griddle Cafe (the morning of my birthday) was HORRIBLE!!! My friend and I came in super early for breakfast because there is always a line. We got seated right away at a table that was just finished being bussed as we sat down. We got our menus and then..............................................?....NOTHING. No water, no waiter, no...nothing. 10 mins go by and the table next to us is seated, drinks served, and order placed. My friend asks their waiter (right next to our table!!!) if he could get our waiter. He said "oh someone should be right over". Another 5 mins go by and the table to the other side of us is seated, drinks served, and order placed. WTF!!! So we sat there a little longer still waiting, looking around trying to get someone's attention and finally I said screw this lets go somewhere else. I left there feeling extremely annoyed and knowing I will NEVER go back!

I got the Creme del la Creme French Toast. ZOMG. So BIG, so SWEET. My advice? Get a french toast to share between two people and get entrees that are more savoury so you're not overwhelmed by the sugar from it. Besides, the French toast REALLY fills you up. God, I want more. FYI, the tacos here have really overcooked dried chicken - not appetizing :/

Best breakfast in LA, period! Their pancakes are out of this world. ÊYou will most definitely be in a food coma for hours. I highly recommend asking for a short stack (i.e 1 pancake). Even if you are sharing it will be more than enough. These are the biggest pancakes I have ever seen!! Go on a week day or be prepared to wait on a weekend. ÊYou walk into to a kind of grungy diner type space, but it's all part of the experience. ÊPut your name down and hang outside while you wait for your table. Once you get to sit, take a moment to marvel at the HUGE menu! I recommend sticking to the pancakes or eggs. ÊThe french toast was not my favorite. Ê "A time to Love" Pancakes are pumpkin pancakes filled with streusel, butterscotch chips and caramel, topped with whipped cream and powdered sugar. These are the most insane pancakes ever!! I don't know that I would say it's "part of a complete breakfast" but it's definitely part of a complete dessert! The "Sow your oats" were also great and not quite as sweet. They are made with honey, cinnamon and rolled oats. Also love the "Kicking and Screaming breakfast tacos"...I usually get them with egg whites. Prices are reasonable and you can always take your leftovers home and warm them in the oven. ÊI'm usually so full I can't stand to look at the pancakes anymore by the time I leave. *Oh and by the way, the waiters are all super hot :)

If I were gutsy enough to get a tattoo, it would probably depict a piece of french toast with "Heart Mom" scrawled on top. ÊYep, I'm talking about the masterpiece that you can only find at Griddle Cafe. The romance began two years back, when a friend pried me away from the library for fuelage in the form of french toast. ÊOnce I got a taste of that fluffy toast, I just wanted to stand up and sing, "My heart goes shalalala la, shalala in the mooorniiiing..." Anyway, that toast slipped into my psyche and became the standard by which I compare all others. ÊAnd I'm sorry to say that none has stood up to Mom's French Toast. ÊThose two thick pillows of bread the size of your face (I have a small face), topped with butter and so much powdered sugar the whole plate looks like Santa's front yard...who is this Mom, and can I kidnap her to cook for me? I went again recently, and it tasted just like I remembered. ÊThe butter and egg lend a savoriness that balances out the sweetness of the powdered sugar, and the bread is soft and filling. ÊIt's a simple dish, and yet eating it evokes so much feeling... Ê Ê Ê I've also tried one of their pancakes, which was a little dry, and some of the Chicago Charlie's Scramble, which was a little underseasoned. ÊBut honestly eating the french toast is like wearing mental blinders--you just can't think about anything else. Ê Griddle Cafe gets four stars just because I don't believe in giving full marks based on one dish alone. ÊBut now that I've had the french toast twice, I'll brave traffic again to come back and try something else.

Brunch & Dessert are my favorite 'meals'.. this place brings the two together perfectly! The cheesecake french toast is phenomenal!! Definitely on my top 10 best things I've ever eaten! Hope that's not over hyping.. French toast and cheesecake are two of my favorite foods.. so the marriage of the them is perfection in my eyes. The pancakes are enormous (definitely sharable) Êand the is a delicious variety. I can never move past my sweet tooth, but I've only heard good things about their savory items as well. My suggestion is to go in a group of 3-6. order a variety of sweet and savory & share so you can try a variety! There french toast & pancake varieties are just too good not to order, but most people cant handle that much sweets in one sitting.. so sharing is the way to go! oo.. also this is a very popular spot.. so often a long wait esp on weekends.. I suggest going during the week or with very good company that you dont mind hanging out with outdoors for awhile while you wait to be seated. The wait is worth it! :)

Delicious! ÊThis place has an extensive menu of breakfast items...pancakes, french toast, omelets, tacos..everything from a super sweet red velvet pancake to the savory burrito this size of your head. Ê The System: This place gets really crowded! ÊWe went on Saturday and there was a huge line outside of the restaurant. ÊThere are two lines- one for small parties (up to 3) and the other line for big parties. ÊMake sure you sign in first and then stand in line. ÊThey lines look overwhelming but they have a fairly efficient system. Ê The food: Oh man where to begin: Peanut Butta Crunch French Toast: The best breakfast thing I've had! If you love peanut butter you will love this dish. ÊTheir famous french toast dipped in a peanut butter crunch batter. ÊEveryone on the table rated this dish the best. ÊNeed to get a meat or something salty on the side because it can be sweet with multiple bites (and you will want multiple bites). Red Velvet Pancakes: Tastes just like the cake. ÊFelt like I was eating dessert Burrito and Tacos: Safe breakfast items. ÊNothing special but good Banana Pancakes: Huge, tasty. ÊPancakes are very fluffy and light. Ê Would highly recommend trying this place. ÊGo in smaller groups, there is a counter top for couples. ÊParking- street. ÊRead signs because most spots are 2 hours and if you are waiting a while in line you may end up paying extra!

Parking is a challenge and there is usually a long wait but the food is great. I had the scramble and the french toast. Its a lot of food. The scramble was okay, not the best I've ever had. I would stick to either pancakes or french toast when I come back. When you order coffee you get your own french press, which is the only way I take my coffeee.

I can only have good things to say about a brunch spot with this level of efficiency that also plays Scooby-Doo on repeat. We went splitsies on the Nutella-stuffed French toast with a side of warm brown sugar bananas and the egg white omelet with shrimp, avocado, salsa, and chilies. Such different things, but both perfect on their own ways. Paired with a personal pot of French press, this brunch was definitely more than worth the 30 minute wait. If I lived in LA, this would definitely be one of my regular spots.

This used to be the spot when anyone who was visiting from out of town asked "Where should I go for breakfast in LA". I quickly would always shout The Griddle! I have been here countless times before and each time after the first few I enjoyed my meal a little bit less. This time was no different but I liked it much less to A. write an updated review and B. I probably won't shout this as a first recommendation for a bfast spot. Service has always been just so-so. Pretty much they are nothing more than eye candy. The dining area is always packed and the tables are just so close to each other. I sat at the counter this time and no elbow room at all. Not the most comfortable place to eat and especially since their portions and plates are so large. I finally tried some pancakes from them and I know we just ordered the wrong ones but they were not good at all. SKIP the Lemon Raspberry ones. Trust me you will thank me later. Go for the gusto and get the RV or Oreo ones or something. anything other than those. I ordered the Kickin and Screamin Tacos as usual but felt like some meat to them so I asked if they could add Steak. Waiter dude said he could bring the steak out on the side. Really?? It would have been that hard for your cooks to put the steak in my tacos and then added the eggs and other mumbo jumbo on top. Weak. The steak was awful. Looked awful and tasted awful. Over cooked, chewy and stringy. Tacos sans the steak were good as always. The beans need to go though. Poop. I HATE how they assume three people will need to pots of coffee. they never ask and they always charge you for two. We didn't even touch the second one but you better believe we paid for it. god I hate that so much! The Griddle is good but has fallen to just A-Ok in my book. Of course I will continue to return but I don't think I will be adventurous in the trying new things department and just stick with what I always get. And the coffee...I gotta remember my own words when it comes to the coffee. it pisses me off every time.

I'd heard of the Griddle about 3 years ago but I'd yet to go until last weekend. My girlfriend and I came around 2 pm for Saturday brunch, and while the line looked incredibly intimidating out the door, it lasted only about 20 minutes. Upon walking in, the restaurant was PACKED and smelled delicious. I'm talking, hardly any elbow room between tables packed, but sometimes that's not a bad thing. I noticed a lot of other patrons had ordered coffee, which comes in its own french-press to the table, a nice touch. Unfortunately it was far too hot outside for coffee so we passed and just ordered. We decided to get one sweet item and one savory. For the savory, we ordered the Tequila Sunrise, Griddle's take on Huevos Rancheros. I can't begin to tell you how delicious this dish was. Their sausages and ranchero sauce were both incredibly flavorful with just the right amount of spice, and the beans and eggs underneath really hit the spot. Definitely opt for the side of sour cream and avocado for a small extra charge. For the sweet we decided that amongst all of Griddle's insane pancake creations (Oreo, Red Velvet, Apple, Pumpkin Spice, etc. etc. etc. etc.), to get the Golden Ticket Pancakes. We were shocked when they came out. 3 huge, 12" fluffy pancakes, filled with brown-sugared bananas, walnuts, caramel, streusel, and a ton of butter and whipped topping. The two of us didn't come close to even eating a THIRD of the stack. Note: The pancakes are possibly even better cold as a refrigerator snack. The only flip side I can think of is that its noisy, the line can be intimidating Êespecially with larger parties, and parking on Sunset is kind of a pain. I'll definitely be back to try the Red Velvet pancakes though!

There's a few things that make this place a win, and a few things that make it annoying. Pros: Cute, tall male waiters. There's something for your eyes to feast on while your belly makes weird, hungry gurgling noises. Giant-sized proportions of breakfast delights for giant-sized giants. Your own mini french-press for many cups of coffee. Cons: Mile-long line if you don't get there early. Also, they separate you into "groups" on one side of the street and "twos" on the other side of the street. I felt like the host was herding cattle. Not so awesome. Failure to refill water often enough. It gets really busy during prime time hours. Styrofoam take out boxes. It's the green age people, let's start using paper. The interior is sparsely furnished, with bare brick as the wall. There's a sort of charm to the minimalist design, and I definitely have to give props to the set up. Never have I seen so many people squished in one small establishment where there's still an impression of space. My friend and I could hear everything from the girls sitting next to us, especially since if I'd stuck out my elbow, I'd basically hit one of them in the face. I exaggerate a little, but don't come here and expect privacy. I ordered the Chicago Charlie's Scramble and Banana Nana Pancakes, after the waiter failed to convince me otherwise. I like both sweet and salty for breakfast, and the waiter told me that buying one banana nana pancake was not as economical as buying one order of banana nana pancakes (which is three pancakes the size of two of your faces). Not as economical?? Well, I didn't major in Economics in college for nothing. I got an order. My friend got the Red Velvet Pancake (which is only one, sadly). The pancakes were both amazingggg. Huge, fresh, hot, the pancakes were delicious. The Red Velvet literally tasted like a red velvet cupcake, but in flattened, pancake form. The banana nana is a house favorite for a reason, because it's so awesome! However, we both got through about half of one pancake, so needless to say we had to get boxes. The scramble wasn't that great. Good while hot, but nothing to rave about and not something I'd order again. Great place for brunch! I'd like to come here every weekend if possible.

Shrimp pesto egg white omelet was mad money. Nutella pancakes topped with whipped cream added a sweeeeet touch to the meal. Always fun to share. LARGE portions so you almost have to! It's a deceptively large venue with rooms in the back. Parking in the back is convenient. Right next to Rite Aid so you can do some quick shopping before or after in case you need to pick up anything.

OMG!!! ÊThe best deal in Hollywood! ÊI have never eaten such delicious and interesting pancakes ever! ÊI ordered the "Scotch on the Rocks" pancakes which had cococnut, oat, pecan and buttersctoch chips. ÊMy friend said they only give one pancake so imagine my surprise when THREE of the hugest pancakes I have ever seen was delivered to my table.

Obscenely huge and delicious pancakes. The only drawback is the wait (which is usually not too bad) and the teeny tiny space between tables, which makes it an exercise in balance and dishware arrangement. Every time I've gone there our tabled has been jostled, thankfully no spills...yet.

Believe the hype. Line is ridic but totally worth waiting for. Great service, great prices, ginormous portions. Red Velvet pancake is big enough for sharing. For something healthy, try the Muscle-Bound scramble: spinach, tomato, green onion with egg whites + turkey maple sausage. Tastes a lot better than it sounds/looks.

Breakfast food done well, in massive, ridiculous portions. The Griddle Cafe has parking and there's frequently a line for brunch on weekends. ÊService was reasonably fast on a not-very busy Thursday afternoon when we dined there. They're known for their pancakes, which fill the entire plate and will provide you with flapjack for a week. They have fun flavors. My boyfriend and I have enjoyed their Banana Walnut streusel and Teacher's Pet pancakes. He didn't like the Black Magic as much as the Banana flavor. The pancakes are definitely worth the visit, and their scrambles seem cool as well. The only downside is every time we eat here, someone in the party over indulges in pancakes and leaves feeling a little sick. So pace yourself. They offer some mixed drinks using Jinru, which I didn't care for. Overall, when you want a big meal, especially quality pancakes, The Griddle Cafe is where it's at. But I doubt anyone could eat there often, it's more of an occasional treat.

Why didn't anybody tell us the portions here could feed the entire continent of Africa?! No exaggeration here! In fact, our mouths and stomach were both savoring and intimidated at the same time! ÊI seriously felt like Adam Richman (Man V Food) by the time I was done! We arrived 8'ish on this Saturday morning and was fortunate to get seated. ÊIt was only matters of a few minutes before the next wave of morning zombies strolled in. The unfortunates stood just outside the entrance while the luckies chomped on crazy, enormous fluffy carb topped with syrup and heavy dose of creamy butter! Let me tell you, I felt like I conquered Mount Kilimanjaro or something! I finished 95% of my order! I got their classic French Toast, side of scrambled eggs and 2 big size sausage links! ÊTheir double Texas-size French Toast, topped off by syrup and powdered sugar, was definitely the largest I have ever consumed! ÊIt was fluffy, soft and easy to break into. ÊI would order it again but next time, if there is a next time, would have to be split among deuce! Among my amigos and amigas, they had ordered another staple, the Red Velvet pancake, Pina Colada infused pancake, and Nutella-stuffed French Toast! I must emphasis again, these orders were ginormous! ÊNobody finished! Nobody! ÊVelvet tasted fluffy and cakey! The taste of the alcohol was quite evident in the Pina! ÊThe Nutella was overwhelmingly nutty and sweet, the way one would expect! Sweet on top of more Sweet! The service was attentive and courteous! They sat us in a pretty secluded spot near the entrance! The vibe was warm and cozy in a hustling and bustling in this Hollywood-ish scene! ÊToo bad there was no celebrity sighting! :( Food coma, you asked?! yes, yes we were in the state of! Would I return? its going to be awhile! ÊIf you decide to come here, please order appropriately and split!

Awful service. The waiter was not particularly friendly or patient from the get-go. He brought out the wrong bread for two of the orders, and didn't bring out one of the dishes until much later than the others. This in itself could be attributed to a busy kitchen, but the waiter's attitude was really the kicker. I tried to tell him which breads we needed and alert him to the fact that there were 5 empty water glasses on the table, but before I could even ask for more water he had hurried away. The last dish eventually came out, and the water glasses were refilled about 15 minutes after we were ready for more water. Not long after, as we were still eating--as in, we had forks full of food and were chewing--the waiter asked us if we wanted boxes, then shoved the check in my face and walked away. I've never been a server, but I think it's a standard rule that bringing someone the check or asking for boxes when people are still in the process of eating is incredibly rude. When I looked at the bill, I noticed the 20% "service" charge that had been added because we were a party of 5 (even though it's generally 6 at most restaurants). I asked to speak to the manager, saying the service was so bad that I wouldn't have even tipped 15%, even though I don't under-tip by default. The manager told us that because we had had the privilege of taking up one of the booths, being a party of 5, we were obligated to pay the 20% tip. Apparently, getting a booth in the oh-so-popular Griddle means paying 20% tip for bad service. I listed my complaints to the manager, and he just kept saying there was nothing they could do. By this point, the waiter had come back and was standing right behind the manager, and the manager started pressing me again to tell him my complaints. I told him that I was not comfortable talking about the issue anymore, with the implication being that I did not want to complain about the waiter as if he weren't there, when he was in fact standing right in front of me. The manager didn't seem to pick up on this and asked me why I was annoyed with him when he was just trying to talk to me. As we left, I told the man who was writing names down--who had been more helpful and brought out the manager to speak with me--that it was weird and uncomfortable that the manager asked me to complain about the waiter right in front of him--I had no interest in getting into a three-way debate that included the waiter who had been so rude in the first place. The guy said the waiter was great and no one had complained about him before (I failed to retort that maybe it was because the waiter's looks were enough to probably shut up most WeHo patrons.) As for the food quality, it's definitely overrated. The french toast had a bit of a hard, stale texture to it, and the Cobb omelet we ordered was a bit dry. Jack and Jill's closer to 3rd Street has much better egg dishes, in my opinion, and from what I remember, their other dishes were great as well. I don't think Griddle is at all worth the wait.

Everytime I come here, I get something new and I love it! ÊHUGE portions. ÊSo either be ready to take some home or share with whoever you go with! ÊIt gets pretty crowded, so the earlier you go in the morning, the faster you get seated. ÊIf you have a big party, don't come too hungry (just moderately hungry), because you'll be absolutely starving by the time you get seated! Ê If it's your first time to Griddle Cafe, the menu will seem endless and bit overwhelming. ÊThe first obstacle is to choose whether you want sweet or savory - really depends on your mood. ÊOr if you want it all, I definitely recommend sharing between two people a sweet & a savory dish! ÊThe pancakes are gigantic and they normally come in a set of three, but I usually get the half order (which I still have trouble finishing). ÊI really enjoy the skillet dishes, but I am nowhere close to having tried them all! ÊThe coffee is really great! ÊIt's French press coffee with complimentary refills - love! ÊThe OJ is also really good, but a little on the pricey side for juice. ÊI've only ever gotten from the breakfast side of the menu, but I'm sure that all their lunch items are delicious as well!

I wrote this in 2002 on Citysearch: I simply can't believe and understand why anyone think this is the best breakfast place in Hollywood, West Hollywood. The food is appalling and comes out cold, the service is disastrous. It's my worst breakfast experience I've ever had. They don't even have a very imaginative menu. So, what's the fuss about?" I was convinced to go back again. I agreed to give it another try. Well, not much difference. At least, now I understand why the place is packed. If you look around, their customers are mainly wannabe actors, hippies and people who love saving money and leftover food. :-) They get so much food that for the price of one dish, they get 2 or 3 meals. No one leaves that place without a doggy bag. So, they can save money by not spending money on the next or next two meals. The quality is still not good at all and services is still beyond bad. I still don't get it why anyone would wait an hour or more to get into this place.

Red Velvet Pancake. The best pancake I have ever had. What more can I say? The red velvet is topped with cream cheese, and because it was a big portion, we were not able to finish it, even though it was absolutely scrumptious. I only ate the red velvet pancake here, and my 4 stars is based off that. I would certainly come back again, but unfortunately their hours are very odd. Other customer's orders have come in triple stacked pancakes and includes more than enough for one person. The serving is huge, and the pancakes are yummy. The only downfall is the size of the restaurant, everything is very squeezed in and the tables are really close to one another. Please, if you ever are craving pancakes, come here, not iHop. Unless you're very far away.

I took my mom and my sister in law there yesterday, Wednesday. We got there a little before 10:30 and it's still very crowded. Don't people work??? Sheesh! We got lucky and found a table next to the window by the door. The place is small and crowded and super loud but since we got a nice table by the window, it made things bearable. Our server Joe (I think that was his name) was very nice, he didn't rush us. I think he was able to tell that it was our first time there. Very cute too!!! I think all the servers are actually. I ordered Red Velvet pancake... I really hesitated in ordering this because I knew it was going to be too sweet. Well, it was too sweet. You can't really eat without the icing coz there's not much flavor without it but with the icing, even just a little bit then it's too sweet. I didn't eat much of it. My mom loved her Old Fashioned French toast. She loves King's Hawaiian French toast and she thinks this is even better! She loved the maple syrup too because it's not too sweet. My sis in law ordered waffle... nothing special. Everything was overpriced. Overhyped. The meal is $10 without eggs. Coffee was good, hot chocolate was huge and good. BUT over priced. Not going back.

Went to the Griddle Cafe today-- I had a group of friends with me from all over the country. I wanted them to experience what I feel like is an essential Hollywood 'morning after' restaurant. The food was great, the portions are huge. $4 per person French Press coffee on the table. Mounds of toppings on your monstrous pancakes. I almost always have a great experience here. Today was a completely different story. Our server was Chris, who needs to re-evaluate his job title. This guy had an awful attitude, and was SLLOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW. Added 20% gratuity to a table of 7... with a note on the bottom of the check that said "Gratuity Not Included. Please Tip Your Server." He dropped the check, and was nowhere to be found. This guy got his $22.50 included gratuity, and I left feeling very cheated. It'll be a while before I go back to the Griddle Cafe after dealing with Chris.

If I had written this review 10 years ago, when I lived right around the corner, I'd have easily given them five-stars. But somehow, they really only get a 3.5 from me these days. The wait is insane, but if you get through it, you can stuff yourself with some pretty darn good pancakes. Don't ever wait two hours for this place and not get the pancakes! That is the first rule. The second rule: don't you dare be on a diet...the portions are huge and if you've got a sweet tooth like I do, then you will have one indulgent breakfast. Prices are okay, service is quick and friendly, and while I still consider them one of the best breakfast joints in town...I've definitely had better. PS.

I've got a secret for all you helpless souls waiting in that long arse line that wraps around the building... Ditch everybody and come by yourself. Seriously. I rolled up to this joint on a very busy Friday morning by myself. While the parties of 3's and 4's were waiting outside, I was ushered right in; like a celeb. No waiting. Not even for one minute. I had the Red Velvet pancake and a side of eggs. I ate all of my eggs (which were quite yummy; sorta creamy and cheesy) and then I had 3 Êbites of that humongaloid pancake and felt sick to my stomach. It tasted just like a slice of red velvet cake (maybe not as sweet) but it was WAY TOO MUCH. One pancake can easily feed 3 to 4 people. I had them box it up and I took it to go. I tossed it in the back seat of the car, ran some errands, spent a few hours at the WGA Library and suddenly remembered I had that pancake. Even though it had been sitting in the car for well over 4 hours, I ate it anyway. And guess what? It was EVEN BETTER than it was fresh. I still couldn't finish it , so I took it back to the hotel and had some more the next morning, and it was still the BoMb!!! The pancakes and eggs are tasty here, but its like a catch-22. If you want to avoid the lines come by yourself, but if you plan on eating anything, you should bring someone (or 2) with you.

This place is awesome, no wonder it has so many reviews and fans! I love breakfast food, and this place really hit the spot. It's a bit crowded, but the food here is definitely worth the wait. The atmosphere is really loud and hip (typical of LA). My friend and I ordered the red velvet pancakes (after seeing how people raved about them on Yelp) and the hoagie omelette (if I remember correctly). We also ordered orange juice, which was pricey but delicious nonetheless. Let me just say, listen to all the reviewers on yelp. THE PORTIONS ARE HUGE. If you're a normal girl, you won't finish. I think maybe guys can finish the plates...but they're definitely hearty and filling. The red velvet pancakes literally filled my plate...they were the size of a mini-pizza, basically. It was yummy, even though I couldn't stop thinking about the calories as I took each bite :') You may think the dishes are a bit pricey, but once you see the portions you will understand why. They're at least 1.5-2 times bigger than what you pay for at normal restaurants. Go here, it's awesome. I don't like to give many 5 star reviews, but Griddle Cafe deserves it!

The omelet was good but probably wouldn't order that again (nothing special). &As for the red velvet pancake, I'd have to say I was kind of disappointed. I LOVE red velvet cake so i thought i'd love this too. but it was just OKAY. I didn't like the frosting/syrup, so i scrapped it off and used the whipped cream from my french toast to compliment it.

I got there at 8:10 a.m. and the place was already full. Note that it opened at 8 a.m. If you just love pancakes and humongous portion this is a must try.

The Griddle is really the ultimate in all things brunch. ÊYes, the wait can be long but with these kinds of portions, prices and deliciousness, that is to be expected. ÊCome hungry and come with someone to share your food with you. ÊMost 250 pound men couldn't finish a dish at the Griddle! The french toast options are overwhelming--I've only tried the original to date but am dying to go back for a french toast tasting and sample a bunch of them. ÊAs far as pancakes, I have had the much talked about red velvet pancakes. ÊAs a red velvet connoisseur, I was beyond excited to see these deep red pancakes bigger than my head with lots of thick icing on top. ÊPractically speaking, it didn't end up working out very well for breakfast. ÊThe pancakes were thick and dense like cake, and the frosting was similarly rich. ÊI felt like I was having a huge slab of red velvet cake for breakfast, and not even great cake, just mediocre cake. ÊToo sweet for the morning, too much, and not enough. Ê The fiesta scramble, breakfast tacos, and breakfast burritos (can you tell I like Mexican breakfasts?) are all amazing and perfect to share. ÊI love all of their egg dishes. ÊService is friendly and quick--especially if you have Kevin waiting on you, he is such a sweetheart. Ê See you in line!

This place was so packed!!! My friend Kina and I went for the first time on a sunday morning and it was packed at 10am. She ordered a walnut banana waffle and it was yummmmmm!!! 3 big layers and stuffed!! we were shocked. this was definitely enough to share with 3 people or more. I ordered the eggs, bacon, potatoes, the regular kind of breakfast and i was stuffed. The service was nice as we sat in the diner area. I was impressed with the pressed coffee so smooth so good!!! definitely we would go back for more and try something different. it is a little pricey, but something to try in l.a.!!!!

Uuuhh....what the hell? If you know me, you'd know that I'm down for breakfast any day, all the time. I thought I knew breakfast, and then I came here.... aaaaaaaahh. as you can see, I'm having trouble forming my words here.. Blueberry and boysenberry pancakes??? French pressed coffee (my favorite)!! Mom's french toast.....aaaaaaaaahh. it's a discreet little shop in the heart of pretentious west hollywood. like a fresh breath of air. Congrats, Griddle Cafe. you've fostered my most incoherent yelp review yet. :)

It was a sunny Monday morning.. Crystal and Brian wanted to eat her for breakfast. So, again.. due to their prior suggestions which never failed to let me down.. I was ready to give it a try. Parking: If I were to drive there without any tips, I would go crazy because I wouldn't even know where to start looking for parking. Good thing Crystal gave me tips to park behind the Rite Aid. So yelpers- Park in the Rite Aid parking lot off Fairfax. Interior/Exterior: Look like a lil' hole in the wall spot.. Nothing fancy. Servers were SUPER laid back (I don't mind it.. esp that our dude was cute). Food: Server was very efficient. Brought everything right out. We ordered French Press coffee to start. Brian ordered this Spinach, Egg White, tomato, and Chicken ham thing.. and since I picked at his plate, I can tell you it was Super DELISH!!!! Crystal ordered this banana nut whipped blah blah something pancake. O- M-GEEE! HEAVENLY! PORTION: TOO BIG-- like my Right buttt cheek BIG. The Server even wished her luck! Me: Strawberries and Cream Waffles. YUMMS... Although it wasn't half the size as Crystals, it was def a good portion that I couldn't finish it all. OVERALL EXPERIENCE.Good food. Quick Service. Just make sure you bring good company. Yelpie!!! CHEERS!

Wow. This place is the real thing. Had the apple cobbler French toast and loved it. The atmosphere is so LA. Jason, our waiter was outstanding.

For the same reason I choose Sprinkles over Crumbs, I can't give Griddle the highest of ratings. A shit ton of food doesn't mean the food is good. The brunch line here is insane and it's a bit confusing as to how to get your name on the list. So they call your name, you sit, and you eat heaping piles of food. Everything is cooked just fine and the flavors are nice but there doesn't seem too much creativity in menu design and execution. Combine price, location, wait time, and food quality and I can't budge above 3 stars. LA is Sunday brunch heaven, standards are high, and it just doesn't quite cut it.

In a city like LA where living expenses can be high, and everyone is looking to save money, lots of places offer lunches for less than $10. While going to Griddle Cafe may not be the first on your list for cheap eats, the serving sizes are gi-mega-normous enough that it can easily be split into two meals. If you, like me, don't mind eating the same meal twice, this ends up being pretty bang-for-your-buck. I have a major sweet tooth so even though it was past 1pm, french toast was on my mind. Well, really the entire page of pancakes, waffles and french toast was on my mind... but I had to make some sort of decision. I chose the Creme De La Creme french toast - graham cracker crusted french toast drizzled with cheesecake topping and powdered sugar. Uhh... DELICIOUS!! The french toast was soft and fluffy and the cheesecake topping was creamy and not too sweet. Everything that everyone ordered at every table looked amazing so I'm sure there isn't much on the menu that could go wrong. Just make sure you're not too eager to reach for the maple syrup if you ordered anything BUT the plain pancake/waffle/french toast. You might just get an instant cavity from insane sugar overload. Oh, and make sure your entire party is present because they won't seat you until everyone is there. And they take the table's order in one go, an one tab. First time I've seen this happen... but whatever.

overrated. definitely overrated. the food sounds so good on paper, but i think the only thing really extraordinary about this place is the huge portions. tried the only eggs benedict item on the menu...smothered in their mayo-y sauce. DEFINITELY ask for the sauce on the side. the ham was good, nothing special. i liked that they use potato skins, very crispy. perfectly poached egg, delicious runny yolk pouring over my food....good, but nothing mind blowing. also had the cheesecake french toast thing, covered in graham cracker bits. a bit too sweet, toast was soggy...large portion, but not something i wanted to eat endlessly. PARKING is not bad, as you can park in the rite aid plaza and get your parking validated. this was probably the best part of the trip for me, considering how embarrassed i am to parallel park in front of people , lol good place to try, but not something i'll be coming back for continuously. p.s. service was awesome, very friendly, energetic servers.

This is one of the most unassuming eateries in the Los Angeles area, but looks are deceiving in this case. This breakfast spot is known for its monstrous plates and believe me when I say they serve big portions AND big flavor. My favorite item on the menu is the order of banana-nana pancakes. These things are pure greatness. Not only are they huge (I would recommend sharing this stack with a friend) but slices of banana are baked in. Fluffy and delicious, as hotcakes should be. I did try the Bailey's pancakes as well though, which taste like they have been drenched in alcohol (had this the morning after a long night out. NOT a good idea, if you get my drift). ÊWouldn't recommend these. The bacon was thick, crispy and delicious, eggs were nicely scrambled, and their potatoes are always well seasoned. Solid breakfast spot. Just beware the Irish cream!

3.5 stars. Weekend breakfast at this diner-style restaurant = guaranteed wait + HUGE portions + lots of sweet breakfast options. ÊWe found metered 1 hour parking down the street, no problem. ÊWait time for two was 15-20 minutes, so not terrible. We ordered: -Poached y Papas Benedict + Avocado -Some Like It Hot -Red Velvet Pancake (for two small Asian girls...I know... -____- ) The savory entrees were pretty good; I would say the eggs benedict were above-average. ÊThe red velvet pancake was also good, though the cream cheese frosting is a little too sweet for my taste. ÊSome of the pancakes we saw looked HUGE; the red velvet is on the smaller (and by smaller, I just mean flatter) side. ÊThe pancakes are definitely the most creative (and decadent) items on the menu, which reminds of Original Pancake House, supersized. ÊThey just need to add a bacon Belgian waffle to their menu ;) hint hint! Overall, it was a nice dining experience - friendly and efficient service, interesting menu, and good food. ÊIt's on the steeper side for breakfast, but then again you are buying entrees that essentially feed two. ÊI would recommend Griddle Cafe if you're looking for a big, diner-style breakfast place and especially if you have a sweet tooth.

4.5 stars. Yay! We had the "mom's french toast" along w/ a few other things, but the french toast was amazingly good! The red velvet pancake was too sweet but good. 1/2 a star off for a sticky table plus they have no real system in terms of waiting area. You're left standing next to the outdoor diners pretending not to eye their food and wishing they'd please hurry so you can eat. Friendly service & the price wasn't too bad. We'll definitely be back.

I'd been wanting to try Griddle Cafe since 2008 and was finally able to a couple of months ago, after convincing my friend to try it with me. ÊWe arrive around lunch time and there were still plenty of people waiting in line outside. ÊHowever, we only waited 10 minutes to be seated, when we were told ~30, so that was surprising. ÊThe host was also extremely friendly and not at all obnoxious or stuck-up as some reviewers mentioned. ÊThe restaurant isn't that big, and they really tried to make use of the space since they placed as many tables as they could, tightly together. ÊIt was pretty cramped. My friend and I were seated and our server was just as friendly and welcoming as the host was (and that alone, deserves another star). ÊHe attended to all my annoying questions on what he would recommend, what was popular, etc. etc. ÊI finally settled on Chicago Charlie's Scramble and a bagel with cream cheese and my friend ordered Poached y Papas Benedict. ÊMy dish was really good; it was plentiful, a much larger proportion than I'm used to, yet, I still managed to finish it all. ÊI didn't try my friends dish, so I can't comment on his. ÊI did notice several people's plates around me were extraordinarily proportioned and everything looked really sweet. ÊA lot of people also ordered the Red Velvet Pancakes, which were bigger than my face. ÊEverything looked great and yummy, however, everything also looked like it could give me diabetes in a split second. The bill came to around $40 (we also ordered OJ), which is pretty hefty considering I usually go to Denny's for breakfast-type meals. ÊOverall, I think Griddle is great, but because of the pricing, I probably wouldn't come back as often as I would like to. 3.5

Came here on a Tuesday morning with a friend. We got there just after it opened so no wait and lots of tables. The parking wasn't bad at that hour either. What can I say, for good food, I'm willing to get up earlier. My friend ordered their french toast while I had the nutella stuffed french toast. It was heavenly. However, the portions were quite huge that we could have shared it... if only we could have agreed on the same thing. We also ordered orange juice, which was delicious, but expansive. I don't think it's the concentrated stuff that they serve at IHOP or Denny's. : ) I made me miss my own juicer. The bill came out to be $40 (we also had a side of bacon). Not bad by LA standards.

The french toast doesn't need any extras!!! It was very crowded and tight. I arrived at 11am on a rainy week day. Thank goodness the line started to build after I was served!! ;-) I was a party of one so I sat at the bar. Some how I still managed to share my plate with an elder English man seated next to me, at least that's how it felt. Through conversation, I eventually found out that he was a local and frequents this cafe. I order an Irish latte that had alcohol added to it, what a mistake that was. I was venturing out, but WHOA, it was bad!!! BTW, I had leftovers, because one serving is more like two. Later that night, I toasted it in the oven and topped it with "Coconut Bliss" vanilla ice cream. Mmm... Call it what you want, I'm my own culinary chef!! *The service is fast *Free parking is in the back *Arrive early *You might bump into a witty old man with good conversation (although you might on food on your mind)

I read an article on Yahoo a few months ago about the country's best pancakes. It mentioned The Griddle Cafe. I came in with intentions to love the pancakes, but I was surprised that I fell head over heels in love with the french toast. After trying this place, I still think Flappy Jack's Pancake House in Glendora has my favorite pancakes. "Addicted to Noisella" Stuffed French Toast Ê(5 stars) - You had me at "hello." This was the first thing that caught my attention on the menu and was the best french toast I've ever had. It was like eating a warm nutella sandwich. It was so delicious and justified the wait. There was a generous serving of nutella that was just right. This is a nutella lover's breakfast dream. "Banana Nana" (4 stars) - The banana pancakes was another pick because it reminds me of one of my favorite Jack Johnson songs. It included slices of sweet bananas. The portions were so huge that it could probably feed a family of three or four. The pancakes were a thick, fluffy, and covered the circumference of the plate. We could not finish it and had great leftovers. Griddle Potatoes (2 stars) - My boyfriend ordered this because he loves potatoes. We were both disappointed. I wish it had more a crunch. However, it was nice to have it between bites of my nutella sugar rush. Mocha Latte (3.5 stars) - It was a great way to warm up, but I wish there was more chocolate flavor. Service (5 stars) - Although it was very busy, we never felt rushed. We received refills when needed. We told our server it was our first time, and he kindly pointed out the most popular menu items. Since three of us were sharing everything, he brought out extra plates for us. Wait (2 stars) - The wait sucks. This is why I've had this place bookmarked for a long time but very reluctant to go for that reason. There was an estimated 40 minute wait on a Saturday morning at 10:00 am. Luckily, we were seated sooner because we didn't mind sitting outside. We were desperate for breakfast, and we settled for the not so glamorous outdoor seating on Sunset. Aside from the wait, this place has great food, big portions, friendly service, and good prices. I will definitely return and would like to try the other menu items.

I have a list of places that I have to take people who are visiting the Los Angeles area. So far I only have two breakfast places on that list and 'The Griddle' is one of those places. It's such a cool place! The atmosphere is cool in an 'I'm not trying too hard' kind of way. The food Êtastes pretty good. The service is consistently Êgreat. Blah blah blah... none of those reasons have anything to do with why 'The Griddle' is as awesome as it is... The Griddle is as rad as it is because of their HUGE FREAKING PANCAKES!!! The truth is the truth. You've got to check out the pancakes. And make sure someone in your party orders Mom's French Toast (because it's amazing.) The other stuff is good, but you can get good food most anywhere. Is it worth the trip? An enthusiastic Yes.

This was my first visit and I am a fan!! I highly recommend sharing as the portions are HUMONGOUS!! There is a wait but all the good breakfast spots have waits on the weekends so this was not an issue and the wait wasn't too long. What we ate: Golden Ticket: Banana Nut Pancakes topped with carmel, brown sugar and whipped cream YUMMY!! Mounds of Pleasure:Chocolate Chip and Cocunut pancakes with whipped cream and powder sugar, DELICIOUS Nutella French Toast: So rich and tasty truly DEVINE Hash Browns: Nothing like some breakfast potatos that are simple, not too oily and grilled to perfection. I will be back but not too soon as I still have to lose the weight I gained in just this one sitting, we were crazy for not sharing but with soooo many delicious options it was hard to come to a consensus.

Even though my birth month has been over for a few days, Yelp buddy Daniel L was sweet to take me here for a belated birthday brunch.....with Nutella Stuffed French Toast! Yum! : D I've heard about the crazy wait here and the crowds, and luckily on this Thursday at 10:30am-ish, we had none of that. ÊWe scored a parking spot at a meter right smack in front of the place, walked right in, and were seated at a booth. Talk about starting this experience off right! Server Kristen was on spot with her service, and everything came out super fast and super yummy: Me: Hunger Pangs - but tweaked as so: 3 eggs over easy substitute the beef that comes on the tacos for the ham steak that usually comes with cottage cheese (comes with) sourdough toast (comes with) add a side of avocado Ok, I officially admit that I'm one of those picky eaters now. ÊI ordered this funky thing and requested no salt, and Kristen didn't bat one eye or raise one eyebrow. ÊAND everything came out perfect! DL: Gone Shrimping - a big plate of egg whites scrambled with pesto, garlicky shrimp, scallions, tomatoes and capers, with toast and a side of avocado. ÊThis was SUPER yummy! ÊThe capers really added a nice flavor, and the shrimp were plentiful and garlicky. ÊThe only thing we noticed was that the dish for some reason had a lot of watery sauce that collected on the plate underneath the eggs. ÊI have no idea what that was, but it was literally SOUPY. ÊStill delish though! To share: ÊAddicted To Noisella - Nutella stuffed between two huge slabs of french toast, topped with Êmore Nutella, powdered sugar and a ton of whipped cream. ÊOMG YES. ÊThis was amazing! ÊNot as overly sweet as it looked, super yummy and flavorful, this was an awesome dessert. ÊHow people eat this for breakfast and then even walk out the door and function is a mystery to me! I love that they have french press coffee here, but honestly for as dark as my decaf looked, I think it should have been stronger. ÊAnd yes, I did let it steep long enough : /. ÊI do like my coffee strong! Daniel had an herbal tea and it came in its own tea press - which was a nice touch. The only reason I don't give this place 5 stars is because it's pretty loud, and we left smelling like we sat directly in front of the grill the entire time. ÊWhich really won't stop me from coming back here, because this place is not known for an ambience that's anything different from what it is. So yes, I'd definitely come back - during the week.....when there's not a crowd! Thanks Griddle Cafe and Daniel L - my bday brunch was sweet : D

THE GOOD: Absolutely massive, delicious, incredibly unhealthy dreamy breakfast dishes. My dreams were actualized with a strong tummy ache after eating here. Sinful. I WILL BE BACK. THE BAD: It's in Los Angeles. It's always packed so there's always a wait. The restaurant is rather loud and cramped. IN CONCLUSION: YES, you do want to eat here. I absolutely assure you. Again, the portions are enormous and you might as well be eating cake for breakfast so a stack of pancakes or french toast can easily be shared between two people. Go to the Griddle and be a glutton.

Definitely happy that I finally got around to checking out this place. While I'm not generally a breakfast guy, I heard the magic words "shrimp tacos" in several reviews of this place, which grabbed my attention. Count. Me. In. Checked it out today with a buddy as we cried in our Diet Cokes about our respective unemployments, and both of us really enjoyed our lunches. He got a grilled club which came out what seemed like four minutes after we ordered... my shrimp tacos in some spicy tequila sauce came out a minute later. Bottom line: Big, tasty food... reasonably priced... sexy male servers (may have been coincidence)... low-key vibe. Will definitely be back.

Loooove me some diabetes. Although I'm not normally a "breakfast" person, the red velvety (soft cake-like but not overly sweet, fluffy like clouds) pancakes had my tastebuds singinggggg. Layered on with all crazy types of sugar, the ONE pancake (for quite a price) already had me stuffed. Thennnn I really had to unbutton my pants (not literally ...) when I also ordered a Poached y Papas benedict to go along with the pancakes. (Gotta balance salty & sweet, ya know)? But thick slice of cut ham, drowned under the eggs benedict with crisp potatoes at the bottom, I nearly ate to my death. But I couldn't stop... bite after bite. This glorious meal was give or take $20. Just share dishes, because there's no way to finish a whole gigantic pancake or french toast anyway. The downsides were it was pretty stuffy & sticky inside, and it is pretty hefty prices--then again it is a hefty portion. * APPROACH HABANERO SAUCE WITH CAUTION. i dipped the teeny tip on my fork in it with curiosity and my mouth caught on FIRE.

Do not, I repeat, do not come here without someone to split your meal with! ÊPortions are beyond ridiculous... ÊI've seen some crazy stacks of pancakes in my day, but these took the cake! Ê I actually ordered shrimp soft tacos as I was already in a lunch mood while the bf ordered the pancakes. ÊI made it about halfway through my dish, and the boy, who usually cleans his plate and then eats my tables scraps, was only able to fit 1/3 of that crazy stack in his stomach. Pancakes are obviously a specialty here and they have some very unique recipes. ÊMy concern with all the desserty descriptions is that they'd be overly sweet, but the pancakes he chose were perfectly balanced and tasted like rich banana nut bread bathed in butter... (these actually became our dinner later that evening.) I don't even want to think about how many calories are in those things. ÊLets just say we had to take turns carrying the to-go box home to give each other's arms a break!

One of my good friends was back in town and visiting me in LA, so I thought we would try this place out for brunch. I'm always on the hunt for good brunch places, and this definitely hit the spot. It was fairly busy for a Thursday morning, but we didn't really have to wait because a table opened up as we got there. We looked around to see what people had ordered.... the portion sizes were huge. We decided we would share one savory and one sweet dish. Thus, the order consisted of the Poached y Papas Benedict and Mom's French Toast. The Poached y Papas had 2 poached eggs served on top of a large piece of baked ham that sat on top of 3 potato skins. We asked for the Hollandaise sauce on the side, and good thing we did. This plate was pretty jam packed with a lot of elements, and the sauce was pretty heavy. The three ingredients went well together because the eggs were soft and had a milder flavor mixed with the firmer and saltier flavor of the ham along with the crispy and starchy texture of the potato. The sauce lightly dripped on top is a nice touch. Mom's French Toast was also amazing and each bite was quite addicting. It always left me wanting more. The toast was soft and fluffy, but still held it's form. The butter ball that sat on top melted and spread on the top layer, adding that nice butter flavor. There wasn't any need for extra syrup, the french toast was already sweet enough and had powdered sugar on it. You get two really large pieces, great for sharing. Service was really good for ordering and food came out relatively fast, it just took a little longer to get the bill squared away. We were also to find street parking a block over. Wouldn't mind coming back to this place, especially when I want a good hardy breakfast.

Deliciously humongous portions! My only compliant is that people there waste food like there's no tomorrow. Why are you going to a place to pay a lot of a giant plate of food and only eat two bites of it? If I ever go back to LA it's definitely on my list to return to. Apparently waiting 20 minutes for a table is the norm there.

Judging by the high quantity and quality reviews of this place I had high expecting for this place and I have to say, I was not let down. There is a reason that this place is consistently fulled to the brim. ÊWe came at 10:30am on a Wednesday and luckily there was one booth still open. ÊFor the whole hour we were there every single seat was filled and people were lined up out the door. ÊThere's no worries here that the food is made to order considering how busy this place is. As it was my first time here I decided to play it safe and try out what everyone else has said was good: Red Velvet Pancakes. ÊPersonally, I found it to be a little too sweet for me and thus had to wipe off the cream and the powder that was on it. ÊNot to say that the pancake wasn't wow-ingly good but I can only eat that thing in moderation lol. ÊAlso they are very different then the ones served at the Larchmount Bungalow, with these being more like pancakes. We also decided to order the Tequila Sunrise. ÊO...M...G...that thing hit the spot. ÊEggs, check. Spicy chicken sausage, check. CheeseS, check. ÊRefriend beans, oh hells yea. ÊReally my only small grip with it was that I wished the tortilla Êwas not as hard, but other then that it was superb. Ê As for the drink I got a regular coffee, which was kind of nice as you get a choice of light, medium, or dark coffee that comes in its own french press. I would definitely come check this place out if you are in the area however be expecting a wait if you are coming at peak times.

Please try suffocate me to death with a pillow bigger then the size of your face, a pillow bigger then the size of the plate. A pillow known as the griddle pancake. You could probably kill a man with the Massive amounts of pancake they give you in that order! ÊBut try and kill me.... And I will survive!!! I will eat my way to safety. Although this order of pancakes takes me about 3 days to get through by myself.. I know I will not starve. ... I've been here a couple times. And once I saw Ian ziring however it's spelled. The dude from 90210. But anyways... if there's a long line wait. If there's rain, wait. If there is homeless man licking your toes, wait. The point is, wait. The fruits of your pains will be rewarded. This place really is that good. So wait. Everything here is pretty much good. So don't worry it's not just a pancake destination Tip: you can order a half order of the pancakes. Unless you're gonna share. Don't order it for yourself. There's too much.

Eh, bad on me for going to a place legendary for their french toast and ordering an egg special instead. I knew better. And I still did it. My small french press medium roast coffee ($2.95) was possibly one of the best cuppa joe I've had at a coffee shop/ diner, like ever. So serious about the coffee quality that you can opt for light, medium or dark roast in your press. Take that with some cream and sugar. The "Some Like It Hot" scramble was pretty lack luster. I'm surprised any place in the heart of skinny central could offer up such a calorie bomb. Folded in between a few scrambled eggs was about a pound of spicy mayo, a mound of jack cheese, and half a hog of spicy chicken sausage. I mean, I like me a fat bomb just like anyone else, but this really was too much. The added calories just didn't add any flavor, and I secretly yearned for a little extra pico de gallo just to freshen up the plate and hoped a lipo machine was tucked away in the closet. My lesson here is stick to what Griddle Cafe is known for... y'ah know, shit that comes off the griddle and your pretty much guaranteed a good time. Stray and you too might be posting a 3 star review.

Hands down best breakfast place in We Ho period...as long as you get there before the crowds...actually, even if you have to wait-its worth it. I always promise myself that i will try something new but hubbie and I always get the same thing and share...strawberry waffles and the hanging over the plate ham steak with a loaf of hash browns:) and excellent french pressed coffee! The service is always fast paced and friendly, the food always pleases and the vibe is cool!

I met fellow Yelper Daniel L here on a Sunday morning. We got there around 9AM and there was still a line of people waiting. I think we waited about 30 minutes before we were seated at the counter inside. If I wasn't so hungry I probably would have waited to sit outside because it's really cramp and loud inside. We ordered the Red Velvet PanCAKE and the Poached y Papas Benedict to share. I also got an order of their French Press Coffee, medium roast. The coffee had a great flavor and just a slight bitterness before I added my sugar. The benedict came out first and it was a lot of food. I loved the crunchiness of the potato skins and the hollandaise sauce was really rich. I liked the flavor but probably would have ordered the sauce on the side the next time. It was a lot and it kinda made the potato skins soggy. The poached eggs were nice and runny and brought out the sauce even more. The Red Velvet Pancake was really good but the cream cheese icing was way too sweet for me. I liked how they put powdered cocoa on top since the pancake itself didn't have that chocolate flavor. As I'm writing this I'm already trying to plan my next trip. My sister sent me an article a few days after my visit about a new off-menu item....Hot Chocolate French Toast!!! http://www.urbandaddy.coÉ YEA you know you want some of that! If anyone tries it before I do please let me know how it is!

This is probably the best place I've ever been to for pancakes! ÊMy friend and I arrived about fifteen minutes after they opened and it was already pretty crowded, which I took to be a good sign. ÊWe were seated quickly and the servers were all so friendly. ÊMy only complaint would be that the tables are all very close to one another because the restaurant is in a small space to begin with. ÊI felt like we were sharing a meal with the couple that sat next to us! My friend and I split "A Time To Love" pancake and the Red Velvet pancake. ÊA Time To Love was my favorite. ÊIt smelled exactly like how I would picture a warm, fire-crackling-in-the-fireplace, holiday evening would smell like. ÊIt was heavenly! ÊThe red velvet pancake wasn't as good as A Time To Love, but at the same time, it had a lot to live up to! ÊAlthough, I still thought it was pretty amazing that they managed to have a red velvet cake taste in the form of a pancake. ÊThe Griddle Cafe is definitely in my top breakfast stops and I look forward to going back!

Be prepared to wait. ÊAnd wait. ÊAnd wait.... ÊBut the question is, is it worth the wait? ÊAbso-fucking-lutely. Came here for Saturday brunch. ÊI had driven by this place dozens of times, and after having read reviews on yelp, I really wanted to experience it just once. ÊI parked at a 2 hour spot on Fairfax, and my party of 3 was quoted a 50 minute wait time. ÊWe headed to the Coffeebean across the street, and decided to be patient. ÊAfter 45 minutes came and went, we checked in with the host... it was going to be awhile longer. ÊAfter having waited as long as we did, it's not like we could've left, we already invested the time. ÊIt's the Griddle Conundrum. We finally got seats at the counter. ÊIt's a tight squeeze, but I was there for the comfort food, not the spatial comfort. ÊI ordered the Golden Ticket, whilst my friends ordered benedicts.... really, we waited this long, and they weren't even going to order pancakes? ÊAnywho, it was amazing. ÊEverything I wanted in a pancake. ÊBanana, Caramel, Walnuts, Streusel - YUM!! Ê But it's dense. ÊI could barely eat half of one. ÊIt was all too much. ÊI had it boxed up. ÊWhen I came home though, and told my roomie about the griddle adventure, she let me know that I could've ordered just 1 pancake. ÊSeriously?! ÊI wish they had advertised that, because really, one would've sufficed. Ê I did enjoy the pancakes for about 3 days afterwards. ÊNo joke -- they held up pretty good. My friend, who ordered the "Poached y Papas" benedict wanted me to warn all of you that if you add the $1 avocado to your breakfast, all you get is a measly quarter of an avocado. ÊYou've been duly warned. One of the best things? ÊAfter having been at the Griddle for about 3 hours (incl. wait time), I came back to my car and there was no ticket.... life can be truly sweet sometimes.

MY FAVORITE BREAKFAST PLACE IN LOS ANGELES. peanut bubbbbbbbaaaaaaaa. enough said. it is the best french toast. They have huge portions. Always plan on sharing. The french toasts are for those who have a sweet tooth. The pancakes are ridiculously large. Getting them is more like a novelty. I like all their egg dishes. It depends on what you're in the mood for. I like the one with shrimp and capers. It's light & salty, so it balances the heaviness of the french toast when you're sharing. I've never even considered having lunch here before and I've always seen a celebrity here.

In all of my years stomping across continents in different cities, I have never had a breakfast as good as The Griddle's. ÊThe variety is extraordinary, and inevitably I get a crush on my swaggering actor-waiter, which is a pity because they're all straight. But that adds to the charm and the sense of longing, both for a perfect breakfast and a hunny like that to come home to.

When I was in L.A. I few months back just to see the sights the GF mentioned Griddle Cafe as a place on our must hit Yelp list. ÊDamn was I happy she mentioned it, because Griddle Cafe has supplanted itself as being the greatest breakfast meal I have ever had. ÊWalking inside the place seemed small but with a lively room of people and a bar inside, the place had a style all it's own. ÊWe ordered "The Red Velvet panCAKE" which appeared in front of me as one giant plate covered entirely by one red pancake that had swirls of whipped cream cheese on top and powered sugar. ÊOne bite and I swear my life changed, mountains moved and I had reached food nirvana. ÊI had red velvet pancakes before but nothing so perfectly sweet and full flavored as Griddle's, and the whipped cream cheese seemed to be just better than and other red velvet cupcake/pancake I had ever had. Finally, when I was all ready won over by the Red Velvet panCAKE, the place just had to steam roll me with joy with the second entre we ordered, the "Poached y Papas" Benedict. ÊIt's my ritual to always ordered eggs benedict the first time I eat at a new breakfast place because it's my favorite breakfast meal and this eggs benedict is the holy grail of benedicts. ÊPotato skins that are covered with baked ham, poached eggs, avocado and hollandaise sauce. Sounds simple, but the harmony of the flavor just knocked me back and from that point on this place could do no wrong. ÊNow every time I order red velvet pancakes or eggs benedict back here in the greater Chicagoland area a part of me is saddened by the fact that they will never live up to Griddle Cafe. ÊWhich is fine with me, because Griddle Cafe alone makes me want to book a flight back to L.A. whenever possible. Must Try: - "Red Velvet" panCAKE - "Poached y Papas" Benedict Tips: - If you are yearning to see a celebrity of the A/B/C/D list caliber on any occasion, going here might make you happy.

The Bar Method. Boot camp. PX90. These are all activities you should probably consider engaging in to redeem the body after having a breakfast affair at the Griddle Cafe. OH, yes it is an affair alright.. a definite cheat on the New Years Rezzy. Gotta do a lot to have the body forgive you for straying, but... eating here is so worth it! There are so many excellent breakfast places in SoCAL, but now the torch for favorite has been passed to the Griddle Cafe. It is my breakfast of champions.. My favorite dish? Some Like It Hot scramble. Chicken tequila sausage, avocado, loads of spice.. It is my idea of the perfect omelette, Love the tangy lime yet spicy chipotle kick! The red-velvet pancakes were phenomenal.. it definitely is better than the ones from the Buttermilk truck. Such a good breakfast dessert! I've been here twice, and although the menu features many different items.. I can't help but keep reordering the Some Like It Hot scramble. I simply am in love!! My boyfriend also loves this place too.. in fact, the second time around he ordered *2* breakfast entrees. The portions are humongous here and yet he finished it all. This place is teeny tiny located in the prime real estate of Sunset Blvd in WeHo, crossing La Cienega Blvd, next to the Screen Writer's Guild. Thank GOD for free parking -- though the lot is probably bigger than the actual restaurant itself. The wait is pretty insane -- 45+ minutes on Sunday mornings. If you're a claustrophobe, you won't do well here since the seating is tight. In fact, you might be seated around the "bar" which looks like a converted sushi / hibachi bar. Happy eating!!

Griddled it up here for the 2nd time, and it was a-ok. As Helen J. mentioned, there's free parking behind the cafe, next to the Rite Aid on the southwest side of Fairfax. ÊThe valet stand up front says Rite Aid, but you can park there, too. ÊJust tell him you're there for Griddle Cafe, and he'll remind you to get it validated. Upon walking in, the sweet, sweet man cleaning the tables and seating the customers charmed me into being his biggest fan. Ê"Hi, Gorgeous (yes, gorgeous with a capital G)! ÊDid I validate that for you, Gorgeous?! Ê*stamps ticket* ÊIf you need another hour, you just let me know, ok?" ÊNow I know that if I ever need a quick pick-me-up, I'll just hop on over to him. My friend who was visiting has a major sweet tooth and wanted to try as much as she could. ÊSo, in addition to her teeny side of one egg, and her side of cinnamon apples, she got a too-sweet Red Velvet pancake and a sweetened-just-right Time to Love pancake. ÊThe waitress was great and let her know that she could order just one pancake for A Time to Love (the Red Velvet only comes as one pancake) since she noticed how small my friend was and how big her order was. :o) Ê I ordered the Muscle Bound Scramble with turkey sausage, and when it came out, I realized that this was exactly what I had ordered the first time I came here. ÊGuess I loooove muscles. ÊThere was a weird herb taste that I couldn't pinpoint in the dish. ÊI probably won't be ordering this again if I ever head back here. Overall, I'm not sure how soon I'll be back to overindulge in the food. ÊBut I'll definitely be back to overindulge in the host's sweet nothings. Ê;o)

Don't bother going hungry on the weekend unless it's around closing time, this small space is always packed like sardines. Weekday mid-morning is much better if you must try it out. ÊAbove average prices for mediocre, overrated pancakes and breakfast food. Some of their items LOOK amazing but the taste disappoints. The service (or lack thereof) may test your patience at times, due to the overcrowding. ÊBottom line, if you want an overwhelming variety of truly DELICIOUS pancakes that don't make you feel gross after consuming, hop over to Cici's Cafe in Encino, you won't regret it.

The definition of the LA breakfast scene is here. If you come to LA you have to come here and eat the huge stuffed pancakes. Have them pulled Nutella inside also.

If you're ever in the position where you have to gain 20 lbs in a few days then this is the place for you. The portions are gigantic, not that I'm complaining. We ordered the Golden Ticket and shared it. Between two hungry adults who have been known to consume mass amounts of food, we ate MAYBE a quarter of the dish. This is good, though, because now we have breakfast for a week. I really like the individual french presses. The dark roast was wonderful, and I'm a coffee snob. The one star off is for the 'cattle call' feel. I understand why they have to do things the way they do, but still. I do appreciate that the host remembered everyone's name. That's impressive.

Best pancakes in LA hands down. I know because I'm a pancake fanatic and I've tried almost every pancake in LA. My fave is the "Scotch on the Rocks" which has coconut, butterscotch chips, pecans and oats - OMG SO GOOD... and SOOOO BIG! Make sure to just order ONE pancake (trust me) if you don't specify they bring 3 - which is enough to feed a small army. Last time I went I decided to get adventurous and also order the french toast. It was good - but wasted space in my stomach where there could have been more pancake. Don't waste your time on anything but pancakes here. Although everything I've tried is good (omelets etc) you will want to spend all your times on the flap jacks - trust me. The only (and HUGE) con to this place is on the weekends it's freakin PACKED. Expect a 2 hour+ wait no matter what time you go and a very cranky host. My suggestion is to play hooky from work and go on a weekday or go before you are hungry. They close at 4 so get there early. Parking is either find a meter on the street (limited) or in the big lot (shared with Rite-Aid in the back. There's a parking guy there now, but The Griddle validates.

Went today for the first time and everything was great until we paid our check. Less than 10 minutes later, we were unceremoniously asked to leave because we were taking up valuable table space. God forbid you'd like to finish your conversation with your table mate before you leave. I guess hospitality is dead. The food and service was fine, but the kick out the door at the end ensured I would never come back.

I think I had this place bookmarked as a place to try for way too long because I was expecting some heaven in my mouth. I'm a really big fan of Red Velvet so when I first came across The Griddle Caf and saw that they had Red Velvet pancakes I was super excited! ÊI've been dreaming about this for months now! ÊAll of that Red Velvet goodness for breakfast? ÊI can just pee my pants from excitement!! I was prepared for the long wait but lucky for us we only had to wait about 30 minutes ish... not too shabby for a Saturday morning! ÊOnce you get inside the restaurant you can see the workers hustling to get you in and out as fast as they can so that others can be seated. I ordered the Red Velvet pancakes and a side of bacon. ÊThe pancakes itself did taste like the Red Velvet cupcakes, just not as sweet. ÊHowever, I was a bit disappointed with the cream that they used for the pancakes; it was a little too sweet for my taste. ÊI really liked the Red Velvet pancake concept and as much as I love Red Velvet anything I wouldn't get this again. ÊI love desserts; I just don't know how I feel about having a large amount of it for breakfast... again. My date ordered the Tequila Sunrise. ÊI couldn't decide if I liked that dish or not. ÊSwitching from my sweet Red Velvet to his Mexican style breakfast kind of threw my taste buds off balance. ÊBut he said he liked it and that he could kind of taste the tequila! I'm glad I finally got to try the Red Velvet pancakes and that I can finally take this off of my bookmarks. I don't know if I would go out of my way to dine at Griddle's again, but if I do, I'd probably try their French toast... I hear it's too die for!

HUGE pancake portions. Just know that going in. ONE order of pancakes easily feeds TWO starving people. I just got the Ol' Fashioned Buttermilk, three in a stack, each pancake probably a foot in diameter. Wow, these were sweet. Even without maple syrup. They must put a good amount of sugar in the batter. The texture of these pancakes aren't spongy, but they aren't really heavy and dense either. I'd say they're really "cakey." (they do serve red velvet panCAKES after all) The breakfast griddle potatoes are pretty basic, but good nonetheless. Sliced onion amid par-boiled, then fried potatoes. The prices were pretty good too. You get a lot of food for the money, and my pancakes were only $8 anyway. I've been meaning to try this place for months, and finally got to it today. Overall, I'd say this place is a quintessential LA hole-in-the-wall style diner. I'll definitely be back again sometime.

This place is very popular, probably because it serves american brunch classics in mammoth portions for reasonable prices. However, if you are not a fan of strong flavors with lots of sugar and fat, you will not be as enamored with this food as most are. In addition, it is strongly recommended to stay within the limited selection that this joint is known for, straying at all can lead to very disappointing results. The pancake suggestions are red velvet or oreo. We went oreo, aka Black Magic, and were quite pleased. The pancakes themselves are a bit chewy but the large chunks of oreos which make up half the cakes combined with the generous amounts of whipped cream made for a very tasty and decadent experience. The portion is massive, enough for two to share. In addition the egg-platter with thick-cut bacon and fresh fruit is a very tasty main course. The best bacon is usually thick-cut and this followed suit, being both meaty and crispy to bite into. Also the fruit tasted surprisingly fresh for a diner. For french toast we tried the peanut butter. And while it was not bad, the extremely heavy and powerfully flavored PB toast paled in comparison to the oreo plate next to it. The thick PB coating made it a bit hard to chew and swallow; and that heaviness made it harder to go back for another bite. Most of the plate was left ignored. The shrimp-pesto eggs was the second main course to be sampled. It was definitely not a staple selection from the menu. And for good reason. It was not good. While the pb toast had some redeeming factors, this really didn't and it was quickly pushed aside. Strongly recommended if you are craving certain pancakes & simple bacon & eggs. Not so much if you're looking for anything else.

This place is very good. The pancakes are huge and so delicious! I recommend that you get one order of pancake for at least two people. Eating an order of pancakes by yourself is TOO much. The oreo pancakes are good and also the blueberry ones. I had a salad and it was good. It was big so I took at least half of it home. My small group girls had a burger and a sandwich and it was good too! The fries are the big thick ones. yummy! Parking I believe is in the back? Correct me if I am wrong. I parked on the street and it was not hard to find. :) I will definitely come back here to eat some YUMMY pancakes with friends. ps. Service is great and the price is very reasonable.

Yum, The Griddle Cafe in West Hollywood is delish! Just want to warn you the portions are HUGE (pancakes the size of a car steering wheel), I loved the buttermilk and Teacher's Pet" pancakes. This place is crowded all of the time so prepare for a wait. I highly recommend this place.

I love places that serves coffee in a french press and it wasn't watered down either. I had the banana pancake and wow it's freakin huge just order that and split with two people. It was pretty good not crazy about it. I saw some crazy sweet looking pancakes more like a dessert My bf had a cranberry turkey sandwich and it was disgusting, the cranberry sauce was sour as hell it was just gross. do not order that!

This is one the best places for breakfast/lunch in LA. It was 10 mintues from where I lived and every Saturday me and my boyfriend would go here for breakfast/lunch. You will not be disappointed. But if you go late there will be a wait time of at least an hour. But it so worth the wait.

Expect to wait..and wait...and wait....for a table. This is a small hole in the wall restaurant that serves some damn good pancakes in enormous quantity and size. ÊThe problem is, everybody knows about it so you're going to have to wait for a table or seating at the breakfast bar. Ê They're known for their Red Velvet Pancake but I couldn't get myself to order it because I thought it would be too sweet for breakfast. ÊInstead, I ordered ONE SLICE of the "Recess Time" pancake and the Fiesta Scramble. ÊThe "Recess Time" Pancake was fantastic. ÊIf you like coffee cakes then you'll love the "Recess Time" pancake. ÊI think I would have been able to devour TWO slices if I hadn't ordered the Fiesta Scramble. ÊThe Fiesta Scramble on the other hand was just average. ÊIt's served with half plate full of salsa chips. ÊThe eggs were served in a scramble of chiles, onions, jack cheese, olives, sour cream and some salsa. ÊNothing too special or too tasty. ÊI think if you're going to visit the Griddle Caf you need to order some pancake or French toast. Service is really good and they move fast (from the host to the servers). ÊThe guys there are always checking up on you and even though they are moving extremely fast they have this calm look about them so you know they have everything under control. Ê FYI, don't park in the garage across the street, Griddle Caf does not validate the parking ticket. ÊGriddle apparently has their own parking towards the back of the restaurant. Parking in the garage across the street cost me $3 on a Monday afternoon. Ê Other option, street park.

I like to do some research when I go on vacation. ÊSo I found Griddle Cafe on Yelp's Top 2010 List in L.A. I planned my breakfast all the way from Chicago. ÊOur breakfast game plan is always get one sweet & one savory. -Red Velvet Pancakes: The best I have EVER had. If you are a red velvet lover like me. You will LOVE it! -Poached y Papas Benedict: I have dreams about the ham on top of the potato skins all the way from Chicago. When I go back to L.A., Griddle Cafe is a MUST!

First time here... Been meaning to come for a while after seeing this place on the yelp homefront... Parking was fine Didn't find out til later about the parking in the back. The door opens and I begin to drool mmmmmmm food. Seriously the smell is awesome. The only downside was this place was pretty cramped up. So we waited for about 15 min to get our breakfast hehe (please note I'm not a big breakfast person). I ordered the Benedict and the bf orders the banana nana pancake. Banana nana pancakes- awesome soo huge.. Each bite has bananas yay but seriously it was good not overly sweet even w all the syrup that was poured on it. The Benedict was sent back due to a hair in the avocado ;( so I sit here writing this review while waiting for my food to come back.. ok now I'm at home finishing up my review. Êmy food came back and really the only thing that stuck with me was the bacon. 4 long strips of thick crunchy bacon. not salty at all mm.. poured mines over syrup and it came perfecto~ the only downside to the benedict was the sauce. to much and to heavy :( but the ham the eggs the potatoes!!!!! i love this place. The service was whatever everything was a bit rushed. but I understand why. You stay in line for about 15 minutes to get in and as you're standing there you are thinking why the hell isnt the service going faster so you can sit...you get what you paid for! hahahaha overall it was good. nothing to sweet not to salty (minus the ham) only downside is that it was a bit cramped..

Came here for brunch for my friend's birthday and enjoyed the experience. We went at 1030 so there was about a half hour wait, which wasn't as bad as I expected it to be given it was a saturday. When we were seated I noticed this place is packeddddd worse than a can of sardines! And no one seemed to care! Cuz I guess they're that good! I ordered a single black magic, which was the Oreo filled pancake ($7), my bf the creme de la creme French toast ($12) and our friend got the golden ticket ($11) with the full stack of 3 pancakes. Seriously, I think we would have just been fine with only ordering the golden ticket and splitting it amongst the three of us. As delicious as our three individual orders were, I only finished a quarter of my ONE pancake, (embarrassing, I know), my bf only finished half of his French toast, and our friend only conquered one out of the 3 golden tickets. It is seriously insane portions per serving. As far as everything else goes, the food comes out quick and the service is fast and efficient so they get people in and out of here pretty quickly. You don't feel rushed though, which is nice, and the servers are all super friendly here as well. Next time I visit here, I'm splitting something though :p.

The first time I came here, I was hooked on their amazing French toast! Since then, I've gone back numerous times. The wait was just about right, and the waiters were quite friendly. So far I've tried quite a variety of dishes amongst their enormous array of selections. "Mom's French Toast" - The name literally speaks for itself, that sweet and abundant taste that just melts in your mouth. I fell in love. "Creme de la creme" French Toast - Amazing if you're a cheesecake lover because it is literally toppled and drizzled with cheesecake topping along with the graham cracker crust that just seals the deal. "Caballero" If you came with a huge appetite and wanted something aside from the average breakfast then I would recommend checking out this HUGE breakfast burrito looking monster! It will feed about two depending on your appetite. What got me most was the mouth watering chorizo. mmmmm :P "Poached Y Papas" Benedict - I can honestly say first thought It didn't look as appetizing but the minute you dig right in, the taste just all came together. The hollandaise sauce and the seasoned potato skins just made baked ham taste 10x's better no joke. I of course dipped mine in ketchup as well just to add to it =) "Omelette "My Soul" - We decided to get ours with steak, and on top of that it was toppled with sour cream, avocados, and fresh delicious salsa. Can you say enticing? yes, VERY =P Ê "Mama Mia" - I'm not much of a burger person, but this was pretty darn good. The garlic sauteed tomatoes definitely added the flavor to one juicy burger. So far thats all I've got, but I will be returning for more amazing and juicy details regarding my griddle cafe journey. In the mean time, please indulge and enjoy :)

I went here on a Thursday around 1pm. No wait!! *whew* There's a Rite Aid next door, and i parked in the their back parking lot- which i know i'm not supposed to bc the sign clearly said RITE AID PARKING ONLY, but i was fine! LOL :) it is always so hard to find parking in hollywood. there was 5 of us girls. we got a booth. service was quick & good. very casual but personable! we shared the plates bc i wanted to try everything. the portions are HUGE. must constantly state that. huge portions! *SOME LIKE IT HOT SCRAMBLED* (chicken tequila sausage, jack cheese, & tequila spiked ranchero sauce topped w/ pico de gallo, avo, & spicy chipotle sauce & seasoned tortilla chips on side) - it was very good. full of flavor. i didn't find it spicy, but i can take heat. i put some extra hot haberno sauce on it too. delicious! the tortilla chips were seasoned, very good. & salty. *GRILLED SHRIMP & PESTO MELT* (grilled shrimp, we got cheese on the side, grilled spinich, capers, & basil pesto sauce on french bread with fries on the side) - delicious!! pesto and shrimp is a great combo together! i had a quarter of the sandwich and it was satisfying enough! and Ê the side of fries that came with it was a huge portion! *RED VELVET PANCAKES* - wow?! just wow. first off, this is perfectly split for 4 people. so delicious. don't mix the cream cheese icing and sugar on top together, just cut a piece and go in for it. SO GOOD. my friends and i loved this place! i can't wait to come here again! but i def gotta save it for a time when i am hungry because i was full for the rest of the day!! :) there's a tv to watch games/shows. and i got the french press coffee, that was so good and i finished it all by myself.

The Griddle made me a breakfast believer. I've always been that diner who leaned towards the lunch side of brunch, and frowned if breakfast was suggested. Ê No more. ÊThe Griddle has converted me to a breakfast fare lover. Thanksgiving Pancake - I thought this would be overwhelmingly sweet but turned out to be just the filling au-naturale. ÊNot super sweet at all. Banana Pancake - I almost started singing Jack Johnson. ÊJust enough banana to batter ratio. Kicking and Screaming Breakfast Tacos - the chipotle sauce makes it. ÊAsk for extra. You'll thank me later. Burrito - A ginormous breakfast burrito. Classic filling. ÊAsk for the chipotle sauce from the Kicking and Screaming Tacos. Benedict - the potato skins were creative, but they were cooked a little too much for my taste. ÊThey ended up too hard. French Press Coffee - Free refills! ÊDelish! ÊThey have Light, Medium, and Dark roast available, but I recommend the dark roast. Go breakfast!

Was up in Beverly Hills for the weekend a couple weeks ago, and me liking breakfast, i jumped on Yelp and this place was first to come up in area. Upon arriving in East Hollywood area of Sunset Strip, we see a line on Sunset about 15 people deep and here the wait is 30 minutes on a Sunday morning at around noon. K, the wait was worth it.

ÊTye french press coffee was also very good even though it looked very dark, wish I knew the brand. Ê I would recommend staying away from any meat here. ÊThe bacon was not very good and the huge ham slice my wife had was on the dry side. I wish I lived closer so I could enjoy the diabetic coma of every one of their pancake choices.

Bf and I came pretty early on a friday morning and didn't have to wait too long, surprisingly. They first wanted to seat us outside. Uh, this IS LA, so that's a no go. They're also on a main street, in LA, so that's even worse. We were seated at the horse-shoe counter like thingy, and 2 minutes later in came Anna Faris (scary movie!!) and two buddies. And they were seated right next to us. And we had a conversation. And I'm pretty sure they loved us. Anywho. I ordered the poached y papas benedict and goddamn if you can finish this, you're a beast. And you also will need to go to the gym for like 3 hours, for a whole week. The thick cut ham is so good, but the potato skins can end up weighing your belly down. Regardless, DELISH. Bf ordered the apple cobbler french toast and it was good, but extremely sweet. Anna Faris' guy buddy ordered pancakes, and literally only finished what was the size of the outline of his fist/wrist. If that makes sense. Either way, he didn't even eat half and he was stuffed to the max.

OMG OMG OMG....I'm in HEAVEN! So worth the wait. And ladies, plenty of eye candy as well. I think the owner recruited the servers from an Abercrombie ad. Maybe they should all go shirtless! Lol jk. I wouldn't be able to eat. Or maybe I'd go just to drink...coffee that is. I trusted my fellow yelpers and went with the Benedict. MELT IN YOUR MOUTH DELICIOUSNESS! instead of muffins it was served on potato skins! The texture, flavors and richness were perfect. Not skimpy on the the ham either, thick goodness. Sauce perfectly distributed with perfect texture and a flavor that never got boring. I promised myself that I will return for the Red Velvet Pancakes. Table next to us ordered it and I almost begged for a bite but it's Hollywood (we're too classy for that) so didn't do it this time but you can be sure that as Arnold would say "I WILL BE BACK!!!" Irish Creme Latte was deliciousness as well. Perfect amount of Bailey's and whip cream piled high. The bottom did start to get too sweet once whip cream was finished but that didn't stop my fatass, sipping water in between so I could keep going. I love The Griddle.

I just absolutely LOVE this place! I was back in town and I just HAD to come here. I came with a friend, and if she didn't want to come I would've just came by myself anyway- that's how much I love this place. Luckily she came because we ordered everything that I want and shared it. Came in Saturday at 10AM and still had to wait 45 minutes for a table- but totally worth the wait. We got seated at the bar area, and the waiter that took care of us was funny and awesome. RED VELVET PANCAKE IS A MUST HAVE!! I'm soo excited to see that on their menu permanently. It tasted just like a red velvet cake. One complaint would be their cream cheese- it was overly sweetened. NUTELLA FRENCH TOAST was soo good! I loove nutella, so in my book you can't go wrong with anything that has nutella in it. CHARLIE SCRAMBLE is my favorite savory thing they have on that menu. It's soo good- the egg, meat, onions, cheese, garlic- everything i love! I was definitely on a sugar rush after my meal, and luckily we ordered something savory to attempt to balance out all the sugar.

no wait for us on a friday morning at 10am and easy parking behind the griddle cafe, same lot as the rite aid, but I can see how at other busier times, this place can get frustrating. They validate and the parking attendant was chill. Apparently booze in the morning was necessary for my friends (mimosa and bloody mary...standard, not very stiff) but I opted for some fresh squeezed oj. French toast...YES! We all shared an order and we all agreed it was amazing. My bf got shrimp tacos and ate it ALL and said they served a good amount of shrimp. Another friend got some egg white scramble with spinach and maple turkey sausage and she enjoyed the flavor of everything as well but wasn't a fan of the sausage too much. Her bf got something along the lines of "some like it hot" and it looked like a peppery scramble which he loved! Lastly I got a standard 2 eggs, bacon and potatoes which was great for me but I wasn't a huge fan of the potatoes and left more than half on my plate. Overall, everything was great, the french toast stands out the most to me...LOVED IT! If you like french toast, get it! You won't regret it! The pancakes looked crazy good so next time we make a trip to LA, Griddle Cafe will be on the list!

They should call this place "Times Four". Because each pancake dish can feed up to four people. ÊSeriously! My 9 year-old was half-traumatized by the largest plate of pancakes she's ever seen. ÊThe "Banana Nana" was "soooo good" she said, but she couldn't eat even a quarter of it. ÊThree 12" pancakes stacked with banana filling could really be cut into 4 huge servings. ÊShe needed a bit of counseling afterwards, as she's not used to leaving such tasty eats left-over. ÊThe left-overs weighed just under a metric ton. My 15 year-old daughter got the "Apple Cobbler" French toast. ÊShe mustered enough appetite to finish almost half of it. ÊShe loved it. ÊI tasted it, and I too loved it. ÊGreat texture and flavor. I got the eggs and bacon which comes with their potatoes and some tasty 6-grain toast (or your choice of bread). In all, it was worth the wait on a mid-week morning for the tasty brunch. ÊTheir o.j. was fresh-squeezed and their service was pretty alright too. Next time, I'm going to take the whole family, and order 2 dishes, which should be more than enough!

BY far the best breakfast food I have ever had! I had the Creme de la Creme french toast with a side of potatoes. Both dishes exceeded my expectations. I also tried the original french toast which was to die for. They have 100% real maple syrup which compliments the french toast wonderfully. the french toast didnt need the maple syrup...thats how good they were, but the maple syrup makes it that much better. the portions are big and the atmosphere is warm and inviting. great service....reasonable prices. definitely going back!!

Wait, I haven't written a review for this place yet?!? Craziness!!! I have a thingy for hearty, carb-y, breakfast foods (who doesn't), and after years and years (or like 3 years) of trying all kinds of breakfast places across LA, from snooty little hipster spots to fu-fu organic french cafes, to laid back diner food... THIS is it. ÊThe Griddle Cafe has never faced any competition, and it never will. From my first bite of Mama's French Toast 3 years ago, to my first sip of their french press coffee, I fell in love. ÊI don't come here TOO often, maybe 4-5 times a year, but that's pretty often for me, considering I like to try new places and I hate eating at the same restaurants. Ê Since my first time here, I've introduced many more people to their GARGANTUAN pancakes, their soft, fluffy french toast, their GIANT omelettes, and no one I've met has been disappointed. ÊI've even converted a couple to loyal regulars! ÊThere is always a huge line every time I've been here, except for the one time I managed to force myself and my friend up, and got there right when it opened. ÊIt was so nice to have the entire restaurant all to ourselves! One time we even came the weekend of my friends birthday, and they gave us a stack of free pancakes topped with whipped cream! ÊIt was awesome, not that we needed any MORE pancakes on top of what we ordered... we couldnt even finish a quarter of it. Last bit of warning which you probably already know... BE PREPARED TO GAIN 5 POUNDS UPON LEAVING THIS PLACE. ÊIf youre going to feel guilty about eating anything here, just dont do it. ÊTake each delicious, gooey, drippy bite and savor it! ÊIt's the only way to go! Ê All their pancakes and french toasts are super sweet, so you've gotta prepare for that sweet tooth, too! Come here, at least once, just to try! ÊYou definitely won't be disappointed!

If I had to say one nice thing about the recent sh*tstorm weather that Los Angeles has been experiencing, it's that the rain has done me a huge favor by eliminating the wait time at Griddle Cafe. Why YES, I would love to be seated in 5 minutes! Thank you kindly! The wait time at GC was definitely shorter due to the rain, but of course nothing will ever come between people and good comfort food, not even weather.. so GC was still jam packed with people dining away. For a late afternoon brunch, my pal and I ordered a double stack of BLUESberry pancakes and the Caballero (essentially a breakfast burrito) and a side of Griddle Potatoes. BLUESberry pancakes - WHAT was I thinking when I decided to get a double stack? I only managed to finish 1/4 of the double stack.. luckily my pal was able to help me tackle on most of what was left, and in the end I still ended up with 1/3 of a double stack. These pancakes are much too monstrous! If you love blueberries, this is an awesome choice cuz it's stuffed silly with a lot of large, fresh, juicy blueberries. The blueberry sour cream atop worked great to balance out any sweetness. Caballero - My pal ordered this simply because a part of the description for it read "This one is HUGE!". Well it definitely was huge (easily bigger than a Chipotle burrito). The burrito itself was simply delicious--I think it was the combination of the green chiles and the spiced chicken chorizo. However, the burrito lacked a kick that I thought the chiles should've provided, but didn't. All good, in the end, still absolutely delicious. The burrito comes with a side of freshly made tortilla chips too! Yum! Griddle Potatoes - Pretty awesome cuz there's a bacon or sausage sort of flavor in the potatoes. I couldn't pin point what it was exactly, but it made the potatoes taste good. Service was great, they constantly checked up on us and they made sure our water glasses never went empty. Even the host at one point checked up on us! Real nice people. Whatever you do though, don't come here with a hangover--the closely seated and overcrowded tables inside a very small cafe is a surefire way to make a headache worse from all the din!

Now I understand the reviews and ratings! Ordered the Hot Chocolate French Toast available only this month. Toast was chocolate topped with marshmallows topped with chocolate powder and then toasted so that the top was nice and crispy and the rest was gooey. Whipped cream was a nice cool break from the ooey gooey sweetness of the rest of the yummy gummy French Toast/mallows. Mama's French Toast is just the right amount of sweetness, a touch of salt and warmth. Sigh.... The coffee comes in pitchers so you can share... There were vacant seats upon arrival. It took almost no time at all to get our food. It's amazing: The Servers have the bone structure of movie leading men or models, they have the height for it too. The girls were nothing to sniff at either. The two busboys might have been older and shorter but their faces were not so bad either. Hahaha!!! The clientele... either they are all in the entertainment industry or some of them are wannabes. Would be interesting to find out. There were a couple of private tables in the back hallway, probably for the bonafide A-listers that might show up.... So glad they decided to raise the ceilings and expose the ducts: If the ceiling were lower, it would probably feel claustrophobic. Tables in the middle could be pushed together for ONE huge group.

If you've been hibernating and just woke up, I'm certain you're severely famished and need to feed that empty belly...STAT! Well, head over to The Griddle Cafe for a massive carbo-load! Don't waste your time looking for street parking! Stop stressing about wondering if you've put enough time on that meter! I've been here several times and never realized Griddle Cafe shares a rear parking lot with Rite Aid, free for patrons! My friend No and I arrived around 11am on a Thursday and the place was jam packed, but not with a long wait like I've been used to. We were able to be seated right away. Note to self (and all my fellow yelpers), when 11:45am rolled around, the dining area was only about 30% full! Seating is pretty cozy as there is just enough elbow room between tables if you are not fortunate to be seated at a booth. FYI, this place is lively and very noisy! Service is very good, considering how busy this place gets. We ordered the "Sow Your Oats" and "Black Magic" Pancakes and a two egg breakfast which included bacon, fruit, and a side of wheat toast. I'll post my pictures in a bit. Ê"Sow Your Oats" are Rolled Oat pancakes with honey and cinnamon. "Black Magic" are Oreo-crushed pancakes topped with powdered sugar and whipped cream...and would you believe...more crushed Oreos! Their bacon is thick, but it was not crispy. The two eggs actually appeared to be a four egg scramble. The fruit was a medley of cantaloupe, red grapes, strawberries, and pineapples. The Oreo pancakes were sweet and rocked, especially the center part. As you make your way towards the outer portion of the pancake, it gets a bit dry and requires a little syrup to help push down your esophagus. Did I fail to mention that the pancakes are massive? You can literally feed a family of four with one order! LOL!

Great breakfast, HUGE portions! I recommend: BLUESberry: blueberry filled pancakes topped with blueberry sour cream and powdered sugar. "Addicted to Noisella" Stuffed French Toast: Nutella stuffed toast topped with powdered sugar and whipped cream. * Definitely a treat for our chocoholics and Nutella addicts. "Some like it HOT" Scramble: Pepper-jack cheese, rancheros sauce, topped with pico de gallo, avocado, and spicy chipotle sauce. Served with a side of tortilla sauce. *To make this dish Zabihah/Halal Friendly, substitute out the chicken sausage for an extra avocado!

This tiny breakfast joint runs an efficient ship. We stopped by prior to my flight out of LA, ordered up The Golden ticket, and told the waitress we were in a bit of a hurry. The place was JAMMED by the way and luckily we had no wait as I think several patrons had just cleared out. And this was Tuesday at like 1115am. Our pancakes came out in a jiffy, and as evidenced by the photos, were of epic proportions. They were delicious. Would definitely go back to try their French Toast and other pancakes.

I showed up 30 minutes before opening..and I was wondering what all the hype was about. At about a quarter to, my brother and I got out of the car and walked up to the cafe, and to my surprise there was already a wait. Service: It was very fast. A waiter/host came outside about 5 minutes before 8 and got down names and number in the party so it was easier to sit everyone down once it hit 8 o clock. Waiters were very nice and efficient, but it seems as though they were rushed/stressed only 5 minutes into opening, which is understandable because it seemed like a popular place, but yelling at another waiter when he was just trying to be organized and make sure everyone was acknowledged and taken care of? I don't see any harm in that. Food: I ordered the Muscle Bound Scramble which was egg whites with spinach, tomato, and turkey sausage. It also came with a side of honey mueseli (sp?) bread. Over all, not bad. The tomatoes made my egg whites soggy, so I wasn't too thrilled. The bread was alright..not toasted enough for my tastes, it seemed as if it was just buttered bread. It was okay, overall, not something I would order again. My brother ordered the Hunger Pangs egg dish. It was scrambled eggs, a large slice of ham and griddle potatoes. I tried the potatoes and they were crisp and delicious. He ordered it with wheat toast, but the bread did not look or taste like wheat bread? It was white with dots (maybe a type of seed), but it was toasted and I enjoyed it. Lastly, my brother and I shared a red velvet pancake. DEFINITELY worth the hype, and it was the star of my breakfast. The pancake itself wasn't too sweet and the cream cheese frosting still had a bit of the tang of the cream cheese, so it was not overly sweet. I do, agree with the other people, portions in general are huge, so definitely bring a Êfriend and share this pancake or any meal you order. I also ordered a Chai tea latte. Not the best, but still good. Also, we saw Ranjit from How I met Your Mother. AWESOME. It is definitely one of those places you have to try once, esp the red velvet cake pancakes are also a dish you need to try once. The menu is so extensive, I would definitely come back to try some of the other dishes!

Came here for the first time as the beginning of an LA food tour for my birthday. What can I say except the red velvet pancakes were the best way to start any birthday. It was like eating a delicious red velvet cupcake for breakfast without feeling embarrassed. We got there 5 minutes after it opened and the place was nearly packed. We sat at the bar and the service was friendly and efficient. I am making this place a birthday tradition and will be going here for years to come.

red velvet pancake. it actually sounds better than it tastes. reminiscent of a confetti box cake mix topped with raw cake batter cream cheese flavored frosting. also dusted with powdered sugar and cocoa powder. you will not really taste the cocoa or the velvet. poached y papas. imagine the best eggs benedict ever, minus the english muffins, and add crispy fried potato skins instead. it was so delicious that it was hard to stop licking my lips. the large piece of ham was smokey, tender, and juicy. the hollandaise was liquid gold! service was super hot, friendly, smiley, swoon-worthy. it is hollywood, people!

The BF and I were visiting LA and noticed the lack of traffic on Sunday morning while we were driving through downtown and West Hollywood. However - as soon as we got close to the restaurant, we saw the line and knew that the only people awake in LA at this hour had to be here. We circled the area for parking, but later found they actually have a parking lot in the back. The line seemed long at first, but we probably only waited less than 10 minutes. Since neither of us are huge fans of sweet meals, we ordered the "Some like it Hot" scramble, and the "Chicago Charlie's" scramble. Both were pretty good, but for some reason it took a while to get our food. I liked the ambiance, and would come back!

My girl friend and I arrived here at around 2:00 PM on a Sunday afternoon and it was STILL extremely crowded. I'm pretty sure we ended up spending more time waiting in line than eating in the restaurant itself. Nonetheless, the wait was well worth it. I ordered the "Some like it HOT" scramble, my friend ordered the "Poached y Papas" benedict, and we both shared one red velvet pancake. Now I know I'm not as sensitive to spicy foods as most people, but I'd say, contrary to its name, the scramble was more of a mild spicy. To be honest, I didn't entirely enjoy it. It was a scramble of eggs, jack cheese, and topped with avocado and pico de gallo. The entre itself was enormous and accompanied with a side of hashbrowns--which were probably some of the best hashbrowns I've ever had. The scramble, however, was kind of a messy and an extremely oily mix. I felt like it had no flavor despite all the hot sauces and salsas they mixed into it. And because of how much hot sauce and salsa they put in it, it was just soggy. I wouldn't recommend it. So picture this: the size of the pancake as the size of your face. Then DOUBLE it. It. Was. Huge. Ohmygoodnessgracious. The pancake itself was pretty delicious, but I'd say a little heavy on the frosting. I ended up scraping some of it off, but it was still really delicious. I'd say it lived up to its reputation.

This place does not disappoint. I went here for the first time 5 years ago on my first visit to LA and absolutely loved it. I was there again this weekend and went again. This place left such an impression the first time that after 5 years it is the only place I remember off the bat eating at. I went on a Monday around 10:30am and it was full. We only waited about 10 minutes. Our waiter was extremely nice, helpful and attentive. I had the Benedict which he said were the best thing on the menu and I would have to say he was right! Eggs Benedict on potato skins!? How can you not like this? I would recommend this to anyone who wants a different take on this traditional meal. We also ordered the french toast which were so buttery that no syrup was needed. I recommend this to anyone who wants a good priced breakfast.

Food is amazing!! The chicken Sicilian melt is one of the best sandwich dish they have!! The food portion is HuGe here, and most of their entree us under $13. The wait is always long in weekend morning so expect to wait at least 30-50 minutes. The only con is the horrible female server. I think they only have 2 but every time I go in, when we get a male server we get great service, or at least the drinks are refilled and at the least he bringing us napkins, but when it's the female server K******, she's slow with service, never checks back on tables, and takes forever to get and run the check. I've waited over 10 minutes one time for her JUST TO RUN THE CREDIT CARD, but otherwise, everything else is GrEaT here. The funniest thing is, when K***** served us, we were a party of 5, we just wanted 1 item split off for 1 person to use her card. Us: We work in the industry, is it possible to split off 1 item off the check so she can use her credit card? K*****: Uhhh, Us: Don't you use Aloha or Micro or something?" K****: I'm not allowed to. Us: O...k....?? (thinking to ourselves, What a dumb b*****, not only does her service suck, she's also a horrible liar. ) I know Griddle Cafe is always busy, but honestly, if they prob get rid of her or watch her more carefully, maybe the line wouldn't be soo long! Food- 5 Service 4 (if it's not k******) and speed 5 (for the amount of people they have). Overall great place for food, quality and quantity!

This place is crazy good. I love breakfast places and have a few current favorites but this place blew most of them away. The day I went, I was so incredibly hungry. I knew this place was popular... But when I saw a line outside, I thought, "The food better be good!" I was in no mood to wait to eat. And I especially hate waiting for over-hyped places in LA that have mediocre food. The combination of the extreme hunger and mediocre food have often led to some of my worst dining experiences. Surprisingly, we didn't have to wait that long! The place was packed. Wall to wall people and really loud. They had music playing but it was barely audible over the din of the diners. The interior is very diner-esque. Reminded me of many of the middle-of-nowhere diners my family and I used to go to when drove cross country. We sat at the bar and were immediately greeted. I ordered french press coffee and a water. The coffee was good. Not the best I've had in LA, but it was nice to have french press. Soon after, the waiter returned to take our food order. When I go to a new place to eat, I usually look up reviews first. Then when I get to the restaurant, I usually scan the tables to see what looks good. Unfortunately, this was an impromptu decision and no one in my immediate vicinity had their food yet. So I had to solely rely on the menu. It was full of food that sounded good (maybe because I was so hungry). I ended up ordering the huevos rancheros with a tequila sauce. It was very good, but when my friend got her pancakes, my jaw dropped. They looked amazing! Huge cakes! Light and fluffy! Not heavy or starchy looking. I almost never order pancakes, because so few places get them right. Then, the woman to my right got her eggs benedict, Seasoned potatoes with a giant slice of ham sitting on top covered in eggs and hollandaise sauce! All of the portions were large as well. Which was great, because I was starving. All in all, a great breakfast/brunch experience. When I go back, I'm definitely getting the pancakes! Maybe the red velvet ones... mmmm.

Come hungry. You have been warned. I am always wary of places that have really long lines. Usually the wait is unwarranted and sometimes it becomes such a chore that you don't get to enjoy your meal once you finally sit. That wasn't the case here. My friend and I waited about 20 minutes to be seated outside, which isn't at all unreasonable. It's always nice to be able to eat with someone who is easy to share with. Between us we split the Sow Your Oats pancakes, and the eggs benedict over potato skins. The portions here are enormous, so as I said, come hungry. The pancakes were really nice. They had a good fluffy texture, and were cooked well throughout, despite being the size of a plate. They were generously dusted with cinnamon, and the rolled oats gave it a nice texture. Add some real maple syrup and you have a great stack. The eggs benedict is a crude presentation of delicious food. You basically get a giant, thick slice of ham. Somewhere under that ham are two giant potato skins. Somewhere on top of that ham lies two poached eggs, smothered in oh so much hollandaise sauce. It's ugly but it tastes so pretty. We ate, we enjoyed, we were stuffed. It's reasonably priced, too. I said come hungry (twice), but chances are, you'll need to take the remainder of your food to go. I'm not sure how long the wait can get, but it was worth my 20 minutes, for certain.

ÊTotally worth the effort, that place is breakfast food porn at it's finest. Loud, noisy, and cramped- yes. ÊBut so worth it!

ÊWe were seated, ate, and as we were leaving the resto, he shook my bf's hand and said "Thanks, Steve." ÊHe remembered his name, that just blew us both away.

Giant pancakes, at least twice the size of your face. They are quite good, but the last one I tried, the red velvet pancake was a little too sweet. It had cream cheese frosting so there was no need for syrup. It is best in moderation, luckily I had 3 other friends to help finish the pancake. We also got the french toast (cheese cake one,) and a few other dishes. Waiting in line made me very hungry so by the time we got seated, I wanted to order everything from the menu. This happened last time I was here too. Portions here are large, so order accordingly. Overall, good breakfast, long wait, large portions.

Tell the truth, Griddle Cafe. When you say that your tacos come with a 'spicy aioli,' do you mean that it comes with a combo of runny mayo and Tabasco sauce? Because that's sure what it tasted like when I had a non-pancake related visit the other day. The huge amounts of white onions and tomatoes that were disproportional to the shrimp provided was disappointing as well. Besides the sub-par tacos, I have to say the rest of my experience was fine. The tortilla chips were fresh and deliciously seasoned. We were seated right away and had friendly servers, though they forgot pretty much everything we asked for until we flagged them down again (they did seem to feel bad about it though). I guess it's my fault for ordering tacos at a place most famously known for their pancakes - what was I thinking? But I can't in good conscience give it more than three stars until my next trip there. Once I spied the cornflake and strawberry pancakes on the menu, I knew for sure there'd be a next time. So consider this just a lukewarm first date, Griddle Cafe. Once we get to know each other a little better and I learn your special talents, I think this will be the beginning of a pretty good relationship!

After the first semester of student teaching and done with our projects, my friends and I decided to spend a day together in LA. We started with our long awaited trip to The Griddle Cafe, which one of us had been raving about. When we got to the Griddle Cafe, we entered from the back of the restaurant, down the hallway, and was seated immediately. Our server was kind and very helpful. I decided to order the "Teacher's Pet," which was pancakes with baked cinnamon apples inside. It was scrumptious but be warned, do not...I repeat... DO NOT order a stack of pancakes. One pancake is about the size of a huge plate! The Griddle Cafe is very well known for their huge portions. After my first time here, I came to the conclusion that I would attempt to come here whenever I decide to head to LA. Here are some other things I have tried here: Mom's French Toast- delicious and definitely a must try!! Yellow Brick Road- too sweet for me. Also, the parking lot was easy to access. They have a lot in the back of the restaurant.

The. best. place. for. breakfast. EVER. I have nothing but good place to say about the Griddle Cafe. I discovered this little bit of heaven over 7 years ago and ever since then it has become one of the staples. I take all of my friends here and it never disappoints. First let's talk about the place. It's compact, busy, but cute. It's kind of tight inside, and it's a bit noisy because of all the patrons, but it's got that homey, diner feel. The host is a funny, nice guy. The waiters are nice (and easy on the eyes ;) ) and they're on top of it. I've never felt like I've had bad service. The owner, Jodi, is super nice, too. Did I mention everyone is nice? Ok, just wanted to make sure. They have two "VIP" rooms in the back - I've been lucky enough to sit in both. The rooms are dim, one has a TV inside, and I must admit you kind of do feel like a VIP when you're in there. Also, please note that the mirror that's near the back entrance is actually a two-way mirror so even though it looks like a plain mirror the people inside that VIP room can see you adjusting your hair, picking at your teeth, or whatever else you do with a mirror. You have been warned. Now let's talk about the food. The portions are GINORMOUS (I'd recommend sharing). If you order a stack of pancakes, you just won't ever see the plate at the bottom until you start eating away at your pancakes. I've had the Chicago Charlie's Scramble, the Some Like it Hot Scramble, the Caballero burrito, the breakfast tacos, Mom's French Toast, Noisella Stuffed French Toast, Peanut Bubba Crunchy French Toast, 'Tis the Season Pumpkin Pancakes, Frosted Flakes and Strawberry Pancakes, Banana Nana Pancakes, Red Velvet Pancakes, Saturday Morning Fever (Bailey's and Kahlua mixed in the batter) and...I'm sure I've had more, but I can't remember. I've been here too many times to count. What I do remember is that everything is oh so yummy and everyone I take is always satisfied. Oh, and did I mention they have delicious french pressed coffee? Well, they do. Even their water tastes good (and I'm not exaggerating). I've actually never had lunch here, but their burgers and sandwiches look scrumptious. The food is delicious, the environment and staff are enjoyable, and you will leave this place with the urge to come back every weekend for the rest of your life. There is usually a wait, but I'm telling you there's a wait for a reason and that reason is well worth it. If you're in the area, this is the place to make a pit-stop.

I only order breakfast dishes when I come here, so I have no opinion of their lunch dishes. ÊThe red velvet panCAKE - Mmmmm...dessert for breakfast?! ÊIt was the best "red velvet"-anything that I've eaten. ÊNot dry - perfect amount of moisture. ÊNot too sweet - even with the swirl of icing on top. ÊThe french toast is also on point. ÊLike the pancakes, the french toast comes in portion sizes too big for one sensible person to finish, but I came pretty damn close.

Time to revive a classic - and steal an intro from myself..."When I travel I make it a point to eat at different places every single time. I scour Zagats, Gayot, Frommers, Chowhound, and Yelp for opinions and eventually glean my list down to a few great choices for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks - I am rarely disappointed, despite never going back to the same place twice. Never, that is, aside from places that are simply too amazing, affordable, or unique to pass up. For me, Hollywood's Griddle Cafe is one of those places. No glitz, no glam - just amazing food in a super casual setting with some of the most down to earth and friendly servers out there....and let's not forget the great prices, absurd selections, and portions!" My fourth trip to LA in four years once again brought me to The Griddle during the day of my annual pilgrimage to Staples Center for a Kings game and once again by arriving early we were met with a minimal wait...as a matter of fact, given the crummy weather and early hours this was the first time we arrived at The Griddle Caf to find half the restaurant empty - no worries though, by the time we left there was a line. ÊGreeted promptly by our server, a somewhat curt but efficient fellow named Sergio we were given menus and drink orders were taken - water all around, tea for two, and that lovely French Press for mother and I. ÊBrowsing the menu while listening to cheesy 80s music overhead I commented that this was the first time I could hear the sounds of the kitchen - again this didn't last as the place filled up. Browsing the menu and seeing options both old and new our decisions were easier than usual as we all wanted to try new things. ÊAs a new twist, Sergio actually inquired as to whether the persons ordering pancakes wanted one, two, or three - essentially a two dollars off per pancakes short of a full stack. Ê With orders placed service would be swift with coffee and tea being refilled before they were even empty (resulting in two tea pots and two French presses on the large table at once;) Êbusy or half full the service at The Griddle has never been anything less than impressive. ÊWaiting a mere fifteen minutes while chatting and watching Sportscenter it would be no time before our desserts - er, breakfasts - would arrive. Ordered by my sister and far better than its humble origins would suggest, a stack of two BLUESberry pancakes would arrive fluffy and light, jam packed with fresh blueberries and topped with a puree of blueberry juice and sour cream. ÊFearing the sour cream would be too tart I was duly impressed by the manner in which the powdered sugar and juice tempered the creamy sour cream and even my sister, a maple syrup fanatic, took it easy with the syrup on this dish allowing its natural flavors to shine. For my mother, another fruited option - Barry Yellow. ÊSimilar in texture to the fluffy yet filling Blueberry option, this selection was loaded with pureed raspberries (complete with seeds) and lemon juice. ÊTopped with merely butter and powdered sugar the buttermilk cakes were slightly more dry than I would have preferred, but with the pockets of jammy raspberry breaking up the dough the key was making sure to get both pancake and raspberry in each bite-then it was quite excellent. My selection would be a result of my aunt choosing the newest menu option-the "Red Velvet" panCAKE, the dish I'd originally targeted. ÊA single cake, both in title and in texture, this monstrous cake was mildly sweet, bright red, and loaded with subtle cocoa tones. ÊTopped with a thick swirl of cream cheese icing with a slight acidity suggesting a nondescript citrus the cake was quite good, though not as successful as the version at Larchmont Bungalow. ÊDense and heavy compared to the standard pancakes a single cake was definitely enough for one, or to share. Having already tried nearly all the pancake options on our multiple trips my selection would once again come from the French Toast section of the menu - this time Crme de la Crme with Griddle Caf's signature egg dipped bread subsequently dipped in Graham Cracker crumbs before frying and subsequently loaded with slightly unsettled cheesecake and more graham cracker crumbles. ÊThree thick slices, perfectly custardized inside and golden and buttery on the exterior I found the cheesecake topping particularly pleasant in its mildness. ÊAdding only a drizzle of The Griddle Caf's pure maple syrup was a good, albeit unnecessary, decision as it worked quite nicely with the graham crackers and cream cheese both. Honestly, there isn't much more I can say about the Griddle than what has been stated in my previous three visits - the fact that I keep going back, from Ohio, says all you need to know. ÊObviously I cannot comment on the savories, but if you like sweet breakfasts this is the place for you and will continue to be a place for me on Kings game days (which would clearly be a health hazard if I lived locally.)

I like my Caballeros meaty, succulent, and too girthy to get my mouth around. Ê And served with a side of warm, crispy tortilla chips. Ê The Caballero breakfast burrito was awesome, but I'd ask for the pico de gallo, sour cream, and avocado on the side so it doesn't get soggy. ÊYou will DEFINITELY be taking some of this big boy home. The red velvet pancake was indeed tasty, even without the syrup, and I'm glad we ordered it to try it. Ê(However, I'd say Larchmont Bungalow wins the red velvet pancake war since they are filled with cream cheese and served piping hot, and the presentation is gorgeous.) Ê I usually don't spring for the OJ, but the OJ-Cranberry juice mix was so great here, and I'd definitely recommend it if you're an OJ fan. Ê Was glad we opted for the outdoor seating, because it was hot inside and felt like a cafeteria more than a restaurant. ÊWe're so lucky that in LA in January we can still eat outside! ÊOnly negative was the throngs of patrons waiting to get seated, staring--more like gawking--at our food as we ate. ÊAnd then there were the typical crazy Hollywood people shouting obscenities about being the son of Tupac and the brother of Michael Jackson. ÊSorry guys, I'm sure you'll get your turn to sink your teeth into a delicious Caballero, too. Ê (Note to non Spanish speakers: Caballero means Cowboy in Spanish.) Ê BTW, despite the shared parking lot with Rite Aid off of Fairfax, it still took a bit of effort to find a parking spot. ÊBe prepared to do some work!

I'm not sure if I just ordered the wrong things, but hooooonestly not that great. The orders: - Poached y papas benedict: Ham was way too salty. ÊEggs were way too runny for poached eggs. ÊBut sadly, the best out of the three we got. - Apple cobbler french toast: French toast was alright, a little too dry for my liking.

You poor thing. ÊUntil you have breakfast here... you haven't lived. ÊIt's a celebration of everything that's good about the morning meal. You're gonna wonder why people would stand outside and wait for a table. ÊYou're gonna wonder what's the best thing to order. ÊYou're gonna wonder what's all the hype.

ÊI got the one with the peanut butter and it was the best French toast I've ever had. ÊIt comes in a half order, which is what I recommend. The eggs Benedict was fantastic. ÊInstead of an English muffin, they use a fried potato skin and homemade Hollandaise sauce. ÊEggs Benedict is probably my favorite breakfast and they do it right with a great twist. The waiter tried to tell me to only get one or two pancakes, instead of a full order of three ÊI didn't listen. ÊSo when he plops down a full stack of delicious pancakes, I can't see the plate underneath. ÊAlthough he said that he's seen people take down all three pancakes, I don't recommend it. ÊOne is plenty to fill you up.

Bigger is better. More is more. Such is the mantra of many who never learned to delay gratification for the sake of quality. "Quality over quantity," my mother warned. I imagine that the Griddle Caf's lovers grew up w/ parents much the antithesis of my own. In their homes, closets piled w/ Payless shoes & other bargain basement crap was heaped into rubbles. "Me like portions big!" grunted their grammatical & syntactical jabberwock. Such is Griddle's crowd: those willing to stand in line on Sunset Boulevard, nonetheless. I couldn't think of a better way to announce how UNcool you are to the whole darned city. Who are these people who don't just disappear behind an inconspicuous door at any place on Sunset? Being in line anywhere in Hollywood? NOT the business! But to make matters worse, these people are in a line for food. This is Sunset, not Santee! I was promptly seated (or else!) at the miserable bar area, & I warned the hostess about my lil' diva (then 4 yrz/o), but she insisted. The service was so slow that we almost bounced after 40 minutes, but Mr. Attitude--our waiter--made it over in the nick of time. After seeing others' portions, the diva & I split a plate. We settled on apple pancakes after being denied the red velvet ones for which we went to the dive in the first place. Dead seriously, Mr. A told me I'd have to catch up to The Buttermilk Truck in order to get red velvet flapjacks. o_O (Fine! That was, honestly, the *best* thing to come out of the entire encounter.) Another 40 minutes later, Mr. A brings out this grotesque pan-sized deally that coulda' fed sixteen hungry linebackers. It was just disgusting, like I had to take bites of my self-esteem as I grew insecure w/ each 2000-calorie fork-full. Even my diva turned it down after a few bites, & when does a kid turn down pancakes?! I'll tell you when: when the food is so thick that it's unswallowable. It takes 15 minutes just to masticate! We ditched this gluey glob quickly; we prefer bolus-friendly breakfasts. The cafe's food may as well come in a trough, & the service is Griddle-godawful. To some people (aka Griddle lovers), any dining beyond IHOP's interior must be "fine dining;" this place is just classless & thunder-thigh inducing. Yuck!

A crowd favorite in Hollywood, Griddle Cafe if for these seeking out a hearty breakfast. Nothing fancy here - just standard american fare (pancakes, omelettes etc) with some twists. Crowd favorites seem to be the Red Velvet pancakes which are very tasty but if you're not into sweets for breakfast this will turn you off. I'm not that person so I enjoyed it. I had the Creme de la creme which was french toast meets cheese cake. Again - super sweet. You will get a LOT of food at Griddle so if you don't eat much you may want to share.

Oh how I love eating cake for lunch. I went here with a group of 4 people and we ordered: Scotch on the Rocks, The Golden Ticket, Bluesberry a side of bacon, and Poached y Papas Benedict. We have fairly large appetites and barely made a dent in our meal. The pancakes were delicious, however the poached y papas benedict was flavorless. Their hollandaise is not incredible, like they claim. The potatoes needed salt and I just didn't dig it. At all. We ordered the bacon extra crispy and it was limp. I hate limp bacon. We waited for about an hour and twenty minutes. It was a Sunday morning so I didn't mind. What I got somewhat annoyed with was America's Next Top Model, Eva, showing up. She's stunning, but the stunning girl came with her entourage after we had waited for our estimated hour and all 8 of them were seated right away. I couldn't help but be annoyed with the fact they probably took our table. Its LA, you see movie stars everywhere, so if you're gonna give them priority, either expand your establishment (especially when you know its super popular) or take reservations. But only one star off from the gross benedict and long wait. Next time I go, I'll be sure to hit them up on a weekday before the stars get out of church. ("church")

Came into town for a belated Thanksgiving and early Christmas. I couldn't have asked for an ideal winter where the weather is 85 degrees as opposed to Austin where it is 62 degrees. My sister wanted to try the Griddle Cafe and told me it's at Sunset and Fairfax. All of a sudden I remembered where it was. It's been awhile since I've lived here. She told me there were Red Velvet Pancakes and I thought cool! I arrive there and it's almost packed. My sister and I end up sitting at a table where we were sitting very close to another party. I don't mind. Hopefully the people next to us don't mind. Well since it's LA I think they do mind. We ask for coffee and they didn't bring an average coffee coming from a coffee pot but a French press. I'm already loving this place. Then I look at the menu and you see in almost a highlight "Red Velvet Pancakes". I couldn't pass this up since I haven't heard about it. The pancakes were huge. You can just divide it up for breakfast for a week.

FINALLY. I've been meaning to try out the Griddle Cafe for Oh So Long. French Toast is maybe one of the best things ever created by man. ever. So imagine my excitement upon hearing that the best French Toast in Los Angeles is at GC. Had a friend from out of town visiting who was open to also trying something new, so we went for brunch today. Put my name on the list at about 11pm and was seated within 10 minutes. Not too shabby. Got two orders of the French Toast, OBVIOUSLY. and it was impeccable. I'm definitely going to be paying for it in the form of cardiovascular blockages, but it was a delicious meal sent from the heavens. PRO TIP: Head into the Rite Aid parking lot off of Fairfax. Plenty of GC reserved parking there left by all the hungry fools looking for street parking.

If you're looking for breakfast, this is the spot.. its like a scene from "Honey I Shrunk The Kids", everything in this place is triple the size, if not more, than what you're use to. Unfortunately I'm a sucker for eggs benedict, which instead of english muffins, are served over two huge patatoe halves.. So I always order that when coming here, but luckily I get to sample the pancakes, waffles and more from the kind people I go with.. This place takes some serious group planning and team work before ordering, otherwise you're going to box up more than half of what you ordered or tossing most of it, because the orders are so damn big its almost impossible to finish! So I've gone on busy sundays and not so busy mondays, if you go on a busy day, its still very worth it.. Don't be intimidated by the long line of people standing outside and leaning against the wall.. Don't mind the dumb security guard that, if you're lucky, will come out from the "writers/directors guild" building telling people not to sit or lean against their building (total power trip).. I almost did it just to challenge him and talk shit, but then my name was called lol next time... if you're having breakfast on sunset, skip Mels and come here!! You'll be more than satisfied!! Looks like they have a good lunch menu too, but never ordered from it.. once seated service is fast and friendly. They also have a Hot Chile contest/best chile advertised, I think next time ill try it..

Griddle Cafe never lets me down. Their menu is filled with goodies great for breakfast and lunch. I wish they closed later! Everyone rages about their Red Velvet Pancake. It's a mussst! One of the best red velvet desserts I've ever had. It is all that it's cracked up to be - a fluffy heaven sent pancake. Their servings are actually pretty big. The Omelete "My Soul" is really good. For their sandwiches, I definitely recommend the Grilled Shrimp and Pesto Melt - the combination of shrimp and pesto in a sandwich, you can't go wrong. All I have to say for Griddle is yumyumyum!

When it comes to breakfast, the Griddle Cafe definitely sets itself apart! Aside from the delicious griddle potatoes that you can get with most of your breakfast meals, the real reason i like to come here are the Dwight Howard sized pancakes that come in a bunch of variations! (and the french toast!) Last time i went, i had the red velvet pancakes.. BOMB. and a dank omelette. The place is a little stuffed and there is always a wait outside but i love coming here for breakfast regardless. Definitely the spot to be for breakfast in Los Angeles.

Mmmmmm delicious breakfast foods! I came here with some friends last weekend on a Sunday. We decided to meet at 12 PM and while we already knew we would have to wait awhile, we were still amazed by the 40+ people waiting outside. Argh. The total wait time was about an hour. I guess that's pretty on par with most fancy schmancy hipster brunch places in LA. After we were seated we had our orders taken immediately (staring at the menu prior to being seated helps expedite the process). Here's what we ordered (and I can comment on everything that was ordered because I ate a little bit of everybody's): French press coffee: pretty intense and dark for a "medium" roast coffee. It was OK... but I think my office coffee tastes way better so that's saying something. French toast: YUM. Light and fluffy and delicious. Giant portions. Eggs benedict on potato skins: Also yummy! Kind of heavy but still quite good. Definitely a different twist on the dish. I think I would still prefer the traditional style eggs benedict dish though. Red velvet pancake: WOAH. Talk about sugar overload. It really just tastes like a flattened out red velvet cupcake. It would actually be quite good if they didn't smother it with cream cheese frosting and chocolate powder. Way way WAY to sweet to order as a main entree. Maybe even too sweet as a dessert. And I love sugar... so that's saying a lot. Potato omelette: so basically this is a giant omelette made with eggs, hash browns, cheese, and a crap load of sour cream. It's good... very hearty, but nothing special. I won't be ordering this again. Also, perhaps it was a mistake getting hash browns as my side too. Potato overload. Although I still have leftovers and kind of want to eat them right now. Cost was about $23 per person (including tax and tip). Tips: Park in the lot behind the CVS/Rite Aid/drug store. I was hesitant to park there because I've had my stupid car towed from a CVS lot before, but this lot is good because there are signs specifically stating that you can park there for Griddle Cafe. Highlights: The host man saying, "OK I got good news and bad news... the good news is your table is almost ready... the bad news is I'm 42, single, and I live with 2 cats in the valley." Awesome.

Came here one weekday morning to see what the big hype was about. I get it. After our 15 minute wait, our party of two was squeeeeezed between two other pairs. It WILL be difficult to have a private conversation in this place... that is if you can even separate the voice of the person you're dining with from other patrons (the noise level is so loud, I felt as if I was in the middle of happy hour and not breakfast). The Griddle was packed with a freakishly good looking crowd. I'm convinced that most servers and guests in this place are aspiring artists. If you're in the mood for what you would imagine a "Hollywood" breakfast experience, Griddle Cafe is it. Portions are huge and the food is delish. Definition of "huge"= I ordered banana pancakes and received two pancakes, thick, one stacked atop the other, and each just bigger than the plate itself! That said, two people could PROBABLY share but once you take a glance at the menu, you'll want to go on an order-spree!

GARGANTUAN size portions on almost everything here. I usually go for breakfast so I have not sampled the lunch or dinner food, but the breakfast food I have had for he most part is amazing. The pancakes are freaking insane, filled with everything from frosted flakes to oreo cookies, these bad boys will get your day going right. You get 3 giants plate engulfing pancakes and I can hardly ever put a dent in these things. The egg dishes are great too, the only one I would not get again was the baked potato omelet, it had about 2 pints too much sour cream in it. To avoid mass crowds on the weekend go early morning weekday, totally worth getting up early and making it in before work, although you might be asleep by lunch time...

YUM! I'm from Atlanta, and eat a lot of really good breakfasts pretty often, and honestly, I was thinking that LA had nothing but salads and tofu. I was pleasantly surprised with this place, though. We had the blueberry pancakes, and let me tell you: they were officially the biggest pancakes I've ever had. They eclipsed the plate and were pretty much the size of hubcaps, and were SOOO good. Overall the experience was pretty awesome, though, because the kitchen area is relatively close to the main restaurant, be prepared to leave smelling like you've left a diner- a little like the food that's being prepared. The wait was average, about 20 minutes, but, it was a Saturday morning and the weather was good, so, it was painless. I love this place, and well most definitely return the next time in in LA.

This review is based on CUSTOMER SERVICE because I didn't get to try their food seeing as the wait staff was so incredibly rude. My boyfriend wanted to take me out to breakfast last Sunday and I had never been here so off we went. We walked in from the back entrance and walked up to the front where we were YELLED at by the host or waiter, I don't know who he was and I really don't care. There was no reason for him to yell at my boyfriend and I. He thought we were trying to grab a table (which we were not) and yelled out in the whole (itty bitty smelly gross-looking, sardine packed piece of shit) restaurant for everyone to hear. No shit Sherlock, I figured there was a wait which is why we were walking towards you. This is West Hollywood, of which I am a resident of. If you want my hard earned money to be spent at your restaurant then find some staff who can be respectful towards its customers. Sorry Griddle Cafe, you are on my s*** list now.

Over-hyped. Food is okay. Service is pretty good. When I've been there it hasn't been packed at all. Wait, food is not okay. I got an eggs benedict (or something) and it was covered in such a ridiculous amount of sauce that I couldn't eat it. I could barely find the egg in all that mess. I feel like they spilled the bucked of sauce on my plate and were like "ahh well..." I think I saw Maddox there once. Yup, probably the only reason I'm giving them two stars. What a mess of a little place. I don't get it. Meh! Been there twice, but wouldn't want to go back by choice.

I met up with great company to try this place for the first time. Each person ordered a dish. We made sure we evened it out with having something sweet and savory to share. We got the red velvet pancakes, peanut butter french toast, chicago charlie's scramble (which was my favorite thing btw!), poached y papas benedictEverything was good together mixing sweet and savory. We were so full and had a lot of leftovers. Coming back again to try other items! Park in the Rite Aid parking lot. I walked through the back which was weird..I almost thought I was at the wrong place haha. Oh, i also noticed that the servers were mostly male and hot?!?

Red Velvet Pancakes, need I say more? lol, This pancake is enough to share with two people. the cream cheese fluffy goodness on top of is just deliciousss. Ê If you're a breakfast person like myself, you will not get disappointed. The only down side is the wait can get long on fri-sun, so go on a slow day to experience the food.

I can't believe they can fit so many people in that small restaurant! My cousin kept telling me how amazing their pancakes were so when I visited, we knew exactly where we'd go for breakfast. Being a french toast fanatic I ordered the creme de la creme french toast and had a bite of my cousins classic pancakes. Both were pretty delicious. Huge portions, decent price and so many choices! A place to go to get a taste of LA.

I LOVE THIS PLACE. You will always have a wait on a Friday, Saturday, or Sunday morning. People who go out late want a good place for breakfast or brunch the next morning. You can come during other hours though and there is rarely ever a wait. HUGE portions. Everything is realllly good. Things that are especially good are: Strawberries & Cream Waffles Caballero Things that aren't that great: Some Like it Hot The Choco milk isn't convenient to drink because the hershey's syrup just goes to the bottom and takes a while to mix with the milk.

HUGE portions. Incredibly monstrous. Share your food. I mean it. I had the omelette my soul, which was good until a quarter way through. At that point, I was stuffed and ready to leave. The hash browns were a bit dry. The ham was also a bit dry. Overall, I would've given this place 2 stars if it was based on my breakfast alone. HOWEVER... the pancakes were amazing. Banana-nana? Wow. This was so. good. I wouldn't be able to eat even half a stack for breakfast, but one bite of it was just amazing. I also had a bit of the Good ol' Fashioned, and these pancakes are seriously the best I've ever had. Go for the pancakes. That's all you need to know. Pancakes. Mmm. Go.

Had the Golden Ticket pancakes and am still in a food coma. I hadn't eaten breakfast before getting here and arrived at 12, had about a 40 minute wait for a group of 2 (granted it was a holiday). Probably should have eaten something beforehand so I didn't go into a total sugar bomb, but it was worth it. Golden ticket = brown butter banana pancakes with walnuts, caramel and streusel yummmmmmmm!!! Topped with whipped cream and more streusel. I kinda wish there were bigger chunks of streusel because I think that was the best part of it. Otherwise, a GREAT deal, 3 bigger than life sized pancakes for $11?? DEAL. Granted I could only eat 1/3 of the meal...but hey I'm always down for leftovers! Came with my mom and she got the Gone Shrimpin scramble which was tasty, I like how they mixed the basil into the egg whites. They also give you some garlic toast which pairs nicely. Great service too, this is a MUST for anyone who hasn't been so what are ya waiting for?!

WTF!? Either everyone is a terrible cook, or they've just never had good breakfast before because TGC is nothing more than average. As I write this, I'm taking the aftermath of this meal on the toilet seat, and I wish I hadn't gone here! The Noisella french toast is basically nutella in the center of two french toasts...nothing special because I do that at home, and needless to say the whipped cream on top made the toast soggy. And anything with nutella automatically taste good, probably even with sardines. (probably not) My Strawberries and Cream Waffle was not even remotely appetizing. A brown sugar sour cream sounds yummy, but it had a weird flavor, and the waffle was doughy and had a cinnamon flavor. The Peanut Pubba french toast should only be ordered if you are a die hard peanut butter fan. And 5 bucks for a glass of OJ? Are you freakin' kidding me? My first yelp let down *sigh*

A bit over-hyped but you come here to gawk at people and the slight chance that you might see a celebrity here. ÊIt's a Hollywood place so even for breakfast, expect to wait on those Saturday and Sunday mornings. Ê Also, the sizes are HUGE! The order of pancakes are definitely made for more than one person. ÊConsider sharing and asking for a smaller order (I believe it's one less pancake or something..). ÊI experimented how long it would take me to finish and by the 3rd day, I was definitely over it. ÊProbably only worth it if you're going there your first time and/or taking friends from out of town/travelers. ÊOtherwise, save your wait time for other places.

We stopped in this afternoon around 1pm and the wait was 20 minutes for two people. The first thing we noticed is that the room was filled to the brim with people at tables topped with french presses and pancakes. You can't walk by a pancake without being mesmerized by its presence. They are enormous. Enormous to the point where it's alarming, and you want one immediately. Ê Upon sitting down, the atmosphere starts to settle in- it's loud, somewhat cramped, and you are now a silent participant in multiple conversations taking place in every direction. In an attempt to establish a balance between sweet and savory, we ordered the apple bread french toast and an order of eggs/bacon/potatoes/sourdough bread. The eggs weren't anything to write home about, and I could barely finish my slice of french toast-soft, slathered, and soaking in maple syrup, orange butter, and warm cinnamon apples. Yes, it's good and will hit the spot, but not necessarily anything I will forever remember or crave. The service was attentive and helpful, at no point did I wonder about a refill or where my food was. Even though I wasn't floored by the food, I will come back and look forward to trying different entrees.

Our good bud Donald R . brought us here this past weekend. OMG I miss it already. There are only 3 words you need to know when ordering here and they are: RED. VELVET. PANCAKE. Amazing! It doesn't get any better than that; dessert for breakfast is the best kind of breakfast. This pancake doesn't come stacked like most of the other stuff on the menu, but boy does it make up for that in its size. It's one large and in charge red velvet pancake, generously dusted with cocoa powder and swirled with cream cheese frosting. So, the 3 of us shared this amazing pancake and the poached y papas benedict, along with 2 pots of French press coffee. The coffee was very good but I think we would've been ok with one pot only but I guess they charge per person, which is $3.95 and for that I would've just gotten a latte or something. The benedict was good too - the hollandaise sauce is legit! But, I'm more of a sweet breakfast kinda gal so I loved those RV pancakes. The servings are very big, we shared just those two things and it was more than enough. Price was about $45 total. I cant wait to come back to try their other pancakes and the French toast with the peanut butter! I might even buy some of the Red Velvet pancake mix!

This place gets four stars only because of the wait. The food is awesome, and the service is pretty good; the last time I was there I got the blueberry and lemon waffle (effin aye that ish was awesome), my friends got the raspberry waffle (another hit) and chocolate waffle (also a hit), as well as the mac'n'cheese (strange thing to order for breakfast, but surprisingly a hit as well) Get there early, and if you have a big group prepare for the worst wait of your life but some of the best food. Also, it's worth it to wait for outside seating instead of first available if it's a nice day because sunny days in LA and yummy waffles are rad. Just saying.

The pancakes here are HUGE and come in all different flavors, some with typical breakfast mix-ins like bananas and walnuts, and others with less traditional tastes like oreo cookie or red velvet cake. The french toast is also divine. I came here with friends, and we ordered a few things and split them between us, so that we could try some of each. We definitely did not need one order/person. Or even one order/2 people for that matter. Also noteworthy is the coffee -- bottomless french press coffee that brews right in front of you. So so good. Why not 5 stars? Parking is kind of a pain, and the wait is always really long for an overcrowded table in the overcrowded restaurant. But I guess that's part of it's character. Overall, definitely worth a visit for a very filling breakfast.

let me just clarify...... QUALITY over QUANTITY this is certainly not the case... especially with the long lines! Yeah so what if the pancakes are as large as a paper plate? It doesn't mean that it's made with the best ingredients. They are very creative with all the different types of pancakes though. We ordered: The Golden Ticket eggs with hash browns and apple pork sausages egg benedict the golden ticket could seriously feed a whole family! i shared with the bf and we couldn't even eat 1/4 of it........ sad... maybe it' just us. but i thought this was way too heavy and drenched with butter and syrup... i would have liked it more if there were actual bananas in there as well eggs with hash browns/sausages: normal, nothing impressive benedict: hollandaise sauce tasted like mayo. instead of an english muffin, a baked potato skin is used here. this made it more interesting and was probably the thing i liked most about this dish. the ham was also a surprise to this as well. what i didnt understand was that they plated 3 potato skins and only gave 2 eggs! i dont think there's anything too special about this place. i've been to similar restaurants like this and this is certainly not my favorite. if you want to feed a big party and order a few plates, then this definitely is the place for you. oh and the servers are awesome!

Deeelish!!!! We had the red velvet pancake (which was bigger than the size of my head), the omelet my soul, and a side of bacon (which comes with 4 slices). The omelet had green chiles, steak (but you can choose between steak/chicken), cheese, topped with sour cream and pico de gallo.. which was pretty good!! My faves about the meal was the pancake that was topped with frosting and hot cocoa mix **drool**!!! I gave it 4/5 stars because it took a while for our food to come out.. The place was soo busy and didn't slow down once while we were there.. Also, I tried asking for the frosting on the side because I was told the sweetness can get a little overwhelming and they said it comes as is, which meant NO they can not put it on the side. But that's all....for now! A Must try!

I don't know if it's the best breakfast in LA, but it sure has my vote. It's certainly one of the most popular places to do breakfast in LA. A 30-to-60 minute wait for a table isn't unusual. Then again, that's par for the course for many places here. It's tiny inside, and can get quite loud. So if you're the claustrophobic type, perhaps this isn't the place for you. Makes it a little difficult for big groups too. But yes, the breakfast is indeed quite enjoyable. I don't know that it's out-of-this-world, or even particularly unique. It is very delicious, and more than that, you come to places such as TGC for the atmosphere. You may luck into to street parking, but if not, there are parking garages nearby.

LOVE LOVE LOVE their red velvet pancake! SUPER soft and i love the frosting! We also ordered the poached y papas benedict and the too hot to handle burgers. The titles of each food item made me laugh cause it was pretty creative and I'm still laughing about it as I'm typing the titles. The benedict was okay, I've had better (served over ham and huge hash brown-like pieces). The too hot to handle burger was a bit on the spicier side for me, but my bf loved it. I love their fries! Make sure you get fries on the side! We didn't expect the portions to be so big...we were about to order the waffles, but after our orders came, we realize how big they were. On a side note, parking is very convenient. They have their own lot. You can't order a red velvet to go, BUT you can order it and then take a bite or two and then take it in a to-go box! I don't really understand why they didn't allow that...The atmosphere in the cafe is more on the casual side. People were chatting away and it is a bit cramped up in the cafe, but they make it work. We didn't have to wait at all because I think most people were there in large groups. The waiters are super nice and friendly. At first glance I didn't know they were workers there cause they were dressed SUPER casual that I thought they were customers! This place is definitely my new fave brunch place! :)

I came here for breakfast and it was amazing. The wait is daunting but it's worth it! On a Saturday morning, I waited with a friend for about 15 minutes. We got a small table outside. We ordered the red velvet pancake and Mom's french toast along with a couple of mimosas. Yeah, the mimosas were good....I mean, how can you fuck up a mimosa, right? Anyway, as for the food, NOMness. My friend and I had a difficult time figuring out what we liked best. The red velvet pancake is one pancake that is bigger than your face. It's a red velvet pancake, topped with chocolate powder and a huge cream cheese frosting swirl. It was more like a dessert item than a breakfast item. Still amazing. Mom's french toast is a must. It's the best french toast I have ever had. Service was friendly and prompt. Didn't have to wait long for food either. Parking is on the street. Didn't have a problem finding parking nearby either. Can't wait to come back and try more of their breakfast items. Yum!

Oh. My. God. A place like this is why America has so many problems with obesity. So I showed up around 11:30 AM and was greeted by a decent group of people waiting outside the restaurant. Griddle cafe is located in a random spot on Sunset Ave. right next to the "Director's Guild of America" building. I was lucky enough to find street parking on the side and didn't have to pay, but mind you that I was extremely lucky and possess parallel parking skills. Anyway, we ended up waiting for about 30 minutes for me and my friend to be seated. All the while, many people kept going in and out so there wasn't a ridiculous amount of lag time in their service. The inside is pretty dark and very tight in space. We were served almost instantly despite the busyness. My friend and I ended getting the infamous Red Velvet Pancake and the "Gone Shrimpin". Let me say, this is probably the most amazing breakfast food I've had in a very long while. The pancake was extremely soft, not too sweet (just the right amount of sweet and salty) and the frosting was amazing. Overall, 5/5 in the world of pancakes. Really can't get better than this. The Red Velvet Pancake was about $8.95 for a humongous single red velvet pancake topped with cream cheese frosting Ê(if you add syrup onto this pancake, you're insane). Most other pancakes on the menu were about the same price or a couple of dollars more for three pancakes (compared to the one you get for the red velvet). So theoretically it's a better deal to get the other pancakes, but HOW CAN YOU PASS GETTING A RED VELVET PANCAKE?! My friend got the Gone Shrimpin' which was scrambled egg whites (for the health conscious) with capers, tomatoes, shrimp, with a slight pesto flavor. Delicious as well, with HUGE servings. There's no need to worry you're not getting your money's worth at this place, looking around, about every dish had humongous portions. Two people can really share one order of pancakes. Most people I saw in the restaurant could finish HALF of the pancakes at most. I ended up taking half the pancake home too) Another cool thing about this place is that when you order coffee, you can choose between dark, medium, and light roast. And they also have their very own "Griddle Cafe" SYRUP! Amazing! All in all, if you're in LA, COME HERE. Fast service. Big portions. TO DIE FOR FOOD. (They serve breakfast all day long). ÊOh and another thing, it was on "Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives" for all you Food Network Junkies!

All I wanted for Christmas was a big ass waffle and I got it...a WEEK EARLY! I came here with Carolyn K. and a few other friends on the suggestion of another friend. My eyes went O_O upon mention of the Griddle Caf. I went to school in LA for 4 years and always wanted to try this place, but never got a chance (read: was never sober enough to drive on a weekend morning). The plan almost fell to pieces, when Carolyn K. and I pulled into a random parking lot in separate cars to discuss "Where the fuck are we?" and she proclaimed, "My GPS lied to me! Noooooo" We persevered and thankfully realized it was across the street from the parking lot, and we entered the gates of brekfast heaven in all its glory. "How many? Five. Ê30 minutes." FUUUUUUUUUUUU. I wasn't expecting the place to have a gnarly wait an hour before close in the middle of the afternoon! Little did I know... We waited. As Carolyn K. mentioned, we were ambushed by two drunk bishes that raved about the $35 pitchers of mimosas and then offered for us to try their leftovers. One went to go get us a fork, when the third friend (sober) appeared. She immediately wanted to know why her friends were about to give away HER leftovers to strangers. AWWWWWKWARD. We were finally seated and had a helluva time choosing what we wanted. I ordered the Strawberries and Cream waffle which was delectable. I saw some bony chick devouring it when we first arrived and decided I had to scour the menu for this treat of all breakfast treats: two huge waffles, with heaps of fresh strawberries, a blizzard of powdered sugar, and a quirky-yet-good brown sugar cream. Man, it was good and I ate every bite. EVERY BITE. I also ordered 2 of the gourmet pork sausages and a scrambled egg. The egg was meh, but the sausages were to die for. I wanted to barter with the waiter: "Sir, how many sausages can I get with what's left of my waffle?" The skin had the perfect snap, the meat perfectly oily, and overall excellent flavor. Our group also ordered the blueberry pancakes, Noisella french toast, Apple Cobbler french toast, and Chicago Charlie's Scramble. All were fantastic. The scramble put anything Denny's could EVER produce to shame. It was easily the best scramble I've ever had. The Noisella French toast (nutella slathered in between 2 slices of French toast) was good, but rich as hell. I also really liked the Apple Cobbler french. It had a tasty cinnamon crunch crust. Service was average, but they were busy so I understand. Mission Accomplished. This is breakfast perfection.

Not sure what the hoopla is about. ÊThe servings are giant-sized... but why is that such a draw? Ê Was prepared by the other yelp reviews for there to be a weekend crowd. ÊBut I came on a weekday around 10:30 and got the last table... ÊAt least didn't have to wait for the privilege of eating here. I thought the stack of "BLUESberry" pancakes I shared was okay. ÊIn fact I thought the pancakes were rather plain and dry. ÊThere was only a stingy dollop of blueberry sour cream on top.

WOW! if you want pancakes, this is the spot to go!!! There pancakes can feed a party of 4, and thats just one order. What I ordered from the Griddle was the strawberry frosted flakes pancakes-AMAZING. This pancakes was a mix of eating cereal and pancakes but in a good way. The spicy omelette is a must order if you feel like eating eggs, it's savory and spicy. This place gets crowded so come early to avoid a line!

Yes, please. 4 stars because we called in to put in a reservation, you can do it if you have parties of 6 or more, but we ended up waiting for 45 minutes even with our reservations on a saturday at 10:45. We did get seated in a nice little enclosed area away from the noisy dining area. Once we got seated it was HEAVENNNN. We ordered the noisella french toast, apple french toast, lemon and berries pancakes, and french fries. Everything was so quick, from the service to the delivery of our food. Everything was DELICIOUSSSS. Well maybe not the lemon pancakes because I'm not a huge fan of lemon. But seriously...I inhaled the nutella french toast...I honestly don't even think I was breathing while I was eating. Everything cost around 12 to 14 dollars. Parking- go to the rite aid and park somewhere in the lot, it makes life much easier. The wait is horrible which is expected if you're going to serve crack on a plate. I wouldn't mind coming back again to enjoy some red velvet pancakes, creme de creme french toast, and waffles. Yummm...I have a smile on my face just thinking about it.

The BF and I arrived here at 11AM on Sunday to see what the hype on Yelp was all about. The wait was about 30 minutes for 2 people (the line looks intimidating but does move pretty fast as other people have stated). We ordered the Red Velvet Pancake and Chicago Charlie's Scramble to share. The star was definitely the red velvet pancake. I think this is the best pancakes I've ever had!! Admittedly, I'm not that big of a pancake person - if I were here by myself, I would have ordered french toast instead - BUT this pancake was SO delicious. I was like eating a fluffy cupcake, but better. The pancake itself isn't very sweet, which makes it go perfectly with the cream cheese frosting. The scramble was just ok, even though it sounded really good on the menu. Not flavorful enough, even with all the different ingredients in it. And it was kind of luke-warm, like it had been sitting out on the counter for a bit. I would definitely go back for their pancakes! Yummm!!!

This place is good if you like griddle food but even the tacos and other breakfast items are great. The food is 5 star for sure. The only reason I gave them 4 stars is because we had a party of 9 and they put us in the back room which was so dark we had to use flashlights to read the menu and such. Alex was very nice and accommodating (as he could be considering this place is like a fire drill going on all the time). The main dining area was very noisy so eating in the back was nice and quiet. I guess a 4.5 is more appropriate. We did get a 10 minute warning from Alex that we had leave soon since he needed to give the table to someone else. Long wait if you go after 8:30am. Alex is pretty good and keeping things moving along.

It's a small hole in the wall place that's extremely 'famous' for their pancakes and huge servings. There's always a line for parties that have 3 people or more. But if there's 2 ppl you can usually get seated pretty quick. Red velvet pancakes is delicious. As well as their omelets. I usually just order two eggs scrambled with hashbrowns and rye toast with bacon and it never disappoints. The wait can be 30 mins to 2 hours especially on weekend and during tourist season... so be prepared to wait. It's well worth it. Prices are reasonable and service is chill.

This is really one of the best places to grab breakfast in LA, however I wish somebody (including the servers) had warned me about the portion sizes here- absolutely monstrous. I tried the Black Magic Pancakes and was seriously full after eating only a quarter of them. Great thing: I had leftovers for a week, bad thing: I did not want to eat for a week. Still enjoyable none the less. The second time I came here I opted for a traditional size breakfast and I was not disappointed at all. I got one of the meals that includes two eggs, potatoes and toast. Reasonably priced. I also added a side of what I'm pretty sure was apple sausage links and it was all really great- especially the potatoes. You can always expect a long wait for a table here (last time it was an hour for a table of five) but it is definitely worth it. Also what I really love about this place is that when you order coffee they bring you your own French Press! Would highly recommend.

Hi there! Want to eat until your eyes glaze over and the button on your pants are hanging on by a thread and all you want to do when you're finished is to be tucked in at the table so your body can work out the food induced coma?!?!? CAUSE I DO IT ALL. THE. TIME!! 4 stars for their "Banana Nana" Pancake: Brown sugar-baked bananas cooked inside a buttermilk pancake. ÊServed with a side of "Omgosh this is so flippin' good!!!" and "I'm so full but I can't stop eating!!" What I love about the Griddle Cafe is that you can order however many pancakes you want..and trust me when I say that one (slice? flapjack?) is enough for one person. Two pancakes if you're going to share...with six other people...because that's exactly what my friends and I had to do when we came here today. It took an army to take down this thing. My friend ordered the Banana Nana Pancake, but of course the entire table ate it cause (1) it was huge and (2) it was GOOD. The pancake came out warm and gooey. The bananas are perfectly carmelized with a slight cinammon taste and it made for a great addition to the fluffiest pancakes in the world! I am usually not a big fan of pancakes or waffles but the Griddle Cafe absolutely won me over with this amazing flapjack. I had their Manhattan Frittata and I've tried their omelettes before. Both dishes were good but nothing special in comparison to their french toasts or pancakes. Their griddle potatoes are exactly as they should be, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with yummy flavor. Insanely busy so get here early! Service was decent, parking on the street. Huge portions. **My friend ordered their omelette with egg whites before and really didn't like it. Some restaurants can do egg whites but I've tried some that just taste weird and frothy so just an fyi.

We visited at noon last Saturday and after a 30 minute wait, we sat down with 20 or so new friends at the counter for one of L.A.'s best breakfasts. Êdespite a lunch menu, about 80 percent of the guests ordered one of the many pancake items. ÊWe each had an egg dish, which was a lot easier to finish than a pancake. ÊDon't bother to order two or three unless you plan to feed the three friends you brought. ÊNot cheap, but the genuine maple syrup tells you they are serious about their hotcakes! ÊI need to come back at 3 one weekend and see if anyone has ordered a burger or a sandwich!

Cooking good breakfast dishes isn't as easy as it seems. So naturally, when there's breakfast or brunch spot with many high reviews, I'm immediately intrigued. Since we were going to be up in the LA area on a recent weekend, we decided to stop by here in the morning. Little did we know, we would probably wouldn't have to eat lunch... and probably dinner. You can send them a message on Twitter informing them of your party size and time of arrival, and would try to seat you with a minimal wait. They even threw in complimentary mimosas for using tweeting them. It was heavy on the champagne too, and not just diluted with mostly OJ. I admit, it was sort of weird drinking mimosas sitting in the bar area in a hole-in-a-wall, while everyone else had their coffees. Ah well, it was free. My wife and I shared a "Gone Shrimping," which is egg whites scrambled with shrimp, basil pesto, scallions and tomatoes, topped with capers. In addition, we also got the "Tis the Season" pumpkin pancake. I thought that the scrambled egg whites were full of flavor, many times egg whites are a snooz for me because it's usually pretty bland. This one was good, with fresh tender cooked shrimp and the slight hint of the pesto which wasn't too overpowering. The pancake was simply ridiculous. 3 layered, and about the size of a manhole cover, we (or should I say, me) made a 1/4 of a dent into it before throwing in the towel. It was moist, bursting with flavor, not too sweet, and fluffy on the inside. Basically, if you eat their pancakes, you'll be saying it's so FLUFFY! The leftovers fed me breakfast for about a week, there was so much more food. Service is straightforward, but not the most personable or friendly, probably the result of the place being so busy, churning customers in and out throughout the day. This is definitely a place I would never know about, giving it's relatively obscure location and hole-in-wall status. Overall I like the place, and I would drop by again to try other breakfast items (like Mom's French Toast). Solid 4 stars.

Definitely liked it here. We waited about 20 minutes because it was so crowded, so I was hoping it would meet my expectations. And boy, it did. I got the red velvet panCAKE and it was SO GOOD. the cream cheese icing on the top went really well with the pancake. And the pancake was HUGE - not gonna lie, I couldn't even finish half of it. My friend got the peanut butter french toast, and that was super good too. I really liked the toast. Their portions are huge and the waiter was also really nice. The place is, not surprisingly, always crowded though. The only thing is that after eating the pancake and some of the french toast, I felt really heavy cause the food was so fatty. I really wished I had ordered like eggs, bagels, or something to balance the meal, cause I did feel like it was way too sweet after a while. Otherwise, I would definitely recommend this place if you haven't been there before!

Yum Yum YUM!!!! I came here for breakfast...i personally think if u want pancakes or french toast - definitely make your way out to Griddle Cafe. They have all sorts of different pancakes, i could only wish to have a bigger appetite to try them all .. OR if only they have a pancake sampler - that'd be awesome. We ordered the Red Velvet pancake. To my surprise, it was light and fluffy. I was imaging this very thick, dense and very sweet pancake. Creme de la Creme french toast was delicious too! the graham cracker flavor of the toast was yyuuuummmay~ Ê i'm so glad that my friend ordered something salty - egg benedict. It was much needed since we had two sweet dishes. Although it was a good pairing for our sweet breakfast, but i didn't like the benedict that much - the hollandaise sauce was just too rich. The potatoes were good though and it helped balance my sweet palate.

There's more than a bajillion reasons why this place gets continuous rants and raves. My reason simply is because of the PANCAKES! Specialty pancakes stacked in 3's and a mouthful more than even I can handle! My first notion was to gun for the red velvet cakes, but I always HAVE to have that chocolate in my system so I went for the "Black Magic" -oreo stuffed pancakes topped with whipped cream and powdered sugar.. soft as heck and uh-may-zing! Not too proud of the idea that my food buddy and I barely attacked half of the monster, but then again.. Griddle's portions are humongo. For moi.. "Poached y Papas" Benedict. One of the best eggs benedict I've tasted. Actually, let's just say it hit #1 on my list. The potato skins were a surprise twist to the usual biscuits.. crunchy and seasoned. The hollandaise mixed with the poached eggs........... zomg, hellosogood! I guess my only drawback with it was that there was too much of the actual sauce.. it completely smothered the ham and potato skins which ended up kind of overpowering everything. I still ate most of it. Most, not all.. 'cause ya know.. oreo stack chillin' RIGHT next to it. So with no traffic, no wait, fast 'n friendly service, delicious breakfast food in huge portions.. hmmmmmmm I'd say Griddle Cafe lived up to the hype. When I go back to try other items, I hope those give me reasons to put up that last winning star!

Came here after reading about their red velvet pancakes from an internet report. Wow, their red velvet pancakes are by far the best I've tested so far. An order of red velvet pancakes comes with one approximately 12 inch pancake with swirls of cream cheese frosting and powder sugar on top. There is no need for any syrup; the cream cheese frosting is heavenly. We also ordered the bluesberry pancakes. It comes with three approximately 12 inch pancakes topped with blueberry cream cheese frosting. We wanted to order more stuff since everything looked so good, but the date and I couldn't even finished the two orders of pancakes that we ordered (yes, they were that big, and trust me, we can eat). The restaurant is located between the Director's Guild of America and Rite Aid. Around the corner (Behind Rite Aid) there is a parking lot that the Griddle Caf will validate for (good to know if you can't find any street parking). We came here on a Saturday afternoon around 2pm and surprising the parking lot attendant said that he would be closing shortly, therefore, we didn't even need a ticket, told us to just park wherever we wanted and stay however long we wanted. The wait wasn't bad; I was anticipating a super long wait. For a table of two on a Saturday afternoon, the wait was only about 5 minutes. The tables are placed really close together inside, I assume to be able to accommodate more people at once. There is also counter seating that seats approximately 15 people. All the waiters here look like aspiring actors working there until they make it big in the business. I didn't mind at all, eye candy with my meal. =) The atmosphere seems very Hollywood. You see all types of people mingling together over a good meal. OVERALL: the red velvet pancakes are the best I've had so far. I will definitely be back to try some of their other stuff on their menu.

Best Breakfast, END OF STORY! I strongly recommend you go in a group of 4 so you could actually finish your food and save money if you're going for their Famous Pancakes. Portions! Portions! Portions! This place feeds you like you're a SUMO wrestler, the poster child for exaggerated plates. 4 people could eat off an order of pancakes and be satisfied. The rest of the stuff is more than enough for 2 people to share, but when it comes to pancakes you're a Fat Ass to the 2nd Power if you could take down a entire plate alone. I had the Caballero and the Banana Nana Pancakes which I couldn't finish and were beyond delicious!

Came here for the red velvet pancakes! it's like a flat cupcake with lots of frosting. ÊMake sure you get one to share with the table, otherwise you will be overwhelmed with sugar.

My waiter was super on top of things and brought everything out quickly. Food didn't take long to arrive.

Headed to LA for business, hell no! More like food venture. As we drove by we saw herds of people waiting outside. 'Oh man that means there's a 3-4 hour wait!' checked in 40 min wait time.... SCORE!! Guy that was conversing with us as we waited chuckled when we heard that it was just a 40 min wait time. LA standard to them feels like a 3-4 hr wait time. Red velvet pancake I want to take you back to San Francisco !!!! This totally is the best pancake I have tasted. Like what I told my GF's.

The wait was a little long, but that just means it is worth it. Oh and it was! I would not recommend this restaurant for the indecisive. I was a little overwhelmed by the variety of choices and even after I left I still think I should have gotten that or that. I was very happy with my Chicago Charlie Scramble. But I think I enjoyed my brother's Apple Cinnamon pancakes more. I didnt order pancakes because they sounded really sweet, but they weren't! They were perfect and I regretted not ordering one. Oh well, guess I'll be back! Why 4 and not 5? Location is a bit tight. If there was a way to expand it, they should, but i don't think that is possible. So the wait is long,it's a little loud, and it is hard to move around in there. That's all. Don't not go because of that though, you'll be missing out on a Los Angeles treat if you don't.

Don't let the line outside scare you away, this place is WORTH THE WAIT... just make sure you bring your appetite because their portions are BIG!!! Everything we've had here is good, but personally I don't think you can get any better than their french toast, it's mouth watering (ok I admit I dream about their french toast). Oh and wait you have to try their red velvet pancake too! It's an experience! Make sure you order a mimosa while you wait... I've seen them served in line... enjoy!!!

Oh man, this WeHo place is crazy-busy and an apparent magnet for every stargazing tourist, celebrity wannabe and working class stiff (and stiffette) in the greater Los Angeles area. Coming upon it on Sunset on a Sunday morning past 11, you are likely to see a swarm of people along the imposing wall of the Directors' Guild building in sunglasses staring intently at their mobile devices. Jamie W. and I let out a collective sigh thinking that a wait under the blazing sun on one of the hottest days in SoCal was not the most desirable use of our time together down there. Alas, things continued to look unpromising when a young bald guy (who looked like a cross between Moby and David Cross) with a clipboard kept yelling at people not to sit on the entryway steps of the Directors' Guild building. We wee finally given a choice to sit outside which we took in order to minimize our wait. Once seated, things improved considerably. We were starving, so we took advantage of the robust menu and ordered big. Jamie went for the $11.95 "Chicago Charlie's" Scramble, an egg-travaganza that looked like a skillet dish from Lou Mitchell's, full of Italian sausage chunks, bacon, bell pepper, onion, potatoes, garlic, and Mozzarella cheese accompanied by a wedge of buttery garlic bread (see photo). A savory madness. I ordered the even more decadent $12.95 "Poached y Papas" Benedict, a twist on the standard bennie with crispy seasoned potato skins cleverly substituting for the English muffins (see photo). A pair of poached eggs sat on top drowning in a thickly addictive Hollandaise sauce. You would think that would be enough, but we needed a taste of the fabled pancakes. Sure enough, we weakened and ordered the $10.95 BLUESberry, a pair of plate-size pancakes, fluffy as all get out with a blueberry sour cream on top and a shower of powdered sugar to boot (see photo). Really delicious and sadly unfinished given how big our first two dishes were. I had their French Pressed Coffee to slosh it all down (see photo). We could hardly move after we decided we finished. Funny thing is that I only took the briefest look at the interior of the cafe when I grabbed a menu, so all my recollections are from the pavement as hungry diners-to-be waited and stared at our dishes longingly. At least the bald guy forced them to stand elsewhere lest they make us feel self-conscious for the amount of food we were eating. Ah, too late. A return visit is inevitable. I just need to wear something more designer so I can fit in with the skinnier customers. FOOD - 4 stars...really solid breakfast carbs with a tasty twist, hefty portions are the rule, not the exception AMBIANCE - 3 stars...like I said, I only experienced pavement SERVICE - 4 stars...beyond the bald guy, the service was just fine TOTAL - 4 stars...the go-to breakfast place in LA, enough said

The girl next to me was eating the red velvet pancakes and they looked amazing but intense. ÊI asked her how it was and she said it was the best pancakes she's ever had. ÊAlthough tempted, I wasn't sure I could handle all the sweetness. I asked the waiter what he recommended for a first timer and he said the French toast. I ordered it and it was DELICIOUS!

You know a place is boppin' when there's a 30 minute wait at 3pm, on a rainy day, for a cafe serving breakfast food. Pancakes the size of two of your heads (stacks of 3), real maple syrup, waffles with diabetes-inducing toppings, mouth-watering sausages, delicious scrambles... there's something for everyone! Blueberry pancakes were freaking amazing. Fluffy, blueberry-y (filled with tons of berries), ginormous, and so goshdarn TASTY. I tried shoveling the whole thing in my mouth, dousing each forkful with maple syrup (only got a stack of 2), but only got halfway. Washed it down with a french-press coffee (perfect on a cold and rainy day). Had bites of the pork sausages and went to heaven, the Chicago Charlie's Scramble (sausage, potatoes, bacon, bell peppers, garlic, onions), the Strawberries and Cream waffle, and stared at the Addicted to Noisella french toast and felt full. Sidenote: they serve pitchers of mimosas here, which was announced to us by a rather inebriated girl as we were waiting for our table. She even offered us bites of her AMAZING Banana Nana pancakes. Alcohol really does bring people together *sheds a heartfelt tear*. P.S. Yelp just asked me if Griddle Cafe is good for kids. It sure is; just remember to keep them away from all pancakes and waffles and french toast. Unless you want your house completely destroyed in the aftermath of their sugar high.

We arrived around 11:30 AM on a Sunday and there was a decent line outside the restaurant already. We were told the wait was about 40 mins for four people. The wait wasn't too bad, but the guy seating us was super rude and was totally power-tripping. Sorry guy, you're just a 40 year old restaurant seater, get off your high horse!!! He gave this huge speech to everyone Êthat he's been working there for 10 years for $10 an hour and that he doesn't have time for our shit. And he REFUSED to seat us because our fourth party wasn't there yet even though we told him he already exited the freeway and was minutes away. When we FINALLY got seated, we ordered: 1. Red Velvet Pancake - the four of us shared this and it was BEYOND AMAZING. Texture was very nice and fluffy. The flavor wasn't overpoweringly sweet. It was actually really light and the cream cheese frosting complemented it very well. Portion was HUGE too. We didn't even finish it amongst the four of us. Best pancake hands down!!! Everyone MUST try! 2. Pouched y Papa Benedict - Meh. It was two pouched eggs on top of a slab of ham and potatoes with hollandaise sauce on top. Their hollandaise sauce was actually better than a lot of other places. The ham was really good. What killed the entree for me was the potatoes. It was deep fried and was SO greasy and dry. I felt like I was eating a REALLY fried potato chip. I felt really gross eating it and barely touched it. If I ever come back, it'd only be for the Red Velvet Pancake.

I absolutely heart Griddle Cafe. ÊWhen in the SoCal area, I now try and fit a visit in. I've only been here a few times but each experience was great. ÊThe service wasn't bad and the wait wasn't too long. It depends on the day and time you go. Actually, last time there in April on a Friday morning (10am), my girls and I were seated right away. The food is great! They have such a huge selection in pancakes and there is so much I want to try but so far... my faves; Some say it's over-rated but I love the RED VELVET PANCAKE! The cream cheese swirl is a little rich, yes, but it's oh-so-good! It's very filling but it's hard to stop. GONE SHRIMPING is good too! ...if you love shrimp, jack and capers. Omelette "MY SOUL"... Just OK to me. My new fave is the POACHED y PAPAS BENEDICT. ÊOne, the hollandaise sauce is super tasty. Two, instead of a english muffin...it's a potato skin and Three... the ham is a huge thick slice. Total perfection! This spot is definitely a must-try when in Hollywood!

The Griddle Cafe is a great example of American excess. ÊYou have to go at least once. ÊAnd bring a friend. ÊJust seeing the look on each other's faces when that ginormous plate of pancakes comes out of the kitchen is worth the wait. ÊI doubt that there is a person on the planet that can eat an entire order of those pancakes. Ê The Griddle Cafe seems to always a have a line out of the door, but don't let that discourage you. ÊIn my experience, the staff moves quickly and you'll be seated promptly. ÊI always come for breakfast, but they have a great selection of burgers and other lunch items also. ÊSo far I've eaten the egg breakfast, original pancakes, blueberry pancakes, and I've tasted the cobb burger. ÊI made the mistake of ordering a full order of pancakes to share with a friend one time. ÊWe barely ate through a 1/4 of them. ÊThen I found out that I could order a single pancake. ÊSo, you live and you learn. Ê The blueberry pancake is delicious. ÊIts topped with a blueberry sour cream and powdered sugar (as if the syrup you're gonna slather on isn't enough). ÊIts heavenly. And it will wreck your diet. ÊSo savor slowly and share with someone. ÊThe original pancake is just original and delicious. ÊIts just what you'd expect an original pancake to be. ÊBacon was right - salty, crisp, yummy. ÊThe cobb burger is great too. ÊI only had one bite but I wanted to have a few more. Ê The Griddle Cafe has a menu full of creative, sugary pancakes. ÊIt would be a shame to not try one.

The Griddle Cafe was an awesome way to start the PERFECT Saturday with 4 other girlfriends. I realized there's a slight trick to jumping the queue...since we were a table of 5 and the 20 people in line in front of us were for table of 2s, we automatically became first in line as we wait for the larger round booth to get wiped down. BE WARNED - LARGE PORTIONS!!!! Order to share. VELVET PANCAKE. I still salivate when I think about the soft fluffy and slightly chocolately pancakes and sweet cream cheese whipped cream. I appreciate how our server told us to try the pancake without any syrup. He was right, it doesn't need any syrup =) EGGWHITE TURKEY SCRAMBLE. I love how there's an eggwhite only option already on the menu so you aren't pretentious sounding. HASHBROWN. Crispy edges. Perfect with the 4 or 5 different options of hot sauces on the table. APPLE PIE FRENCH TOAST. yum. I love the apple chunks within the soft thick texas toast size bread. The apple pie filling served on the side was great too, but slightly overly sweet. I will need to try their regular french toast next time. Free parking in the back of the building!!!

Is my review necessary? Probably not with over 1500 reviews, but I must say this is my favorite brunch place in LA right now. Got here at 10:45AM on a Saturday and waited almost an hour to be seated for a party of 4. Definitely worth it. Again and again. Best nutella-stuffed french toast I've ever had. Sweet, yes, but that's really how a nutella-stuffed french toast should be. It's not cloyingly sweet, just the right amount. The two french toast slices, although not very thick, were quite large. The best thing about the french toast, however, was the whipped cream. It was creamy and thick. My sister got the Charlie's Scramble, which is basically an egg scramble with sausage, onions, bell peppers, mushrooms, and tomato all topped with a generous heap of mozzarella cheese. Big portions, but definitely doable for one hungry female. Another thing we got was an omelette, which came with a potato pancake, which I did not care too much for. The omelette was huge, but I don't know how I will get myself to order anything but the french toast next time. It was so good! Everything here was delicious, and even for someone who doesn't drink coffee, I thought the French press smelled really good. There is parking for the cafe behind in the drugstore parking lot. The service is pretty good, but music is really loud inside. I will definitely come here earlier next time to try and avoid the wait.

I had the pancakes there and my girl had some tacos with guacamole, I'm not sure y would she order tacos at a breakfast joint. The whole experience was not that memorable for me as far as food goes but the service is really good. It turns out that the tacos was better than the pancakes. Pancakes was dry for me. We went there on a whim and waited in line. We stood in line for 15 minutes before realizing we had to put our name on the list and line up in order. Fortunately the line staff (think his name is Jim) was awesome, he let us get back to where we were instead of losing our space. ÊIt's a very packed restaurant but for breakfast, I wouldn't come back. if I had to come back it would be the good service and the huge fries I saw people having.

ÊPancakes are family sized, so bring your cousin, your boyfriend, your next door neighbor and your friend who eats a lot (we all have one), and get ready to indulge in guilt-free breakfast/brunch items.

ÊMy tooth shook from all the sugar so if you're not into getting diabetes, don't order these babies. Leftovers galore.

My friend suggested this breakfast place to me, especially as a breakfast hot spot, it was our first destination of the trip. I LOVE BREAKFAST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The wait was not bad at all (monday afternoon) For the portions they serve, our table for two was NOT BIG ENOUGH to support out dishes and coffee. BF got the omelet hoagie and i had the cheese cake french toast. WoW their french toast are amazing! I want to try ALL of them, but the portion size will not allow for that to happen..... and living hundreds of miles away doesnt help either. The thing i wasnt to thrilled about was the noise level. i could NOT hold a conversation with my BF sitting across from me. But i could hear the conversations to my left and right..... thats because the tables next to me were closer to me than my actual party. Oh well, i was mainly there for the food anyways, but definitely not a spot for conversations, prolly should take it to a coffee shop, i saw one right across from the Griddle.

OMG. Best breakfast ever. Went there on a Tuesday morning around 11am and had to wait about 5-10 minutes for 2 people. Got the breakfast burrito and the oats pancakes. So delicious. Split both orders between the two of us, were able to finish the burrito, but only ate about 1/4 of the pancake. Definitely plan to share when you go there.

I would like to relate this morning's experience to you. I have been going to the Griddle regularly for a few years. ÊI know to get there early so that I can get a table without waiting. ÊThis morning I arrived at 7:45 and waited for my breakfast companion to join me. ÊHe arrived at 8:00 on the nose. We then went into the restaurant to get seated. ÊI noticed a number of open booths and the occupied booths held either two or three people. ÊI asked for a booth and was told they were only for parties of three or more. ÊI pointed out that there were booths containing two people and his response was "You can have a table or the counter." He completely glazed over my observation. We begrudgingly took a table. ÊI was both disappointed by his lack of customer service and somewhat angered by his attitude. ÊWhen he came again I expressed this to him and said I would have a hard time finding a reason to come back. ( I drive a long way just to eat at The Griddle, so it's an involved process). ÊHis response was "That's fine because we don't want people like YOU here anyway!" ÊAt that point I got up and left. I have worked in customer service for twenty-five years. ÊI know the definition of good customer service and I also know that if you are going to create a policy it needs to be universal. ÊIf the policy is a minimum of three in a booth then I don't expect to see two in a booth and then be told that I can't have one. ÊI also know that no matter what your thoughts of the customer it is NEVER acceptable to speak to them in the way I was spoken to. So why the five star review? ÊBecause Jodi, the owner, made it a point to contact me about my negative experience. ÊOther than this one interaction with one staff member, the rest of the staff, especially Sergio and Kevin, have been awesome. ÊJodi apologized and handled the situation not just to my satisfaction, but above and beyond. ÊTo me this is what customer service is REALLY about. ÊIt's impossible to prevent every customer from having a negative experience, but it IS possible to fix it. ÊThanks, Jodi!

I adore this place! Anytime friends are in town and they wanna do breakfast, I take them here. I usually order the pancakes or french toast here and my absolute favorite is the Peanut Bubba French Toast. There is just something special about Nutter Butters for breakfast! The Noisella (Nutella) French Toast is probably my second favorite since Nutella is just plain addictive. The Black Magic (Oreo) pancakes are darn good too and impossible to finish in one sitting so it's a good thing that their pancakes are still good when taken to go and reheated. If you love pumpkin, the 'Tis the Season Pancakes are great and remind me of my mom's pumpkin bread during the holidays! If you don't feel like having anything ultra sweet, the Sow Your Oats Pancakes are oat and cinnamon filled and only need a bit of syrup to enjoy. The only thing I didn't care for too much was the Apple Cobbler French Toast. The side of apple pie-filling was a bit too much and managed to soak it's way into the stack of french toast. I think it would be better without it. Their coffee is wonderful too. I usually get the french press with the medium coffee and wait a bit to plunge the handle and it's perfect every time. The line forms early so if you're planning on an early weekend breakfast, get here a good 15 minutes before they open and you'll be seated right away...and make sure your entire party is there too.

Let's make a deal. I'll give the Griddle Cafe 5 stars, if you tell your waiters to work on their eye contact with customers while they're talking rather than talk to us as they're walking away. I don't even remember the name of our waiter, nor do I remember what he looked like, because we saw nothing but his back side during Brunch. Tip: HUGE PORTIONS, so make sure you come in with a big appetite. Oh, here's another tip, try to order really fast, because some of the waiter's here are too impatient to stand around and listen to you what you want. Is the so-so service going to stop me from ordering a stack of their Blueberry Pancakes next time? Probably not. I'll be back, hopefully our waiter will be in a better mood, next time around.

HUGE portions, yes. This place is known for the GINORMOUS size pancake and french toasts. Flavor-wize, it's just okay. I had the "addicted to noisella" french toast with nutella. I love nutella, but this combination was way to sweet for me. There were a thick layer of nutella in between 2 slices for french toast, and cover with a mountain of powdered sugar. When I cut into it, the consistancy reminded me more of cake than french toast. So I guess if you like cake for breakfast, this is the choice for you. Also, they have very strong french press coffees.

The plate arrived in front of me + HOLY COW!!!!!!!!!!! All the photos I browsed through on Yelp + on The Griddle Cafe's website did nothing to prepare me for how HUUUUUUGE the portion sizes are! No joke... my stack of pancakes was OVERFLOWING the size of the plate, + after 20 minutes of dedicated chomping, I only barely consumed 1/3 of what seemed more like an actual cake than 3 pancakes... AHHHHH!!! / Ê/ Ê/ Ê Êrewind Ê Ê/ Ê/ Ê/ \ Ê\ Ê\ Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê\ Ê\ Ê\ Seeing as The Griddle Cafe tops the "Hot on Yelp" featured local spots right now, I made time to come to this little restaurant http://www.yelp.com/biz_É midday on a weekday so that I could partake in all this battered up goodness without the wait. I crave some American breakfast fattiness every once in a while, + this day was just one of those days. Skimming through the pancake, french toast, egg combos + lunch options on the menu, I gave in to my craving + got the oh-so-delectable "Eyes Wide Open" ($9.95) which has a shot of espresso + chocolate chips mixed into the pancake batter. http://www.yelp.com/biz_É \ Ê\ Ê\ Ê Êfast forward Ê Ê\ Ê\ Ê\ / Ê/ Ê/ Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê / Ê/ Ê/ The plate arrived in front of me + HOLY CO- Ê\ Ê\ Ê\ Ê Êfast forward Ê Ê\ Ê\ Ê\ Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê / Ê/ Ê/ Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê / Ê/ Ê/ So I think I died from inhaling the powdered sugar even before leaning in to take the first bite. This fluffy monstrosity was so intoxicatingly sweet, I probably got a sugar rush high only 5 minutes in. Especially with their specialty maple syrup from Vermont http://www.yelp.com/biz_É all soaked into the buttery-ness, it was just that good. My friend across the tiny table ordered the "Mom's French Toast" ($10.95) http://www.yelp.com/biz_É + was equally hit with a fatal overdose of sugar as he couldn't get close to finishing his magnificent plate either. And to think that he'd been considering getting an egg combo as well, oh man. *phew* I opted to abandon ship before I was truly overwhelmed + got a to-go box in case I had the guts to attempt trying my fate against the chocolatey monster again. Funny how even my 2/3 remaining had to be squeeze-packed into the already over-sized styrofoam box. We stumbled out into the back parking lot, looked back at the mockingly cheery-looking logo painted on the back wall http://www.yelp.com/biz_É + vowed to never return again... but something tells me that I'll somehow end up at The Griddle Cafe on another unsuspecting craving-driven day in the future. When that time comes, I shall share a plate + have a detox + workout regiment already prepared to sweat out the sugar overdose.

OMG I wish I had some chocolate chip cookie crusted french toast now....this alone gets 5 stars. We came in on a Friday morning after a long drive from the Bay Area and got seated within 3 minutes of getting there. LUCKY US...or lucky to being just a party of 2. We also ordered the potato skin eggs benedict? I don't even know if that's what it was called, but I saw it on someone else's table and ordered that. We only ordered two things and it was enough to share and enough to save for breakfast the next day! But part of me wish I ordered more to eat for the entire week! The service is good!

Okay, went back and definitely wasn't as great as I remembered it. I'm tempted to give 3 stars, but I'm sticking with 4 just cuz I gave 5 last time. Went on a Saturday morning-ish, like brunch-time, and it was PACKED. We waited about half an hour for a seat, and when we finally got seated, it was at this TINY table for 2. Service was very slow and our waiter was EXTREMELY blah. I sort of understand because it's atmosphere isn't the most conducive for peppiness, but he was kind of a downer. We waited just as long for our food as we did for our table. It's also really noisy inside the restaurant, so my friend and I were almost yelling in order to talk to each other. The food, of course, was amazing, but SO FILLING. We had to take 3/4 of it home. I've decided that I can't take Griddle Cafe more than a couple times a year. Fills my pancake quota for the first half of 2011.

WOW, all I can say is just wow. 45 minute wait for pancakes? Waaaay worth it. Do yourself a favor and order the black magic pancakes. BEST PANCAKES I have EVER tasted, no lies. These three griddle cakes can feed 2.5 people. I ordered the pancakes and a side of bacon. The bacon was definitely not needed. I barely had 1/3rd of my pancakes before I gave up. Normally you would think that oreo pancakes would sound like it would be too chocolaty and bitter after a while, but it had the perfect balance and stayed delicious till the last bite I took.

Went to the griddle cafe a few weeks back with my b, seeking to satisfy our breakfast food craving. ÊEven though the portions were HUGE... I thought it was just OK, but maybe it was just what I ordered... Here's the scoop: Hunger Pangs- huge slice of thick cut ham, 3 eggs, toast, and griddle potatoes. ÊWhen it came out from the kitchen my eyes widen at how big the plate was. ÊIt was a good breakfast, something you expect from any greasy spoon breakfast joint. ÊWas tasty about 1/3 of the way through, then it was just crazy salty. Ê Caballero-pretty much a loaded breakfast burrito with eggs, chicken chorizo, potatoes and green chilies, serves with guacamole, sour cream and chips. ÊAnother huge portion, I made a very small dent in the burrito before I threw in the towel, but it didn't really do much for me. ÊI was excited when I saw that chorizo was in it but it just lacked flavor, which was such a bummer... Strawberries and Cream Waffle- This was the best dish we ordered... whole wheat waffle topped with brown sugar sour cream and strawberries. ÊI loved the brown sugar sour cream and the contrast of sweet from the brown sugar and tang from the sour cream. Ê I will not completely rule out Griddle Cafe, but I will for sure be ordering something new the next time I head over.

This is the first breakfast joint I tried when I first moved to LA and I can never get enough. Went back again this morning. It's all-star weekend, so the wait was a little longer than normal, but it was sunny and the street was crowded and I had good company so I didn't mind. I adore the host - he's busy and has a dry sense of humor but is always incredibly sweet and as accommodating as he can be given the amount of people he has to shuffle in and out. He's honest and let's you know when the wait is going to be extra long. He also has a great memory. I sat at the bar for the first time - it didn't make much of a difference. The seating is so close, it didn't really matter. I like that feeling of being close to the other diners - it gives it a sense of community and sharing in great food. I've never had a bad server - they're busy and don't have time for much small talk, but the orders are always right and they always fill up your water glass and replace your drinks. When they have time they exchange pleasantries. This morning I had the pumpkin pancakes and a side of the best bacon I've ever eaten. I ate about a quarter and will have plenty of left overs to last me the week. The mimosas were yummy. I had two but only got charged for one. My friend had the chocolate chip french toast - also delish but I think the pancakes are what really stands out here. The Red Velvet is brilliant, but I try to get something different every time. Although some evenings, I just find myself hankering for that sweet, sinful staple that The Griddle is known for. I can't wait to get the mix. The Griddle has remained my favorite breakfast spot in Hollywood. It's always well worth the wait.

Pancake overload. MASSIVE! Equally massive is the number of people outside waiting to get a table at this tiny joint. Decadence to the extreme. Captain Crunch on my pancakes? Pumpkin Pie pancakes? Nutella French Toast? Be ready to blast yourself with sweet, sweet, and more sweet! It's like Willy Wonka quit making candy and went into the breakfast restaurant business. Or you could skip the sugar and just go for an omelette but I think that would be boring. Oh and don't go here if you want a quiet peaceful breakfast. Most likely, you'll be at a table where you are rubbing elbows with the person at the next table. It is cramped and loud! But just block it out and focus on the gigantic pancakes already.

Went there one Sunday morning for breakfast. ÊIt was raining and yet we Were told it would be an hour wait for a party of 4. Decided to wait it out. Got seated in exactly an hour! Hubby ordered the Say cheese omelette and I got the red velvet pancake with cream cheese frosting and hot chocolate. My sister ordered the strawberry and cream waffles and her hubby ordered the Caballero eggs. The portions were ginormous! The hot chocolate was thick and creamy and covered in loads of whipped cream and drizzled in chocolate! Absolutely yumm! The red velvet pancakes were great but maybe a tad too sweet for my liking. The waffles are highly recommended - fresh strawberries with fresh cream on hot waffles. The caballero scrambled eggs came wrapped in a tortilla Êwith chicken chorizo and avocado and chips and salsa on the side. The say cheese omelette came with toast and a side of fruit. All in all a delish breakfast! Service was good. Would definitely go there again but probably not on a weekend. Took off one star since they don't take reservations and the long wait!!

If you're in the mood for a hearty or decadent breakfast, search no more friends. As others have attested to, the red velvet pancakes are unbelievably delicious (so good that they top the pancake off with some of the red velvet batter). I also tried the chocolate chip cookie french toast as well as the apple cobbler waffle. Each of these desert-infused breakfasts are packed with flavor, and are very filling. Their more standard breakfast fair like their scrambles are equally well executed with generous portions. I also could not recommend their eggs benedict enough; it's one of the best I've had! Every dish we ordered was around the $10 range. I went on a Sunday morning around noon with a party of 6 and our wait was only 15 minutes, and we were seated in a cool back room apparently for use by celebrities whenever they come through. I would go back a second time, definitely!

Best breakfast place ever!!! Wow, all the time I come here, I see a looong line! If you go there with 2 ppl, you don't wait that long, but 4 ppl for about an hour wait. Coffee is great! The French Toast is amazing!!! My favorite is Cobb Omelet!!! Highly recommended!!!!

I love this place. ÊFor breakfast and brunches on the weekend, it gets pretty packed. ÊSo be prepared to wait at least 45 minutes. This time, I got smart and went on a weekday. ÊAt lunch. ÊNo wait and plenty of booths to choose from. Ê*evil laugh* ÊMy bf and I ordered their eggs benedict (based on Yelp reviews) and the red velvet pancake. ÊI dared my bf to compare their eggs benedict to mine and although he tried his best to not say mine was inferior ("well, they're both very different"), I could tell in his eyes that the Griddle's hollandaise sauce had won him over. ÊIt is absolutely one of the best I've ever tasted. ÊNow, if only I can get that recipe... The only thing I didn't like was their attempt to experiment by substituting English muffins with fried potato skins. ÊI found it a little too heavy. ÊBut it's still a pretty good dish. If you order the red velvet pancake, be prepared for a toothache. ÊIn a good way. ÊIt's a plate-sized pancake with swirls of cream cheese frosting. ÊMy gawd. ÊIt was like eating a red velvet cake. ÊAs a breakfast item. ÊGranted, it wasn't breakfast at the time but damn! ÊNot only did I leave with food coma but I was struck with sugar coma as well. Other things to try: Êthe French Toast with cheesecake (another toothache inducer) and their chili (although I heard it's been taken off the menu?).

HUGE! manhole cover sized pancakes that are AMAZING! The different varieties and creative combinations are a win! I don't have a particular favorite one cause they all taste so good! But the school teacher one is pretty high up there. I only come here for the pancakes, but my friends have gotten the other breakfast items and those have been awesome as well. Huge portions is all I have to say! The wait can be a pain, and can be quite long. But def worth it!

Thanks to fellow Yelpers Anthony N and Marti L's recommendation, I brought my friend to Griddle Caf as soon as he arrived in LA from Salt Lake City. The weekday did not slow down the crowd from packing the sidewalk tables, the chili bar, and the regular seating area as rows of tables were tightly stacked leaving less than an inch of elbow room for comfort. The noise level was very high, and the first striking characteristic about this place was the upbeat atmosphere coupled with eye-popping, ridiculously massive plates of food piled wide and high on every table. Our French Pressed Coffee with soy was the first to arrive, and it was dark and flavorful with plenty of intensity for a wake up call. For the entrees, we shared an order of Poached y Papas Benedict that came with a thick bulky piece of juicy baked ham that was tender and not too salty layered in between two poached eggs, robustly flavorful hollandaise sauce, and a thick piece of well-seasoned potato skins at the bottom. The potato skin was nicely seasoned and easy to cut into. In all honesty, I'm not big on ham due to its salty nature but this one was tender and delicious with an impressive hollandaise sauce to strike a perfect savory and sweet balance. The eggs were a bit overdone and not as runny as it should, but overall it was delicious and I was impressed at the way they were able to pull it off with the potato skin as an alternative to the use of muffins or brioche and croissant. My friend thought the stack of Red Velvet Pancake was a bit too sweet for him, but I really enjoyed it. It came with a rich buttermilk taste without the hint of chocolate but the fluffy swirl of cream cheese icing was enough for me to finish it all without the need for maple syrup that was available at every table. For me, the Red Velvet Pancake had plenty of wow factors and the experience inspired me to eventually try the ones from the Buttermilk Truck so I can get a comparison. Service was on point at the beginning but dwindled once the dishes arrived at our table. We didn't get a refill of our coffee and had a hard time tracking down our server to settle our bill. I can't imagine how busier this place can get on the weekends, but was glad to have tried it without having to wait. I thought the price and value was pretty good considering the range of sweet and savory items to choose from and the quality you get for large portions of food. It was overall a memorable meal. I hope to be back at another time to try their other buttermilk pancakes.

Overrated red velvet pancakes. Why? Too sweet. Not that great strawberry waffles. Why? Not crunchy enough and too much sugar. Not so good apple cobbler French toast. Why? Nothing special. Omelette, eh, whatever. What is good is the papa Benedict and the peanut butter bubba French toast. Those 2 things are the only things u should get. Oh, and coffee is not good. Hence, latte is not good. And mocha is all Hershey's syrup.

This is easily one of the best breakfast places I have ever been to. ÊThe flavors and portions here are enough to please anyone. ÊIt would be nearly impossible for someone to not find something amazing that suits their mood. The pancakes are larger than I've ever seen, the french toasts are insane and the eggs benedict are incredibly perfect. ÊThey are made on a bed of potato skins instead of english muffins and with a huge ham steak instead of canadian bacon. The line here can get huge, so make sure you're ready to wait, or go by at an off day/hour if you can. Ê Please do me a favor and try Griddle if you have never been before, you will most certainly thank me.

BEST. FRENCH TOAST. ANYWHERE. EVER. I'm normally a pancake type-of-girl but this place came very close to changing my mind. There was zero wait, which was awesome considering it was a Saturday and very busy. The seating was a bit close for comfort, but it's expected when you have a continuous flow of customers and need to make the best of the space. Plus they're extremely efficient and have a good turnover. I have a real appreciation for places that serve great food without all the dilly dallying. We never had to wait or flag down our server-- he was on top of everything which was impressive considering how busy it was. We ordered Mom's French toast and the "Kicking and Screaming" breakfast tacos and they sure did make me want to kick and scream at how tasty they were. But by far, the french toast stole the show. The first bite of it was one of those "close-your-eyes-and-shake-your-head-because-you-?cant-possibly-comprehend-how-yummy-this-is" type of moments. The french pressed coffee was delicious as well. This place is definitely one of my top go-to breakfast places when I'm in the area.

Pumpkin Pancakes...amazing! Not the one's with the caramel sauce...the "Tis the Season". Huge....could share with three-four people. There was a little bit of a wait...about Ê20 minutes...not much for a Saturday morning. Here's the skinny... The pancakes are amazing. The reason...they aren't the same kind of run of the mill buttermilk...they actually infuse the pancakes with the flavor, adding actual pumpkin to the batter. They're about 10 bucks and worth every penny. You don't leave hungry...or thinking to yourself..."I could have made them at home!" The Griddle is a treat...someplace you'll take guest to for a "only in Hollywood" kind of breakfast!

My friend and I went on a Friday morning at 10:30am and we only had to wait for 5 minutes which I was grateful for. We ordered the Caballero breakfast burrito and shared it. Good thing too because it was huge! The burrito was one of the best I have ever had! Every bite was as good as the first. ÊNot too spicy but perfect flavoring! Then we of course tried the red velvet pancake. ÊLet me tell you...one of the BEST pancakes I have ever eaten in my entire life!! DELICIOUS! Love at first bite!!! I can't get enough of this place!

If you love to eat and you don't mind gargantuan proportions (is that redundant?), you have to hit The Griddle Cafe! ÊThe first time I went there, it was after noon and I wasn't in the mood for breakfast, so I ordered a hamburger. ÊThat's like going to Pink's Hot Dogs and getting... well, a hamburger!** On my next visit, I became acquainted with the fabulous pancakes they're known for. ÊI'm telling you, the variety is almost as astounding as the size! ÊOne of the best parts of going to The Griddle is the inevitable moment when a customer's jaw drops upon seeing the standard stack of three cakes which is delivered by default! Tip #1: ÊGet a single! ÊUnless you have an appetite to be reckoned with, or you want to have a few days' worth of leftovers, just order one pancake! ÊYou may not see this option on the menu, but it will save you a few dollars, and possibly an aching gut! ÊAlso, if you order an omelet, you can upgrade your side from toast to a single pancake for an extra couple bucks. ÊThis is great if you're sharing with a friend, which I would definitely recommend! Tip #2: ÊPark in the back! ÊThe entrance to this lot is behind Rite-Aid on Fairfax, just south of Sunset. ÊThe Griddle has a dedicated lot that they share with Rite-Aid and a few other businesses. ÊYou don't have to worry about meters, what time of day you can/can't park on the street, etc. ÊYou can get into The Griddle through the back entrance, and you might just see Lily Tomlin dashing into the shoe store next door. Tip #3: ÊFollow @thegriddlecafe on Twitter! ÊYou'll get the scoop on specials such as Red Velvet Pancakes, which are not on the regular menu. ÊYou may even get complimentary mimosas or express seating. ÊBut if you do have to wait, it's usually not long, and you can feast on some eye candy appetizers. ÊThe actor/model/servers are just as yummy as the food! **I'm a breakfast junkie, so I usually gravitate towards things like the Apple Cobbler French Toast and A Time To Love pumpkin pancake fabulosity, but TGC also has some badass sandwiches, such as the Grilled Chicken Sicilian Melt.

The Peanut Bubba Crunchy French Toast is amazing! But keep in mind that many of their breakfasts are super rich so it'll be more like a dessert than breakfast (which I know I'm okay with). The place is small but has tons of tables so our wait wasn't very long. I would recommend getting there early since a link starts to form pretty quick. Even if you're starving you could still split a meal and not finish it. If you like leftovers this is a great place to go.

Griddle Cafe! I had heard a lot about this place, so my husband and I decided to try it on a Monday (President's Day). We drove by on a Saturday and thought it was a night club because of the line. There was less of a line on Monday, but we still waited 30+ minutes. Anyway, the host is pretty entertaining and the wait goes by quickly. Upon our arrival at the table, we both ordered coffee, which comes in your own little french press and is GOOD. Also, you pay the price for the good quality at $4 each. Even though we try to avoid carbs, I had to get a pancake. Duh. So, I got the Scotch on the Rocks. Coconut, pecan, butterscotch goodness! Delicious! PLEASE get the short stack, though! The regular order was 3 gigantic pancakes and we ate it for 3 days and had to throw the rest away. Too much goodness! My husband got a scramble which I think was good but I only remember the pancake. If you want to indulge, it's the place to be.

The Prologue: I'm generally hesitant to try famous, hyped-up places as they generally tend to let me down. Not the case with Griddle Caf. Our experience there was great from beginning to end. The Beginning: We arrived around 10am on a Saturday morning and the hipsters (http://www.latfh.com/ ) were out in droves. We were able to park about a block away on a side street. There was a crowd of about 15 people waiting out front and I knew we were in for a long wait. But as we approached the host man to get our names down, he asked if we were just two, I said yes, he said follow me. And like that, we were seated with zero wait. The Middle: My stomach and brain had a furious debate on whether to go sweet or savory and in the end my brain won. I ordered a shrimp omelet with cottage cheese, plus a side of bacon and the woman got some apple cobbler French toast. When my plate came out, I was shocked to see about a pound of cottage cheese on the side. It was literally a full tub of the stuff. The omelet itself was great. The eggs were cooked perfectly as were the shrimp inside. The sour cream and avocado provided a nice cool contrast to everything else. Oh and that side of bacon could have been some of the best bacon I've had outside my own kitchen. http://www.yelp.com/biz_É The Second Act: The wife's French toast was really good but not orgasmic. The two oversized slices of bread would make Texas toast look like it was from Rhode Island. The coating on the bread was quite nice as was the huge side of apple pie filling. http://www.yelp.com/biz_É The End: A very filling and great meal, we both took about half our plates home for another meal. I can't wait to go back and try more of their ridiculously large menu.

Holy crap. Everything here is huge. Everything here is delicious. You're going to wait outside with an eclectic group of people while a rude man comes out and yells names that you pray is yours. When you finally sit down, it's loud and you're crowded in, but when you're greeted by delicious pancakes and french toast, nothing else matters. You will have leftovers upon leftovers, so the $10 you pay for your meal is more like an investment. Try the OJ at least once! it's $5, but it's fantastically delicious.

I enjoyed then with an ok mimosa, side of cheese eggs and with some sort of tasty maple sausage. You will definitely hurt yourself... You've been warned!

Since my favorite food is breakfast, my boyfriend and I have been trying every breakfast spot all over Los Angeles. I enjoyed this place so much. I wished I would have read reviews or that the waiters would have warned me that when you order "Eyes Wide Shut" Pancakes that I would not be able to finish them! The pancakes are chocolate chip with espresso shots in the pancakes which is an A+ set of pancakes, but they are about 10 inches wide and they give you three of them. The couple next to us noticed that it must be my first time there and offered to buy our breakfast if I could finish the whole set of pancakes. I wish I could have succeeded in that challenge, but there was no way. I couldn't even finish one. My boyfriend had a Êstrawberry waffle and said it was good which means it was most likely spectacular. The wait staff is all handsome men who look like this is their stop before they become actors. The mimosa could have been a little bit larger and could have done without the marischino cherry at the bottom. We will for sure be going to try this spot again. Next time I'm going to try an omelette.

We were hungry one Sunday recently (today, actually), and wanted to take the motorcycles on a breakfast run. Seemed like a great day to try the G.C., so off we went. A bit discouraged when we pulled up and saw the line of peeps, but since Coffee Bean, Tea Leaf, and Artichoke Hearts (ok, they really don't have artichokes) was across the street, the anticipated 40 minute wait wasn't a deal killer. Good people watching as well. So, finally made it in, and saw why the line was so long. Huge portions of great looking food. This was one of those times when you eat and eat, then eat some more, but then it looks like you have hardly made a dent in your meal. Way too much food! Good service, great breakfast food (for two days, actually, post Griddle Cafe), reasonable prices. Love this place!

Griddle Cafe's 250th Review...nice ! Seeing that french press in full effect, got me all percolating, which in turn got my pal to ask me what you know about percolating ? Came here with Diddy after a long lazy afternoon and had a super late breakfast about 3 pm...cool no f 'n crowd...we sit immediately. Cheeks - Hey Diddy...isn't that the girl from The Goonies ? Diddy - Uh...there's two girls ? In the movie...and sitting next to each other ? Cheeks - No...you donkey...that girl, the one in green...didn't she come out in The Goonies? Diddy - Hmmm...Are you saying there are two girls in the movie ? Cheeks - Yeah...don't ya remember...there's this cute one and then there's the other one... Diddy - Oh...so she's the cute one ? Cheeks - Naw...she was, is, the...uh...less than cute one... Diddy - Well I can't say for sure...I don't know...I never saw the movie... Cheeks - ?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? Yeah...good times...we quickly ordered our food. 2 OJs, a coffee, and water...two of them Diddy - Bacon n' Eggs w/ a FULL Stack of Ol' fashion Pancakes(we were gonna share the cakes, don't trip...)http://www.yelp.com/biz_É Cheeks - Cobb Omelet, awesomeness in a folded egg torta...http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OSYoTFAfq9_?wFyDH_qUsTA?select=AeHylvgaIpfZE4WPc3eveg Man, we hunkered down...we battled, we scratched, we fought tooth and butter knife. And at the end of the day, Diddy and I, vanquished that monster load of FOUR (4) cakes...yes, yes we did. I think on the last two bites, I started to waiver a little, but with Diddy encouraging words (sissy) and laughter, I pushed the envelope...thank gawd it didn't return to sender ! This place is alright...I've been coming here for years, so I brought Diddy to introduce him to the wonderfulness of this place cuz he said he's never been. Like I said before, I totally avoid the crowds, so I show up super early or super late, never in the middle, unless you wanna impress outta-townees with famous faces...which reminds me... I did see Cam Diaz w/ Timberlake here once...but the funniest was when we, my sis n' I, saw Ian Ziering http://www.imdb.com/nameÉ (of 90210 fame) pull up to the counter while we were just about to finish. After some discussion of yay or nay...we decide it is him, cuz someone hit him up for a signature...musta grown up watching the show... So we leave, thinking about our planned day ahead...When we get out the back door, we noticed this silver Porsche w/ tan red interior, well a f 'n hot car, BUT it's parked all crazy...like...well you know...don't hit my car cuz it's new... I told my sis, "Watch it be his" and she's like..."You think..." to which she pointed out the CA lic. plate Ê90210 * (star symbol) ! ! ! Yeah...they called the paramedics cuz I was withering about on the parking lot floor in pain...all buckled over cuz I couldn't stop laughing for 10 min. straight ! ! Hmmm...I heart L.A.

My first trip to the Griddle: Saturday morning, 11:15 AM. Quoted 15-20 minute wait. Not too shabby, and was right on the money. My first reaction to the menu: "Holy crap, there are a lot of pancakes." My first reaction to viewing the massive pancakes flying past my head and on to other tables: "Oh my Jesus." My first decision: order Mom's French Toast. With a side of Nutella (since I was almost positive the Stuffed French Toast would be too much for lil' old chocoholic me...) My first reaction to tasting the French Toast, with an ice cream scoop-size of butter on top: "Oh my Jesus." My next decision will not be an easy one: a) should I wait until I burned off the million calories to return to this breakfast haven? b) should I order pancakes next time? c) Or stick with the delish French Toast? d) Or venture to the lunch side of the menu, which looks equally delicious as the breakfast? It will take multiple, subsequent trips to determine the best course of action.

One of the best deals in LA. One plate of pancakes feeds about 6 humans or 39 actresses. What I recommend is coming when people visit from out of town on their first morning. ÊThey will love the anticipation of waiting 40 minutes for a table , they will love seeing the DGA next door, they will love the Weho bustle and the insane pancake flavors. Take the leftovers home with you, and voila, your breakfasts will be covered for the remainder of their visit. It will break down a two-dollar a day breakfast and you don't have to leave the house to grub from there on out. Perfect. The food is not as delicious as it is plentiful, but it's good. Not the best pancakes I've had, but definitely the best variety of pancake flavors. I like the golden ticket which is bananas, struedel (kinda like chunks of cinnamon coffee-cake) and nuts. I didn't like the breakfast burrito, as huge as it was. I would say stick to pancakes.

So peep this! It's Monday morning and here I am, thinking I was slick by avoiding the weekend madness at the Griddle. WRONG!!! I wanted a table for four and yeah I know it's a small place, but still a 45 minute wait? are you fucken serious? Since I had pumped the kids up about having pancakes bigger than your head we decided to wait. Once we made it in we decided to get the guevos rancherros, blueberry and old fashioned pancakes. everything was ridiculously good. My ten year old brother who claims to be a pancake expert said these were the best pancakes ever and we all agreed! Overall it was a good experience. They didn't lose a star despite of the long wait where I thought I was going to starve to death! The food was Delicious and our waiter was really nice and super cute. He spilled ice cubes on me but was very apologetic and said he only did it because I was smokin' hot lol. I left this place feeling like someone had to roll my fat ass out of here and wondering if I would fit thru the door way, but guess what...i'm going back next week :)

Welcome to G.Riddle's house of curiosities...pancakes that dwarf your face and scoops of whipped cream as big as your fists! Step right up to be seated by the man from Nantucket and be sure to get there early to avoid the long wait. You may be greeted by Kurt Cobain's (probably) gay doppelgnger, who is a strong, silent, hard-working type and won't tell you that it costs less to order one or two pancakes, rather than the standard three. Please do keep your hands and feet inside the vehicle (table) because seating is tight and chairs are small and do bring earplugs if you're sensitive to high volume because the noise level can reach 90+ decibels. My meal, Scotch on the Rocks, was butterscotch chips tucked into the coconutty beaches of buttermilk pancakes. I think the rocks were the oats and pecan pieces generously scattered throughout. I have to say, being a coconut fiend, a coco pancake usually leaves something to be desired, but this batter could easily be 30/70 coconut/batter ratio! With the mound of coconut studded whipped cream jauntily seated atop, these pancakes needed none of the real maple syrup provided. I carried my two pounds of leftovers back to the car and as I lie back in my seat, I moaned in ecstasy: "I can't breathe. My teeth feel funny..." and my leftovers happily squeaked along in their foam packaging in the backseat.

This place is amazing! The pancakes are out of this world. Seriously, they are like heaven in my mouth. I also ordered the turkey maple sausage and scrambled eggs with cheese and sourdough toast. All delicious. Really exceptional. If I was bulimic, I would have thrown up just so I could stuff more in my mouth. To address some of the reviews I read of people dissing this place: 1) I noticed some people dissing the chili. Who orders chili at a place called "the griddle cafe"?? That is like saying that the salads at IHOP are bad. Duh. You go to IHOP for the pancakes, just like you go to the Griddle Cafe for breakfast. 2) Yes, the pancakes are huge, but guess what! You can order just one! That's right! No need to waste food by ordering the whole order. They make every pancake as singles for those of you who worry that not cleaning your plate somehow affects starving children in Africa. I have only love for this amazing establishment and I feel priviledged to live in a city with such wonderful pancakes.

This is one of the very few times where advertising on Yelp worked wonders for an establishment. They bought the ads. People searching for restaurants or brunch around Hollywood area. Sponsored search put this place on the top with highlighted box. People bookmarked it. Voila! They became the #1 Bookmarked place in all of LA. Well, it also takes the word of mouth and positive buzz from other reviewers to get this place on that pedestal. This place became a fascination of mine when I was in town for a weekend stay at WeHo. I knew it was a breakfast/brunch place only because they closed at 4pm everyday. So definitely not a Êdinner joint and they close down way before the craziness of the night at Sunset Strip begins. I stumbled upon this place at the wee hours of the morning about 15 minutes before it opened. I forgot in that they opened at 8am on the weekend while it was opened at 7am in weekdays. So I had to wait out a bit until at 8am. While waiting, I grabbed the menu for a closer inspection of what was being offered at Griddle Cafe. The interesting lay out of the menu was that they offering the big selections of pancakes or a French toast in their own section. They treat the sausages as a side dish, but you could ordered some of the traditional omelets or their egg dishes on the menu. With many of the unique names and some creativity on their part, there were many different selections of pancakes/French Toast you can choose from. For instance, there were names of "Teacher's Pet", "The Golden Ticket", to "Devil's Daydream". Yes, the last one is in the menu. I decided to take a shot at Creme de la Cream http://www.yelp.com/biz_É (picture courtesy of Yelp) which was a wheat bread French toast with sugar powder and cheese cake cream. Sugar delight for all cheese cake lovers. The portions of huge and definitely can be shared. I got a good look at some of the omelets and pancakes, they were in gigantic portions like the French toast I have ordered. The pricings can be a little up there, but it's definitely better than your local IHop. My cheesecake French toast was delightful little fluff with cheesecake filling on top instead of butter provide an unique experience to a whole new French toast experience. I also added in a side of sausages which comes either in form of chicken, beef, or pork. (of course I chose the pork). There is one thing I would strongly suggest everyone to order if they ever decide to come here... order the French Pressed Coffee. ÊYou gotta love the little coffee pot they bring you while you can "pressed" the coffee yourself while it's hotly brewed in the pot. The breakfast was good, but the coffee made it even more than worth the while. The regular Pressed coffee is also refillable too. The ambiance here in the morning reflects the tailback nature of the location. While a loud blues music can be blaring loudly while you walk in, but luckily the loud chattering of the patrons will drown that out. It is in a way very sociable for this kind of place and very informal. It's very laid-back and not too pretentious with the staff reflecting that. Luckily they were quick and very attentive in the morning. Food also come in a very efficient time with plenty of check ups. The only drawbacks are the popularity of this place. I recommend people to come in very early as in the crack of dawn when it opened because it can filled up really quick with long lines of wait in the weekend. Let's just say that when I was leaving at 2pm on Sunday at WeHo, I can see the long ridiculous line forming for lunch. Try not to be the fool waiting for brunch on weekend at 10:30am. The place does serve breakfast throughout the day with lunch menu offer in the afternoon. Try their coffee and one of their many unique selections of French toast or pancakes. They also have syrup from Maine to top off your servings. Just be prepare to wait if you came in too late.

I had no idea the pancakes were so huge! When my plate came out, everyone was pointing and laughing because my pancakes were bigger than me! Motherfuckers hurt my feelings. Conveniently, I had a giant plate of comfort food in front of me. I gnawed away my Golden Ticket pancakes, which were the sweetest pancakes I've ever eaten. How they got that much sugar into the batter, I do not know. I really liked the brown sugar bananas, caramel, and streusel combo though. I ended up eating about a third of one pancake (a ninth of the whole plate) before nearly exploding. Good thing I was wearing stretchy clothes! Paul had the Strawberries and Cream waffle, which wasn't that sweet, and actually kinda disgusting. That's because sour cream is gross. There are a bunch of other things I wanted to try, so I plan on waking up again at 7am on a Sunday, eating some more overly sweet pancakes, then dying shortly thereafter. What a way to go.

Baby, oh baby. The Griddle is IT! The mecca of breakfast, the Disneyland of brunch, the Ibiza of foodgasms. The Griddle is a MONSTER. But you, you're a beast ready for a challenge. Challenge 1: ARRIVE at an opportune time, either before 10 or after 11:30. If hunger knocks you over the head like you're a white boy in K-town and you have to come in during prime time, Êj u s t c h i l l. The wait isn't too bad and usually there is a T-Pain-look alike belting out raps outside of the cafe. Tip him. He's hilarious and surprisingly talented. Challenge 2: FOCUS. The menu is long, lean, and deeeeeelicious, and will have you foaming at the mouth as you envision each and every option brunch had offered in the history of American face-stuffing. About 18 pancake options (thick and stacked just like your woman), 9 french toast & waffle choices, 20 egg masterpieces, oatmeal, tacos, burgers, salads, sandwiches, lord oh lord my head is spinning... I've loved everything that has crossed my lips: 1. Nutella Stuffed French Toast: Creamy, choco-hazelnutty Nutella smothered in thick, juicy slices of french toast....If you love Nutella, you will make a home in this. 2. Banana-Nana: Sugar-baked banana in buttermilk cooked in battered pancake batter. Simple and tasty. This would be Jack Johnson's favorite I'm sure :p 3. The Golden Ticket: This is the Banana-Nana on crack: All of above plus caramel, walnuts, struesel, and whipped cream. YES! 4. Eyes Wide Open: Buttermilk battered pancakes with espresso and chocolate chips. Lots of chocolate chips. Chocolate and coffee, my heart and my soul. 5. Caballero: Scrambled eggs with green chiles, potatoes, cheddar cheese, and chicken chorizo wrapped up in a tortilla topped with sour cream, avocado, and salsa. Comes with delicious hot chips. This is a BIG BOY! Challenge 3: PORTIONS. You will honest to G-d be eating everything for at least 2-3 days, I don't care how FAT you think you are. Challenge 4: Battling food coma afterwards. Do this by ordering the French press coffee: it's rich, delicious, ÊAND you get complimentary refills. Griddle = sugar rush + caffeine rush + savory satiation. Everything I could ever want from my meal, all in one experience. Marry me, Griddle Cafe! I'll even sign a pre-nup!

I'm usually not a super big breakfast/brunch person, and I especially don't like breakfast enough to stand in line for an hour for it. Ê Despite this, I hesitantly ventured here with my two BFF's on a Saturday morning at 9:45am, and was pleasantly surprised that the wait was relatively short (about 15-20 minutes). Ê Even though my two bff's are teeny tiny, we ordered enough food to feed a small country: French Toast (DELICIOUS, we finished it all) Blueberry Pancakes (HUMONGOUS, between the three of us we finished less than half) Chicago Charlie's Scramble with sausage, potatoes, bacon, bell peppers, cheese, garlic, etc (Very good) Even though the place got packed, and it took us FOREVER to eat our food (in between all of our gabbing), the servers were really nice and never made us feel rushed. Ê I would eat here all of the time, except it would most certainly turn me into a giant fat blob, so I will just have to save it for special occasions!

Yelp's own Richard T. would call me FAT ASS to my face because I have finished all three of those huge-ass pancakes in one sitting. OK it was only once but I was really hungry! I hate the wait so I only go during the week after the rush. Too bad all you 9 to 5'ers!

So, I've been really busy as of late and so has my love, and it just so happened that we were free on the same day - and decided to make a day of it. So, my love kidnapped me at whisked me over to The Griddle Cafe for breakfast. We were both starvin' marvin's - and holy mole, there was a lot of people there - on a friday. I guess no one works in Los Angeles. In any case, we put in our names - and we're told that wait would be around 40 mins. We've both never been and determined to have some breakfast-y goodness in some form or another. When we finally get called (I'm not sure if it was 40 mins or later - I wasn't paying much attention) we were seated. We already made our decision while waiting outside. Black Magic Pancakes and a side of bacon. I was taken back by the interior of this spot. It really beckoned the old days of diners. Depite it being loud and busy, I dug the overall comfortable vibe. We get the pancakes a little bit later, and holy crap - they're HUGE! And it's a short stack of pancakes, not just one gigantor pancake. Who in the world can polish off all that food in one sitting?!? My love and I gave it our best effort, and we respectively and collectively ate about 1/4 of the whole pancake. We boxed it up, and apparently it reheats quite well. (I wouldn't know, I didn't have it the second day around) The pancake itself was just simply divine. It doesn't reinvent the pancake wheel, but it does it really well. It wasn't overly sweet - it was decadent. The bacon was thick cut, but a little undercooked by just a minute or two. They were busy busy busy, so I can understand that they wanted to get the product out. The pancakes had just the right amount of oreo cookie goodness with the whipped cream. All in all, despite the long wait, The griddle cafe is a go go GO! Def. Worth the wait - which is pretty much any time you go. The weekends we were told is just a madhouse - so if you do have the opportunity to go, try to go on a weekday.

Hallelujah for those sweet, sweet words, "Breakfast Served All Day". Especially so when it's Griddle Cafe's brekkie we're talkin' about!! I literally can not think of any other breakfast serving establishment - and I mean anywhere in the country - that has a breakfast menu so robust, so craveworthy, so pancakelicious that it would warrant me yearning to eat their dishes morning, noon AND night. Get in line (yes, there is guaranteed to be one), put your name in, and then prepare for breakfast blast off. You'll quickly notice the plethora of pancake options... do not ignore them, these are the pinnacle of pancakery and the fundamental building block of Griddle's existence. Even as a lukewarm pancake enthusiast (I'm more of an eggs gal, m'self), I've been converted and positively adore these specialty gargantuan cakes. Oh yeah, no short stacks here... every order of pancakes is piled 3 high and hella wide. Like half the table wide. Ideal for sharing? Perhaps. But as mentioned earlier, you'll be craving these puppies all day long... take home your leftovers and indulge in the most indulgent reheats for lunch, dinner and midnight snack!! My personal favorite is the "Banana Nana" with brown sugar baked bananas cooked right into the light, fluffy batter. Oh Mama!! With Pumpkin Pie Pancakes, everyday can be a Holiday at the Griddle... or satiate your ultimate sweet tooth with the likes of Nutella stuffed cakes, Oreo topped cakes or even the Chocolate and Coconut filled 'Mounds of Pleasure' cakes. How d'ya like those sugar lumps? Fabulously sinful and good any time of the day, the Griddle Cafe gets my super seal of approval. Oh, and whaddya know, even a spot that specializes in pancakes serves up the best breakfast tacos, too. Try the 'kicking and screaming' variety... filled with eggs, jack cheese, chipotle cream sauce and topped with avocado and refried beans, it's the ideal savory accompaniment to your pancake pandemonium.

The Griddle is one of the few really hyped up businesses that I would actually say deserves the hype. This is hands down one of the best breakfast spots in LA. I have been here at least 20 times and I can honestly say that a meal from here is always a treat. Here are a few of my favorites : Mom's French Toast - I really want to know who's Mom makes french toast like this . These are by far the biggest, fluffiest pieces of french toast I have ever had. Not overly battered or cooked which I usually find when I order french toast. This is hands down the best french toast I have ever tried (sorry Mom...). The bread and batter are both amazing and then they top it all of with powdered sugar and delicious whipped butter. YUM! Chicago Charlies Scramble - I love this dish so much! It's simple but done so well. ÊThis delicious breakfast feast consists of Italian sausage, bacon, bell peppers, potatoes, Êonions, garlic, basil and mozzarella cheese! If that's not enough it also comes with a side of garlic bread but the marriage of flavors in the scramble is so good I usually just opt for a side of sourdough toast. The Golden Ticket - A delicious banana pancake filled with warm caramel, walnuts and streusel and then topped with the exact same ingredients in addition to whipped cream! Talk about decadence. This is the end all of all pancakes. I can never eat more than one. Ham and Eggs - Talk about a huge piece of Ham. When I say huge I mean that this mammoth piece of pig swallowed the plate whole and ran over all sides by about three inches. The first time I saw this dish ordered it came to the table next to me and the stranger that ordered it was so in awe of it's size he asked my company and I if we wanted some ! I ended up ordering it the next time I came to eat here an it was delicious!!! French press Coffee - The coffee here is SO good and fresh. I love that they bring it out to you in a french press and they definitely keep it coming. Service at the griddle is always good. I come here with some of my bike friends and they always let us pull our bikes up to an outside table and create a mini bicycle parking lot on the sidewalk. Orders are taken quickly and the staff is really friendly. Also considering how PACKED this place always is I have never once felt like I was being rushed out of my table. The Griddle is a must try!!!

Have you ever wanted to know what it was like to eat leftover pancakes for 3 days straight? Yeah, that's what you get when you order one from the Griddle Cafe. The pancakes are so ginormous that you have to take it home and finish it off over the course of the week. SO DELICIOUS. The wait totally blows though. So does using the word "ginormous" make me a douche? That's so sad. It used to be such a cool word. Like 3 years ago.

I waited half an hour to get in - no way I was eating outside while everyone stared at my food, and chose the Eyes Wide Open without expresso and orange juice. In less than 10 minutes I had it in my table. That thing is huge; three pancakes staked, filled with chocolate chips and butter melting on top of it. I put some syrup on it and it tasted even better. I thought I could handle it, but as you can see in my pics, I couldn't. I didn't even eat half of it! I took it home to eat later. Not sure if they got parking, but I parked at the street. Pay attention while you are waiting to be called to get in, they won't be looking for you.

Bring your appetite and remember to share!! The 3 of us did just that and still could not finish our food. French Press Coffee (http://www.yelp.com/biz_É): with complimentary refills. Choice of mild, medium or dark roast. Mmmm...dark. Too bad it was 3pm already, otherwise I would've had more than one pot. Caballero (http://www.yelp.com/biz_É): one of the popular breakfast items. A burrito filled with eggs, cheese, potatoes, green chiles, and chicken chorizo. Then topped with sour cream, salsa and avocado. And served with tortilla chips. Very hearty, although it lacked a bit of kick. Tapatio to the rescue! =D Poached y Papas Benedict (http://www.yelp.com/biz_É): another raved item. Looks are deceiving. Honestly, it didn't look like much. Huge potato skins topped with thick slice of baked ham topped with 2 poached eggs topped with hollandaise sauce. But omg, it was sooo good! The potato skins are perfectly baked so it holds up to the incredible thick and creamy hollandaise sauce. Potato, ham, egg, sauce. The perfect bite! *droools* A Time to Love (http://www.yelp.com/biz_É): more like time to unbutton my pants. 3, 12 inch diameter pancakes filled with streusel, butterscotch chips and caramel, topped with powdered sugar, whipped cream and more caramel. Soo fluffy and surprisingly not overwhelmingly sweet. Felt bad for wasting it, but it was just too much food. Here's how far we got. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_É) I like it here. Very laidback. Down-to-earth staff too! =)

Tried the blueberry pancakes, chocolate french toast and regular french toast. Blueberry pancakes were huge, fluffy, and thick but I thought it tasted rather like a blueberry muffin drowned in syrup. ÊThe regular french toast is decent. ÊPortions are huge, though the taste isn't all that stand out. ÊChocolate french toast is good though, warm, and lots of cocoa flavor. ÊThe main room is quite crowded, noisy and busy. The manager said that Jessica Alba, and two other fairly big celebs - I forgot the names, came in the same day we were there. Paris Hilton had also called to inquire about the wait. ÊThere are also two private rooms in the back with a sofa, and table. Shared parking lot with Rite Aid, that was pretty full. ÊBack door is adjacent to the lot, front entrance is on Sunset. A bit hectic here, three and a half stars, rounded up for the scene and the portions.

This is the most over-hyped place I've been in LA. If the water is the best thing you've tasted at a place, something's wrong. If you think I'm one of those foolish super biased reviewers who don't think and just write, please know you are mistaken. I enjoy food and write honestly and this is honestly the worst food I've ever paid this much for. Just because something is huge doesn't mean it's better. On the table: Buttermilk pancake, omlette, potatos, tacos (sent back), grilled cheese sandwhich and fries. Everything lacked flavor and effort. The stars are mainly for our waiter, Joe, who was a pretty good guy. Otherwise, the place is too small and cramped and the food was subpar to boot. We won't be back.

Came to Griddle Cafe on a Friday morning before heading up to yosemite. I was surprised at how crowded it was on a Friday morning, don't people work around here? But the crowd wasn't too bad, the place was full but we didn't have to wait for a table! Yippee!! Griddle Cafe is cute...it's jammed packed with tables close to together your almost touching your neighbors or listening to their conversations which tend to do (bad habit, being nosy). But the place gets pretty loud inside and there are two large TVs on top. There are also some private rooms in the back. Very cool. I ordered the Fiesta Scamble!! Ole!!! I was sold with Fiesta! The other scramble we ordered was the Chicago Charlie's Scramble. I definitely loved the Fiesta...truly a fiesta en mi boca !!! And the portion is fairly large, I definitely couldn't finish it all. The Chicago Scramble tasted like a chicago dog or something....I think I liked the Fiesta more! I would definitely come back here!! For the fiesta and perhaps try some pancakes because they looked delish. Also the coffee here was pretty damn good. I always love a place with good coffee. http://static.px.yelp.coÉ

It's good. The food was good. We were met by a very enthusiastic host which I love. The menu was good. Maybe if the waitress wasn't so short with us and the people next to us were a bit more pleasant (which is not the restaurant's fault) I would have had a flawless visit. I'll never know. I really don't like feeling like I'm bothering you by ordering or I should have known what I wanted to order. The waitress did warm up towards the end but it was too late.

ÊI almost always make the mistake of ordering pancakes with a side of eggs and bacon only to have at least one of those items completely neglected because I'm too busy trying to finish the ginormous pancakes.

I was debating whether to give this place a 3 or 4 because but settled on 3-stars just because this place just isn't good enough for me to make the drive, wait the 30+min, or loo for parking in the area. Yes, Griddle fares above your average diner b-fast, but I just wasn't sold on this being one of the best breakfasts ever. It was good, but I can find other places that don't require me to stand in long waits. However, the eggs benedict is something I'd recommended just because of the real slices of ham and the unexpected twist with the potato skins. If you're not a fan of the heavy and sweet, I would stay away from the nutella french toast. But if youre into the having dessert breakfast, go right head and order a plate and share with friends.

Came here with 3 guy friends and ordered a Eyes Wide Shut (I believe that's the name) Pancake, that has a chocolate chip and a shot of espresso. The 3 other people ordered Oreo French Toast, another Pancake from the list, and a regular order of Omelette dish. Those who ordered Pancakes and French Toasts, were definitely TOAST!!! It's way too sweet... I mean geeze, after a few bites I can't even take it anymore, it's way way way too sweet... I didn't try the French Toast, but I heard the complain on it... Only the Omelette person finished his dish. As for us, yeah we took it to go, but once it's in the box, we couldn't imagine putting those into our stomach. I'd keep thinking if I put that one more bite into my mouth, I'd soon die of diabetes. Lesson learned? If you're not a fan of sweet or sugary stuff, don't order them!!! The waiting was crazy too, 45minutes on SAturday morning at 11.30am... compared to what Shauna D, we're still better, but food-wise, nah uh. My cousin told me though the french toast is actually good, so I would still come back to give it a try. Parking here is always sucks, can't help it, but I heard there's parking in the back, which I didn't see, so next time I come back, I'd check it out. Price wise, I think it's decent, but because of those crazy sweet food, we had to get out of there and get something salty to balance it, so off we went to the dim sum place in downtown, that still served them until 2.30pm.

The Griddle Cafe has an extensive breakfast and lunch menu, although if you're going on the weekend I recommend you snack before and bring some provision because you'll be there for the long-haul. ÊWhether you're into sweet or savory, Griddle Cafe has something for you! Ê THE FOOD: I can attest to three different items on the menu: - Deli and Eggs: This is one of my all-time favorite foods: bagel, cream cheese and lox (smoked salmon) and it was splendid! - Addicted to "Noisella" Stuffed French Toast: If you love Nutella (as all those with a heartbeat should) then this is the thing for you. ÊSuper sweet and oozing with Nutella (that chocolatey-hazelnut ambrosia), this breakfast dessert is ideal for anyone with a sweet tooth. - "Red Velvet" panCAKE: the title pretty much says it all, but the cream cheese frosting dripped all over this pancake of perfection is unparalleled. THE ATMOSPHERE: Once my group of 7 was finally seated, about an hour after putting our name on the list, we got to check out the fun interior of this establishment. ÊThe front room is loud, crowded and generally overwhelming, but the decor is fun and appropriate. ÊMy group was seated in one of the few back rooms (supposedly for the occasional VIPs, according to the waiter) which was really quiet and perfect for us. All in all it was absolutely delicious and the service was excellent! ÊIf you're willing to wait for a table then it's definitely worth it!

I'm sorry my fellow yelpers but my first experience at the Griddle was not good. ÊAside from a vast menu of choices and very large quantities, this place left me very disappointed. I've been wanting to come here for a while now and finally had a chance to visit. I was ready to sample the famous pancake and egg dishes. My Boysenberry pancake was large and packed full of boysenberries but somehow lack flavor! I tried lathering it with butter and syrup but to no avail, I was not impressed. Ok, I chose the Cobb omelette which was ok, the chicken was good and the bacon was decent. This was not a mind blowing omelette. ÊAfter all the hype, I suppose I expected something more, especially since I waited nearly an hour for this omelette. The Griddle potatoes were standard issue and needed to be doctored-up for my taste. Why oh why did I order a tuna fish sandwich to go????? I decided to take a sample bite on the way home and oh boy, big mistake. It smelled like fish ass mixed with toe jam and tasted just as bad (yes, I took one bite) ÊI was so pissed I just wrote it off. Ê Mediocre Food At Best and pricey. While I don't fault people for liking this food, I can't see why...it's bland and uninspired. So, in summation, if you're interested in being served large portions of below average food and being assaulted by ridiculously loud music and slow service first thing in the morning, not to mention lousy parking, you should go here and wait in line for two hours.

After waking up at the crack of dawn to head to LA, my buddies and I were starving the moment we landed and picked up our rental. ÊTo satisfy our hunger, we made our first stop at Griddle Cafe in Hollywood. Upon arriving, we put our name down and was told it was a 30 minute wait (30 minutes for a hungry Herman feels like 30 hours). ÊThe restaurant is a decent size, but due to a huge following, wait time can be an 1 hour or greater. ÊOf the many different dishes, Griddle Cafe is most known for its pancakes. ÊFrom banana to apple, from chocolate chip to Oreo, there is something for everyone here. ÊThey have other breakfast entrees as well. ÊMost of them are a variation of what you find at a normal restaurant, but with interesting twists. ÊFor example, I ordered the "Poached y Papas Benedict" which was an eggs benny on a potato skin. ÊOne of my buddies ordered the Cobb Omelette which was basically a cobb salad stuffed inside an omelette. ÊOverall, I would say the food was good with the service solid. Ê Disclaimer: ÊI really can't strongly comment on how good the food was because A) I ate so fast that my brain couldn't register how good it tasted and B) I was so hungry that anything I ate would have been the best thing in the world. Tips: Ê * Resist your hunger and don't listen to your stomach on grabbing something to hold you over from Coffee Bean across the street. ÊThe portions at Griddle are large and in-charge, so the wait is definitely worth it. * Celebrities come here too, so don't be surprised if you're rubbing elbows with Bradgelina. * Get a short stack of pancakes to share. ÊTrust me, its worth it. * Check out the my pics of the food: Êhttp://www.yelp.com/userÉ

If you are anything like me, you don't sleep until after 3am and usually don't wake up until the afternoon. ÊSo an ideal time to have breakfast is around 2pm. ÊAnd this also happens to be the best time to come to the Griddle Caf on a Monday afternoon. ÊNo line and was one of those "sit wherever you like" situations. ÊAnd breakfast is served all day. Ê It was my best friend's 26th birthday and I decided to take her out for breakfast. ÊAll roads led to the Griddle Caf. ÊJazz & Blues soundtrack, brick walls, optional counter-style seating, and a flat screen TV playing old school Hanna-Barbera cartoons to remind you how old you really are. Ê As recommended by our server, we ordered Mom's French Toast with a side order of bacon. ÊSlap me, choke me, and pull my hair delicious. ÊThis dish exceeded all expectations and should not be passed up. ÊThe saltiness of the bacon is the yin to the French toast's yang. ÊWhen it comes to eating its always about balance. ÊThe bacon here is phenomenal and if I didn't know any better I would guess that it was Black Forest bacon... Ê But I could be wrong, as I so often am... We also ordered the Chicago Charlie's Scramble. Please excuse me for my ignorance, but I don't know who this Chicago Charlie is or whom this dish is referencing, but if he is anything like this scramble, he must have suffered from a multiple personality disorder. ÊI say this because there was too much going on in this dish and each bite tasted different. ÊIt was not bad at all, and in fact was pretty good, but just too many ingredients. ÊNext time I will opt for something that is simple. Coffee & tea for breakfast is a must and comes in personal sized presses. ÊThis is great, if you drink copious amounts of coffee and hate waiting for refills. ÊYou are not alone. ÊThe dish portions are large enough to accommodate Paul Bunyan and Babe the blue ox. ÊSo prepare to waddle out of the restaurant with a take-out box of leftover food, craving the post-meal cigarette. Ê One of the best mid-afternoon breakfast experiences in a long while and definitely one of the better breakfast places in the city. ÊThank you YELP. Recommended

Was really looking forward to a great breakfast here. Showed up right after 9, I literally ran from the parking lot in the back (Rite-Aid) through the back door since others were just coming in too. Luckily, no wait - spot for 2 at the "bar". Food roundup: Cobb Omelet: Filled with bacon, green onions, blue cheese, and diced chicken. Filling had good flavor and their chunks of bacon were hearty, but the chicken was pretty dry. Also unfortunately, the outer layer of omelet was about an inch thick, way overcooked, and rubbery. The eggs were like a shell over the filling, didn't become one at all. Griddle potatoes had a nice crust, but were pretty mushy and had no flavor. Overall was disappointed with this dish. Eyes wide open pancakes: Light, fluffy, and perfectly crisped pancake with espresso and semi-sweet chocolate chips. This was really good and sweet for the choco-holic bf. Only complaint is that you get 3 HUGE thick and wide pancakes. If you're the only person eating it, just order 1, cause even that will be more than enough. I wish we had only ordered 1 along with my dish, that would've been perfect. I did give the leftovers to a bum, I felt so bad throwing so much food away :P Lowdown: Down home and welcoming decor that reminds you of your local breakfast watering hole with some modern touches. Be ready to wait during peak times. Food can be a bit slow to come out, and service was alright (they forgot to give me my toast). Stick with what their known for, pancakes, and stay away from the omelets. Beware of portions on the full order of pancakes, may be good for a group, but after awhile it'll make you sick if you have it all to yourself.

The apple cobbler french toast is worth the 45-minute wait for weekend brunch. Ginormous portions and every kind of ridiculous pancake you could dream of (even Oreo cookie ones!). UPDATE: I didn't think anything could get better than the apple cobbler french toast until I had the Peanut Bubba French Toast. It's like magic!

Simply scrumptious! The 45 minute wait wasn't at all bad considering it was Sunday, and all those not hiking the sunny hills of West Hollywood, nor having a walk of shame in their repertoire are nursing the hangover -- Êbrunching. The delicious french toast smothered with apples, and nuts wasn't the only thing that melts in your mouth like buttered candy. The wait staff of ethereal male models left one with plenty to drool about. The place may appear to be hecticness, but the service was faster than a locomotive. I'm not shitting you, our food got there within ten minutes of our waiter placing our order. The eggs Benedict were served on top of potato skins smothered with hollandaise sauce...so good. Definitely check this place out. So worth it!

I felt like I was back on the east coast. The pancakes are mammoth, gargantuan, jigundo. The whole reason I came. But the morning I went, I didn't want an overly sweet pancake. So I ask the server which pancakes are less sweet. He names a few, but recommends recess time..says it is one of his favorites. Do NOT order Recess Time. It should be called Brown Sugar Time. because that's ALL I tasted. Three huge flapjacks comes out. 2 people tried hard to finish just one. I can't tell if that was because the pancake is so big or because how much brown sugar can you eat in a sitting. blech. rawk. euk. Moving on...the cobb omelette was wayyyy too rich & heavy for me but yummy. This is a omelette made for a man, a lumberjack man. Big chunks of chicken, swole pieces of bacon cut up, cheese etc etc. The food here is heavy and hearty. I feel like this place should be frequented in the colder months. (You don't feel so cute eating this on a summer morning.) Something different about GC is that Êwhen I ordered coffee - they asked me how I wanted it - mild, medium, or full. First off, I have never been asked at a restaurant of this caliber for coffee strength options. I dig it. I ordered mild coffee, and I GOT mild coffee. *rimshot* I don't like the layout of the restaurant. It's too cramped; however, the energy of this place transported me back to a familiar and comforting east coast city feel. It truly epitomizes the hustle and bustle of a NYC/Boston/?(maybe even SF) restaurant in the heart of the city on a fall or winter morning. (Fall/winter because it's so dark inside.) The service is semi-efficient. Water is already on your table when you sit down. I like that. Also, I noticed a huge clear jar filled with miniature size chocolates near the communal table. Not sure what this was for, but I saw a server open the jar and eat one. Maybe they put some of these chocolates in their pancakes? JD's sidekick on Scrubs was there too. =D Also, the host is the Griddle Cafe Nazi. He is colorful, friendly, and extremely efficient and awesome at what he does. He means bidness. You put in your name and he calls you when your table is ready. If your group isn't there when he calls, then no griddle for you!

I visited Griddle Cafe on my long-weekend vacation in LA, and a friend sent us over here for some great breakfast food (and to possibly see some famous people in the area - which unfortunately never happened during my entire trip!). A little bit of outdoor seating, and crowded indoor seating to fit in all the people who apparently don't have to be at work on Fridays at 1030am. Ê(Seriously...I felt like it was the weekend already with how busy it was!) The servers are good-looking :)...not overly attentive since they're so busy, but they're nice enough. The food portions are huge! Êi.e. 3 huuuge pancakes on a large sized plate or overloaded skillets. ÊUsually at brunch places we never have to get a doggy bag...but we would've here if our hotel had a big enough fridge to store everything! Overall - LOVED IT - great place to go, big portions of great food...would go again if I was in the area!

Are you hungry? ÊHow hungry? ÊREALLY hungry? ÊGnaw-off-your-arm hungry? ÊWait a couple days, then go to the Griddle, and maybe you'll manage to finish a plate of pancakes. I took my family here, and they were super impressed by the menu (pancakes, French toast, eggs, chili, bricks of hash browns...) and the portion sizes. ÊIt's sort of fun watching people's faces as their food is set in front of them. ÊIt took me a few seconds to figure out my plan of attack for my apple-filled pancakes; I may avoided having syrup in my lap, but the pancakes won the war: I could only finish a quarter of my food, and I weighed my leftovers at home...almost 2.5 pounds. ÊHoly shit! ÊOne of the dudes at the next table was exclaiming over the size of his steak fries, to the point of offering some to us (we politely declined). Ê"If I was in prison, I could shank someone with this!" said he, brandishing a fry. Yes, the wait is long, yes, it's crowded, yes, it's full of LA-types and wannabe actors. ÊI don't really care. ÊIt's delicious (I think my dad was the winner for ordering the Peanut Bubba French toast), you get your money's worth, I've always had really nice servers who weren't rushing me even when the wait was 45 minutes and one even took the time to make me a special drink when I'd lost my voice (and they're as yummy as the food, mee-yow)(hi Mom), and it's just a fun place to go.

Who goes to Sunset in the daytime? Yea, me neither. ÊSo driving there is so weird in the daytime, like you know how you get to a place at night because you always look for that one neon sign at the corner or that one really bad lit gas station, yea, it's kinda like that. I have no idea where I'm at. The Griddle is right down the street from the Laugh Factory. The parking is bad. ÊIt shares a backlot with Rite-Aid, but there was no luck. Cars were posted, not in a spot, but waiting...kind of like when you use to go to college and people would just park and wait instead of parking furthur and and you may have had a longer walk, but made it to class, before that person who waited ever did. Yea, that's exactly what it was. ÊSo I parked a block away. ÊNo big deal. I walked throught the back entrance to the smell of a lovely dumpster. ÊWho cares though, I mean it's the back entrance. ÊI walk through this long hallway..."Did i just die? Should I follow the scent of delcious syrup? I'm scared. ÊIt's really weird when you come in from the back, especially if it's your first time there. Don't worry, everything will be okay. ÊThat wait seems long only for those with a large group. "Two people? What's your name?" That's how you get a seat fast. I ordered the "Yellow Brick Road" a massive sugar-high in pancake form. ÊIt's two stacks with walnuts, butterscotch and caramel topped with whipped cream. All the good stuff is in the pancakes, not as though they just dumped everything on top. Oh, I won't forget to mention how ridiculously big it was! ÊIt filled the entire plate to the edge. ÊIt was like the size of a small pizza! I also had French Pressed coffee. ÊCoffee made in the best way possible. If you go, I would suggest sharing, depending on what you are getting. Ê ÊUnless you're obese, then go for it.

If you are homeless and haven't eaten for months and are craving breakfast, this is where you need to be. Here you will find one of the biggest pancakes ever served in LA. One of the coolest places to dine and tell all your friends about. They have a large variety of pancakes to choose from and non-pancakes items are also great. After drinking pretty heavily the night before, we heard that this place is the place to be. I thought having a huge breakfast would probably stop me from eating anymore on my trip to LA. I order two items, an omelet ( don't ask what it was, it was good) and a blueberry pancake. It's not something you would find at Denny's or IHOPS, it's much better. You can't take anyone word for it, but yourself. Parking is awesome, for 25 cents, you get an hour parking. And if you want to be discovered, the Directors Guide is right next door. And if you like coffee, they offer the French Press. Now, that's hot!

My Yelp review just disappeared into Yelp cyberspace. So this update will be quick and sweet. This is the place for pancake lovers. Seriously. Each order comes with 3 dinner size pancakes. It's unhealthy. Virtually no fiber. Full of sugar. Sinfully delicious. I had the strudel pancake -- pancake meets coffee cake is the best description. Each pancake layer had crunchy strudel. C ordered the raspberry and lemon pancake -- best described as pancake meets pie. F ordered the crazy coconut pancake. I took home F's leftovers. Delicious cold b/c it's full of pecans, coconut, and butterscotch chips. Her pancake was more like a cake. B ordered the nutella French toast -- holy mother of chocolate. I think I ate my share of carbs for the entire weak. You should share, b/c trust me -- there ain't no way in hell you're finishing your pancakes. We barely made a dent in our respective dishes.

Just back from Peru, my friend calls and says, "Let's go to Gorilla Cafe!" Wracking my brain, I feel ashamed. Gorilla Cafe, Gorilla Cafe? I'm no fan of WeHo, admittedly, except for the shopping on Melrose, and drooling over the architecture in Hancock Park, which I suppose just doesn't count. So how am I supposed to know all the cute little cafes? And then I placed it: GRIDDLE CAFE! I'd had it bookmarked for a year. So I drove over to said friend's house (which straddles West Hollywood and Hollywood proper, so it's cool), and we walked the four blocks to Griddle to avoid the horrendous parking situation (one star gone - and I started today's review with an arbitrary but optimistic four), arriving at about noon. Walking in, everyone was surprisingly friendly (add one star - we're back to four). We sit at the counter, which was nice - there were options as to where to sit, too - FIVE STARS! We talked, eventually got some attention from a rather rad counter waiter guy. The menu was extensive and ... expensive (one star off - overpricedness - four stars). I ordered a raspberry champagne drink (mimosa with fruit - delicious - one star - FIVE!). After a while, we decided on savory food, as opposed to those gigantor pancakes which just seem extraneous and arrogant in my politically correct mind. We ordered breakfast tacos, to be precise. I chose the Sunset Hipster (one star off for having to say that ridiculous name - Êdown to four), which is shrimp or chicken, cheddar, bbq sauce, red onions, with refried beans or tortilla chips made in house. She got some with eggs. This arrived and it was flavorful, large, and ... sloppy. I think the cooks should grill or at least heat the tortillas (flour Mission brand-type floppy tortillas), instead of just folding them over. Three stars. Service is good, though we didn't get a chance to specify beans over tortilla chips (we got chips). The French press iced coffee made my heart sing, until I saw the bill. $50 lunch, oops (for two). Mimosas, though, don't forget. And I took home half my food. And a ramiken. Shhhh. I tip fat. Ramikens are like 25 cents. That sour cream in the Ramiken? $1.50. Hey.

This place was on my ta-do list. ÊFinally rounded up my girls, and headed to the Hollywood hills for some gluttony. ÊI was flipping through the pages trying to decide if my palette called for savory of sweet. ÊWhen the waitress asked what I want and I told her I couldn't decide between the Baked Potato omelet and Teacher's Pet pancake, she told me I could have both for only a few dollars more. Ê*insert big smile* ÊI was thoroughly satisfied with both. ÊHowever, the pancake didn't have enough baked cinnamon apples in it for my liking. ÊThat could have been remedied by asking for a side of baked apples....wasn't gonna go there considering I was being gluttonous in the first place. Ê Both of my friends were satisfied with their dishes as well. ÊThe only reason I had to deduct a star is because the host told us it was a 45 minute wait. ÊWe positioned ourselves out of the cold wind tunnel, and ended up missing our name being called 15 minutes later. ÊThis caused us to wait an additional 15 minutes.....oh well. ÊOverall I would recommend this place for a friends' day out where you don't plan to eat anything else for the rest of the day and spend lots of time catching up.

Yeah, the pancakes are pretty insane. I've had a couple of meals here. One lunch, with a gigantic and intensely dense salad. And one breakfast, with an egg-white scramble called "Gone Shrimpin'." If you are down with shrimp in your eggs, I recommend the dish. It has pesto in it and is pretty spectacular! Criticisms: packed on the weekends (but for a good reason), too loud, and I swear to GOD I don't understand why LA doesn't give you a big pot of creamer with your tureen of coffee. Special: apparently, you can rent this place out as an afterhours club/restaurant in the evenings. Also, there are Famous Person rooms in the back, on the way to the bathroom. That's where the royalty seems to sit. Peasants in the front, money in the back.

so everyone knows that breakfast is the most important meal of the day.. gotta get energy so you can carry out the day right? BUT griddle cafe.. is a sugar/fat OVERLOAD!!.. but it's SO DELICIOUS!! mom's french toast IS THE BEST FRENCH TOAST I HAVE EVER TASTED!! it's so delicious AND ITS TWO INCHES THICK .. w/ two MONSTER SLICES.. its 10 bucks but i could only finish one!! perfect sweetness and saltiness decorated w/ powdered sugar!! mMMmm french press coffee was a great pick me up and pairing to the sweetness of the french toast! and it's free refills! However.. my friend did not have as great of an experience. instead of energy HE HAD .. as another review had said ... A NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCE.. he ordered the eggs benedict, and boy did that egg w/ potato and ham smooothered in sauce look deadly.. before he finished the last bites his LEFT ARM got somewhat NUMB.. and his RIGHT BRAIN started to hurt!! he seriously thought he was going to have a heart attack from the unhealthiness of the meal!! and he couldn't wash it down w/ his COCO-CHOCO latte topped w/ whipped cream either! (it was way too sweet by the way) i was so scared for him! but he made it out okay.. i guess we can't come back because.. we are going to try to be more healthy from now on.. HOW'S THAT FOR A MORNING PICK ME UP? note: THERE IS ÊPARKING BEHIND RITE AID just for the restaurant and a back entrance! the info on yelp is wrong!! enter the lot using FAIRFAX

Hands down, the best french toast I've ever ever had. ÊAnd I don't even like french toast (until now). ÊPancakes the size of flattened basketballs, the Griddle dedicates an entire page of its menu to the most insane variations ever. Ê For example: Ê "The Golden Ticket"~ For the dreamers of dreams,our golden "Banana Nana" originals filled with caramel, walnuts, and streusel. Topped with whipped cream, caramel and streusel. Heart attack just waiting to happen. ÊBut sounds like something worth having.....just a bite......once..... If you haven't already guessed, the portions are ridiculously huge so bear that in mind when ordering in a group.....

Go early or be prepared to wait a long to get seated. * People grease bouncer's at clubs... but its now being done at the Griddle Cafe.. the host is making a killing there! While waiting for a table a guy slips the host a $20 to get seated asap. I thought that was hilarious! Loved their red velvet pancakes! We also had the oreo pancakes but that was an overload.

You ever wonder why people always preface a naughty or off color comment with, "Pardon my French but..."? Let's face it. We talk a lot of trash about the French. The French bear the brunt of a lot of smack talking and nationalistic American chest thumping, and some of the claims are pretty absurd. My dad, for one, insists that he dislikes the French because they let their tiny dogs poop indiscriminately in Paris, and that there is dog crap paving the sidewalks. Whether this accusation rings true or false, I cannot say for sure. After all, I do see a lot of suspicious looking masses on the sidewalks of Los Angeles. Are we going to blame that on the French as well? What I do know with absolute American certainty is that I am willing to forgive a Paris paved with canine defecation because I respect that there is no finer breakfast than a plate of warm, syrupy French toast. Perhaps they did not invent it, but it still bears their pedigree. If you share my enthusiasm, then look no further than the Griddle Cafe. Their French toast is the best I've ever had. I will wait in line for 45 minutes to enjoy the heft of it on my fork and the melty goodness of it in my mouth. While they offer a variety of flavors and accoutrements, you cannot go wrong with the traditional "Mom's French toast." Although I don't drink coffee, my friends always rave about the Griddle's French press coffee as well. So dad, doo doo notwithstanding, I say oui oui! P.S. This is America, people, clean up after your dogs!

I saw the Griddle Cafe featured in Rachel Ray's "$40 dollars a day" and just had to have it. ÊGet here early so you don't have to wait in line. ÊThere's usually about a 45 minute to 1 hour wait but well worth it. Ê The portions are GINORMOUS here. ÊThe pancakes are literally hanging off the plate. The first time I came here, I ordered the blueberry pancakes and must say that my boyfriend and I couldn't even eat 1/4th of the stack. ÊThat's how much pancake there was. Ê I LOVE the "Poached y Papas" Benedict which is a nice thick slice of ham with 2 poached eggs on top of potato skins. ÊIt's a nice twist on the traditional eggs benedict which comes on english muffins. ÊTheir french pressed coffee is fresh and awesome. Ê Come here in the summer and it may get too hot so I wouldn't recommend coming during the summer if you don't like heat. ÊYou will be waiting in the sun and it does get hot in the restaurant. Ê There is street parking on the street but you will need to circle around the block a few times to find parking. Ê Servers are very friendly and prices are very good. Ê Really nice brunch spot if you ask me.

Nummie nummies! When I want pancakes I for sure go to the Griddle! If I'm wanting a scramble or an omelette it wouldn't be my first choice because to me those aren't anything special. But the pancakes, oh those luscious fluffy pancakes! If you go with screaming toddlers the wait seems to be not as bad ;-) They usually bump you up pretty fast! And like Corey P.

How unnecessary is it for anyone to write another 5 star review for The Griddle? ÊPossibly just as unnecessary as ordering eggs benedict on potato skins. ÊNot even the anorexia committee needs that. I usually go for the sweet here - Golden Ticket pancakes, to be exact. ÊBut today was a savory day and the hollandaise drenched eggs atop thick sliced cut-with-a-butter-knife ham was perfection at 10:30 am. Ê If I ever move back to Jersey I will miss The Griddle the most. ÊWell, that and the lack of cities built on swamps. **gross out alert** I'm sure I'll be sick within the hour, but that's ok cuz I look forward to tasting the yumminess again. ÊEwwwwwww. :)

This place is pretty popular and parking is hard to come by since its metered on the street but once you bypass those obstacles you're in for a pretty good treat. The waiters are very sociable and funny and the food is great. Strong flavors can be distinguished in each dish making them distinct and delicious. Service can be somewhat slow because of crowding and orders can be messed up but over all fairly good experience here.

There are few restaurants I can still remember over a year after I have eaten there but this is one of them. I remember getting sat on a busy mid-early Saturday morning at a cute bar area. Looking around there is a choice in seating, bar area, tables, booths, and even a private-type table in the back. I remember ordering a coffee and getting it in a French ÊPress....yum...so much better that way. Ê I am pretty sure I remember our waiter being super nice and not pushy, no attitude. Just a good server (seems to be hard to find in LA) I remember being confused on what to order -- there were so many choices and everything looks really good. ÊI should have paid attention to the food that was being served around me and that was a big mistake because when I ordered my pancakes and they arrived in front of me.......W-O-W......ok, what three people are going to help me finish this???? Ê Seriously, the cakes were really really good (I got the healthy ones which name escapes me now --- hey, it was over a year ago, I can't remember everything!!) Êbut WTF on them being so big?? Who could possibly finish them? Ê Ê I remember getting through a pie-slice portion of the stack and taking the rest home and throwing it in my freezer. FYI- not a good idea, it doesn't really stand up after a week in the freezer (probably how long it took me to digest the first portion) and then a re-heat. Better off to just throw 'em in the fridge and hope an army invades your kitchen. At least you'll have proper rations.

I must say, I am truly lucky to have wonderful breakfast foods every weekend. Last week it was The Original Pancake House down in Redondo, this week it was The Griddle in WeHo. Now, let me remind you that I'm a HUGE pancake fanatic, but this time I decided to try the French Toast. The "Addicted to Noisella" French Toast to be exact. Allz I gotz ta say is... YUMMERZZZ!!!! I heart nutella. It was soo delicious. And it wasn't TOOO sweet where my tooth would end up aching. Somehow, it was just the right amount of sweetness with just the right amount of powdered sugar and chocolate. I split with that with a gal pal and we also had a side of scrambled eggs and sausages. MMMMMMMMM.....perfect breakfast. And to top it all off, we had a large French pressed coffee. I don't normally like black coffee. Actually, I don't like black coffee at all. But I decided to drink this in it's purest form and to my surprise it was DELICIOUS! Of course, I had the mild roast, so choose the one to your own liking. Paired with a sweet dish (nutella French toast), you've got yourself a winning combo! The wait was not long. We went on a Sunday morning around 10am (primetime brunch time) and we waited about 20 minutes. Don't come here with a huge group. Do come here with a huge appetite. Oh- and free parking! Who doesn't appreciate that in LA these days?

Our friends were there too in a party of 4 and waited over an hour. So, just go on a little date with a friend and walah- deliciousness in your belly in no time! We got the "Addicted to Noisella" (Nutella stuffed french toast) and HOLY MOLY this is AMAZING. It's SO GOOD but if you aren't into super sweet things...it's not for you. BUT IF YOU LIKE NUTELLA HOLY *@&T IT SURE IS FOR YOU! We also shared the "Sow Your Oats" pancakes with honey, oats and cinnamon. Super super fluffy and HUGE pancakes. Really yummy. :) So, overall, AMAZING breakfast and totally a must try for visitors and LA kids who just haven't gotten around to braving the wait. YUMMY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The Griddle Cafe is easily one of my favorite breakfast places ever ever ever, but you've got to be smart about it. If you don't like crowds, stay home on a weekend morning. This a fight you are not going to win. If you think the portions are too large, ask for a smaller serving. I love ordering one pancake. Even that is usually too much. Their servings are insane, but you should know that going in. If you like customer service, know that you're rolling the dice. Some of the waitstaff is very friendly. Some will forget to bring you your check. It's a gamble. With that, it sounds like I hate the place, but it's really a wonderful little joint that I recommend to everyone. I like to go on a weekday around 10 or 11. It's usually much more relaxed than the typical insane saturday morning. The coffee is great. The new southwestern chipotle chicken scramble is amazing. The pancake(s) are amazing. Dodge the crowds and temper your service expectations and you're golden.

After hundreds and hundreds (okay, 3) of recommendations to eat here, I finally did after waiting 30 minutes for a table outside on the sidewalk (not even a real patio!). ÊWe couldn't decide on what to get... : The huge-ass pumpkin pancakes (in this case, just because it's bigger, is it really better?)? ÊThe banana-stuffed pancakes? ÊThe shrimp sandwich with capers? ÊA salad? ÊWaffles with strawberries? ÊOmelette Pomodoro? We settled on sharing the French Toast - huge, really moist with real whipped butter and sprinkeld sugar... added the maple syrup that was on the table and it was devine! ÊWe also shared the Papas Y Poached - their version of an Eggs Florentine, but instead of an English muffin, they put it on 3 slices of potato skins, drowning in Hollandaise sauce... GENIUSES, I tell ya!!! Ê The guy who put the food down on the table was really abrupt and just slammed our food down in front of us... I had to stare at him with a WTF-look on my face and he finally apologized. Ê There was also a lady who decided that she wanted to hover over me from behind while I ate and while she waited for her table... heard of personal space, beeyotch?! ÊAlso... it took like another 30 minutes to get our food. ÊWaaaay too long for a hungry gal like me!!! So the food was good, but definitely not worth the wait... regardless of all the beautiful men I had to stand next to while waiting... If I wasn't so hungry, maybe it would have been worth it. Side note: while waiting for a table, the girl who played Topanga from Boy Meets World was sitting in front of us... I thought that was pretty funny.

The Griddle is the gold standard of what all pancakes should aspire to be. ÊIt's worth the wait, though I've never waited more than 10 minutes for a table. ÊMy first time here, we were seated next to Ian Ziering much to my delight! ÊSince then, I always refer to the Griddle as the "Peach Pit". Situated at Sunset and Fairfax, the Griddle isn't too far from the notorious 90210 zip code. Ê Besides the fun people-watching, the coffee is strong and good. ÊPerfect, because it gets me jacked up enough to tackle shopping on Melrose immediately after! ÊBut justly, the Griddle's claim-to-fame is their pancakes. ÊThough I've tried a few of the varieties, I am now MARRIED to the pumpkin pie pancakes. ÊThey are sinful, decadent, Êaaaahhhh better than most things on this planet. And they're not your basic pumpkin-flavored pancakes, either-- rather, they're stuffed with pumpkin pie filling and topped with homemade whipped cream. ÊI'll tell you what-- these delectable babies make my trip from Chicago worth it every time. Ê On my last visit to L.A., SP tried to get me to try a different spot for brunch. Not happening unless you want to see me throw a tantrum. ÊThe Griddle. Now. ÊOh, and I've attached a picture to my profile so you can see the infamous pumpkin pie pancake for yourself!

I am the first to bitch and moan about LA not being a "breakfast town". But seriously, the abundance of actress/model/dancer/writer/producer-types and a town that is made for such schedules where people are out every night of the week mean that an abundance of breakfast hot spots are just not logical. Who wants to get up that early to eat when you're just going to bed at sunrise on any given day? But Griddle Cafe is my favorite bright spot in LA's emerging breakfast landscape. Pancakes bigger than your head, flavors more glutenous than anything Willy Wonka ever pushed, french pressed coffee made to order, and fresh juices make this place my favorite for that very important AM meal. Yes the wait is pretty much always insane, especially on weekends but, as long as you aren't too hungover to hang out and wait in the sun, it's well worth your time.

If you like pancakes or french toast you cannot miss Griddle Cafe on Sunset and Fairfax. The portions are ENORMOUS. The pictures of their specialty pancakes look big, but they are even bigger in person. There is just no way for one person to finish it in one sitting (and keep in mind I am the bottomless pit when it comes to waffles, french toast, pancakes and maple syrup). We initially only got Mom's French Toast and the Muscle Scramble, but I really wanted to try their pancakes and was happy to find they take orders for just single pancakes (instead of a stack of 3). Everything was excellent and we tried to finish, but with only 2 people, we were unable to finish about 1/2 of the pancake. Parking is available in the back of Rite Aid (enter from Fairfax). The wait wasn't too bad - about 15 minutes on a Sunday morning at 10:30 a.m. The only cons: Êit is very loud in the restaurant so if it's a nice quiet brunch you're looking for, this is the wrong place. The restaurant is also kind of dark, and has more of a bar feel than a place for breakfast.

I don't even like pancakes, but Griddle Cafe makes me want to cry softly in my sleep. I think it's the fresh french pressed coffee that makes it go down sooooo well. These pancakes are the size of Iowa, so make sure to bring a party big and enthusiastic enough to share. Their egg dishes are just okay, but it's nice to have something salty in between the shovels of pancake. I hear they have red velvet pancakes now, so it's time to revisit to see if it's as good as Larchmont Bungalow's RV pancakes...mmmmmmmm

Ughhh, I'm sorry but I DESPISE this place. After I left this restaurant last week, I felt like I'd wasted a huge portion of my life and a piece of my soul died. 1) I ordered a chai tea latte and it was the worst chai tea latte I've ever had. (Very powdery). 2) The pancakes, which is what they are known for, are NOT good. They're just huge and covered in crap. Exl- a chocolate chip and coconut "meh" pancake covered in powder sugar and whipped cream WHY is that necessary? And whyyy do they have to cover a blueberry pancake with alllllll that stuff???? We ordered ONE whole wheat pancake PLAIN! and it came with a bunch of sugar and God knows what on it that we had to scrape off. Sooooo gross. Whatever happened to simplicity, Griddle Cafe? I had one of their omelettes and it was decent, but it was still way to overpriced for what it is. The worst part about this place is that it is soooooooo loud!!! This is not a good place to go if you actualy want to talk to a person because you can't even hear yourself think. In conclusion, this is just a non-chain version of a louder, rampantly obesity- inducing, overpriced Ihop.

My New Year's resolution is to write more reviews, so here is the first one for 2008... Yes, there are a ton of reviews for this place, but I have to add my 2 cents. ÊI went to Griddle Caf with Rick W way back in 2007. ÊIt was a Saturday, mid-morning. ÊIt was pretty crowded when we got there, long wait, so we got a table outside and took a look at the menu. ÊBanana pancakes looked good, but I wanted something more. ÊThe Golden Ticket pancakes seemed to be calling my name. Ê3 banana pancakes filled with caramel, walnuts, and streusel and topped with whipped cream, caramel and streusel. Ê I'd heard you get a lot of food here, but I was in no way prepared for the amount of food I got. ÊThese pancakes were HUGE! ÊLike bigger than dinner plate size huge, and thick! ÊWhoa! ÊAlways up for an eating challenge though, I was ready! ÊSo, you ask, how did you do? ÊI'm not ashamed to say I failed miserably! ÊPartially because we were short on time, but mostly because they were monstrous, I only ate less than one pancake worth of my meal. ÊEmbarrassed, defeated, humiliated and hanging my head in shame, I had to ask for a to go container to take the rest home. Ê As far as taste goes, they were good. ÊFluffy and sweet and topped with gooey goodness! ÊI had to eat a section out of the side quickly so the whipped cream and caramel wouldn't drip over the side onto the table and make a mess that the cute waitress would have to clean up. ÊHey, that's just the kinda guy I am. ÊThe service was adequate, but nothing special. ÊRick had the waffle, which looked really good. ÊMaybe I'll try that next time. ÊNote, they close at 4pm, so this place is strictly a breakfast/lunch restaurant and get there early to avoid a long wait.

I had to wait 48 hours to write this review, because I literally couldn't MOVE after eating at this place. Holy mother crap is this food delicious, and HUGE! Downfall is that I hate wasting food...it makes me feel guilty - and it's seriously impossible not to do so at this place. My sister and I ordered 2 dishes: Banana Nana pancakes, and the Chicago Charlie Omelette. I also ordered a coffee (which comes in a French Press...super-duper cool, and was SO good). By the time our food arrived, I had downed 2 cups of coffee and was already getting full. The pancakes were incredible, and I need not mention how ridiculously humongous they were (see photo, and the terror in my sister's face upon receiving them). The omelette was incredibly tasty. We wound up eating more of that than the pancakes. (P.S. My diet was on vacation, during my vacation...). Another thing worth mentioning: Not only is the inside of this place adorable, but I swear that every single server working there is a model. The boys were as yummy as the food...and damn them for flirting with us while we felt like heifers from the food they brought us. **Be careful if you've never been here, it can be tricky to find - it's next to the Rite Aid on the Southwest corner of Sunset at Fairfax. You can park behind the Rite Aid for free.**

With nearly 700 reviews at the time of writing my review, I don't feel compelled to say much, so I'll stick to the essence of why this is an excellent breakfast/brunch/lunch place. 1. REAL maple syrup. Not for extra money. Not served in little 4 oz. cups. Just a glass jug on the table. If you're not from the northern part of the US or Canada, you may not fully appreciate the flavor of 100% pure maple syrup vs. maple flavored corn syrup salve. I went to another place and the manager told me, "We no longer carry it for expense reasons." Guess the Griddle didn't get the memo. 2. The portions are large, so technically, you "could" share a plate. But then again, not. 3. Fresh squeezed orange juice. 4. Fast service despite the extreme crowds. 5. Outside street side tables with good people watching. 6. Excellent quality ingredients. Option for whole wheat pancakes. Hot tip: Go before 9:20AM always.

Starting off by saying, I HATE the parking here. Got lost my first time trying to find this Griddle as it was located in the middle while I had a tempered fiddle about it!! Be prepared to play wait time in the back of an Rite-Aid lot when finding a parking spot. Secondly, please bring a huge very HUGE appetite! I told my friend that If i ever do come here for a 3rd time, I will literally starve myself the day before so I can take a mouthful and actually finish my food. Thirdly, yes the portions are huge and meets thus price ranges but I wouldn't rave about it being the best of the best. I brought a friend here tonight and out of his mouth came the words " I could have perhaps made this at home" then stabbed his pancake. He of course got the "Original" which came with no toppings or all the fixings so I could see his point. Ê I chose the Banana-Nana (cmon you guys know I have a fetish with Banana foods/things in general) and while it tasted like a typical banana pancake, I ate a pie sliced diameter and I was DONE! I also ordered a side of hash-browns which I regretted doing since it looked like a piece of bread. I love my hash-browns to be traditional shredded type, not pudding-bread type. Pretty much left the plate the same as it arrived, full. My friend and I sat at the counter and the service was slow. It wasn't even busy! It was so slow and bad we never got the name of our server. We just ate a bit and were ready to get out of there to head elsewhere.

If you're from LA or in LA and love breakfast, You got to eat here, and if you're not from LA, you got to try it. Come early, cos' this place picks up quick. The earlier the better. I tried the Eye's Wide Open pancakes, and sure enough, it got me eyes popping for the rest of the day. Of course, the butter makes it complete. The Griddle Waffle is also a must. To top it off, the french coffee is excellent. I took a star off because this place is so crowded, which is good, it takes a while to make the order. However, the staff are cool people. This joint is one of the places I hit up alot in the weekends.

Pancakes are the size of my head! and I have a huge head! These are some G ass pancakes. The people next to us both ordered pancakes and it looked so good. Actually I'm lying. I don't eat sweet stuff. But if I did, I'm sure it'll be good. Huge stack of hot cakes drenched in strawberries and whip cream. Yuck. i mean Yum! To be honest, I really wanted the Chicago Egg Special which was like a onion, sauage, egg scramble. But Slick wanted to order the same thing and I figure I could eat off his plate. Soooo. my brilliant ass decided to order a chicken chorizo burrito instead. Sounds disgusting? It was. Chicken chorizo apparently is some sort of ground chicken mixture mixed with bell peppers and chopped tomatoes. I always try things three times so I'm going to come back but next time i'll order something simple. In the meantime if I want to see ample eye candy and have a 30 minute wait, then I'd go back to Toast (http://www.yelp.com/userÉ).

One of my roommates chose to come here during our trip to LA for spring break. Before entering this place, I was skeptical. ÊI thought this was yet another overrated breakfast joint located on Sunset Blvd that all the stars go to and overly priced. ÊThis doesn't happen much, but for once, I was wrong! I love hole in the walls! I ordered the Kicking and Screaming Tacos while my roommates ordered the Bluesberry, and the Omelette Pomodoro. ÊFor the table, we agreed on the Addicted to Noisella stuffed french toast which is just nutella. I absolutely loved my tacos! ÊThe eggs were perfectly cooked, and drenched with chipotle cream sauce. ÊIt looked so cute and yummy. Ê I'm not a fan of pancakes or blueberries in them but these ones were quite fluffy and chewy. ÊIt came in about 2 or 3 huge layers and was topped with blueberry sour cream, an odd concoction but a nice compliment nonetheless. Ê The Omelette was pretty good too. ÊI was too full to enjoy the french toast, but the few bites I had of it was delish! ÊWho doesn't love nutella? Too bad most of it was devoured before I got a chance to really enjoy it when I was hungry again. Overall, this is an excellent place. ÊThe servers are friendly and the prices aren't bad for the huge amount of food you get. You will definitely have leftovers for the road. Oh yeah, we also got a glimpse of Anne Hathaway and Fred Durst. ÊBut we rather take pics of our food than of them.

Frisbees, berets, fake plastic vomit, LPs, tortillas & large hubcaps are all SMALLER than the pancakes they serve Êhere. ÊSeriously phat griddle cakes, man. ÊNo room for silver dollars here. Sure. ÊAll the flavors and toppings sound delicious. Yes, the descriptions on the menu read well. But you start to feel ill after only the third sickeningly sweet bite. I say stick to the Chili (it's from chili, my soul!!), or eggs, or whatever... Just order some pancakes for the whole table and enjoy your meal while you take delicate nibbles of the flapjacks. Ê That way you can get your taste of sugary sweetness without the bloat and Rolaids chaser. If you must order something sweet for breakfast, pass on the pancakes and go for the french toast. ÊThey are super slobbery drool worthy! Plus any leftovers you have you can just throw on the floor and I will be there to slurp those puppies up right off the ground. Ê(smallish) Dogs allowed & hollywood A$$holes are welcomed at the outdoor tables.

Aaamazing! I can't remember the last time I've gone out to eat breakfast, but I'd definitely come here to eat breakfast any day! This place exceeded my expectations, especially with their delicious coffee and stomach-upset-free breakfast food! I came here with Mark S. on a Sunday morning, and we came at around 9ish, just before it got really busy. We were seated at the counter and immediately approached by our waiter. Pretty friendly staff. Here's what we ordered: Medium French-press Coffee ($3.75) -- Got a medium from the recommendation of the waiter. Their menu was right -- it was great-tasting coffee! Perhaps the best coffee I've tried (that wasn't ice-blended). I added a bit of cream and one packet of organic sugar to it, and it just hit the spot! "Poached y Papas" Benedict ($12) -- I had a certain craving for Eggs Benedict and I was so happy when I saw this on the menu! Perfectly poached egginess on top of a generous slice of ham and four potato skins. If that wasn't a mouthful to say, it was definitely a mouthful to eat! I enjoyed it very much and didn't get any sort of upset stomach, which is a great bonus! Definitely a good pick, and the Hollandaise sauce added a nice extra eggy and creaminess to the dish. "Caballero" ($12) -- Pretty good, and very filling! Mark S. ordered this and I tried some of it. It's basically a Mexican-style omelette with eggs, chicken chorizo, chiles, cheddar, etc. topped with sour cream, avocado, and salsa, and altogether wrapped in a ginormous flour tortilla! Served with tortilla chips, which weren't so bad. Not a bad item, but I liked the Benedict more. Coming here from the OC makes this place a great day-trip destination! It's right on Sunset Blvd, too, making it all the more awesome. Great service, too. NOTE: The place isn't too big, so come here with small parties of 2 or 3 and make plans to share dishes; the proportions are huge!

This is my 2nd time checking out the Griddle. ÊOn my first experience..it wasn't that great and my friend found a loooooooooooooooong piece of hair in his pancakes right when he almost finished them. Ê(thats the worst...finding a hair when you're almost done w/ the meal!). The server was cool about it and the mgr handled the situation but it still ruined his meal. Anyway..it was the same friends' bday and I asked if he wanted to have brunch @ the Griddle just to give it a 2nd chance and he agreed. I don't know why everyone says parking is hard to find. ÊI guess a lot of people do not know that you can park behind the Griddle in the Rite Aid parking lot. ÊIts used for both places. The place was packed but the host said it would only be a 10 min wait and I think it was actually shorter than that. We got sat at the bar area. Ê I ordered Moms French Toast (im more of a pancake person but ive been on a french toast kick lately for some crazy reason ). My friend got the French Toast w/ Nutella and we split an egg dish. Everything came out quickly and everything was waaaayyyy delicioso! The portions were very big and filling. **They have 2 for 1 mimosas during breakfast/brunch.

This place is a great place for breakfast or breakfast for lunch! Locale: This place has both a bar area where you eat and watch TV. There tables for two and booths. Food: They serve huge portions. If you order pancakes don't get more than two. Each pancake is about half an inch thick and as big as the entire plate. I got one and still took half home in a doggy bag. Also not that each ingredient is there in abundance. For example if a pancake comes with coconut, the whole thing will be full of coconuts. Interesting: My wife saw Justin Timberlake and Cameron Diaz there when she went in back Nov. 2010.

Came here with a friend on a Tue around noon, but it was actually pretty busy.. Street parking is impossible, but luckily there is a parking lot in the back. We did have to walk past the smelly trash cans to enter from the back door though. Once inside, there's a long hallway you walk through to get to the hostess area. It's a pretty small space and could get crowded and the place smells strongly of FOOD. Luckily, there was a table outside and we took that. Unfortunately, sitting outside means the service was slower, but it didn't bother us THAT much. It did start drizzling though so that was unfortunate. The menu has a wide selection and it's definitely a great place to try. We ordered the Vanilla Latte, soooo good. I'm not a coffee drinker but I liked this drink enough to get one to go for later. We ordered: Red Velvet Pancake: At first this looks REALLY SWEET And RICH, but it tastes SOOOO GOOD. It actually wasn't as sweet as I thought it was going to be but had a rich red velvet taste. Addicted to Noisella: VERY RICH and SWEET french toast... If you like sweet stuff and Nutella order it! It was a little too sweet for me but my friend liked it. Some Like it Hot Scramble: Pretty good... with salsa and a side of bread... But probably not something I'd order again. It wasn't spicy enough for me and the textures of everything was just too similar. Overall, I would come back on a sunny day and def not when it's crowded so we can sit outside again... It just seemed really stuffy inside. There's a lot of other things I would want to try on the menu and I'd def order the red velvet pancake again!

Worlds biggest pancakes! ÊWOW, how fun! ÊWe got take out because we didn't want to wait in line so I can't really comment on how long the wait really is. ÊI can say that our order was ready by the time we walked there from the Laemmle down the road. Ê I got the teacher's pet pancakes. ÊI asked them to add walnuts but they forgot to do that. ÊAside from forgetting the walnuts, my pancakes were fantastic! ÊThey were HUGE, I didn't even eat 1/4 of them. ÊHeavy too...and I sure felt heavy after eating them! ÊThey had cinnamon apples baked into them and they also had them on top. ÊWarm cinnamon apples, does it get any better than that? Ê Paul was real excited to find out that they carry chili from his favorite chili place in Encino, Chili My Soul. ÊThey have four or five different flavors a day actually! ÊHe got a bowl of Texas Pride chili that came with garlic toast and three toppings. ÊNeither of us liked his toast but that is OK everything else was great. ÊPaul LOVED the chili, he actually said several times that it tasted better than it has the last few times he went to the actual restaurant in Encino! ÊVery cool! Ê We loved the Griddle Cafe!!!!!!!!!! ÊI hope we go back soon. ÊOh, and how cute are the waiters that work there???? ÊWOW, kudos to the owners for hiring hotties! ÊI think Paul even caught me staring at one of them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Breakfast should be eaten 3 times a day if it's from The Griddle Cafe. ÊYou'll keep wanting to come back here because it's THAT good and you'll want to try everything on their breakfast menu at least once. It does tend to get crowded but takeout is available for impatient, hungry peeps. There is something for everyone and you really can't go wrong with much. ÊMy favorites here: Strawberries and Cream Waffles - Gotta have this again and again and again.... Golden Ticket Ê- Banana stuffed hotcakes with caramel, nuts and icing- Gotta try at least once. Caballero - Eggs scrambled with potatoes, chiles, chicken sausage, cheese, sour cream, and avocado wrapped loosely in a flour tortilla. Their best egg dish, in my opinion.

These pancakes are ginormous! I could swim in them. I could use them as a trampoline! My wiener-dog Milo could use them as a bed! The Griddle Cafe really delivered: quick, efficient service (despite the long wait), cheap & delicious food, and huge, fluffly round pancakes that contradict the meaning of "pancake ass". Parking around here can be a pain, but that comes with any LA brunch eatery. Here's what we ordered: - The Golden Ticket Pancake: banana-walnut pancakes w/ streusel & caramel, topped with even more streusel, caramel, and tons of whipped cream. On the heavy, rich side, but so so delicious. - Gone Shrimping: SO healthy and SO flavorful. A bunch of scrambled egg whites w/ basil, pesto, chopped veggies + capers & loads of shrimp - Kickin' and Screamin' Breakfast Tacos: i had a bite of my friend's - it was quite tasty, but i like to save tacos for after lunch hours - Cobb Omelette: SUPER fluffy egg omelette filled w/ veggies + bacon and tons of fruit - FRENCH PRESS COFFEE: this coffee lives up to the hype. You can see the soft grains of dark coffee and gives it its earthy, rich flavor. yum! I would love to come back here to try other entrees, but it's just too much of a headache to wait on the crowded street, where random homeless bums approach you selling beads and asking for $. And another weird thing is, I swear one of the servers tapped my ass a couple times as he was walking by. I don't mean that in a conceited way - it's just SO crowded here.

If variety is the spice of life, this place is death. A sweet, sweet, sugary one. Not a bad thing at all. They do the dessert-pretending-to-be-breakfast thing incredibly well, but they do it uncompromisingly. Meals are a homogeneous stack of a cutely named concoction that will be the best damn thing you ever ate in the first 5 bites and the most overwhelming thing you've ever dealt with after the 6th. That, and with no bacon or potatoes offering a respite from the ruthless sweetness, makes for a challenging meal indeed. In fairness, you can get savories on the side, but the menu is certainly not designed for this. They make you go out of your way to have a balanced meal. But it's those glorious moments, before you realize you've made a grave mistake, that get this place 3 stars instead of less.

Fellow Yelpers Sida B. and Eddie W. recommended this place to me. Realizing it'd probably get super busy, Charlene P. and I left early in the morning, trekkin' here from Irvine, CA to check out the hype. We pulled in around 9:15 AM (it was Sunday; they open at 8 AM) and were seated promptly at the counter. Service was super quick, and we started out with coffee ($3.75). Out came a French coffee press and our waiter instructed us to wait two minutes before pushing down on the press. On Griddle Cafe's website, they say it's the freshest cup of coffee around, and man - it was the best cup of coffee I've ever had! Granted, the $3.75 price tag was hella steep, it was still pretty legit. So I decided to choose the Caballero (~$12). A few moments later a huge ass breakfast burrito came out with some tortilla chips on the side. There was an avocado on top and some sour cream and salsa on the side. I cut open the burrito and am so glad the tortilla is not that thick; the insides are pouring out. I take a bite and man, it's bomb! The chips were nice too. It was a bomb breakfast burrito - not too salty at all. Everything just tasted so good; I even took a bite out of Charlene P.'s poached eggs with holladaise sauce...BOMB. Overall, the meal was super delicious, but also somewhat expensive. We spent about $40 including tip on two people. Damn. Also I saw some people around us getting those ridiculously big pancakes. Personally - coming from me, the Professional Fat Arse himself - HALF of one of those pancakes would've done me in. And I'm not even a fan of pancakes mind you. On a side note, this definitely looks like the kind of place that should be on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives ("Where they're doing pancakes their own way"). Also everyone here looks like a movie star. Pretty crazy! If you want bomb breakfast food that'll fill you up to this brink of insanity, check out this place!!!

Double D-licious! I am ecstatic to say I finally got to try TGC and it lives up to the hype! First off, Jodi, the owner, is AMAZING. She genuinely wants everyone to enjoy him/herself and really tries to make your experience more than delightful. And the crazy thing is... all in spite of being so popular and crowded! +10 for that alone! We were offered mimosas on the house, but we declined because we're a few months shy of being legal... but I would've loved to try some! My friend and I both ordered french toasts (~$10-12). My friend got Mom's French Toast, and I got the creme de la creme, which was graham cracker crusted and topped with cream cheese, and it was LOVE at first bite! Absolutely melt-in-your-mouth divine! It was soooo good, but I couldn't even finish half because the portions were so big! ...French toast for dinner? Sounds like a plan! Our server Thomas, was great as well! And parking wasn't bad. Yes, there's a ton of people and yes, even the Rite Aid lot was packed, but there's PLENTY of street parking around the residential areas. All in all, an EXCELLENT experience! I can't wait to come back!

Service is excellent and by excellent I mean, fast and efficient. Plus the majority of the servers are really good looking which is always nice on the eyes. The establishment itself is very cute. I like how the tables are small and close together. They also have bar area that looks very comfortable. As for the food, well, I think all the previous reviews have already covered that. I ordered the Banana Nana pancakes (short stack). Of course they were HUGE and I only ate about 1/2 of them. None the less they were still very good with nice chunks of bananas inside the warm fluffy cakes. Coconut Choco Latte to drink, very tasty. Very reasonable pricing. Definitely gonna be back to try some other things on their menu.

I went here on a fist date, and it probably wasn't the best place for it, but the food is really amazing. ÊThe pancakes are literally the size of steering wheels. ÊGet a short stack if you have a normal appetite, or go with the normal size if you're literally hungry enough to eat a horse or sharing with at least 2 people. Even the omlettes are rather large. The coffee and tea isn't done in a brewer or kept hot like in most places, this place gives you a french press or even a tea press with your desired tea or coffee. It's a great place, you sit elbow to elbow with obnoxious hollywood types (we were next to some wannabe actress who was discussing loudly that she had a meeting with an agent at 3pm who was stupid if he didn't sign her), eat obscenely huge portions of food, andthen go into a food coma.

I've heard and read so much about this place and new that I was at the right place once I saw the line outside the door. They are so organized and friendly. Excellent food and excellent service.

The portions are huge so to get the best out of this place, share what your friends and ask for their most popular items off the menu.

Ohmygawd, the best breakfast EVER. Yeah, huge waits on weekends. Which is why I never go before 2:00 pm, cuts wait time down to 5-10 mins. By 3:00, you'll be seated right away. Note that the restaurant shuts down at 4:00, though... You don't go for the service -- though it's usually adequate -- you go for the pancakes. It's impossible to visualize how large they are without seeing them for yourself. One order consists of 3 massive pancakes. Regulars will usually ask for just 1 or 2 (I recommend 2... even if you don't finish them, that extra thickness is deliciousness itself). Hard to beat the Black Magic pancakes, loaded with the black part of Oreo cookies, but they have several other choices, too. Their egg dishes (Charlie's Scramble, Yumm!) are also top notch. And the coffee is not to be missed. I've yet to have better coffee in Los Angeles. Simple French press style, really good beans. (Also some of the best orange juice in the city, and there's not much good OJ out here. Sorry, I used to live in Florida, and the OJ selection in LA is pretty weak for the most part.) We don't go often -- just too busy at times -- but we try for a visit every 4-5 weeks and always leave very, very happy.

The food is amazingly yummy. Stopped in here on a Saturday morning. Got here about 5 mins before they open and there was like one or two other parties already waiting. Plus they filled up quickly after they open so you know this place is good. Got seated quickly service is friendly. I had the Creme La Crema french toast and it's amazing but very filling with the cream cheese frosting. Overall, definitely would come back if I was in the area. Everyone enjoyed their dishes too.

#300 Note to self and everyone: DO NOT GO AT 12:30 SUNDAY AFTERNOONS. We ended up waiting over an hour for a table and then only to be told the food was taking up to an hour to come out. ÊWhen did we finally get to eat? 2:30. Which by that time, I wasn't hungry because my body had started breaking down my body fat and muscle. ÊI was a gasping skeleton by the time I got my lukewarm iced tea. I'm not a pancakes person. ÊI've never have been though I toyed with the idea of boysenberry pancakes as I love, love, love boysenberries. ÊBut I just couldn't stomach the idea of all that powdered sugar or syrup so I was going to get lunch. ÊMy friend yelled at me that I must try something from the GRIDDLE. ÊOkay, okay, okay! ÊGimme an omelette. I chose the Cobb omelette which was fine. ÊI mean, the chicken was good. ÊThe bacon was good. ÊI could have used a little more blue cheese but otherwise, this was not a mind blowing omelette. ÊYes, it was well cooked but after all the hype, I suppose I expected something more. ÊEspecially since I waited nearly an hour for this omelette. ÊScratch that, TWO HOURS. The Griddle potatoes that came with it looked like a chunk was missing and needed a sprinkling of salt and pepper from me. ÊThey were just okay. I received a second glass of slightly colder iced tea when I asked our hot but harried waiter. As I was finishing up, I realized I never received my toast. ÊAfter the disgruntled guy to my left harassed every passing staff member for his check, I caught our waiter and asked for a to-go box and my damn toast. Well, my toast was the best thing I ate at the Griddle and probably the only reason I'd go back. ÊI might be convinced to go again to get a waffle (I do love waffles) but not if I have to wait 2 hours. ÊNope. Edit 10/18/07 I'm dropping my review to 1 star. ÊMy leftovers went moldy the NEXT DAY.

Showed up here at about 130 in the afternoon and had no wait at all. it was sure packed, but I guess we were just that lucky...heh I have had this place bookmarked for a good while because their pancakes looked fantastic...we had no pancakes. I ordered eggs, bacon, and taters and she had the french toast. Eggs were quite good...better than most restaurants i'd have to say. Cooked with some butter, however not doused beyond tasting anything other than the butter. The bacon was fantastic, not as crispy as we usually like but the flavor was very good. The potatos were essentially fried mashed potatos in a nice rectangular brick on my plate. They had a good selection of hot sauces to choose from to lather everything in, but I was my typical kind self and refrained so that the other sex could enjoy the food as well. Her plate consisted of three massive pieces of french toast covered in powdered sugar. I am not a french toast person but we decided to try the pancakes on our next visit here. I do have to admit, that this was the best french toast that I have ever had. You MUST love cinnamon in order to enjoy these and my guess is that there is a good deal of dairy product that these are soaked in so a tough stomach is a necessity. They were fantastic. The bread is very nicely browned and very flavorful throughout. We had decent service and enjoyed a nice time people watching. I suppose any business on Sunset in Hollywood will have its share of aspiring actors but this place takes the cake. It seemed that every person in there was posing for a headshot every minute of the day. All in all it was a good time. Cost was high...for both of our meals it crested 25 bucks...i cringe

Found this place through yelp when my bf and I were hungry at 5am in the morning. Finally tried it 2 months later with my bestie. parking is in the back behind where Rite Aide. You can't miss it. You should get their early as possible or you have to wait in a long line. I think they have 2 separate line for big parties and groups. Got there at 11am and it was still packed. Breakfast is serve from 7am-4pm, but Êearlier the better! The place has Tv's so you can watch sports. Very ongoing and loud. Place is small that's why it gets very packed. They're were 4 of us so we ordered the famous Red Velvet pancake, the Nutella French toast, and the oversize ham with sunny side up eggs w/ sour dough toast. Just 3 things for all of us to share. Price isn't as bad since your getting a lot of food for the amount your paying for. So don't trip if you see the pancake price around $7-$11. Most of the meal ranges that prices. Red Velvet Pancake, they are the size of the whole plate! Very sweet if you put a lot of the icing on it, but good and different. The pancake is only serve as 1, but if you order other pancakes its still huge but they give you a stack. Nutella french toast was good. You'll like it if your a chocolate lover, but not too chocolaty. The Ham was Huge!!! wasn't oily or anything just perfect. The 3 things we order, us 4 couldn't even finish it. even when we were sharing. It was a lot of food.

This was the week of average food, apparently. Of over-hyped joints and wilted expectations. I came here with another Yelper, who had succumbed to the hype and insisted on going. We walked in to the faux brick walls and blasting music, already too much for a 9AM weekday morning. The endless lines that are often here later in the day were almost formed, but we snagged the last table for 2 inside. Apple ordered the Waffle, something she apparently loves to the point of sacrificing untold gym hours to eat, and a latte. I decided on the French Toast. Looking around, we noticed the portions were huge, one particular 3 stack pancake order obscenely immense. Considering the inflated prices here, they better be. $11 for FT? $12 for waffle with strawberries? That's always a bad bet, considering a waffle is just that, 1 piece, no matter the price. It better be amazing! It wasn't. I tasted a piece - tough, sawdusty. Awful. My FT came served with a dollop of salted whipped cream, 2 huge pieces filled with raisins. On first bite I wasn't impressed, as it was too thick to absorb the egg in the frying process and dry, but as the maple syrup and cream seeped in, it started to taste good. I also had a french press coffee - I chose dark roast, it was decent, and a side of scrambled eggs. It was ok. On a plate. Plain. Ok? Apple said her latte was crap. The service was decent, but the noise level was just too much, grating blues guitar solos ricocheting off the fake brick walls in the stage set fake diner. We paid, we left. 634 reviews with a 4 star average. Astonishing. $41 with tip! Seriously? Go to Denny's!

Attention America: big food does not always equal good food. Though it sounds like a keen idea (especially if you waked and baked) Oreo pancakes are actually disgusting.

ÊA massive, moist, rich, delicious mass of red velvet cake in pancake form with gobs of cream cheese frosting ooey gooey goodness and cinnamon swirled on top. ÊThis could easily be shared, it's huge and eating more than half may give you instant diabetes. ÊOh well, it would have been worth it. Ê The french press of coffee was very impressive and tasty. Ê The perfect remedy to a nearly sleepless red eye flight from Hawaii. ÊThis place gets super busy too, we totally lucked out with a table. ÊMmmm I'm totally jonesing for red velvet pancakes and you are thousands of miles away! ÊGrrr.....

My roomie/good friend kept raving about this place. She used to nanny for a certain famous person's child and she would take him here on their weekend stomps around LA. Definite hipster joint with a hefty waiting time 25min to an hour. Very small dining space and loud as hell. If you want a nice tasty, intimate breakfast with friends, fam or loved ones, then pass on it. We were tempted to order to go but they weren't offering that cuz it was so busy. I tried to venture out and order the apple cobbler french toast but I didn't realize they would dip it in cereal. I was not too keen on that idea even when I scoped them out online. They also had to have mixed some peanut butter cereal on my order accidently cuz half of my french toast tasted like peanut butter instead of apple cinnamon. The servers denied that there was anything peanut butter on my order or that they serve something with peanut butter (hello! there is a peanut bubba french toast??), but I dropped it and just ate the one slice and took the rest home. The saving grace is that my friend ordered the regular french toast and it was very good and she even shared a few bites. I ordered a side of maple turkey sausage which was good too. Both of us paid around 20 bucks a piece for meal, tax and tip. Ummmm.. there has to be better breakfast spots out there for less damage to the pocket book right?? For that much, the ambience could be better. My friend was very bummed that my experience was not stellar but I may try it again with her if the day/time is convenient. That breakfast burrito looked insanely good so that may be my next order if we do...

You can't gripe about the wait if you know the reputation of this place. Waiting is a mandatory requirement for The Griddle Cafe. A late Saturday morning is no exception, and I was cool with chilling outside and waiting for my spot. Originally, I wanted to request counter seats for 3, but I thought that'd be silly to do when they're so busy. We ended up with counter seats anyway, and I was stoked. I think our server's name was Joe, and he was pretty goddamn awesome, I must say. What I loved about him is that the guy was on his feet, on top of everything and still able to do a bit of chatting with the patrons without missing a beat. As we set ourselves into our chairs, we got our waters, ordered our drinks of coffee and orange juice and perused the menu. ÊI don't know why I bother to look at the menu when I typically always get the same thing: ÊNutella Stuffed French Toast and a side of bacon. ÊYum! The wait for the food is definitely not as long as the wait for seats, but it's always nice to have company to chat with, especially when you can play with their iPhones ;) Food, of course, was blissfully rich and good. Bacon was spot on. I love the crazy thick bacon of substance. We each got an order of it. Turns out, my two friends aren't a fan of this bacon, so guess who got to take theirs home for snacking on later!!! That's right! Good company. Good server. Good food. I was stuffed like my french toast, and totally happy about it.

Fours stars because I had to wait 2 hours in line haha. The food is amazing. 4 of us = 1 huge red velvet pancake ( probably about 9 inches in diameter) an order of bacon, an order if delicious grilled potatoes (took yelpers suggestions to get these to help cute down on the sweetness of the pancakes..) and 1 order of pumpkin 'tis the season' pancakes: 3 huge pancakes with whipped cream and pumpkin deliciousness plopped on top. Sinful. Great prices - and even though the wait was horrific...the service was pretty good - the guy that waited on us was fast, friendly and normal. Worth the wait!

I gotta thank the Hollywood Christmas Parade for closing down the streets, rerouting all the buses and making us (literally) walk from Hollywood&Highland to Sunset&Fairfax. We were on a mission to visit another restaurant when we hopped on to our Yelp App and found that this place was closer - 'I'm starving, sounds good to me!' I ordered the Chicago Charlie's Scramble - 1) it was HUGE, 2) it was fresh, and 3) it was fantastic! As Deana I. mentioned: we became INSTANT fans!

You do what you do so well Griddle Cafe. After waiting over over 90 minutes for a seat (on a Sunday Morning)...I said to myself if the pancakes are good, it would be worth every minute." After placing my order of "Black Magic" its been over 2+ hours and still no food, I convinced myself to stay positive, because it gave me time to build my appetite. Black Magic Pancakes ($10.50)- Oreo Pancakes w/ Whip Cream. Absolutely delicious. Top it with a little 100% Maple Syrup (Dark Amber) and you're good to go. Stacks of 3 pancakes were more than enough and can feed 3 people! The tip of the day here is to request for one or two pieces of pancakes. Every pancake you subtract from the original order of 3, you knock off $1. http://www.flickr.com/phÉ --5 / 5 Stars Red Velvet Pancake ($8.50) - This was the price for one pancake (as listed on the menu). The RVP was quite disappointing. It didn't resemble anything close enough to a cupcake or a cake IMO. The frosting on top of the cake didn't fair well with me as well. This wasn't my order so I continued to chow down on Black Magic. --2.5 / 5 Stars Tips +Order a side of bacon. Eating just pancakes or french toast doesn't feel like breakfast IMO. Some meat will definitely make the overall meal a little more appetizing. If you and a friend can agree on sharing a pancake dish, split another breakfast dish (non-pancake). +Come on weekdays or come extra early on weekends (Before 8AM - Seriously). Party of 6 or more can call in advance to make reservations (the only exception). +Like I mentioned above, try to order only 1-2 pancakes. I'm 5'11 and 190lbs and I can barely finish half of the 3 pancakes. Look for yourself http://www.flickr.com/phÉ

Best breakfast in Los Angeles. I've been going here for about 4 years now. It never gets old. It's amazing. The coffee is the best, french toast the best, best waffles, best egg dishes and their bacon is actualy the world's perfect food. I could actually eat here everyday. I'd die at the age of 29, but it would be a lovely three years. The service is actualy better than you would expect in a place this packed. And the host is the best host in this planet. He should get stock options, I swear.

This is what you should do: Round up many friends. Get to the Griddle early. I know, it sucks, it's the weekend and we drank too much the night before and sleeping in would be much better. Be strong; get there early! You won't have to wait nearly as long for a table, if at all! You and your group of friends much each order something different. The portions will withstand this, trrrrrrrrust me. Then the whole shebang arrives, you split everything up, and everyone's happy, without having to go all Sophie's Choice between the peanut butter french toast or the baked potato omelet.

This review may be wildly unpopular and I know I'm in the minority here, but I'm just calling it as I see it. The service at this place is terrible. ÊThe host is really slimy and hit on me. ÊThe portions are INSANELY huge to the point where is just downright wasteful. ÊI mean seriously, their pancakes are like the size of jet engine tires. ÊThere is no way a mere mortal can begin to eat all of that food. ÊThen of course pancakes don't exactly keep or lend themselves to being leftovers so it winds up being wasted. The last time I was there they were extremely rude. ÊI was seated and waited for another friend to join me. ÊShe was running Êlate since there was no parking to be found. ÊWhen she arrived they informed us that it was too late for her to order any food since they just seated a big party and those people were more important. ÊThey literally told us this. ÊI was stunned. ÊAll my friend wanted was a bagel, which I doubt would have thrown their kitchen off track or anything like that. They were just so rude that I decided the excellent french toast wasn't worth the poor treatment.

Hands down, one of THE best places for breakfast/brunch places ever! Thank you Yelpers for introducing me to this little piece of heaven on Earth. I had the best "Apple Cobbler" French Toast of two thick slices of apple bread with what seemed like little bits of graham cracker all around it and warm cinnamon apples on the side, but did not care for the orange-zested banana slice on top of one of the toast... I'm craving just thinking of it! My friend's "Some like it Hot" Scramble was also amazing and I had to stop eating his food and save room for my french toast. I also tried a little bit of "Chicago Charlie's" Scramble, which was also good, but not as good as "Some like it hot." The Poached eggs y papas" were interesting as well. A different twist on eggs benedict that came with two large potato slices instead. The ham that came with the dish was also very good. Fresh squeezed orange juice is AH-mazing here, but it should be since a glass will set you back $5. Sighs. Why aren't there places like these in San Jose. Places like these makes me want to move to L.A. to quench my food cravings... I will be back here for sure the next time I'm in the area. *NOTE: Portions sizes are pretty big, but if you are up for a challenge and in the mood for the flap-jacks, you are in for a surprise. The flap-jacks are easily 10 inches in diameter and about a quarter inch thick. AND you get three of them stacked on top of one another! A couple next to us ordered one dish and ate only about a quarter of it and took the rest home. Good luck!

Oh, how do I start with the Griddle Cafe? Hmmmm.... Well, I'll start by saying. Dem is some mighty big sized pancakes ya got there! Forget about Sunday mornings if you're hungry, because from the time you close your car door, if you find parking, to the time you eat, you might starve. That being said, if you time it right, and arrive when the rush is not on, you will be treated to great food and a fun atmosphere. Star sightings are typical if thats your thing, but the food gets the praise from me. There is perhaps one thing I didn't like, and it was a very greasy grilled cheese, but other than that, the food is great. Order pancakes and you may as well share it with 2 of your best friends, cuz honey, you ain't gonna finish that urself. Treat yourself to the Griddle Cafe. Lunch is great, but for me, its a breakfast spot.

What I love about this place: the BIG portioned, FLUFFY food. Êthe generous list of breakfast-y drinks perfect for lushes (try the raspberry champagne!). Êthe knowledgeable waitstaff. What I don't like about this place: the long waits (to get a seat, to get your food, to get to the restroom, etc). Êthe decibel level inside. Êthe tantalizing choices on the menu that prevent me from making a quick selection (ok, this isn't really a negative... but it did make ordering more difficult). Next time, I'm bringing a party of 6 so that I can make a reservation ahead of time, requesting a table outdoors and making someone order for me. Ê That would ensure an even more perfect Griddle Cafe experience. There's a shared parking lot with Rite Aid, behind the restaurant. ÊFrom the restaurant, go South on Fairfax and make a right into the lot. ÊFREE!

Thursday night the the gf threatens me with "You better take me here tomorrow or I am breaking up with you!" Being a smart bf, I obliged and waited as she came to my neck of the woods. On the way there, I was hoping this place was worth the hype because after all, the gf seemed to be stuck in traffic coming to LA for what seemed like an eternity. Add a hunger factor, along with a bit of road rage, you get a side of the gf that no one wants to deal with.... When she finally arrives we are off to Sunset Blvd, a street that I hate dearly due to all those traffic lights that always seem to turn red on you. Not to mention the crazy LA drivers in their leased BMW's and S-Class Benz. The Griddle Cafe shares a parking lot with Rite-Aid, and if you have gone passed Griddle Cafe on Sunset, turn back around unless you want to pay for street parking. We walked in through the back of Griddle Cafe, which starts off with restrooms and a long hallway. As you approach Griddle Cafe and was confused like me, keep walking until your at the front of Griddle Cafe to get seated! We got seated pretty quickly, I looked around and the decor was nice. The place felt really laid back, with a couple of tv's mounted on the walls. Our waiter was really laid back, as he brought us a couple of waters and menus to start before asking us what we wanted to drink. I ordered a Caballero, which was basically a breakfast burrito. Included was eggs, tomato, chorizo, sour cream, avacado, and tortilla chips. Like the menu said, THIS IS HUGE! The gf ordered Blueberry Pancakes which came with sourcream blended with blueberries topping. I enjoyed the Caballero as this was one of those burritos you needed a fork to eat with. I think the gf enjoyed it too because she kept poking at my burrito with her own fork. The tortilla chips were VERY FRESH. The sour cream, well it was better than any other sour cream I have ever remembered. Cap that all off with 5 different types of hot sauces: Tabasco, Louisiana Hot Sauce, and 3 others I have never seen before. The pancakes, well they were massive. The pictures are not deceiving. The gf ate maybe a fist full of pancakes and she was full. These pancakes are plate size. The maple syrup here is crackalicious! Awesome pancakes but the sour cream topping was not my taste. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, visit Griddle Cafe, and you might even end up leaving with leftovers for lunch and dinner.

How tired do you think the waitstaff here is of hearing "No, I wanted a large!"? All of the food here is incredible but the portions honestly look like something out of the Flintstones. The pancakes come out in a stack of 3 maybe the size of one medium-large pizza each. The French toast comes out like it was cut from a loaf of bread the size of four loaves. EVERYTHING is served to 3/1 or larger scale. If you leave Griddle hungry you have a tapeworm. Overall the food is incredible and the service was VERY good. It took a little while for the food to come out but the restaurant was slammed so that is perfectly acceptable. All of us were visiting from out of town and we will all make the trip back here next time we come to LA.

I'm in love with a love with a plate of Mom's French Toast and want to marry it. I've never had French Toast so good that I'd eaten near-half of the first piece and realized I'd added no syrup, no extra butter yet. The dipped bread alone that uniquely tasty -- 4 stars there. The fact that my added strawberries were big, fresh, sweet and not a skimpy few? Ê5th star earned. Service rocked--most likely because we went at a million-o'clock in the early dead of morning when they first opened. By 8:45am that Saturday the place was PACKED. ÊLast time I drove by Griddle at 10:30am on a weekend? The line for seating was like, Pink's- Hot-Dog-Stand-long...Pasadena Cheesecake- Factory-long. That's why it's taken me soooo long to try Griddle...I absolutely HATE long lines! ÊThing now is, I LOVE Griddle Cafe. So guess who may need learn to love waiting once in a while? Mouth full of Mom's FT, I'm gazing at decadent, endless flavors of pancakes floating by... Saw a huge, yummy lox and red onion plate on the next table. Can't wait to get back here. Better to set my alarm clock for the crack o' dawn and hit it when they first open. ÊThat's the m.o. right there. Otherwise? ÊLong lines await. ÊI'm told lines/wait aren't so much an issue during the week if your schedule (or lack thereof) will get you by the GC on a weekday. Oreo cookie pancakes. Ê'Nuf said.

There is a reason that a line always heralds the entrance to the Griddle. Ê This place is my number one pick for breakfast carbs that are worth the calories and the carb coma that often follows. ÊEverything I've had here has been wonderful--of course, any place that calls itself the "Griddle", should have amazing pancakes and waffles--and they deliver! Prepare to wait for a seat, though I've been lucky the times that I've gone and not had to wait long. ÊIt is worth it! Ê Tip: Don't order more than 1 pancake or waffle unless you are going to be sharing with 10 friends--they are monstrously large. ÊOne order is more than enough to split between two people or maybe even three. ÊThen you can get yummy sides (maybe some protein;-) to go with your delicious carb fest.

The Griddle Cafe is hands down my absolute favorite place to go for breakfast or brunch. It can get really crowded, especially on the weekends, but their prices are beyond reasonable considering their enormous portions, delicious food, and fast and friendly service. You HAVE TO try their famous bigger-than-your-head 2-inch thick pancakes and their french toast. Their pancakes are probably the best I've ever had. One pancake is probably perfect (or maybe even more than enough) for two. The french toast I ordered (can't remember the name) was packed with dried fruit and nuts. Incredible!!! Oh, and their waitresses look like they're going to a casting call for the seventh Pussycat Doll. But hey, it's Hollywood.

One of my favorite places for brunch. I first heard about Griddle Cafe from a comic book podcast (yup, geeking out!). My suggestion when going with a friend is to order two main dishes and then split an order of their famous pancakes. Speaking of pancakes, my picks are Banana Nana and Saturday Morning Fever. *Droool* The location is fun too, right next to the DGA. So you might see an interesting crowd from time to time.

NAME: The Griddle Cafe TYPE OF CUISINE: American heart attack gigantico ADDRESS: 7916 Sunset Boulevard, West Hollywood, CA 90046 PHONE: 323-874-0377 RESERVATIONS: Might be an idea during mealtimes GENERAL LOCATION: On the south side of Sunset, just west of the intersection of Sunset and Fairfax HOURS: M-F: 7-4; SS: 8-4 DELIVERY SERVICE: Nah WEBSITE: http://www.thegriddlecafÉ AMBIANCE: First: if you come in early (8 AM-9 AM), *wear a sweater*! It's COLD! They told me they have to do it that way because of the hot weather: get the place cooled down as a protection against the rest of the day. It's seriously cold: your hotcakes will NOT remain hot. If you come in later, there's a mob. They're waiting outside. It's a wildly popular place (as of this writing). NOISE FACTOR: Totally unacceptable: hard surfaces: cement floors, metal, glass, brick walls. The kitchen is noisy: you can hear the assaultive bang of steel pans clashing on steel, the laserbeam clatter of porcelainware and glassware crashing together. And when it starts getting crowded (which it will), the noise is even worse. Ê* If you don't like noise, don't go there.* It's dim in there, too. You expect a breakfast place to be nice and bright. This isn't. ÊAt the same time, it's a nice-looking joint, and each table comes with a humongous collection of condiments, including the leeringly lascivious Beaver Mustard (Sweet and Hot). ;-) Everybody's there: singles, families, all shapes, sizes, colors, persuasions. The regular breakfast denizens (and the waitresses) apparently know to wear sweaters or light jackets. FOOD: The food is definitely interesting (see the menu at http://www.thegriddlecafÉ ), and served in such Paul Bunyanesque portions that each serving will feed two, even three people. It's common to ask for a styrofoam box in which to take home the uneaten portion. So don't go there unless you're ready to eat like you haven't eaten in three days. The coffee is good: very intense flavor. Someone has definitely spent a lot of time creating original recipes in the pancake/egg department. The menu *shouts* the virtues of the food like a carnival barker. They could tone down the rhetoric a bit, methinks. VEGGIE FACTOR: You can stuff yourself with non-meat eats here. Health food it ain't. FOOD PRESENTATION: Straightforward. The pancakes cover the whole plate! Come to think of it, servings of everything we ordered covered their plates, right to the rim! DRINKS: The coffee is good as I said, comes brewed and served in a French press, with complimentary refills. There are also various teas and lattes, beers, juices, milk and sodas. SERVICE: It depends who's doing it. The guys I talked to were cheerful and friendly. The gals didn't seem that thrilled (but then I'm 71, fat and bald...they were much nicer to my son...) RED FLAG: DO *NOT* LOOK UP AT THE CEILING on pain of ruining your appetite. If you do, you will see AC ductwork, the top of which is SO FILTHY that you worry about the crap falling down into your food. It looks like it has NEVER been cleaned, not since the same floor space was used for the long-gone Quigley's Department Store. Frankly, this should be reported to the Health Department. PRICE RANGE: A bit pricey, but then you're getting portions that make supersized look like samples. Count on $15-20 for a full-course meal. PAYMENT: Cash, CC PARKING SITUATION: There's a big parking lot in the rear that serves the cafe, the Rite-Aid on the corner, and another one or two stores. Otherwise it's street parking where you must read the signs.

Summary: "Griddle Cafe - Home of Pancakes On Steroids" I honestly couldn't give the slightest shit that I paid $10 for a mere stack of pancakes. ÊThat was by far the best near-death experience I've had since the time I almost became radioactive. ÊIf only this place were open 24/7!! I came here with a friend a few months back. ÊI had the Saturday Morning Fever (kahlua + baileys + buttermilk batter) and she had the Eyes Wide Open (consists of chocolate chips + a shot of espresso + buttermilk batter). ÊThese pancakes were GINORMOUS! ÊThey were larger than my ass! ÊEach one was about 1 cm thick, and I of all people couldn't even finish half my stack. ÊSo ashamed!!! When I finally threw int he towel and got a box to take my leftovers home, it seriously felt like I was carrying a small child in a styrofoam to go box.....not that I could accurately make such a metaphor as I have never kidnapped..... Did I mention that the caramelized bananas were very tasty? ÊNo? ÊWell, just so you know, they are! Only downside is they close around 4 p.m. so get here early because it gets really crowded. ÊIn fact, you may want to consider camping out. ÊI know I will so I can try the famous Peanut Bubba French Toast.

The most amazing breakfast I've ever had. Ever. Started with a new yorker running around outside calling out people's names. Don't be deterred by the long list or the new yorker. He's super friendly. And the list disappears quite quickly. Ordered the some like it hot omelet, avocado, hot sauce, chicken sausage, eggs. Delicious. REALLY DELICIOUS. Best friend ordered the banana pancakes. Equally incredible. Spent the morning watching the SC game (from two weekends ago...NOT TODAY'S EPIC FAILURE) eating breakfast. The waiter was super nice, (pretty cute) and of course, an SC fan, so I loved him. Consumed the freshest orange juice you could find this far away from Florida. Completely unpretentious, total diner style. Sat at the communal table near the kitchen.

GIANT PANCAKES! If I could increase the font +72 times, you might understand better. Don't be macho. You'll only eat one. I tried all 3, and got through all three, but only if you count cutting down through 1/3 of each in the stack. Which I will. The sweet pancakes (with butterscotch, etc) were teeth-hurtingly sweet and not for me, but I had the all blueberry ones. They were AWESOME (+72 font sizes). Also, I loved the french press coffee. Which I wouldn't share (don't pay attention to the fact that my compatriot doesn't drink coffee): thus I also drank all that by myself. We waited about 15-20 min outside for a table, hovering over others. The wait was worth it. We got a little table outside and talked to our friendly table neighbors about their food and ours, and had a generally nice time. My only minor complaint was that the street seating occasionally smelled of truck exhaust. But the coffee was strong enough to generally mask it/make me forget my woes.

There are a few things I really liked about this joint. 1. If you order coffee you get your very own French press (or if you are with multiple coffee drinkers..you share..)..point is..French Press action is HOT and the coffee is ever so yum 2. Great prices considering you will have left overs unless you have an impressive appetite..if this is the case..you will leave extremely satisfied. 3. PUMPKIN PANCAKES! Served with extra sweetened and spiced pumpkin filling fun...and whipped cream...and for me...a doggy bag.. Everything was delicious a group of us 4 picked at each others eats and we were happy to do so. Their French Toasts looked INSANE, their Huevos Rancheros sounded phenomenal..who the hell am I kidding? I wanted to walk around to everyones table and ask if I could take a bite everything sounded like it pretty much had to be a winner. Oh, and there was a super happenin back room that I guess either you have to be friends with them, paparazzi fodder, or a large group to utilize....and almost everyone was sporting that "Real LA" look that kinda weird fake hipster heroin rock deal and no one made eye contact.

ÊBut in any case, I have to admit, the wait is worth it for The Griddle. It's LA Hollywood at its best. ÊTry the Banana pancakes. They are large enough to feed 2-3 people and are absolutely awesome. The coffee is great too. They present it to you in a french press. ÊOther standard food there is pretty good as well. I have been told they have good chili but who knows. Ê Keep your eyes open for celebs. I got to sit next to Dawson aka (James Van Derbeek) and he's old looking now. No longer the little boy that took his canoe out to go have "sleep overs" with Joey. If he did that now, it might be a case of breaking and entering.

I had to check it out due to the reviews I saw on here, went on afternoon with my buddy Blair who was visiting from Dallas. WOW! They aren't kidding when they say the pancakes are huge, I was only able to eat 1/4 of it and boxed up the rest. I ordered the Golden Ticket which was good but I will try something else next time. The service was good and the atmosphere was fun, I'll be back.

This culinary tour of LA is turning out pretty well. I happened to be wearing all black and was able to borrow my buddy's new beemer to drive up Sunset for this early (by LA standards) 9AM business meeting in Hollywood (where dreams are made) The pancakes are as big as my dome (7 1/4 hat size) and the banana rama pancakes might change your life. I am beginning to become a big fan of restaruants that leave water or coffee at the table for you to disperse at your leisure. It saves you and the staff time; a win win that never gets old. The coffee is strong and left at the table in a mini french press so you are good to go as you refuel. I'm on board in a big way and will be doing breakfast here pretty much whenever I am in town from now on....

Want to satiate your sweet tooth and shopping needs? Easy. Just come here! Griddle Cafe is located on the Sunset strip, very close to all the cute boutiques on Melrose. After waiting outside for a good 30 minutes, my friend and I got seated by the bar, which looked like a shabu shabu bar...which we found kind of strange. ;) We ordered our first mimosas, which I did not know was champagne and orange. I just pointed at my neighbor's orange juice, and that was what I got. It was yummilicious! No regrets there! I ordered "Addicted to Noisella" Stuffed French Toast and asked them to top it with strawberries. It is pretty much a french toast spreaded with Nutella, powdered sugar, whipped cream, and strawberries. It was yummilicious! But my body can only handle so much sweetness, so I ordered a side of eggs to balance it out. My friend ordered the "Strawberries and Cream" Waffle, which is a one inch thick waffle topped with whipped cream and a mountain of strawberries. It was good, but honestly, I would rather have the waffles at Roscoes. So dock one star because I love waffles. Supposedly, many stars come here, but I don't think I saw any that morning. Dock one star because the place is super busy, so our waiter was not as attentive as he should be.

There's too much of a good thing happening here!!! That's my issue with the Griddle. They make me crave them, day and night. The cheesecake french toast, and the pumpkin pancakes, eggs benedict with potato skins...it's all too amazingly powerful and rich and worth every penny spent. Whenever I go with my girlfriend, we have to order 3 or 4 different items to split between us. We're not girthy girls, we just LOVE the sweet griddle food! Even though this place is filled to the brim (chaotic at times) with regulars, celebrities, and HUNGRY grouchy people, wait it out. Don't be disuaded by the long lines and big crowd. It tastes as good as people say. Be sure to get some "to go", there are lots of people on the street asking for spare food. Be generous, share the griddle goods!

The Griddle makes it worth getting up in the morning : ) This place tops ALL breakfast joints, hands down. We came here a year ago and cant stop telling people about it. We tried coming back here last month to bring the family on labor day morning (HAA! yeah... what were we thinking?! ...2 hour wait lol). ÊBut its ok, it just confirms how flippin awesome the place is. Its not your average breakfast place though. The breakfasts all have 'creative' ingredients and the portions are massive. Order to spilt! SO anyway, came here last week with the outta-towners to (pretty much) show off how we do breakfast @ the griddle : ) ÊWe got: ---- the 'Hear me roar' pancakes (strawberries & frosted flakes in the mix!) ---- Êthe 'Tis the season Holy moly' pancakes (pumpkin & whole wheat batter... which was actually amazing!) ----the Nutella french toast (pretty much chocolate heaven) ----and the Pomodoro omelet (with cheese, garlic, tomatoes..oh man... so amazing). Also, we all had about 4 cups ea. of the yummiest french press coffee on our table... it was so delicious. Oh and our waiter was awesome. Very cool guy, accommodating and overall fantastic customer service.

Beware of eating at the Griddle. Why, you may ask??? Because after you have any of the pancakes here, any other pancakes you have will taste like garbage. Yup, that's how good the pancakes are. The pancakes come stuffed with just about anything you can think of, possibly even crack, since they can be so addicting. The other awesome thing about the Griddle is that they can care less about your health and life, considering Êthat eating these pancakes gets you closer to diabetes after each bite. This is without a doubt, one of the best, most delicious, slow deaths you can have. I've probably tried at least half of the pancakes on the menu, and have yet to be disappointed. Banana nana, Scotch on the Rocks, Golden Ticket, and Teacher's Pet are some of my usual picks. And not that everyone else providing reviews hasn't already mentioned it, but the pancakes GINOurmous! So make sure you order a full stack on your first visit. You won't regret it.. The reason for the four stars is due to the MINIMUM 35 minute wait, the small tables and bumping elbows if you sit in the isle, and the occasional bitter server that is hating life because he just can't get that part in a Hollywood movie. Otherwise, staff is mad cool and attentive, despite how busy they are. And asides from the pancakes, waffles and french toast, I have really been too impressed with their other breakfast or lunch plates. For those who are easily star struck, it's pretty common to catch a celebrity gorging on pancakes, looking hungover as hell (I won't throw any names out)... Overall, I can't imagine having a better pancake than anything the Griddle can throw at me. This is definitely a must for your Ê"before I die" to-do list. Actually, going here will actually require you to get things done on that list much quicker, so keep that in mind.

Number 1 : The male waiter that works on Sunday mornings at the island dining area, is so pretty! He is so handsome, I can eat my food while staring at him. I've been here twice and during these two visits I've tasted the cobb omelette, red velvet pancake, the nuttella french toast, and the hot chocolate. The omelette was average, nothing to boast about. Between the eggs, lies chicken, bacon, and swiss cheese. The chicken was dry and flavorless, the bacon was very thick and sweet. The omelette came with griddled potatoes, which was also flavorless and dry. As for the red velvet pancake, it was decent. The cream cheese is very sweet. The pancake itself is nice and moist, but there's something in the batter that makes this pancake very spongey, like there's an elastic taste to it. The nutella french toast was good, they do not skimp on the nuttella. The only thing i don't like about this is, out order probably was sitting too long on the counter. By the time it came out most of the whipped cream melted... made the french toast looked very unappealing. As for price range it's between $11- $13. So would I come back? I think so, as long as the hot waiter keeps working there!

YUM! It almost seems unfair to review restaurants in LA as a person who lives in Boston because our little city just can't come close to comparing to the amazing selection of LA restaurants- especially for breakfast food. Of the many excellent breakfast haunts in LA, The Griddle Cafe is one not to miss. ÊI shared a breakfast burrito and whole grain pancakes with fruit and both were sooo good! My gf had some peanut butter chocolate waffle concotion which made me swoon. The atmosphere is also very cool but again so much in LA seems so much cooler then anything in Boston.

I took off a star because I don't like to wait. Even if it is for a droolingly delicious breakfast packing every amazing ingredient. I'd eat here more often if not for the issue of timing. ÊIt's in my neighborhood. ÊI do sometimes bring out of town guests. ÊYou know how mere proximity to the Director's Guild gets foreigners excited. Sadly, after a film screening, when you would actually like the Griddle to be open for that wonderful French press coffee and a huge sharable dessert, they are closed. ÊWe have to get in the car and drive to Sunset Plaza, or Cheebo, because Bean & Leaf is already out of any decent pastries at that hour, when we should just be able to stroll next door to the Griddle. ÊNow I'm getting all riled up .. Êand I may deduct another star, but I'm a nice person, so I'm not going to do that.

I really liked this place. We arrived with a big group and one of our friends was not feeling well. The waiter was so accomodating and asked us if he can get her gingerale while we waited. He even brought her bread to get something in her tummy. Then he hussled to get us a table asap so she can sit down. The service was amazing for such a busy place. When we got the food, it was like the extra icing on the cake. Everything was so good. My fav was the banana pancakes!!! be careful though, the servings are HUGE! if we weren't there with a friend who has been there before, we would have totally over ordered! we orderd the appl french toast, the chocolate pancakes, the eggs benedict, the chicken omlett and about 5 other dishes, all of which were yummy!!

There's a reason this place has an hour long wait by 9am every Saturday - it's just THAT GOOD. ÊNow, obviously, I recommend trying it out on a morning when you've been an early riser so you can beat the crowd and avoid the wait (you should be fine before 9am), but even if you can't do that - you need to try this place for breakfast. The real treat at the Griddle is how humongous they make absolutely everything. ÊAn order of pancakes comes out 3 thick, covering an entire plate and looking almost like a birthday cake. ÊWhen I get the pancakes, I can share them with my husband and still bring home 3/4 to munch on the rest of the weekend. My absolute favorite meal here is the eggs benedict. ÊThis meal is served with 4 fried potato skins, covered with a plate-sized slab of ham (I'm surprised pigs even come this big). ÊThen it's topped off with the eggs benedict and a pool of creamy hollandaise sauce. ÊThis is so amazing, I've actually come close to finishing it in one sitting before. ÊGranted, I hadn't eaten in practically a week, but still. Another favorite is the Caballero breakfast, which is a breakfast burrito with chicken chorizo. ÊIt's super spicy (and of course, huge), and served with avocado on top and dirty chips on the side. When I'm going for something sweeter, I like the Banana Nana Pancakes, or the crunchy french toast. ÊI hadn't realized there was a way to make French toast even more delicious, but amazingly, the cooks here figured out a way. Ê Every time I have family or friends visit from out of town, I take them here. ÊWhen I brought my sister and her roommate, they were still talking about it months later.

I have to go back and try more of the menu items before I can comfortably give Griddle Cafe five stars. The restaurant wasn't quite what I was expecting -- I thought it'd be big and modern-looking, but the inside was cramped and I found myself rubbing elbows with the people sitting on either side of us. I arrived late to a lunch date, but luckily they held a table for my friend and me. The service was friendly though inattentive (towards the end I asked if I could have a lemonade refill instead of a mocha and our server nodded absently but never returned), but the food came out quickly so I can't complain. I ordered a mocha latte and the Cobb omelette. The mocha came in a huge cup with a mound of whipped cream and chocolate sauce drizzled over it. It was good -- nothing special, but nothing awful. The omelette was delicious, but not perfect. Portions were generous, but the egg and the few pieces of chicken inside were very dry. Hash browns were burnt on top and dry underneath as well. The toast was good, though I wouldn't really call it "sour"dough. I tried a few bites of my friend's Nutella french toast and enjoyed it, but not to the point where I feel compelled to rave about it like other people seem to be doing. I plan on going back and trying more of their sweet dishes, though.

I love this place. ÊI literally walked by when I first moved here and have been a huge fan for years. The Griddle has the hardest working host in LA and the food is consistently good--and filling. ÊSome tips: 1 - go early or way late on the weekends. 1.5 hour waits are not unheard of after 10am 2 - they have a counter and if you are by yourself, that's the best way to go, often no wait. 3 - the coffee is OFF THE HOOK. ÊSuper strong, served in a great French Press...3 strengths...go with the medium and modulate thusly. 4 - the pancakes are awesome but I suggest only ordering a single stack..the normal order is 3 and it is FAR TOO MUCH FOOD for a normal human. ÊI go with the "Eyes Wide Open" -- chocolate chips and a shot of espresso IN the pankcake!--and a side of bacon. Êthe hashbrowns are good, but I like mine shredded and these are not shredded. 5 - if you are a single guy, go right now. Êif you are girl, ditto. Êthis is some fantastic people watching, people! Ê 6 - super fun after a long night out and a superbly great place to take guests.

Best place to eat breakfast in LA bar none! ÊSeriously. ÊI have not met it's equal -- well I have, but that place is in Mammoth, and beside the point. Ê Heather has been coming here for years, and turned me on to this place. ÊFirst thing I got here was the French Toast -- and I do have to say, first time here was skeptical. ÊThe menu doesn't read like I wanted it to, or to be more specific, like I was used to. ÊWhich was more of an IHOP, Denny's, Waffle House type of menu. ÊSo I went safe with the French Toast and some bacon. All I could say was: "Oh. My. God." Ê I didn't use syrup which I always do with French Toast (which is why the Stove in Mammoth was ridiculous! Again, beside the point). ÊI just devoured the bread and powdered sugar like a person who broke their jaw and had been on a pure diet for a month. ÊIt was amazing. ÊAnd I was hooked. Ê But then Heather sealed it with the pancake she got -- that's right it was just one! ÊWhich are as big -- wait, no -- they're bigger than your head. ÊThat's right, bigger than that noggin of yours. ÊAnd they try to give you three of them. ÊHeather just gets the one -- and she more often than not, does the Yellow Brick Road style. ÊAfter a bite of that I was sold and wanted to go no where else. After several visits I've hooked myself on the Poached y Papas Benedict. ÊMy sort of rich decadence: Ham, poached egg, on top of potato skins, then drenched in a wonderful Hollandaise sauce. ÊYou can add avocado, but I don't bother. ÊIt's fantastic as it is. ÊIn fact I want it now -- at 3a! I'm sure they have a great lunch too, I just never tried it. ÊOne day I will -- I keep promising myself too. ÊThe breakfast though; It's just too good! The place is rather tight quarters, but the atmosphere is awesome. ÊGood chance you'll see a celeb. ÊAnd they do have parking, it's in the back, and shared with the Rite Aid. Actually you know what -- don't go!!! ÊForget what I just said. ÊIt's a terrible, horrible place. ÊWorst place to eat breakfast ever! ÊIf you go you'll just make the wait that much longer, and I love my Griddle. ÊSo believe me when I say it's bad! Ê (sigh - I can't lie it's not!)

No matter what day or what time you go (unless it's about 45 min. before closing) you will have to wait. ÊBut it's worth the wait. ÊIf you can eat everything on your plate then I think you might be ready to battle competitive eater Takeru Kobayashi in a food eating contest. Nutella Pancakes are a PMS day favorite of mine!

The Griddle gets five stars because it is the home of the best bacon in LA. As a person that values good bacon, to find downright perfect bacon is an event worth celebrating. However, the thing that really sets The Griddle apart for me is the Strawberries & Cream Waffle. What a concoction. Bacon affinity aside, I'm not really a breakfast person, so for me to praise and crave a breakfast dish is quite the exception. The truly remarkable thing about this waffle is the brown sugar sour cream. So much more decadent than regular whipped cream, the flavor is something I've never seen anywhere else, almost a cheesecake tang with perfect sweetness that is utterly fucking inspired. Someone give me this recipe. And then strawberries, who doesn't like strawberries? What an absolutely perfect breakfast this is! Yes, eating at The Griddle has downsides: The parking is far from certain; the wait, especially on weekends, can be a torment. But for perfect bacon and brown sugar sour cream? Are there better reasons to suffer in this city?

I don't know what I expected, but I think I just expected more than I got. Look, it's all very tasty-looking. ÊI mean, how could it not be? ÊIt's fat, salt, sugar and candy, for crissakes. But here's the thing. ÊI like my food to be food. ÊNot dessert masquerading as food. The blueberry pancakes were delicious...as cake. ÊThey were cake. They weren't pancakes. ÊI cut out a wedge, and it would've been terrific...as a light cake. I had an egg and sausage dish and the sausage was seriously horrible. ÊIt tasted like 99c store hot dogs cut into pieces, and mixed up with some eggs. ÊMy colleague had a pesto scramble which she said was ok, and my other colleague had waffles. Ê I can't speak for their meal, but mine was AWFUL and bland. ÊI guess because I didn't order butterscotch smothered whipped cream choco-pancakes. I can put butterscotch whippedcream chocolate into a pancake and it'll be tasty. ÊIt's not exactly innovative or even hearty and satisfying. ÊBut to eff up scrambled eggs, spinach, tomato and sausage? ÊThat's sort of amazing. ÊThere's no excuse for starting off with crappy ingredients and fooling your customer with piles and piles of junk food. Ê I mean, yeah, this is America. ÊA place with gargantuan portions and full of empty-calorie HFCS-based products is going to succeed, of course. But it just won't be on my list of go-to brunch or lunch spots.

The best pancakes, hands down. I love breakfast. ÊThere, I said it. ÊPerhaps the one meal I like more is brunch, and this place is the best for both. ÊIt gets crowded but I have never waited longer than 10 minutes (group of 3 or 2). Of course they offer other foods, but the pancakes is the reason you should go. ÊI have a big stomach and tend to eat all my food because I have little self control if there is a good meal in front me. ÊThis is one of the only places where I cannot finish my food. ÊI never had leftover pancakes before in my life, but now I look forward to them as an added treat. The other food looks delicious. ÊA couple friends have gotten egg dishes and they tasted fine, but I'd feel wrong if I didn't get pancakes. And, on top of all that, the price is exceptional. ÊYou could spend the same amount on a much smaller and less delicious meal. ÊYou should go here. ÊYou won't regret it. (Also, there's a parking lot)

To be fair, I am writing this review to balance the "sexist" review I just wrote of Gulfstream Newport Beach. LOL! Every college town should have a Griddle Cafe. Popular breakfast spot. Young crowd. Cheap food. Large portions. Even larger menu. And for the ladies, an attractive male wait staff sporting single digit body fat percentages. I saw Ian Ziering here once and he was like...the 20th best looking guy in the joint. Not that I was counting. Basically, it has everything college guys on a budget need (minus the insecurity vis a vis the handsome wait staff). Don't be surprised if your babe sneaks a peak here and there.

The Griddle Cafe is like the antithesis of West Hollywood. ÊThe portions here... just...doesn't....quite make sense?? ÊAnd yet, we are compelled and drawn to the complex gluttony of carbohydrates. ÊMyself included. Ê I had yet another difficult option between savory and sweet.....savory or sweet... just when I thought I had settled on an omelet, I flipped the switch and was sold on the blueberry pancakes made with WHOLE wheat. ÊCome on now, I give myself credit for being semi-healthy. ÊI liked the pancakes just fine, my only critique is that the maple syrup was not sweet enough and the blueberry sour cream didn't really go well with the pancakes. When the plate came out, I nearly gasped... as much as I tried to inhale the damn thing, it was futile. ÊI managed to squeeze a quarter of the food into my stomach and then I gave up completely. ÊThe chips served with the tacos were toasty and seasoned well. ÊI'm going to have to try their delicious looking tacos next time to satiate the savory appetite. Ê The coffee, though bold & strong, was so-so. ÊIt was almost on the borderline of burnt tasting, which is never fun. Ê With over 700 reviews, I'm sure I don't have to tell you that this is the go-to place for breakfast & brunch. ÊMake sure you go with a big fun bunch and enjoy!

Strong delicious french pressed coffee. Be there early, we were there at 7:45AM on Sunday, doors opened at 8:00. Every table was taken by 8:30. The waiters and waitresses are hot, it's distracting in a good way. I wonder if it is because they are struggling actors? (The Guild of Directors is next door, and the Guild of Cinematographers is one block down the street). We had the Blueberry Pancakes, it is okay- with a interesting blueberry yogurt on top. It is bigger than your face... about a 8" in diameter, and three layers high. My friend only ate 1/4 of it. I ordered the Strawberry Cream waffle, it was so yummy and dreamy. Perfectly warm, crispy, fluffy, and I think even made of wheat or something whole and brown. The sweet cream was just right, and the berries fresh. This was also about 8" in diameter. My other friend had the french toast, the BIGGEST toast I have ever seen, practically falling off the platter. Very tasty- I was pleasantly surprised. Bring a light jacket as their AC is blasting even at 8 in the morning. They have outdoor seating and posh people take their dogs to breakfast. The inside is all brick with simple pictures, high ceilings, and friendly staff. A great place to bring visitors from outta town.

No wait time, cute cozy place....yeah yeah... the important piece: BEST French Toast ever ever ever like everyone else is saying. It was so good that we ordered another plate. And it was only about 10 bucks. I also had some Muscle Builder Eggs: egg whites, tomatoes, green onions, turkey sausage.... it was great too. But the french toast has me Praising God for bread.

After trying Cici's in Tarzana, I contemplated bringing Griddle Cafe down a notch in my book. Came in on a weekday morning, knowing the wait wouldn't be crazy and just as expected we were seated right away! Tony was our waiter, and he didn't smile much so I was hesitant to ask too much of him. First off, my bf had to make some calls for work. So Tony kept coming back and forth waiting to take our order. Then the bf's phone died, and he asked Tony if he could have it charged- which he did but didn't look happy about it. We placed our order and I warned him I had a weird request! He made a joke about it but didn't smile. Coool, he's just not a smiley person. I told him I had two orders to-go and if any sauces and toppings can be placed in separate containers. The to-go orders were to be taken on our flight back to SF that afternoon. Heffer of me, ha? Wellll, I swear it wasn't for me. He, not smiling, was happy to the all of that for me! So I was able to enjoy my breakfast of the "Peanut Bubba" Crunchy French Toast. I've never had anything like it before, and the first couple bites were sweet and fulfilling. But after one thick slice, it gets a little too rich and boring. So I tried to force my other slice on the bf, who was busy with his Muscle Bound egg scramble! Thanks, Tony for another good trip to the Griddle Cafe!!!

Thought I'd write a review before the Griddle's syrupy sweetness left my mouth. ÊI went here for lunch today with a bunch of friends. ÊWe had reservations, but still ended up waiting about 15 minutes. We ordered 5 dishes, which was plenty for the 8 of us. ÊHalf guys & half girls! ÊThe place was completely packed, probably because it was Saturday. ÊI didn't drive here, although my friends who did parked in a nearby shopping plaza. ÊIt's the one with the Trader Joe's. The first dish to arrive was the Nutella French toast. ÊIt came with whipped topping and drizzles of chocolate. ÊOh so delicious! Ê The consistency was perfect. ÊIt was very sweet, as expected, and no overwhelming eggy flavor. ÊWe devoured it quickly. The next one was a chicken salad. ÊAlso delicious. ÊChicken was tender, the dressing was good, but the part I liked the most were the sweet red bell peppers. ÊThe tortilla chips were freshly made, still warm, and had an awesome crunchy texture that was just right. ÊNot too hard and not too mushy. The strawberry Belgian waffle was okay. ÊThis one was just regular sized. ÊI didn't see what the hype was. ÊIt was tasty, but not spectacular. ÊPerhaps our taste buds were numbed by the Nutella? ;) Someone ordered a breakfast burrito stuffed with scrambled eggs, potatoes, and sausage. ÊIt was okay, but a bit bland. ÊIngredients were fresh and the consistency was good. ÊProbably better with a splash of Tabasco sauce. Then, we got 3 large blueberry pancakes with blueberry yogurt on top and dusted with powdered sugar. ÊThat was delicious and generously loaded with blueberries. ÊIt was cooked just right. ÊTender and even more yummy with maple syrup. ÊThe guys were complaining that it was too sweet, even without the syrup. If I was in the West Hollywood area, I'd go back to this place. ÊIt took a while to get seated and the food took a while to get to our table, but it was hearty and good. ÊPrices were also very fair. ÊWe paid $9/head even with tips & tax factored in. ÊNobody ordered a drink. ÊAlso note, it is very loud inside. ÊWe were all practically yelling at each other and it was still hard to hear people at the same table.

IMPORTANT TIP: YOU CAN ORDER ONE PANCAKE INSTEAD OF A SHORT STACK. Just because some of the reviews complained about getting three. Ê So with this many reviews, I can't add too much. ÊThe "Too much to love" pumpkin pancakes filled with caramel and candied walnuts, topped with whipped cream and more canned pumpkin = AMAZING. ÊThe best pancakes I have ever had: light, fluffy, not too thin nor too thick, and with a pleasant pumpkin-pancake batter ratio. ÊThe caramel and walnuts added a lot to the experience (I always want a texture contrast with pancakes, and the walnuts were perfect for that). ÊBluesberry were okay, but after eating the pumpkin there was no comparison. Breakfast tacos were also great! ÊSo was the "some like it hot" egg scramble with peppers, chicken sausage, and hot sauce, served with chips. ÊGood savory starts for our sweet finishes. Finally, individual french press coffee = perfect way to start the morning. Ê$5 for a medium sized OJ = skip it. Griddle Cafe = Delightful! ÊNo matter what you order, you'll probably be happy. ÊDon't order sweet if you don't like sweet, because it's sweet (but not cloyingly so). ÊPrepare to wait; this place is packed, and for good reason.

The Griddle Cafe is truly an amazing breakfast experience. ÊThe service is excellent and the wait staff is very friendly. ÊI went here with my mom and sister after getting out of knee surgery early in the morning. ÊSince the doctor told me not to eat beforehand, I left the hospital famished and needed to eat. ÊThis place definitely fit the bill and I earned every calorie! Fresh French press coffee, thick slices of heavy French toast, fluffy and delicious waffles covered in decadent strawberry cream cheese and fresh strawberries. ÊFluffy pancakes fit for a lumberjack. ÊYou definitely won't leave this place hungry. The pictures offered here are probably the best review for anyone interested. ÊThey are as good as they look. The service is excellent. There is usually a crowd waiting for one of the few tables or seats at the counter. ÊI came in with crutches and as soon as the host saw me, he was quick to offer a seat for me, asking those already sitting down to move. ÊHe then seemed to bump me and my family up the line so we may be seated and served more quickly. ÊThanks for taking pity on me! ÊThe food really made my post-surgery recovery that much better. ÊMmm... Everyone should come visit Griddle Cafe for some quality breakfast goodness!

Ahhhh, ever ate sooo much that you had to unbutton your pants to bring back circulation around your tummy area?!?! ÊOh boy, that was my top priority after finishing my huge-ass meal!! Literally, I started to walk like Quasimoto from the Hunchback of Notre Dame. ÊI was sooo full to even stand up straight. ÊThis place is wonderful. ÊI was not surprise that the wait was 40 minutes for a table of two, considering this place is one of LA's hotspot. ÊWe were seated at the center counter where we could see the cooks do their magic. ÊPretty awesome! Ê First thing I ordered was the cappacino for $3.50. ÊYumm, pretty good! ÊA little bitter at first but it's nothing 4 packs of brown sugar can't handle. =) ÊI also ordered the "Gone Shrimping" (scrambled egg whites w/ shrimp, scallions, tomatoes, and capers over pesto--and garlic toast, of course)!!! ÊI've never had anything like that in my eggs before... I loved it! ÊSooo good, I cleaned out my plate--plus it wouldn't be the same if I had boxed it for later. ÊMy meal cost $11.95. ÊNot too bad for something huge and delicious!! ÊI swear, this place is definitely generous when it comes to portions. ÊEvery meal I saw was GINORMOUS--enough to feed a family of 3 or 4!! Ê Their service is awesome..very friendly even in a hectic environment!! ÊThe customers here are friendly too.. I got complimented on my hair while waiting in line for the bathroom. ÊI just love that!! ÊHAHA =) I WOULD DEFINITELY COME BACK HERE AGAIN!!!!

I HATE BREAKFAST FOOD BUT THIS PLACE IS AN EXCEPTION! Pros: -Their pancakes are huge! 2.5 pancakes= 1 of their pancakes. -They have so many different kinds of french toast and pancakes. I had the Nutella (can't spell it) chocolate french toast and it was like eating dessert for breakfast! It was dense, crispy on the outside and soft of the inside... chewy too! -The egg & potato benedict is great also. Really heavy after sharing the french toast. It was yum! Potatoes were crispy and seasoned topped with thick ham, eggs and sauce! -Great breakfast food. I'll be coming back for sure. Cons: -Make sure you read the street signs before you park. -French toast (no sides) + Benedict (no sides)= $27 (excluding tip). It's a bit pricey for breakfast considering we only got water but it's worth it. Ê -There is no such thing as personal space here. It was busy and we all practically sat next to one another.

As if this place needs any more reviews but our meal was a perfect blend of breakfast and dessert and thank goodness I ate a tiny breakfast beforehand. ÊDefinitely go with more people so you can do a family style bc the pancakes themselves are dinner plate sized. ÊWe tried the Saturday morning fever (kahlua/bailey's), Apple cobbler french toast and Baked omelette eggs. ÊThey were all reallly good and you could definitely taste the alcohol in the pancakes. ÊMy favorite was the french toast though -- thick slices of challah bread dipped in corn flakes, dusted with powdered sugar then smeared with sugary apple chunks. ÊWith all the sweetness, you have to balance it out with some savory eggs filled with griddle potatoes and cheddar. Ê 4 girls, $35 bill--we were happy, stuffed AND took home 1.5 pancakes for later. ÊService was slow but the place was packed midweek at 2 pm.

Haven't they made enough money by now to move to a bigger place? I love the food here, but hate waiting for an hour! To make things, street parking around this area has one hour limit. Totally worth the wait though. Although their pancakes are delicious (I love their blueberry pancake), that's just too much carbs for me so I've been trying their egg dishes. ÊThe best I've had thus far is Poached y Papas Benedict. The hollandaise sauce is out of this world! Chicago charlie's scramble with italian sausage wasn't as impressive. Oh, we also got two for one mimosa for $8. It's per person though, so you can't share (they bring out one glass, then bring out the second glass when you're done with the first glass). Maybe I'll try coming here earlier to minimize the wait.

We came here after a hike at Runyon Canyon. It was much deserved. We chose to sit outside since we were really not dressed casually enough to fit in. The wait wasn't too bad, seems like after 11am it gets a bit crowded. I had the Caballero burrito with seasoned tortilla chips and my friend had the red velvet pancake. The burrito was great! It was everything I wanted. Eggs, potatoes, and chorizo, topped with fresh salsa, avocado, and sour cream. Man, it was delicious. Definitely, a MAN breakfast. I'm not ashamed. I ate the whole thing. It was very flavorful, tasty, and 10x better with some tapatio. The only thing that I would have liked is more of the fresh salsa. The tortilla chips were good but I need some salsa with those chips. This burrito will fill you up. For sure. I tried the red velvet pancake. IT WAS YUMMY! HUGE of course...known for their large ass pancakes. Apparently, the red velvet pancake is the smallest one they make...because all the other pancakes come with 3 flaps. The red velvet pancake comes with a huge plate of the cake, topped with cream cheese topping, and sprinkled heavily with cocoa powder (I believe). It was really good, I had a savory and sweet combo. Some of the Caballero and some of the red velvet pancake. The pancake was not dry. It was sweet after eating it for a while...but absolutely no complaints about it. Here...you definitely go big or GO HOME! -Give it a try! P.S.: You can park behind rite aid (I think) (you can get validation) orrr street parking (just make sure you read the sign). P.S.S: Next time I'm gonna get the Poached y Papas Benedict. I saw the plate and was like DAMMMMN I WANT THAT!

I came here with my buddies a few weeks ago and when we all started checking out the menu were basically all said, "Dam this place is over-priced!" I thought it was crazy to charge between $10-$15 for a plate of pancakes. We all ordered our own plate of pancakes. When our plates got dropped off, we realized why they were so expensive. Between the four of us, we literally could have ordered one plate of pancakes and all gotten more than enough to eat. These pancakes are HUGE! Not to mention delicious. Like I said, when I saw the prices I was thinking negative Yelp review, but after having the delicious pancakes and realizing why their prices were so high, I definitely recommend Griddle Cafe to anyone looking for some bomb pancakes. I promise you that one plate of pancakes will easily feed 3 people.

I came here with my room mates on a bright and sunny morning in January. We were all ready to grab a huge carb fix before a day of shopping, and by the time we finished our meal, I was so happy I wore a loose dress that day. Parking is a bit tricky, but I parked on the residential street past Griddle Cafe when you're driving west on Sunset. I believe there was a small fee, but come on, you're in LA. Nothing is free except sunshine, okay? Our wait was surprisingly short. 15 minutes tops, but I must say that there was a huge line on our way out. The four of us decided to split the BLUESberry pancakes, Apple Cobbler french toast, and one of the scrambles (I forgot the name). They're not kidding when they say that these portions are HUGE. The BLUESberry pancakes were not too sweet, and the blueberry sour cream was an interesting topping. I'm not that much of a fan of the sour/sweet combo. The apple cobbler french toast was amazing (but what isn't amazing when it's topped with powdered sugar?). The toast had a nice crisp to it, and the apples in the topping tasted somewhat fresh for them to be smothered in sugary goodness. The scramble was chock-full of onions, peppers, and sausage. Between the four of us, it was definitely an uphill battle to finish our respective portions of the meal. Only one of us actually finished her entire meal (it just so happened that she was the tiniest girl there). Overall, Griddle Cafe is a charming place for a nice breakfast/brunch, but I would suggest an after meal power stroll through Beverly Center or The Grove to burn off your 1000 calorie breakfast!

Pancakes! Pancakes! Pancakes! Pancakes! Sorry. I had to get that out of my system. Boy do I love pancakes, especially the ones at Griddle Cafe. Food: For about $8 you can get a trio of pancakes that are 4-5 inches high. They're so light and fluffy that they're unmistakably products of the old pour and flip, but their hugeness is deceptive. If you don't look closely enough you might mistake a stack for a true cake. Several pancake toppings and batter mix-ins stand out on the menu including oreos, berries (http://www.yelp.com/biz_É), Kahlua (http://www.yelp.com/biz_É), and espresso. The salad (http://www.yelp.com/biz_É) is also yumtastic and comes in huge portions. They also serve lunch items like burgers (http://www.yelp.com/biz_É). Service: Pretty slow which isn't surprising given the crowds, but attentive to your needs. Atmosphere: If you have 5 people or more you might get a seat in the back rooms (http://www.yelp.com/biz_É) which are decorated in a faux urban decay paint job complete with plush couch. I was kind of grossed out by the couch; it's just asking to become a syrup sponge. Also, it was freakishly cold in that room and there was a door to an office on the side which employees kept trying to open unsuccessfully. Together, this gave me the impression I was in a meat locker, potentially holding stone cold dead mafia victims behind that door. It was awesome. Parking: There's a lot right behind the restaurant. You enter it on Fairfax. Synopsis: I already want to go back, but parking and the wait here sort of sucks. Pancakes!

My favorite restaurant! YOU MUST TRY IT. PROS: 1. BIG portions 2. GOOD prices 3. Best french toast (fluffly, moist, thick challa bread) 4. Best pancakes (humungus and various flavors) 5. Best sandwhiches (thick soft challa bread! The chicken sandwhich is great) 6. Best coffee- French pressed Coffee- unlimited refills! CONS: 1. Some pancakes are TOO sweet. Omelettes aren't that special :/ Orange juice is too small. 2. Dangerous place for healthy eaters 3. Parking can suck- go on the residential streets closeby, but read the signs. Or try the back lot shared with CVS/some other big store. 4. Usually long lines

Oh french toast...you little bitch. You had me at "Hello." The Griddle Cafe is a bustling, little joint off Sunset that will now forever put any other breakfast I eat, to shame. The place is small, but I liked the feel of it. It's reminiscent of an old time short-order diner, and the eye candy makes for good people watching. The menu gave so many appetizing options, but I ultimately settled on the Cobb omelet with grilled chicken breast, blue cheese, green onions and fresh avocado on top. This came with a side of potatoes and your choice of bread. My group decided to share an order of Mom's French Toast, and I am so glad we did. My omelet was probably one of the most flavorful and fluffy omelets I've ever had, and the potatoes and wheat toast made my belly frown turn upside down! I'm hoping to try and recreate this omelet at home, but I almost don't want to ruin the memory of something soooo good. Then came the object of my hearts desire. I absolutely love french toast and hate when I order it somewhere and they give me floppy toast with almost no egg batter to speak of. Well, the Griddle has gotten their recipe so right, I'd venture to say its the best french toast I will ever eat! The slices of bread were the size of the plate, perfectly griddle grilled to be evenly browned with a slight crisp to the edges. Sprinkled with powdered sugar and whipped butter melting on top, my heart skipped a beat. We didn't waste any time and dove into the toast, with moans and groans of utter taste happiness going around the table. I can't really remember what we talked about after this, or if we even talked. All I know is if I could have that french toast every day, I would be the happiest person on earth....I'd also weigh a ton, but who cares when you're that happy!!! I will be back to LA someday...and the Griddle and I shall meet again, and again, and again.

One of the best brunches I've ever had, and that's for sure! My friend and I split a half order of the Peanut Bubba Crunch French Toast - it was absolutely heavenly, and huge! Êthere was no way I could eat the whole thing, but it would've been a very enjoyable attempt.... We followed up by splitting a Cobb omelet, which was also fantastic - probably the best omelet I've ever had. ÊThey managed to make it soft and fluffy like scrambled eggs, not sort of hard and chewy like omelets can often be. ÊGreat, fresh fillings like grilled chicken and blue cheese. Ê If I lived here, I'd come here all thet ime - it's definitely worth the wait!

I'M IN LOVE WITH THE NUTELLA FRENCH TOAST!! I came here with a large group so we ordered two kinds of french toast, the whole wheat pancakes, and three egg scrambles. The egg scrambles were all very good but the portions for those are on the smaller side if you're sharing with a large group. But the portions of the french toast and pancake were plenty. It was even too much for our group of 10. Another major bonus: Our server was HOOOTTT! yummy. This is why I love how all the serves in LA are unknown actors.

Had this bookmarked for a while....MAN VS FOOD..... MAN VS FOOD!! Lol.... This is what comes to mind when I see the bigger than two heads sized pancakes, this is kinda like a novelty breakfast spot... I found the food very whimsical in a way, this is definitely not your typical everyday breakfast spot unless your are indeed a person who versus food, maybe a once a week spot, but if your weight conscious this isn't the place for you, unless you want a BIG ASS SALAD! Ok so the place was packed people outside waiting & looking hungrier than hungry, me and my friend waltz in and get two seats right at the bar... SCORE!!! Menu is extensive so you will most likely take at least up to 15 minutes to decide... more like twenty for me... So not knowing the food was made for Ogres & Giants me and my friend ordered way too much.. Ordered the blueberry pancakes with blueberry sour cream, & the Nutella stuffed french toast, forgot the actually name. so when they bring the pancake to the table me and my friend looked at each other try'd to hold back as much laughter as we could and took a BIG breath. Okay why THREE??? I mean there's homeless people starving ya know? Its utterly impossible two finish the pancakes, ridiculouslleeeey out of the question. You cant even see the plate, and as stated in other reviews you can dive in for about 10 minutes and not even scratch this thing! So onto the french toast two big ass slices of bread stuffed with nutella and chocolate topped with whipped cream. My friend didn't like this one, only because she said it was too sweet for breakfast, I on the other hand loved it and at that point a i got called out on a bet..... " I BET YOU CAN FINISH THAT... I DARE YOUR TO FINISH IT, ILL PAY FOR THE MEAL... dems was Êfightin words, so I went into Adam R. drive baby (throws shades on).... I posted pics of the carnage by stages lol. I technically didn't win because I left like a funky end of the bread boohoo big deal. Lets see you even eat half of that ginormous thing!! It was damn goooood though. Im gonna eat the whole plate of french toast everytime I come here Êwith the hopes of gettin my pic framed on the wall one day.

There is a variety of breakfast foods (pancakes, toast, eggs, etc.) The portions are big. I am not really a pancake type of person but the BLUESberry pancakes are absolutely delicious!!! I expected them to be too sweet but they were perfect. No syrup needed. The blueberry sour cream sauce on top was all right. My friends had the taco, eggs, and french toast which were far from bland. Prices are reasonable. About 10-12 bucks for a huge plate of food. I recommend sharing unless you plan to take it home. I also saw Anne Hathaway and Fred Durst here! :)

Yep, one star, here we go... We sat at a table underneath A/C piping, every so often water would drop off the pipe and on to the table, the food, and us. We placed the order, food did come quick, but the waiter forgot to bring my side with dish and while my food was in front of me he actually asked what I ordered...UM...'you just dropped it off and it's on the bill, bud' maybe he was brand new, seriously doubt it. We ordered the "Hear Me Roar Pancakes" and the "Chicago Charlie's Scramble" (to share) which was a slew of everything but the kitchen sink thrown in, I mean how can you get anything wrong at that point, and yet I feel they did. There was a long wait with an extremely rude host, he actually said "you sit here and you sit here." (This was the second wait. You actually wait outside first, they call your name and then you sit in a tiny space by the door for your table." Forgetful service; The waiter did not once come and ask how the food was, he actually only came to ask if we needed anything more and offered the bill. Poor seating; cafeteria style small tables for the plate size. No close parking expect to walk a distance. I don't plan on going back...it's pretty over-rated. I was really let down. Maybe someone can tell me what to order? The food we had..just wasn't up to the hype.

If you're looking for breakfast, look no further. Everything here looks great and the portions are enough to satisfy a lumberjack and his lover (yes, I'm assuming lumberjacks are all queer).

Saturday, 2 p.m. and the wait is still about 30 minutes, so ÊI wouldn't recommend trying to come here when you're starving, or you'll surely suffer. It's a pretty small place, not too many tables and it sounds like they're always slammed. ÊWe sat at the counter, which was fine for two. I had the Season of Love pancakes---pumpkin pancakes with caramel and crunchy bits. ÊI could have done with more caramel instead of the dollop of canned pumpkin on top, though. ÊOur waiter said that this was how Stevie Wonder ordered his pancakes here so they added it to the menu. I made it through about 1/4 of it and took like two pounds of it back in a doggy bag. ÊIt'll be my breakfast for the next few days....sure, they're soggy, but still good! Ê(Yeah, I'm pretty shameless when it comes to food...) Can't wait to come back and try the Nutella french toast.....and the "Peanut Bubba" french toast....and the "Devil's Food" chocolate pancakes....

I would NEVER expect this place to be as popular as it is. There is absolutely nothing too special about the griddle. This place needs some remodeling really bad. Our table was wobbly, chairs were thrashed, and the silverware seemed like it was from 1940. Sitting outside kind of sucks, the traffic is SUPER loud and all the tables are crammed really close to each other. People watching is always a plus though! Next time I want to try inside. SO, my first time here wasn't that great. The service was horrible. It took FOREVER for a waiter to take our order. Maybe if you sit inside they pay attention more? Anyways, I ordered 2 eggs, hash browns, toast, and a fruit cup. They forgot my toast and it took forever so my eggs got cold. The fruit cup was okay EXCEPT for the melon being SUPER unripe and tasting like shrimp. Ya, it was pretty bad. My friend got the Fiesta Scramble...I tried it and that was actually pretty good. Because of this, I will totally try coming here again. Too bad I'm not into pancakes, because I guess that's what this place is famous for. The memosa was amazing. Best OJ ever. I also had a bloody mary, which they make with soju, and that was pretty good also. My friend and I got there around 9am and there was a 10 min wait...when I drove by again at around 11:30am there were a bagillion people outside. So getting there super early on the weekend seems like a good idea. Sorry Griddle, you get 2 stars for now!

JC: Ê "You wanna do what? ÊServe me three humongoid pancakes (the size of a large plate) with sugar and whipped cream on top? ÊBut I hardly know you. ÊCan't we start slow? ÊYou know....be friends? ÊTaste each other a couple of times before we commit to anything? ÊI'm not the kind that goes 'all the way' so soon." Ê Ê GC: Ê"No worries mate! ÊI'll just serve you ONE humongoid pancake. ÊNo pressure. ÊWe'll wait for as long as you need." JC: Ê"Oh thank you The Griddle Cafe. ÊYou won't regret it. ÊOne day when I turn into a 300lb man....I'll devour your trio of love like nobody's business!" Folks, there's not much to say here. ÊIf you love pancakes, this is your paradise. ÊI haven't tried anything else on the menu, so I can't advise you on their other goods. But the panclogs? Ohhhh.....unbelievable! Ê Wanna know what I order? ÊIt's always the same. ÊExcept for that one time I was feeling adventurous...nay, adulterous (sorry BanaNana!) and tried the pumpkin kind. ÊI order the aforementioned BanaNana...which (humor me for a second) I believe should be marketed and sold as an anti-depressant. Ê Prozac? ÊWho needs it! ÊIt is humanly impossible to be down in the dumps when you have a piece of this concoction in your mouth. ÊImpossible I tell you! Ê Now I must warn you....you HAVE to specify to the waiter that you want only ONE, or you will be served an inordinate amount of fluffy goodness (sounds like sheer torture doesn't it?). ÊUnless of course you WANT that amount. ÊIn which case, by all means, order the three. ÊBut I will tell you, I have a pretty impressive appetite (for a girl...OR a guy) and I am happy (in a full kind of way) with just the one. Anyhoo, AS I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted by deviant thoughts of banana-y ecstasy....I order the BN. Thick soft dough, filled with large generous chunks of ooey gooey caramelized banana. ÊYou are instantly transported to a utopia of flavor. ÊFor a moment, the outside world turns mute. ÊCars honking on Sunset? ÊCan't hear 'em. Concerns over this month's rent? ÊDon't have any. Ê I have them hold the sugar (because that's just too much sweetness in my book) and hold the whipped cream (same reason) and ask them to put a single creamy over-easy egg on top. ÊI like to break the yolk and have it cascade over my pancake like warm golden lava. ÊMMmmm... A couple of non-food points I should make. ÊCome with good parking Karma, as it is packed in the mornings. ÊUsually a couple of rounds is enough to secure a spot. ÊAlso, come with a healthy dose of patience. ÊIt's not fast-food. ÊYou'll have to wait (sometimes a good 45 min.) for your meal. ÊBut mark my words....it is worth it! ÊBring a friend and make it "catch-up" time. Ê Other than that, you are good to go! ÊYou'll thank me when you're driving home with a smile and a belly full of happiness. ÊAnd by "thank"....I mean pay. ÊWhachu think? ÊI give out happiness for FREE???!!! ÊSheeeeet. *Please send check or money-order payable to... WHAT?!!! ÊOk fine. ÊIt's free. Ê You're WELCOME!!!

I bought a Los Angeles guide book a long long time ago. ÊOne of the highly recommended restaurants in the guide book is Griddle Cafe. ÊThe restaurant is right next to Directors Guild of America. ÊThe couple times I went to DGA for film screenings, I always saw Griddle Cafe full of people waiting outside. ÊAfter many years of wanting to try this breakfast joint, I finally came on a Sunday morning. The place was packed as we expected. ÊBut the host told us it's only a 20 minutes wait. ÊWe waited patiently on the sidewalk with 30 other people. We got a table in about 20 minutes just as the host said. ÊThe little restaurant was full of hungry people. ÊThe aroma of coffee and pancakes made us really hungry. We all ordered coffee. ÊThe coffee here was a bit more expensive, but it was served in a French press with unlimited refill. ÊThis is what they said on the menu: "Micro roasted coffee served in a French press, which ensures the freshest cup of coffee. ÊThe French press captures more of the coffee's flavor that is otherwise trapped in a traditional drip brew machine's paper filters." ÊIt's true! ÊThe french pressed coffee was so good that I think I had 3 cups. ÊI'm gonna go get a French press now. HP can eat a lot. ÊSo he ordered the giant Caballero. ÊBut even him couldn't finish it. ÊScrambled eggs, cheddar, potatoes, green chiles, and chicken chorizo rolled inside a giant flour tortilla! ÊTopped with sour cream, avocado, and salsa. ÊServed with hot tortilla chips.... This one is HUGE! BF and I shared a Cobb Omelette. ÊThis thing was also huge. ÊTwo of us didn't finish it, either. ÊStuffed with grilled chicken breast, bacon, green onions, and crumbled blue cheese. ÊTopped with black olives and sliced avocado. ÊDelicious! ÊOur omelette came with buttered toast. ÊI love eating my toast with the soft omelette on it. Of course we ordered their famous Griddle pancake. ÊThere were like 50 choices on the menu. ÊThey all sounded so good. ÊIt was kinda hard to make a decision. ÊWe finally decided to get the Eyes Wide Open. Ê"Wake up with a shot of espresso and semi sweet chocolate chips folded into our buttermilk recipe! ÊSprinkled with powdered sugar." ÊWhen the pancakes was brought to the table, first my mouth dropped open with surprise. ÊIt was gigantic! ÊI took a bite. ÊThen I had a grin on my face the whole time. ÊOMG this pancake was yum-o. ÊOne order had 3 giant pancakes. ÊThree of us only managed to finish 1/3 of it. When we were leaving the restaurant, the host patted HP on the back and said, "Thanks, HP. ÊSee you again soon." ÊHe remembered his name! ÊThat's one good host. We came home with bunch of leftover and all fell into a food coma. ÊWe really like Griddle Cafe. ÊWe'll definitely be back again to try more pancakes. ÊOne note, please be careful about parking on the side street. ÊWe got a $40 parking ticket because we didn't read the fine print on the sign. Ê"Permit required!" ÊNow that's one expensive breakfast, but at least it was an excellent one.

My favorite breakfast place on the planet. If I could eat here every day for breakfast, I'd die as a very happy and fat woman. It's all about Poached Y Papas Benedict. I know it's not a traditional eggs benedict- no toasted english muffin here. You get three crispy potato skin halves under a huge ham steak, doused in creamy Hollandaise sauce, topped with two poached eggs. I still haven't found a place in L.A. that makes better eggs benedict than the Griddle Cafe. It's incredible. And very filling. I never finish 'em. I eat half, skip lunch, eat the rest for an early dinner and I'm spent. The pancakes are also fantastic. My friend and I usually share the Tis The Season which is a pancake mixed with pumpkin pie, topped off with whip cream and more pumpkin pie filling. And I'm not usually a fan of pumpkin pie but this is delicious. If you love cheesecake, you need to get the Creme de la Creme french toast that has cheesecake icing all over it. And the best thing that goes along with breakfast is the French pressed coffee. It's strong, but not too bitter. If you're really starving for breakfast and want to go here, you need to get here right when it opens. I mean it- you wait an hour later, Êyou're screwed with waiting for up to an hour or more. When I get there on Sundays, I'm there by 8:15 and as I'm leaving around 9 the place is PACKED with suckers waiting outside. And because this is in Hollywood, don't be surprised to find celebrities and other Hollywood honchos or wannabes dining here. I've seen a few B an C listers, but the most legendary spotting was Kevin Richardson from the Backstreet Boys- only he could stop me from eating my Creme de la Creme french toast. That was a teenage dream come true for me. KTBSPA!

OK, I'm going to throw down the gauntlet here. Can any 1 human eat a complete order of ANY of The Griddles pancakes in one sitting? I have been here quite a few times now and can only get about 2/3rds through them. I can finish off any of the french toasts but the pancakes still own me. The Griddle straight rules. I am going to blow the lid off it. It is pretty tiny, in the heart of Hollywood so it fills up quick. Choice of french press coffee, check. Endless gourmet pancakes, check. A few choice options of french toast (Peanut Bubba rocks!), check. Well-rounded breakfast and lunch menu, check. Get your butt in there so I can say I told you so.

With the exception of our waiter, your employees show a shocking lack of over-site, an unwillingness to understand their guest's wants, a complete inability to work in a high stress environment and very poor understanding of service. ÊThis sort of street mentality is inexcusable, in my business. I visited your caf this afternoon to have lunch with 5 of my neighbors. ÊI was treated rudely, with no consideration for my happiness for your business and finally, I was physically intimidated and bumped by an individual who was introduced as your "manager". ÊThis despicable display of "customer service" was so appalling and was performed in front of so many of my friends, your employees and fellow customers, that one of the 14 people I have already mentioned this episode to today, thought I should mention it to whoever it is who represents the business interest of your company. ÊMy take on this was, there is no way this business, which has repeatedly displayed such a lack of concern for their customers would care. ÊAnd as further proof I pointed out to my neighbor that your manager told me so. ÊHis exact words were, "I don't care whether you are happy or not". ÊAny business that would allow themselves to be represented by the type of individual who was representing your establishment today, must clearly not care . Still, after telling her about my experience she was so shocked that she encouraged me to write to you. ÊSo, in the spirit of good sport, I made a bet with her: ÊIf I do not get a prompt and Êappropriate response to this letter, she would have to post my story on her Facebook page and tell 20 people personally about it. ÊIf, on the other hand, I received an adequate reply, I would let the matter drop and chalk it up to someone's inability to see the larger picture and while I will no longer patronize your restaurant, at least I will refrain from making this episode my current cause. At about 1:30 this afternoon, I attempted to frequent your caf. ÊAs usual on a nice weekend day there was a line. ÊI gave our name to your host. ÊWe would be 4 guests, one of whom we were waiting on. ÊUnderstanding that making others wait for incomplete tables ties up valuable seating space and slows down overall customer service to the rest of your clientele, we would wait for our 4th and let our host know when they arrived. ÊYour host was nice enough to seat us as our turn came up. ÊWe ordered drinks for her, we were preparing to order her food, when she texted us that she had just parked at our residence a block away from the caf, and was walking to us. ÊAt this time 2 more friends and neighbors whom we had previously asked to come out with us showed up. ÊWe understood that this would make our 4 into a 6 and would possibly cause inconvenience to others. ÊI went to your Êhost and tried to explain to him that the original 3 would be using the table we were seated at and that the 2nd 3 would need another table. ÊWe fully expected to wait our turn in line. ÊThe first 3 would eat now at our current table, the second 3 would wait their turn. ÊNow, everyone had arrived Êin our party. ÊAt this point, our host who did not seem to understand, after we explained it to him, started insisting that we get up from the table which we had already ordered drinks from. ÊIn fact, our waiter had now arrived with our drinks at this moment. ÊAgain, I tried to explain to your host, has the irony of this term dawned on you, we would now be 2 parties and the late arrival would wait for their table. ÊOh no, we would have to leave our table and wait, until all "our party had arrived". ÊYep, he wanted our party to arrive even though our party was present. ÊBy this time I was beyond explaining that all our friends were now present. ÊWe refused to "get up now" as we were told. ÊWe asked to speak with your manager. ÊWhile my friend AGAIN began to explain the situation, I interrupted him and said I was a paying customer and I wasn't being treated right. ÊThen came the reply I feel best expresses the attitude of your restaurant. Ê"I don't care whether you're happy or not". ÊBeautiful. ÊI must at least acknowledge his honesty. ÊOf course, we began to leave. ÊAs I was getting up from the table and this was really the reason for my letter, you manager began to bus the table. ÊHe stood in front of me, too close and when I asked him to let me by he said, "you can go around me". ÊThen your host move in toward me. ÊAmazing, your two employees were obviously trying to physically intimidate me. At this point I must tell you, the combined restaurant experience of this party was well over 40 years, most of which was managing high volume, local, independent, recognizable, and very successful restaurants. ÊNormally, when I experience poor service or products, my reaction is to let the business keep performing in their way. ÊI mean, I am not being paid by them to be a consultant. ÊKeep running your business this way, by all means I won't miss you.

Can somebody tell this Guy S. person to stop reviewing everything I review. Seriously, is he trying to BE ME? Anyways, after much much much much anticipation, I did it. I went here. I've been wanting to for a year, and yesterday I said I want to be strong. I want to wake up early and go to Griddle Cafe. Ohh Griddle Cafe, if starving children around the world could see you now. You see this is DEFINITELY a love-hate thing I have for Griddle Cafe. Breakfast is undeniably delicious, yet I'm wasting food and supporting an institution thats influencing an unnecessarily higher demand for food and supplies. In other words, our world is limited in its resources, and I hate hate hate skinny bitches who eat a bite of this shit and bounce. We came here at 8:30am and there wasn't a wait, nice. Now, I was dying to try the French Toast or even the pancakes. But, you see I just hate wasting food. I think about Africa, I get sad. So the choice would have been gain 14 lbs. or be (as I feel) personally irresponsible. So, I got the Baked Potato Omelette. And Guy got the banana nana nananana (there might be too many "nana"s in it, I was tired) pancakes. His pancakes were great. They really reminded me of banana pancakes that my mom makes arrr the time. Not to brag but, I could get that at 11am, no wait, and decent sized (as in, smaller). My omelette was good, except for the massive sour cream they amassed on it (again with the 14 lbs.). The potatoes were decent, the omelette itself, really good (minus the sourcream..srsly sour cream at that magnitude is just gross. Why didn't you just put a stick of butter on top of my fruit?). I got the fresh fruit side, which was bigger than most places' side of fresh fruit (which is NICE), and it came with a toast--which they almost forgot to give me, but thankfully didnt. It was buttery goodness. All in all, I'm not down for a wait, but if I'm feeling like a champ at 8am, I will be back for the french toast (I wonder if they do short stack on those). I will not be back here any later than 8 though, because the lines and the scene isn't worth it.

A must-do, especially if you're hung over from a Hollywood all-nighter. ÊHell, even if you're in the valley, make the drive through the canyon, and try out this spot. Ê A complete breakfast that won't run you an arm and a leg. ÊMy favorite? ÊEasy choice - Mom's French Toast. ÊThe best I've ever had. ÊThe slices aren't slices...they are pies. ÊYeah, consider it a french toast PIE. ÊStill, extremely tasty and buttery. Ê It's not a huge restaurant, so you're sure to have (at least) a 20 min wait. ÊIt's well worth it, nonetheless. The staff is down-to-earth. Ê Service is great. ÊThe only knock on this place is that there isn't much elbow room between tables/chairs. ÊAs I mentioned, it's not the biggest place. Ê WARNING: ÊUnless you typically walk off your breakfast, you will be taking a power nap soon after visiting the Griddle.

FIVE MONSTER STARS!!! I eat a lot of breakfast food and have been to dives and diners all over the United States. I say this with no hesitation. Griddle Cafe does not edge out the competition, it crushes it. You could say "Griddle Cafe French Presses the competition!" I have never had anything I disliked - even remotely. From coffee to cakes, eggs, cheese and meats! They have the quality ingredients Êand the ingredient combinations to meet the needs of the serious breakfast fool. Now I guess it is some kind of scene. Really? I don't care - I'm there for the food. And I know it's busy... What does anybody want? Plan ahead or get up earlier if you can't hang. Bring your dog and sit outside, bring a foot bag and entertain yourself while you wait... Bring all your friends and turn them into Griddle-heads. Last words... Bloody and Mary, together again. Holy heck. Ate her for three years before I tried one. 36 months wasted, or NOT WASTED depending on how you look at it. Either way, I will be the guy at the bar with his friends getting loud - the one who almost hit you outside with his foot bag. The one with plates of food, eating until he pukes.

Can this place be any more cool! The peanut butter french toast thing was totally BOMB! I felt like i was on cloud 9 eating it, even though i was on a "diet" this thing is the one that kills it hahaha. We also ordered their eggs benedit which i love as well cuz i love anything that's an eggs benedit. We also got the strawberry pancakes which was super duper huge, sharing with four people and there was still 1/4 of it left! This place is yum, plus the waiters/servers were yum too hahah they were super cute!

This place rocks! ÊWe call it the "sick place" because that's where we go when we want to get sick from eating a large portion of heavy food. ÊI love pancakes and they have the best. ÊThe portions are very large so I advise sharing and they'll bring you a small cup of butter. ÊI thought my heart stopped just looking at it. The parking isn't great and it isn't very large so you'll have to wait if you don't get there by 9am.

MY PICK FOR MOST OVERRATED BREAKFAST IN LOS ANGELES!!! I know this place is very popular. ÊThe wait is always long, my friends always talk about it. ÊI for one must say....F$k the griddle. Ê Now, I am sure plenty of people will disagree with me, and that is fine. ÊThis is just MY opinion, I respect yours. First off the portions. ÊNow I know a lot of people go gah gah whenever a restaurant gives you ridiculously large portions. Ê"Oh you have to go to claim jumpers, they need a dolly and car jack just to serve you your food, isn't that awesome". ÊI like to be full sometimes, but this place is excessive. ÊI can not bring myself to possibly attempt to order pancakes from here. Ê You know in those old Total cereal commercials where they would explain how many bowls of the other brands cereal you would have to eat in order to match the value of Total and you would see a tower of bowls in front of the guy. ÊImagine they took that tower of bowls and decided to put all that into two pancakes. ÊThese things are HUGE. ÊIt is like being asked to eat a pillowy man hole cover. ÊIf they harden they are considered lethal weapons in 27 states I kid you not. Why does human kind need this. ÊI have never in my days seen one person even come close to finishing these. ÊNot even one pancake to be honest. Ê This upsets me for two reasons. 1) This is a waste of food. ÊI am not going to get into some depressing rant about the world and hunger and all that jazz, you know the story. ÊI think it is gluttonous. 2) ÊIt doesn't even taste good. ÊWhy the hell do I want 10 pounds of pancakes that don't taste good. ÊWhat type of deal is that. Ê The service has always been lousy when I have gone. ÊI am not going to get into specifics but I have little patience for lackadaisical incompetence on Sunday morning. ÊThat being said, maybe I should or could blame myself for being impatient. ÊI am usually hungover and lacking a proper amount of sleep. ÊRegardless, if I am hungover I want to go someplace mellow with service that is attentive and everything happens in a timely matter. ÊI don't like waiting 40 mins for breakfast standing in the sun while I am hungover. ÊI am not going to do that for breakfast. On top of the long wait, there is all this tension outside as a crowd of people wait to be seated and eagearly wait for one of the servers to pop out and call their name. ÊYou see the dissapointment in their eyes when a server comes out only to bring a cup of water. ÊGod forbid someone gets called before you that showed up after you because the table seats 4 and you are only part of a group of 2. ÊI don't need to deal with this. ÊThere is no reason to have to wait for food in Los Angeles, thats just how I feel. One time I had to go there for a birthday breakfast and they stuck us in a back room. ÊThere weren't enough chairs, the restaurant had some of their trash on the table. ÊThere was receipts and trash on the floor and the waiter barely ever came or when he did he would forget what we asked him for by the next time we saw him. ÊThe chair I was sitting in was broken and was jabbing me in the back. ÊOne of my worst restaurant experiences ever. That being said, the fact that I see such a long line of trendy people every time I go there just makes me think of how people will go here because it is hip regardless of the fact that there are 20 different places in LA that are better for breakfast with no wait. ÊMc Donald's even being one of them. Ê And that right there sums it up. ÊWhen I would rather go to a Mc Donald's restaurant than eat at your establishment, you have failed me.

Some of the best people watching I've ever done over breakfast. Ê 1) Mysterious skinny hippie gardener guy from up the street who I always imagine is a serial killer using bodies for fertilizer. 2) Narcoleptic steroids guy in his early 70's?? who falls asleep with his fork in the air at 20 second intervals 3) Skanky porn-y chicks who got ready for that night's clubbing at 10am ... no time to stop home? 4) "Mystery," television's self professed pick up artist, who tried to impress said skanks with a fork bending trick, because it's easier than trying to cultivate a personality. 5) ÊHis hulked-out buddy with the pimp hat and wife beater gave the Griddle a few of his modeling poses before leaving. Ê Then there was me. ÊTo be fair. Girl in last night's waitressing uniform with ratty hair and a big angry pimple on her cheek too intensely scrutinizing people to properly focus on her really delicious breakfast burrito.

This is my second visit to the Griddle Cafe and I wanted to be certain this was indeed my favorite breakfast spot in LA before writing a review. ÊIt is!! ÊIt is!! If you get there after 10 AM be prepared to wait to get seated, trust me it's worth it. ÊHad the "Tequila Sunrise" Êand wanted it again this morning but didn't have the energy to drive over, their pancakes are out of this world, the hubby and I share one for dessert and still can't finish it, my fave is the "Bluesberry". Ê A must is the French Press coffee, if you like coffee this is probably as good as you can get without going to Columbia. The wait staff is great, attentive and friendly. I'm making myself hungry just writing about it, if you are in the area you won't regret making the trip to the Best B-fast spot in LA.

This is one of the better brunch spots that I can think of. ÊI visited last week with no expectations and was blown away by the taste of the food. Ê I ordered the "Poached y Papas" Benedict while my date had the "Peanut Bubba" crunchy french toast. ÊBoth were AMAZING. ÊI'll start with the french toast. ÊIt was dipped in a peanut butter crunch and fried up. ÊSo heavenly. ÊIt came with some whipped cream and powdered sugar. ÊAdd some syrup and it's a wrap. ÊI think it's safe to say that's the best french toast that I've ever had. The Poached y Papas Benedict featured a few poached eggs on top of a bed of sliced ham and potato skins. ÊThe Hollandaise sauce is AMAZING on this meal. ÊThe sliced ham also has a really nice taste to it. ÊThe seasoned potato skins just set off the whole meal. ÊThis place is so tasty that I actually finished my food and a slice of toast of my dates. Ê The place does get a bit busy and it's really hectic inside. ÊI wouldn't say its a great date place but if you're down for great brunch food, I wouldn't hesitate to come here again.

So i arrive on a Beautiful Los Angeles morning...Fathers day to be exact, i look out Êthe window and see a crowd of people in somewhat of line outside of some place next to the Directors Guild of America..my first thought is...oh god another strike! But then my brother a resident of la says thats where we are going for breakfast...which leads me to my second thought..umm...you guys can, but i'll be good with a bagel and cup of hot chocolate from the coffee bean directly across the street..but my brother ever the charmer promises me its well worth it plus my nephew loves the pancakes there and that i should atleast do it for him. So we parked and put our names on the list...45 min wait..hmm..i'm little apprehensive but ahh..wait the host does something i love, he speaks to my dad using his first name, that is why i waited the 45mins. Anytime someone can use your name more than three times speaking to you i give them credit because they are making a effort to actually act like they care about you. We decided to go grab some coffee and hot coca from the coffee bean while we waited. We finished just in time for our names to be called. Again the host spoke to my dad by his first name, seats us in very lovely spot in a booth by a window, our waiter was a hottie and was so nice..again customer service..awesome. As we wait i look over the menu and decide to get pancakes sense i heard they were really good. As i wait i see the server walk pass us with a plate of three pancakes..that were bigger than the plate! Êi knew then Êthat i had ordered way more than i could eat, hell i had ordered more than four of my girlfriends could eat. i can't imagine anyone every finishing all of those, so i asked brother if anyone has ever finished and he proceed to tell that he heard through someone else one guy, once finished all three pancakes on the plate...ONE GUY! How long has that place been open and only one person has finished them... So the pancakes are enormous..and i only finished like four bites. However the sausage was really good, the eggs scrambled perfectly and the four bites i had of the pancakes were pretty good. To sum it up...i would go again, first the customer service was amazing and the food was really good, the only problem the portions are way too big...and no one(other than ONE guy) will ever really finish those pancakes..which is why i gave them four stars and not five.

ÊIn no particular order: Reason #1: ÊValue - Each couple split an omlet and a stack of pancakes, but we really should have simply gotten one plate of pancakes and one omlet and split it 4 ways, as the portions were huge. ÊThe pancakes and omlets were about $11 each, which, given the portion sizes, was a good deal, especially for LA. Reason #2: ÊFree parking lot in the back with plenty of spaces. Reason #3: ÊTastiness - This place puts a whole new meaning to the word pan-"cake." ÊAll stacks are deliciously sweet, with flavors like oreo or walnut/banana/carmel. ÊThis is also a good reason to share as suggested in Reason #1, as there can be too much of a good (read: tasty) thing. Reason #4: ÊThey play Saturday Morning Cartoons on the TVs! Reason #5: ÊThey know they're popular and busy, but instead of being rude to patrons who are waiting, like some restuarants, the staff is very amicable. ÊAs a heads up, they only seat when the entire party has arrived. ÊIf you're waiting for a member of your party, be sure to "wait past the tree." All in all, a great brunch again. ÊWill be gultenous here again!

Double-dated it up for brunch a few weeks ago. ÊWe both ended up ordering an omelet and pancakes, big mistake. ÊWe could have easily ordered one omelet and one pancake for the 4 of us and probably still had leftovers. Ê The omelet was phenom and the pancakes were equally so. ÊThey are literally the size of the entire plate and they taste amazing. The place is crowded so be prepared for a little wait, but the guy is extremely accommodating and friendly. ÊIf you go here for brunch, you will NOT leave unhappy.

Ok - so I'm sure by now you've read all 501 reviews on the Griddle, but if you're visiting just my page to see reviews... THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE PLACES TO EAT!!! ÊI highly recommend "kickin' and screamin" breakfast tacos, bluberry pancakes, apple & cinnamon pancakes, their mild french press coffee, their french toast (its addictive), basically its all good! The waiters are waaay cute. ÊThe waitresses are hot s*x. ÊNot that should matter, but nice scenery with a good meal is always nice. There is parking in the back behind by Rite-Aid. Ê Yes, it is ALWAYS that busy. ÊBe prepared to wait in line....for a very long time. This is a good place to spot a celeb or two (but please don't go there just for that). Ê The prices are reasonable for LA standards. ÊIf you're a tourist from the midwest reading this, you might find them to be a little overpriced - afterall you are in LA!

Good food. If you want food which can be filling early in the morning (that morning breakfast in bed feeling or room service breakfast in a swanky hotel) then here is the spot. My rating is based upon the food and the fact that an acquaintance owned the store next door till he passed away few yrs ago. The reason this spot doesn't get a 5-Star rating is due to the washed up reality tv show "performers" who came here to be seen and further their reality tv careers.

The Griddle is the setting of many, many fond memories for me. ÊLike the time I ate an incredibly large omelet while sitting next to that guy from that show. ÊOr the time I OD'd on bacon (not possible) while sitting next to that girl from that show. ÊOr the one time I didn't have to wait an hour to get a table and the waiter looked like that person from that show. Food: Pretty much everything on the menu is big, cheap, and tasty. ÊMy advice: get a side order of bacon, one pancake (not one full order, just one, because you (by which I mean anyone) cannot eat a full order), and your choice of a dozen different types of omelets or pancakes (the pumpkin pie flavored one - 'Tis The Season - Êis my favorite) or french toast or an assortment of chili or a sandwich (the shrimp one is the only thing on the menu I don't like). ÊYou'll have enough food for a month and spend less than $20. Ê3.5 stars. Service: Alex is a great guy and a great host. ÊThe rest of the wait staff used to be in a very attractive, punk/pop co-ed boy band (I wish them all fame and success). ÊService is fine, if disinterested. ÊThe downside is the wait on Saturday and Sunday. ÊOne thing is certain: you will wait. ÊAnd wait. ÊAnd wait. ÊExpect 45 minutes if you aren't a regular. ÊAn hour or longer is possible. Ê2 stars. Decor: Typical diner, with tables, booths, and counter space inside and a few tables outside. ÊThere are also two private'ish rooms in the back for larger parties. ÊSince you'll be spending about an hour out front waiting, I guess you can consider the sidewalk near Sunset and Fairfax part of the decor. ÊIt is often warm, sunny, and crowded with people waiting for cheap pancakes. Ê2 stars. Summary: Food (60% weight for Overall): 3.5 stars. Service (20% weight for Overall): 2 stars. Decor (20% weight for Overall): 2 stars. Overall: 2.9 stars Ê(which I am rounding all the way to 4 since I am a long-time fan and this is a must-try LA scene). Come for the cheap eats, stay for the... wait.

damn flippin' good. Worth the wait in my opinion, of course when I went I had a friend who was already waiting in line. I think I woulda waited anyways. First off I like how crazy it is in there. People running around, loud noises, it feels a bit like a concert. Same types of people too, some guy with long hair reminds me of the drummer for Kings of Leon (maybe it was him?), some chick all tatted up -- and of course the tourists in Hollywood about to make a day of it taking photos with Dracula or a storm trooper or whoever is in front of the Mann Chinese. The menu is rediculous, right? And thats before you even get to see what it is youre getting, which in the case of pancakes is more than you and your spiritual adviser can handle. They have the eponymous griddle section which, for the money, is the closest thing to pure insanity. If you can put it in pancakes or on french toast they got it. Chocolate, cereal, fruit, some other craziness that you probably would never want to eat but shit youre here so you might as well. I had french toast with nutella layered in between the slices. And I feel gross, but damn was it worth it. I mean REALLY GOOD. I wanted to write a Prince song it was so delicious. I mean the only way that this could go bad for you is if you got cold feet ordering, b/c there is "so much good stuff". This is a totally normal reaction, I know b/c I had it, I was like "but maybe I want the strudel-stuffed pancakes wid the choco chips" but you are gonna be happy no-matter-what so RELAX. If super duper sweet just isnt your thing head over to the eggs section, with some good shit on there too. My friend got some scramble with tequila-chicken and that was pretty awesome, i think I'll have that next time. I can't say I was offended by the Soju Bloody I had, as I did get a nice buzz going but I guess I'm a fan of the Vodka variety a bit more. I guess if they really wanted a hard liquor license they would've gotten one by now so i guess I'll shut up about that. Coffee was good too, nice touch with the french press. All in all just about the most ridiculous breakfast I've ever had, the kind of place you've always wished your current favorite breakfast joint was like but couldnt all the way admit it to yourself. If you arent a risk for a coronary and want to put yourself in a 12 hour coma check this place out.

They put the cake in pancake! Quick tip: Call Ahead before heading to this spot to put your name down. Their pancakes is hella good. I don't think one person can finish their classic three stack pancakes. It's more like between 2-3 people can share. The proportion they serve is huge, way more than generous! I had the scotch on the rocks and it tastes seriously like a cake and you don't even need any maple syrup, it's that sweet. This has to be the best place for pancakes all around hands down. They got the service pretty much down. They divide the restaurant seating layout in big groups, couples and single counter which is pretty efficient use of space. ÊGreat group of people work here to make sure your taken care of. It's like a neighborhood breakfast and brunch place to go.

This is the most delicious and fattening brunch place on the planet! The pancakes are amazing and the servings are so huge that you can split one plate between three people. I've also seen a few famous people here which can be fun. BUT (and its a big but) I can't give the Griddle 5 stars is because of the atmosphere. Its crowded, difficult to find parking (even behind the restaurant is always full), and the bathroom is tiny and always has a long line. In addition, the service is awful. These factors make going to The Griddle a stressful adventure instead of a relaxed brunch experience i usually crave.

I hit this place the morning after a disappointing wedding reception where my date was a no-show, I was mocked by the ex girlfriend in the bridal party (who looked like an animated corpse. ÊI patted myself on the back for cutting her loose), and a prolonged drinking binge with my oldest friend upon my early return lead into a very late breakfast here at Griddle Cafe. I remarked to my friend how everyone looked like they were trying to be noticed for the next episode of "trying too hard scenester with ironic t-shirt." ÊI told him that they were all hung over eating breakfast at noon on a Sunday and who did they think they were fooling. He being an LA native, full time waiter, and part time acting auditioner, told me that it is always this way. ÊIf they're grocery shopping. ÊIf they've run down to the corner for toothpaste. ÊAlways. Very LA, I guess. After the 30 minute wait for the crack of noon hangover breakfast (where everything good along the same street is similarly jammed just like this one is) we gnawed like starving wolves into cakes and eggs of various types. We were so famished that we actually consumed it all, and they serve portions here that could feed a family of 10 in southeast Asia for a week. A good time was had by each of us. ÊWe got our fill of ironic t-shirts, stuck up hipsters, and pancakes and omelets.

Aside from a vast menu of choices and very large quantities, this place left me very disappointed. I've been wanting to come here for a while now and finally had a chance to visit. I was ready to sample a pancake, a french toast, and a couple of egg dishes. Boysenberry pancake was large and full of boysenberries. Flavour was nearly absent, but I will say that it was packed with fruit. Dark chocolate french toast was tasty but nothing stellar. Chicago Charlie's egg dish with sausages and vegetables was bland at best. I had to add ketchup and hot sauce to every bite. Same went for the Muscle something or other egg dish with egg whites, vegetables, and chicken breast. I'm sorry but if I do come back, I will sample other dishes and will steer clear of the eggs. I am curious to sample the Oreo pancakes and the chili and maybe something else but I don't see myself going out of my way to return. The coffee was good.

i've heard so much about this place, and i love pancakes so i decided to try it out! you can either street park or valet at the rite-aid that's on fairfax which is behind the restaurant. i was lucky to find street parking. i went with the bestie, so we didn't have to wait for a table as there was one available. it's a very cozy space. the tables are very close together and the walkways in between the tables and the booths are very tiny. the host didn't even walk us to our table. he just handed us the menus and pointed to an empty table. how hospitable. i LOVE the coffee! it's french press coffee and have three different roasts: light, medium, and dark. but, it is gonna cost you $3.95 per person with complimentary refills. i was hoping they'd have much more of a selection of pancakes. i had the "eyes wide open" which is basically chocolate chip pancakes with a shot of espresso in the batter and my friend had the red velvet pancake. disclaimer: all pancakes come in a stack of three, but the red velet pancake does not! you only get one pancake for $8.95 while the others are priced from $9.95 and up for a stack of 3. the pancake itself was too dense and heavy. and the red velvet one was a little wet. the servers wear caps with professional sports team on them, which is out of leftfield as it's not a sports bar, but it can be a conversation starter.

This is one of my FAVORITE places to go for breakfast in Los Angeles...the unfortunate thing is that it's also everyone ELSE'S favorite place to go! Long lines abound so make sure you have a friggin' lotta time to stand around outside waiting for a table...it'll be worth it though, I promise! A little tip...if you are a pancake lover and choose to get a stack of killer cakes (they have a HUGE assortment of flavors...yummy) be forewarned that the cakes are BIGGER Êthan the plate they are served on AND come in a large stack. ÊI would suggest that A) you either split it with someone or B) ask for a half stack or one pancake...they can do that. Get the french-press coffee...DE-lish. I usually do a plate of cakes AND some sort of scramble dish and split it with a friend...usually a male friend helps in this department seeing at the food is not itty bitty French portions. ÊAnd we all know that men have bigger bellies... :)

I have been compared to a human trash compactor. I eat until I make myself sick...we think God forgot to install an "off switch" in my brain when he was putting me together. So you'd think the Griddle Cafe and I were a match made in heaven, right? Wroooong. I've finally found the one place where I can't clean my plate. The portions are ginormous. The french toast and waffles are doable, but the pancakes are insane. I've never seen so many plates being taken away with three-fourths of the food left untouched. I'm telling you, if I were homeless, you know where I'd set up camp?? In the back of the Griddle Cafe where they throw away all the food. Jackpot! So the last time we came, we found out that you can order only 1 pancake (instead of the standard 3). You'll be able to finish your meal AND you won't be eating pancake leftovers for the next couple of days. They knock about three bucks off the normal price (so the one pancake costs about 2/3 the full price). Yes, it makes economical sense to order the full plate since you save only a few bucks, but your stomach will thank you. I promise. Apparently, this special ordering trick is just for people in the know. Now you're in the know. Also for those in the know? Order the Peanut Bubba French toast. Soooo delicious.

ÊI had the eggs benedict on sweet potatoes and the potatoes really made the whole dish work. ÊThey were much better than expected. ÊThe coffee comes in a french press with atleast 2-3 cups of delicious coffee. Our second time there was just as good. ÊThe service was off this Saturday - it was St. Patty's Day so they were extremely busy. ÊBut they did serve green mimosas which is awesome. ÊThis time I had the chocolate french toast. ÊI'm drooling thinking about it right now. ÊWith the most delicious fresh whipped cream I've ever tasted. ÊMy cousins ordered pancakes. One had the oreo cookie ones - delicious - and the other had some sort of apple and banana concoction - good but not really my thing. Ê I would go with the french toast because the portion size is much more manageable. ÊThe host is always really decent and funny.

I heard about how much they served and was a little worried about if they had quantity over quality. However I had nothing to worry about. This is a great breakfast place. I may rank it up as one of my favorites,with only The Original Pancake House with it. They had great pancakes(I had the Banana Nana) and also great omelets. I think one day I'll have to try their chili too. I've seen today however how just the sight of the amount of pancakes,almost falling over the plate can mentally stop dinners so It's helpful to know you can split it with someone else. The waiter was pretty good also,being engaging,giving advice and paying attention to all the customers in a room that was quickly filling up. We noticed there was parking behind that they shared with Rite aid and a cleaners but it does seem to fill quickly so it may be best to go early for breakfast. The only complaint I can think of was how much their shirts are. I like getting t-shirts from places I go to but still wonder if I heard the price wrong.

Mmmmm...Oreo Pancakes! Breakfast and dessert rolled into one delicious singular sensation. These people mean business when they serve you some pancakes. I can barely get through one and never even finish the leftovers I always end up taking home. I tried the Manhattan Frittata and it was OK. I prefer the carb breakfast items like pancakes and waffles. Best to get a group and have everyone order something different and share. That may be the only way to finish off a plate. Divide and conquer! There is plenty to go around. The guys on staff are nice eye candy while you wait in line. YUM!

I've been coming here for 8 years but have finally succumbed to writing a review. Why? Well after my move (job related) to San Diego in January I suddenly realized how much I missed this place. After a Thanksgiving weekend visit in Los Angeles, I decided to swing by the day after turkey and had a hearty serving of their Strawberry Waffle with brown sugar sour creme. How much I've missed this place. Other things to try: Pumpkin pancakes, Mom's French Toast, Chili My Soul Omelettes, and their super delicious breakfast tacos! I'm more of a breakfast person but friends of mine have also sworn by their delicious lunch time meals. Happy dining!

What can be said about the Griddle after 700 great reviews that haven't already been said? With that said I have probably been here 20 times since moving nearby and I figured I would share some awesome experiences I have had on my trips. 1. My friend ordered coffee which came in this cute little french press but yet never got a coffee mug. Finally, after 15 minutes one of my favorite server there comes over to us and was like you know what, I imagined that I brought you a coffee cup and then went to get him one. 2. The crowd here is crazy...I've seen professional race car drivers, girls from my private high school 3,000 miles away, the boring celebrities, and my friends who I always try to convince to eat 6 pancakes for $250. 3. This girl Ella is a waitress at this place. I love her with all my heart and she is totally insane. You want her if you can do anything about who brings you your food. She doesn't ever seem to smile but is a bunch of laughs. You have to warm up to her style and then you'll always come back for more with her. She told me one time that serving at the Griddle was her being a "conveyor of death." 4. I watched a crazy homeless guy at the bus stop scope out these people who left from the far table while eating outside. In full stride he stole their plates and dashed onto a bus that showed up plates, silverware, and all. AMAZING. Long story short, the breakfast is awesome and shockingly the burgers/sandwiches are even better if you cannot handle the breakfast food. I always bring visiting clients here for a great time. The french toast isn't as hyped as the pancakes too and they are a MUST TRY. You can even get the french toast with Nutter Butter. Eat here before anywhere else when near the Sunset Strip!

See my review on Sunset Ranch for my tips on what to do with the leftover pancakes you will surely have after you try to devour these massive, succulent, steaming cakes. Pancake stacks can feed a horse - literally. Seating is a bit cramped indoors and the street-side tables might as well have orange crossing-guard vests on them - you are barely off the busy Boulevard. Gustatory rewards are worth the risk of being flattened by sidewalk-drivers. If they still have the pumpkin pancakes - get them. ÊThey are terrific. ÊThey may as well come with a candle in the middle - the stack is as big as a Jack-o-lantern.

Sugar...overload.... I came here because my little sister and I are in LOVE with red velvet everything (cake, yogurt, fro-yo, etc.) so how could I pass up the red velvet pancake? Not to mention I just saw it posted on http://thisiswhyyourefatÉ! Anyway I ate a banana to prepare myself for the feast and drove here with my friend. Service: 5/5. Impeccable. We were told a wait time of 20 min but were seated within 5. Now that's called setting the bar low and defying expectations! Our waitress was lovely and attended to us constantly. Also, the male waiters in this place are freaking hot. I am not sure why. There were at least 3 really attractive guys hustling and bustling around us--great way to start the day. Food: 3/5. I got the red velvet pancake and asked for the frosting on the side. Not allowed, because it's a specialty. Ok, fine. But then it came out and it was the size of a small baby pig. So thick and so, so sweet. I could barely eat 1/5 of it. It's like a flat red velvet cake with powdered chocolate on top and then super sweet white chocolate cream cheese frosting. Honestly, I had a few bites and felt like throwing up. I generally don't eat that many sweets and it was just too much sugar and butter all at once. I did take a picture and send it to my sister just to show her I did eat some. I was so glad my friend got the turkey sausage scramble because I really needed something to balance my stomach and the hot sauce & turkey did just that. Ambiance: 3/5. Busy, homey, nothing special but definitely nicer than a hole in the wall. Makes you feel like you are in a secret cafe along Sunset, which is nice. Probably not coming back...but it was worth the experience.

If you like breakfast food &amp; aren't diabetic you MUST try this place! Their selection always makes my mouth water just reading the menu. Their French Toast is amazing no matter which one you choose, and you'll probably want to take the leftovers with you. Their coffee is also impressive because they use a Bodum French Press & the cofffe has a nice kick to it. One warning: there is always a line, but it moves fast so don't be deceived by the crowd standing outside. The guy who handles the seating it freaking awesome! The one time we waited it was due to a friend being late to meet us. We asked to be skipped to wait for our friend & he kept checking with us to see if we wanted to be seated without our friend. We almost did. The only parking is a small and behind the Rite Aid on the corner net door. If you have patience for the parking the food will definitely make up for it. Overall, I love this place.

I often like to think of myself as a breakfast connaisseur, having cooked quite a few in my own kitchen. ÊWhile my eggs aren't the most buttery, the pancakes not as fluffy or homemade, and have yet to attempt a good eggs benedict, I've tasted so many supposed specialty restaurants that the unmistakeable taste of a perfectly cooked waffle really goes a long way to enforcing that required return trip. So, after hearing about the immense lines and awesome pancakes, there's no way we couldn't check out this Sunset Strip fixture, the Griddle Cafe. ÊGetting there somewhat early for a Sunday morning (about 10:30 AM) it was still rather packed and we waited a good 30 minutes for our table. ÊIf the food had been atrocious, this wait would not have been worth it at all. ÊThe 'Tis the Season pumpkin pancakes we ordered were like a holiday morning, complete with whipped cream. ÊAside from the originality of the flavor, they were enormous. Second on the menu was their take on the classic huevos rancheros, the Tequila Sunrise. ÊThe tequila flavoring in the sausage and ranchero sausage was subtle, but just a hint enough to make it unique. ÊMy one gripe may have been the tortillas, but if I want authenticity, I'd have gone elsewhere. ÊThe eggs themselves, deliciuosly runny and smothered in cheese, were more than enough to satisfy me. No doubt, this place is on the map for a good reason. ÊI'd highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great breakfast near Hollywood and look forward to a second trip!

Before coming to Griddle Cafe, I recommend that you smoke a huge bowl of weed - because honestly, that's pretty much the only way you can finish your food. I've come to Griddle Cafe before, in search of a delicious breakfast that will only satisfy the gods, and I have found that place. I'd recommend parking on Hollywood blvd, that way you can get free parking and it's a very beautiful, nice walk - great for burning all those calories you're going to devour during breakfast! There is a huge line when you walk up to Griddle Cafe, however, despite encountering this line twice, I've been seated almost immediately inside - either at a small table or at the huge counter. The menu is overwhelming- between the different varieties of french toast and pancakes, the egg combination plates - it's really hard to choose. The first time I was there, I had the banana nana pancakes - banana pancakes with brown sugar and banana baked into them - so delicious and truly so mouth-watering, it's hard to not eat the entire plate, which by the way is 3 pancakes the size of Kim Kardashian's big. fake. ass. It's a lot to eat. This time, I had Mom's French Toast which is two pieces of egg bread smothered in whipped butter with powdered sugar. It was so amazing, I ate the entire thing. Their coffee is great here. It's french press, you do not need sugar at all and it's like rocket fuel - this stuff will have you hyped up for hours afterwards, which is good since you will need some energy when you're walking around, trying to walk off your impending food coma. I definitely recommend that everyone comes here - at least once - just to try the pancakes.

Breakfast.Hollywood.Griddle Cafe. Enough said. But I'll say more for clarification sake. I've had my fair-share of LA dive food in the AM post-hangover's but I must say, the Griddle-Cafe is second to NO ONE! The portions-amazing. The service-Brian is the best! Well trained and friendly staff. The prices-completely acceptable. The food-uber awesome. I highly recommend the bluesberry pancake, it's so good it'll make you want to slap yo' momma.

You ever walk into a place and feel it's history? This is the type of place where you feel the experience of your meal. The clanging from the kitchen, the air wafting in every time the door opens to the buzz of people and vehicles hurrying down Sunset, background chatter of some hipsters latest music deal...all soundtracked to a little Lightnin' Hopkins on the box and choreographed by an awesome staff and topped off with an amazing meal. The hot cakes are an enormous serving and could feed 2-3 average people. French press coffee, red velvet pancakes...yummm. This will be a regular stop for me when I'm in LA. Thanks guys!

I may be spoiled by all the amazing brunch places in San Francisco, so maybe this Êplace deserves 4 stars for Los Angeles. ÊThis place has a unique ambiance....I could have dressed in sweats and all would have been well. ÊThere seems to always be a line and the server is extremely efficient. We ordered the Eggs Benedict, Huevos Rancheros, and French Toast. ÊThe Hollandaise Sauce on the Eggs Benedict was great, but I am sure was loaded with tons of Sour Cream. ÊAgain, I try not to compare every Eggs Benedict to Butler and the Chef (SF, CA), but I can't help it. ÊIt was still a good Eggs Benedict placed on a potato. ÊThe French Toast was fantastic and asking for a heart attack! ÊIt had nutella, ice Êcream, and syrup. ÊDid I love it? ÊYes! ÊI could have done without the Huevos. Would I go back? Maybe.

Went here on Labor Day. ÊThat afternoon we were going to the CBS Television Studios to go see a taping of the Scottish Conan guy. ÊSo, one of my friends suggested we go to the best brunch/breakfast place in West Hollywood. ÊThe best part, CBS is down the block on Fairfax. ÊOK...go go go. Some words of wisdom: 1. Arrive early: ÊThis place has a long wait....you and ur new friends will have to put ur name on the list and wait. ÊThe guy will tell you anywhere from 45-90 minutes since you and every in West Hollywood will want to get some Griddle's for morning grub. 2. Bring comfortable shoes and something to do: ÊThe wait is long. ÊBring a magazine or your Kindle....or i(whatever the device is) to kill time. ÊThe guy who took your name will call ur name when the table is ready. ÊThis guy is cool. 3. Be careful where you park: ÊSome residential parking near by require permits, read the signs or two and that will keep the tow truck away. 3. Don't eat beforehand and bring a good appetite: ÊWhat ever you eat, they will serve you big portions. ÊMy friend and I made a mistake of ordering a side of fries with our entree and game over. ÊFood overload....food coma guaranteed for the the rest of the day. ÊGet some exercise before hand, since you'll reload on what you just burnt quick style at this place. Ê I got the chorizo breakfast buritto and that this was huge. ÊChorizo was good and it was mixed in with veggies and eggs, and verde sauce and the like. ÊTopped with sour cream. ÊCame with tortilla chips on the side. ÊThe side of fries I ordered were steak fries and the serving size was good enough was meal itself! My friends got eggs benedict and french toast. The people next to me ordered pancakes. ÊWhen their pancakes came, I looked in utter disbelief. ÊThe pancake is about the size of a small to medium size deep dish pizza. ÊYou don't even see the plate Êthe pancake is on. It's a three layer pancake with goodies between each layer. ÊThe lady ate only a sliver (like the size of a small pizza slice...very small) and already had enough. ÊShe and her friend took it to go. ÊThey give you those hefty to go boxes, and it barely fit in there. ÊWe got to the restaurant at 11am and didn't leave til around 2:30p. ÊWait times including. ÊThe restaurant was packed the entire time. If I do come back next time, I'll definitely share with a friend or two. But I won't get an entree of my own and NO side next visit to Griddles.

If you're looking for a place that gives you monster-size portions of breakfast dishes, this is a good place to go. ÊOne would think quantity, not quality, but the food was actually very good. ÊAnd a place that uses a french press to make it's coffee (and leave it for you to pour your own at will) gets a big gold star in my book. And if you're missing the East Village in NY, the decor will give you your fix.

Coffee House on Sunset - R.I.P. Ê Once upon a time, you made the best cornflake french toast. ÊTragically, I was the last to find out that you are no more, so I grudgingly set out to find your successor. ÊDown the boulevard at Fairfax, Yelp helped me find Griddle Cafe. ÊWhile it's known for their monstrous thick, fluffy pancakes (comparable to the dimensions of a large wheel of aged cheddar and entirely imaginable in feeding a Little League team), and although I didn't find what I was exactly looking for, secret handshakes and all, I DID find the crunchy "Peanut Bubba" french toast: thick brioche toast dipped in pb crunch and grilled to a brown crisp, sprinkled with powdered sugar and whipped cream... just what the cardiologist ordered. Ê A friend chose the brown-sugar baked "Banana nana" 3-stack which is freaking GREAT accompanied with the signature french pressed roast coffee. ÊIf I ever moved to LA, I'd have to eat here once a week, then by sheer rapid weight gain, be forced to stalk Kirstie Alley, lobbying to be her fat girl sidekick. Ê Leftovers are 100% guaranteed and holds up well for a couple days if stored properly. ÊI'll never forget you, my dear Coffee House, but Griddle is my new crush where Scott (the coolest, cutest and nicest of the Griddle staff) takes care of all.

Impressive queues shorten quickly in this fast paced southwestern themed pancake house. ÊService was courteous but necessarily brusque, and the food turned out with alacrity.

3.5 stars is the most I can give this place I find it hard to give this place a 4th star, the food was good and had pretty large portions, however it's about the taste. This tasted like most breakfast places I've been to. Not saying it's bad, just not worth all the hype that made us wait there for 45 minutes! If it was a shorter wait, maybe I would've thought/tasted differently, but standing outside inhaling car exhaust and other people's cigarette smoke while slowly dying from hunger made me expect great things! All I tasted was huge pancakes, eggs, sausage, etc. As I was reading the menu I saw the somewhat pricey food and thought it must be REALLY good because of the price, but nope, they justify the price by giving you large portions! so you are definitely not getting ripped off. A few members from my party had grilled sandwiches (lunch stuff, I think it was a chicken avocado or something) and that was freaken DELICIOUS! Make sure you try one of those if you want more than just generic omelets! Pancakes were good, many options to choose from, maybe the ones we got just wasn't spectacular, but flopping whipped cream and powder sugar on a pancake doesn't make it that much more special. French toast was much better than pancakes.

Aaaggggggggghhhhhhh ----- suggests drooling sound affect? Yes. I absolutely love breakfast... therefore, I absolutely love this place. Went here on a Sunday around 12:00 and of course we were in for a wait. A wait well worth what we were about to experience. The host was friendly and had no problem remembering our name when our seats were available. We took the option of sitting at the bar. I loved the set up! The old school diner style bars are great for conversing with people around you that you don't even know. Well at least that is how my mom sees it because our neighbors at the bar were her friends by the end of our meal. Gotta love we friendly Texans! Our server was not only handsome, but very accommodating. The guy didn't miss a beat. I freaking love great service! It just makes the experience go from good to over the top. I love that the coffee is french press. You get your own personal pot right next to you on the table. I will say that I didn't enjoy spending $5 for a small cup of OJ, but lesson learned. I always forget that restaurants charge so much for that stuff. My mom and I ordered our own items and then split them. I love having a variety and getting to try more than one thing in a visit. We had the Creme de la Creme French Toast. Graham cracker crusted french toast topped with creamy cheesecake drizzle and powdered sugar. Ahmmmmazing! Really sweet, of course! To balance out the meal we also had the My Soul Omelet. Steak, green chilies, jack cheese, sour cream, salsa, and guac on the side. The portion sizes were insanely huge! An order of cakes could seriously feed 2 people! The food was really, really good. The prices are high for breakfast food, but portion size makes up for it. I am so freaking excited about this place and returning soon. You have won my breakfast loving heart.

My first impression was, "Whoa, this place is packed!" We had to wait awhile to get in, and once we were seated, everyone from the waiters to the customers already eating was fast paced. You know a place has good eats when people are grubbing on their food. Thank goodness my food partner in crime knew his yelp reviews because we ordered a 2-layer pancake and we STILL couldn't finish it. I think there should be a huge warning sign on how big the portions of food are, but I'm not complaining because it was well worth the wait and the pancakes were delicious! Tip: Take a look at the menu while you're waiting in line because there are SO many choices, you'll have a hard time choosing. The lasting impression? "Can't wait to try all their breakfast menu items and the different types of pancakes!"

I would have definitely given this place 5 stars if the wait weren't so long and if the staff was a bit more friendly. ÊThey don't really have a waiting area so we waited for a few min in the front (by the entrance), but we were constantly in the way of the barking waiters so we ended up waiting in the narrow hallway in the back. ÊRestaurant itself is no frills and the tables turn relatively fast - probably because the food comes out in the blink of an eye. ÊMajor plus if your really hungry from the long wait. Food was definitely 5 stars: Best. Pancakes. Ever. ÊWe got the Banana Nana and it was to die for. ÊIf you like pancakes and you like bananas, then look no further. Mom's French Toast was highly recommended so we got it. ÊNot "mind blowing" but definitely good. Wish we had tried the stuffed french toast because the orinal was very plain jane. ÊThe pancakes definitely overshadowed the french toast. Lastly, we got the "some like it hot" scramble. ÊNot what i was expecting at all, but delicous. ÊIts less of a breakfast egg dish and more of an afternoon (haevy) snack - salsa with eggs. ÊA good balance to the meal since our other dishes were definitely on the sweet side. Highly recommended because the food is amazing and serivce is quick, but be prepared to wait.

Yes I finally got my ass up at 6:30 in the morning and had breakfast at The Griddle since all my friends rave about it. Actually I think I pulled an all nighter in order to get up so early. Luckily we didn't have to endure the long wait like everyone normally goes through because I got here before everyone wakes up in LA. So HA! Honestly I think it's place is a tad over rated. I don't give a rats ass if you agree with me or not. The portions are huge. Only come here if your starving hungry. My hot chocolate cup was the size of my head. All it was missing was some Baileys. I was hoping for more food on the non-sugar side. When I opened the menu it was 24 million different kinds of waffles and pancakes and a small page dedicated to egg lovers for omelette's and other non-sugar high goodies. I gave in and ordered Mom's french toast. I've never seen french toast that big before. The lunch menu's gigantic but I'm not waiting in line for it today. I'm still digesting breakfast. Perhaps some other time.

Oh man, everyone love Griddle Cafe. The pancakes are great, the eggs benedict on potato skins are AWESOME (and huge!), and the mimosas have just enough orange juice to provide color. ;) Yes it's got a long wait, but if it's just two people I've found the wait is substantially less (like, only 15mins... if that). ÊIf you take a group of more then 4, be prepared to wait at least an hour.

I have been here several times now, and of course went based on the great YELP reviews. I love this place and haven't tried anything I didn't like. This is a breakfast review only because that's all I have eaten (that's what they are known for) The red velvet pancake is delicious, ans so are the black magic pancakes (Oreo pancakes). Their pancakes are super rich and taste just like you are eating a piece of cake, you definitely will not be able to finish it because of the richness, but you will love it. I have also tried the omelet "my soul" which was very good. I can't remember the name of the french toast I had but it had caramel, whip cream, and something else....delicious as well! GO THERE YOU WON"T BE DISAPPOINTED. If there is a line, which there just might be, it's very worth it.

Came here on a Saturday at about 10:30 and had 3 ppl in my party altogether. Waited an hour and finally got sat outside. Boo! for sitting outside because now everyone would be staring at us. I've been here before and had the black magic pancakes which are REAL, REAL, REAL GOOD! For whatever reason I wanted to try something different this time. The server recommended bana-nana pancakes so I thought, hey why not, I heard someone else in line talking about it. Let's see what all the rave is about. We went with that, the poached y papas benedict, and Êtequila sunrise eggs. The Bana-nana pancakes were a MAJOR disappointment!! I expected actual bananas pieces in the pancake but I got NONE. Just banana flavor. bleh! I don't cook but I've made better banana pancakes. So disappointing. I really should have sent them back but I'm too much of a coward to say, "I know I ordered this but this is horrendous can I get something else?" Ê=(. Tequila sunrise was alright, not a fan of the big blob of cheese that's been melted and consolidated into one large blob on the plate. The poached y papas benedict was definitely the star of the meal! Put a Êlittle bit of everything in your mouth and it's a flavor explosion, the flavors meld together so well. All in all not a bad restaurant, but this time I'd have to give it 2 stars for the 1 hour wait and whole box of bleh banana pancakes to take home "sigh" not to mention breakfast cost $50. Damn you banana pancakes did me so wrong!

If you like pancakes, then this is the place for you. I've gone a few times now, so I've had the pleasure of sampling at least half a dozen different pancakes. As others have noted, the restaurant is loud and bustling. I've gone early in the morning near opening hour, and have yet to experience the very long waits that people complain about. ÊIt's a fun atmosphere, especially with a big group of guys who have all have a huge appetite. ÊThe service is just okay. The servers I've encountered were not particularly friendly and mostly run around a lot trying to deal with the crowds. The portions are monstrous, and will provide you with several days of helpings. ÊIf you don't want to take so much home, you can ask for a single pancake instead of the stack of three. This has become our preferred way of ordering - it's still enough to share and the plate doesn't overwhelm you. (And I'm not exaggerating about the overwhelming part. During our most recent trip we brought a cousin along. He just stared for a minute at his stack of pancakes and didn't know where to begin!) First, you must try the coffee. This is not your usual watery sludge that most restaurants serve. The coffee is a nice strong dark roast and is served in french presses with unlimited refills. The good: Banana Nana pancakes. Ask for walnuts. And don't be afraid to add a little maple syrup to them. This is the only flavor that we've had so far that actually improves with syrup Scotch on the Rocks: coconut, pecans, oats, butterscotch chips. Mmmmm. Wholey Moley: whole wheat and brown sugar batter. Probably the most 'traditional' flavor we've tried. If you're looking for something that's not too sweet, this is a good option. Barry Yellow: buttermilk pancakes with raspberry and lemon. These were a little disappointing. I've become a big fan of lemon pancakes in the past year, and so I had high expectations that the added raspberry would be sublime. Unfortunately, while very tasty, the flavor is unbalanced. The pancakes are very tart and need to be mellowed a bit. Adding some syrup helped, but I wonder if folding in some ricotta cheese would provide the mellowness I desired. Side of bacon: although a little pricey, they provide you with nice thick cuts of bacon. None of that paper-thin, frozen Sysco slices that too many diners serve nowadays! The Great: Yellow Brick Road: caramel, walnuts, butterscotch. ÊThis may induce a diabetic coma, but at least you'll die with a smile on your face! Addicted to Noisella Stuffed French Toast: a nice layer of nutella spread sandwiched between two old fashioned slices of french toast. The portion isn't nearly as huge as the pancakes, but this is so rich it's still hard to finish! The Not-so-good: The Griddle Potatoes that are served with egg dishes. ÊThey give you a big brick of potatoes that just don't have much flavor and are a little dry. You'll find yourself reaching for the catsup and/or hot sauce. Chicago Charlie's scramble: sausage, potatoes, bacon, bell peppers, onions, mozzarella, garlic and basil. ÊIt sounded good on paper, but the end result just didn't quite work. I only tried a few bites, and thought it was heavy and lacking of any punch.

Finally!!! We've made it Montezuma! We've made it to the Griddle cafe. For weeks - my boyfriend and I have been trying to hit the Griddle cafe. We did a drive-by past the place Labor Day weekend and there was a line at 9am. We decided to hold off and try for another day. So, last Saturday we got up early enough to make it to the Griddle Cafe at 820am. We found a meter right in front. We were seated at the bar area as that was the only place seats were still available. That would not last for very long. By 830am, there was no seats left in the house. We learned from the locals that unless you make it by 9am, you have to wait for a table. The upside is that you don't have to wait very long. The staff was not only friendly but everyone worked together like a well oiled machine. We ordered a French Press. When our waiter brought the press to us - he made sure to educate us (or more so myself). As we pushed down on the press, we noticed that our press had a hole in the bottom. The coffee was really good, but we did have a dilemma with our press leaking from the bottom. No worries - our waiter jumped in and replaced the press with a new one. All is well again. So I ordered the "some like it hot" scramble. I like all things spicy....especially in the morning! My boyfriend had the Huevos Rancheros. I really enjoyed my scramble. It had a good amount of spicy but was not overwhelming. The portions were HUGE!!! And it's not like the plate the waiter put in front of me was that big - but the portion was just piled on. I could barely make a dent in the scramble. I would highly recommend Griddle Cafe. And be aware - if you show up after 9am, be ready to wait. But it is worth the wait. I will definitely be back for some Griddles next time. (Yes, it had occurred to me that we came here and neither of us had a griddle of any kind).

if you like crazy pancakes in large portions you will LOVE the griddle cafe. it used to be a tradition when any of my out of town friends came in we would do brunch here. The lines are long on the weekends full of the hungover hollywood crowd. It's worth the wait though. The blueberry pancakes with sour cream on top- YUM! The golden ticket pancakes with bananas, whipped cream, caramel, strussel....I'm drooling as I type. Birthday cake pancakes, pumpkin pancakes, oh my! The egg dishes are ok too - but if i want an egg I'll go to any place - if i want pancakes I come here! PS Ê- who can eat 3-5 of these pancakes that are bigger than my entire body? YOU CAN ORDER A HALF STACK - it doesn't say it anywhere on the menu but its cheaper and you still can't finish that half stack anyway!

Don't even know where to begin for this place! I wish I came here with a larger party just so I could've tried more of their dishes. Between the four of us, my party got the: Peanut Bubba French Toast, Red Velvet Pancake, Gone Shrimping Eggs, and a regular omelette (do not take this route). The Peanut Bubba had just the right amount of sweetnees and my mom couldn't get enough of it. The Single Red Velvet pancake was literally larger than one plate but it was SO delicious! The Gone Shrimping was my order and I did not expect green-colored eggs but after just one bite, I didn't think I could go back to regular eggs again. Their breakfast/brunch items are so unique and different from what you can find at a regular diner. I will definitely come back when I visit LA again and I will be tackling one item at a time on that menu. DELICIOUS!

Goooodnessss gracious..talking about mouth watering craving after you eat the Creme de le French Toast. Just thinking about it makes me want to drive their now park in front & be the 1st in line tomorrow morning. I've been to this place a few times and can't help but, wish I could go every week! When ordering pls be extra hunger or share because, the plates are pricey BUT well worth it and ohhhh so yummy! You liable to see a celeb or two while waiting in line to be seated on weekends too!

went here becuz of all the hype and its pretty much just hype. Don't get me wrong the food is good but its not great. We ordered their famous velvet pancake, which had way too much cream cheese icing & once you took the icing off it had no taste. We also ordered the tequila sunrise eggs. Overall everything was fine but not worth it for me to wait 30min for a table.

You will have to wait forever for a table, but don't worry - everyone there is beautiful, so you won't be bored, and the food is magnificent, so you won't be disappointed. French press coffee: yes. It's really, really good. Potato skins benedict: worth the inevitable self-loathing. Probably.

Huge helpings. Êi admit I was hungry and most likely ordered too much, but the french toast was amazing. Ê Also, the coffee is french press so if you like coffee, you're in for a treat. ÊService was great too. ÊAll and all I'd definitely go here again.

Most notable are the huge portions. Nicole Ritchie will not be ordering any of the high-rise pancake plates. Food ranges from above-average to quite-good. Their omelets are beautiful and fluffy. Pressed coffee is novel. Decor is low-key, not much breathing room, music isn't annoying (think Allman Brothers). Patronizers consist of director-types and aspiring actors hoping to catch the eye of director-types (same for the servers, who are impressively attentive even when busy). Some advice: get there early. Parking and seating is a whole lot less stressful.

How DO they get their waffles to taste like that? The waffle was good, but once I glimpsed a peak at one of the Griddle's massive pancakes I became envious of the eventual consumers of those pancakes. We came in on a Monday morning...and the place was 2 people away from being full. Service was pretty good considering all the chaos around us and our food was served quite quickly. I could imagine the parking in the back could be quite hellish, so I was pleased that we found a spot once we got there. It always seems that free parking in this area is only available due to divine intervention. Eggs were also fluffy and tasty and I was supremely impressed with the bricks of hash browns they serve alongside said eggs. Would come here more often if it weren't for the crowds and parking.

I came here with two of my guy pals and we came hungry and ready for the breakfast that feeds giants. Ê Our plan was to order three different dishes and split it three ways so we can try as much as we can in one sitting. Ê We chose the Noisella French Toast, Tis the season (pumpkin) Pancakes, and the Some Like it Hot egg scramble. Ê "Addicted to Noisella" Stuffed French Toast - Nutella stuffed french toast, large and thick slices of toast filled with gooey nutella, topped with fresh whipcream and a drizzle of chocolate. ÊThis was hands down our favorite of the three dishes. ÊThe french toast melts in your mouth and the combination of whip cream and Nutella hit your tongue and you close your eyes, smile and go "mmmmm...." "Some Like it HOT" Scramble - egg scramble with chicken tequila sausage, cheese, the tequila rancheros sauce gives it a good kick, not over powering spicy, but the sausages had great flavor. ÊMines were also sitting on my plate of whip cream so it help tone down the heat a bit lol. ÊIt was ok overall the sausages I would want on its own mmm so good. ÊThe best part with the chili cheese bread!! ÊOMG! ÊIt's jalepeno cheddar slices toasted! ÊI want some more!!! I wish they were the same size as the bread they used for the french toast, but we got 4 slices. Ê "Tis the Season" Pumpkin Pancakes - 3 pancakes topped with whipped cream and a dollop of pumpkin pie filling. ÊThe pancakes were spiced and was pretty decent, but I was only able to take in two bites before slapping my hand down and tagging myself out, I was too FULL!! The place is really crowded and packed in tight and loud, but hey you're stuffing your face with good food, no need for talking. ÊThe host was awesome, he referred to us as "Janet and Friends" and as we walked out, he was taking his break and said "Bye Janet and Friends" hehe. ÊWe waited about 15 minutes at 12pm Saturday afternoon, not so bad. Ê Also gotta Thank all the YELPERS for the Rite Aid parking tip! I'm coming back when my cholesterol goes back to normal , for now it's just oatmeal and cheerios...hehe

I am a pancake/French toast fanatic. So after studying the menu online, I went in with much anticipation. I got the "cheesecake" French toast........and man, that thing was just sugar and cream on top of dough. It sounded so exciting and delicious (and heavy?) but it was only okay. It was just grilled bread with cream cheese and lots of powdered sugar. I was a little disappointed. Friend got the nutella French toast and it was super rich....unsurprisingly. I could easily make what we ordered at home. Staff was cool, though. Not worth for a second visit in my book.

Food: 2.5 stars Service: 2 stars Ambiance: 3 stars Noise: 5 stars Price: 4 Stars (our total $26 before tip) With over 700 reviews I can hardly contribute anything novel at this point so instead I will hope that reiteration will translate into listened warnings for my disappointed sentiments are laced throughout the plethora of quality yelp reviewers. Slightly tough pancakes + sub par omelets + impolite and forgetful staff + notoriously gigantic portions + tasty french press coffee + real maple syrup just does not equal an 1 hour wait where you're herded like cattle against a cement wall. So no matter how you divide, multiple, add, or subtract, it's just not worth the wait. Even higher math theory can't save you here. Even if you wanted to wait inside to catch the football game...NOPE says midget host man...cause if you miss your names that's too bad for you! So there you are, left with the decision to eat outside surrounded by disheartened famished patrons waiting in anticipation for their name to be called like it's the first round draft pick or to be packed inside in a cloak of chaos trapped by brick wall. The highlight is the french press coffee-richly roasted and full bodied. TIP: Let the it steep 3-4 minutes before applying steady pressure and pressing down the plunger. Hold the lid when pouring to avoid a mess (Saw a not so lucky patron, no it wasn't me). Banana Nana Pancakes: Notable selection and variety and worthy of the prefix PAN, but the truth is that what you're really getting are slightly tough and tasteless pancakes that are dull to the taste buds that you'll have to endure forever because they're huge. I guess I can't blame them, it's hard to not accidentally overwork the batter when you're making them by the industrial bucket. Omlette "My Soul" (with egg whites): With poorly distributed chunks of chicken and random pockets of jack cheese folded into fluffy bland egg whites and then topped with a skimpy dusting of salsa...I know my soul was not anywhere close to heaven after trying to eat this. Please don't order this, go for the scramble next time, it looks much more promising. Fruit: Not fresh at all and probably not a good idea to eat it. Service: HA HA HA So I completely understand they're stressed, overwhelmed and peeved by the constant, "When are you gonna call us?" inquiries, but I think they're just so obnoxious here and there's no excuse. The hosts are abrasive and sarcastic, while the servers are just too overworked to be attentive. She never even asked how our food was or if we needed anything. All morning I was conflicted by who or when a good time to ask for a little more salsa, but I never did because I was too scared... If you want a a lot of average food for about 30 bucks and like crowded spaces and waits, then Griddle Cafe is for you. There are so many other places in LA that have french press coffee and real maple syrup, that I'm just going to have to move on.

Great, great, great, great breakfast food. I love coming here for some breakfast chow. Here are some of my favorites. "GONE SHRIMPING", which is basically egg whites with shrimp, basil, tomato, scallions, and garlic toast. Healthy, filling, flavorful. Good start to my day. "CABALLERO" This has scrambled eggs, cheddar cheese, potatoes, green chiles, and chicken chorizo wrapped up in a giant flour tortilla. The chorizo is what makes this breakfast dish special. Its flavor is so powerful that it does not influence this dish subtly. It adds color to the scrambled eggs with its orange oils and makes them so full and rich. The fat in the chorizo coats the eggs, brightening them to a saffron yellow. Its robust flavor and warm, tingly spice gives this dish such a distinctive taste. "MOM'S FRENCH TOAST" is very good as well. It's old fashioned buttermilk french toast topped with powdered sugar and whipped butter. So classic. "BLACK MAGIC" Ok picture this... Buttermilk flapjacks with an oreo cookie crumb center, topped with oreo cookies and whipped cream. If you order this with milk, I swear you'll be reminded of your childhood. Also around Thanksgiving time, they provide a special platter of pancakes with pumpkin filling topped with whipped cream and powdered sugar. it's awesome. One of the best parts of this place after the great taste of the food are the portion sizes. The pancakes, french toast, and egg dishes are so big. The egg dishes are probably the only plates that you even have a chance of finishing. Pancakes and french toast, well let's just say I haven't seen it happen yet. It's probably enough breakfast to last you through the week. I shared a pancake dish with my friend once and we only got through a fourth of the entire plate. They close at 4pm so get your butt there early!

Just when you thought the breakfast value meals were a thing of the past... For just a few more dollars than what you'd pay at IHOP or Denny's these days, expect pancakes the size of a small moon, smoky sweet bacon as thick and long as my arm, french toast that's larger than the fists of five children spread out. Oh, and the potatoes?!?! Creamy-crispy perfection with well-cooked onions stuffed throughout. So good, even onion-haters won't notice they're there (just my perspective, no promises Onion Haters). Parking, however, can be a time-suck if you don't know that it's shared with the RiteAid in the same complex. So now you know - I just saved you 10 mins circling around Sunset Blvd. They would have gotten 4 stars if the service hadn't been a bit slow even if the place was only 1/3 full. Because this has so many reviews already, I will deviate from my usual long reviews and stop now. Just go eat here - you won't regret it.

Hey she looks like Janice Dickinson. Oh wait. It is. I first came here with my bff because Food Network controls our minds. The guy that took down my name acted like my bud, which is not a bad thing. He was awesome. The wait is always really long. The min time I've waited here is prob 30 minutes. That's when Bristol Farms across the way is great for wasting time & samples to hold me over (or go to Rite Aid next door for Thrifty ice cream, my fave!). My bff got a hamsteak and devil's dream french toast (chocolate brioche french toast w/ whipped cream). I got the chili omelet (because they had Chili My Soul chili!). The hamsteak was seriously straight from the Flintstone's. His french toast was to die for. It was not heavy at all and, of course, he ate the whole thing (he IS my bff for a reason). My chili omelet was awesome, but the hash browns were only OK. My sweet tooth got so mad at me that day for not indulging in the many many pancakes, waffles, & french toast options. 2nd visit, 45 minute wait was too much so we left. 3rd visit, my friend got the blueberry pancake which rocked (esp cuz of the blueberry sour cream) and I got the caramelized banana-y pancake. Never have I felt better about basically eating a cake for breakfast. Let's just say if even a freaking supermodel (no matter how old or messed up) is willing to risk her waistline for brunch at this joint, it must be worth it.

Griddle Cafe is a good place to get your morning food. I came here right when it opened at 7:00AM on a weekday. The portions are very large. I don't think I finished my omelet. Don't remember exactly what I ordered but I remember that it was good I'm sure most other things on the menu are good. How can you go wrong with breakfast food? They have a few flat screens in the place for your entertainment. They have an authentic oval shaped table/bar to eat at. Pretty neat to eat at it to get that hole-in-the-wall cafe feeling. Check this place out if you're in LA!

The saying sharing is caring is certainly reinforced in this place...the portions are sooooooo HUGE that if you don't share you might have to be wheeled out. Can someone say food coma? The french toast is pretty damn good...fluffy interior with a nicely grilled exterior, not overly indulgent and a lot to go around. The Bailey's and Kahlua pancakes were certainly not your conventional pancakes (like most of their menu). Better eat quickly otherwise the Bailey's and Kahlua will overwhelm the dish...it was like eating alcohol! Other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed my meal and definitely going back to try the cabrello (its the giant breakfast burrito) CANT WAIT!

I heard that there would be a huge line on weekends, but I showed up with a couple visiting friends circa one pm on a Sunday, and we were seated right away. Maybe people are upset that you can't have two tables at once, because whoever designed these portions must have been trying to feed a family of Orcas. ÊWe foolishly ordered too much from our goofy but good natured waiter (who my snarky friends ragged on for his sad jokes--- sorry guy! you were nice). I ordered an eggs benedicty thing with avocado, but should have read closer to see that it was served on potato skins instead of English muffins. That was weird, but the chili and cornbread and pancakes of my companions were all delish. Makes you feel bad about Africa or something, though. (To add-- the food was great, but the coffee is a must have... It's served in your own French press, and you get your choice of roasts. I would venture to say it's some of the best in LA.)

Pancakes come in one size, and 3 to a plate... there is no way you can finish them! It's meant to feed a family of 6! I ordered the golden ticket and it was oh so good. bananas, walnuts, streusel topping, whipped cream, brown sugar = yummy! I couldn't finish it... I didnt even make a dent. Aileen V. ordered the Strawberries and cream waffles which had fresh, sweet strawberries and this really tasty sour cream topping. They have really good coffee and fresh squeezed orange juice.

I was expecting a lot from this place since the reviews are out of control on Yelp. However, I was mildly disappointed at the quality of food that was served. Not to say that the pancakes weren't good, but I expected a big WOW factor when I took my first bite. Yes, it was light and fluffy, but it didn't seem to taste any different from pancakes that I've had at other places. Size wise-that's a different story. As for my bf's plate, the eggs tasted as if they were made from powder and not from scratch. It had a grimy after taste which led us to leave half of his food on the plate. Not sure if I would come back again unless I had a strong craving of pancakes and french toast, especially since we left smelling like grease.

So I figured out how to get through this recession. ÊBring your family... up to 6 people... order some pancakes, and expect to be filled... probably for the rest of the day. Ê The pancakes are disgustingly HUGE. ÊHonestly. ÊWhen people say things are big, nine times out of ten I finish whatever people are talking about, plus some more. After I saw the guy eating an order of pancakes next to me, I pointed him out to my wife as he was leaving, saying he didn't even finish his order. ÊLess than 1/2 of what he ordered... the equivalent to 1.5 pancakes... I seriously questioned his manliness. ÊHow much did I finish? ÊThe same amount... I'm scheduled for my public castration in a couple hours... Anyway, expect to leave full. ÊThe pancakes look to be the obsessively large item at this spot. ÊFrench toast is pretty big, but nothing crazy. ÊThe omelet plates look to be more normal sized portions. ÊOrder accordingly. ÊIf you're bringing a date, don't order pancakes if you want to leave with your pride... ÊCoffee is pretty good. ÊIt's just very crowded and loud here. ÊIf you're a bigger guy, don't volunteer to sit at the counter. ÊNo room to spread your arms to eat unless you eat sitting diagonally like me. Ê This'll probably be a good spot to bring people from out of town as it feels a bit on the touristy side... down play the size the pancakes and place a bet to see if the people you bring can finish them... Tell them loser pays for breakfast. ÊIt'll be a free meal for you...

Oh, this place is REAL GOOD. ÊThe Griddle doesn't need my review, but nonetheless, I felt it necessary to say how much I like it. If you're in the market for big-ass pancakes, then you've found your spot. ÊThe French Toast is as good as advertised. ÊThe menu is huge and they have several different legit healthy options (although the maple turkey sausage was reminiscent of a hot dog, which I found oddly appealing.) They even have French Press coffee. ÊA nice touch. BUT, real talk: I do not like to wait in line, especially for bfast. ÊI know, I know, it's LA and such. ÊIt's just a personal thing. ÊBe advised: unless you are extremely lucky, you will have to wait at least a few minutes and more than likely something in the range of 20 mins. ÊIt's loud. ÊIt's busy. ÊThey don't have a lot of seating for more than six and I personally wouldn't go there with a party of more than four. ÊI recently had to wait for 45 minutes with a party of five and literally every other party got sat WAY before us, even people that showed up like 30 minutes later. ÊNot complaining, just saying. It's weird because once you get in there, the place is larger than it appears it would be from out front. Ê But I digress. ÊIf you're lucky enough, go there on a weekday and you're all set. ÊIf you can only hit it on the weekend, I recommend arriving early.

Okay so this is one of those Hollywood hot spots that people talk up so big that when you experience it, you're left disappointed. Let's start with the food: AMAZING! Wonderful! INCREDIBLE! RICH! TONS! Restaurant: CROWDED! EXPENSIVE! FULL OF HIPSTERS! NOISY! Service: SLOW! ARROGANT! EYE CANDY! This place is seriously raking in the cash...they've got you waiting up to an hour to sit, they serve you in about 15-25 minutes, and they want you out of there after first bite. If you don't feel uncomfortable having angry, hungry, tired people watch you eat and waiting to snag your chair...then feel free. However, for me...I thought this was WAY over rated. Go to Home instead located at 1760 Hillhurst Ave. This way you can SIT, EAT, and TALK TO YOUR FRIENDS instead of STAND, GET BUMPED, SHOVEL FOOD, and SHOUT.

No no no. ÊI cannot believe that people have not caught on to the sheer vileness that is Griddle Cafe. ÊI can't really eat anything on their menu, having gone completely vegan a year ago, but I would've thought people would have caught on by now. ÊEven three years after my last visit, seems like no one has. ÊLet me explain... The vileness is on multiple levels: Encouragement of Food Wasting: since everyone gets the hugest possible portions for their plate size, there is no way that they can finish it. ÊSure, lots of people might say, "I like having leftovers for later" and I would agree with them. ÊBut the portions are ridiculous - completely overboard. ÊAnd if you go there for breakfast, please try to convince me that you are going to reheat your scrambled eggs or pancakes and eat them later. ÊI don't eat eggs or milk anymore, but I used to, and I know that NO ONE reheats eggs and pancakes. ÊIt's criminal to waste that much food. Rude Service/Bad Teamwork: ÊAn old friend of mine worked here and of course, she was great as far as I could tell. ÊA lot better than the rest of the staff. ÊOne time, I went there to have breakfast (the last time I went, actually) and visit her; during that visit, she dropped a newly filled French press of coffee on her foot while working and not only did no one on her "team" offer to help her, but she was allowed (asked?) to keep working. ÊHOT LIQUID AND GLASS FELL ON HER FOOT and no one helped her or sent her home. Rad. So, if that's how they treat their team members, imagine how they treat their guests. Too Goddamned Loud: ÊThe place stressed me out every time I went there because it was loud. ÊI am not an old person and there are other loud places that I enjoy visiting. ÊHowever, I would like to have a cup of coffee or two before I go to a rock 'n' roll venue. ÊWhen your server has to ask you to repeat your order three times, it's time to turn down the music. Mediocre Food At Best: I do not feel as though this needs elaboration. ÊI know bad food when I taste it, and while I don't fault people for liking this food (hence, this particular item's placement at the bottom of my Levels of Vileness List), I can't see why. ÊI mean, it's bland, often served lukewarm, and uninspired. So, in summation, if you're interested in being served outrageously obscene portions of below average food and being assaulted by ridiculously loud music and rude service first thing in the morning, you should go here and wait in line for Êtwo hours for breakfast on a Saturday.

Damn fine food, and not too long a wait (especially if there are only a couple of you). BEWARE the pancakes!!! ÊIndividually, those suckers are effing huge and an order consists of *three*. ÊWord to the wise - order any pancake as a side (or ask for just one). ÊI've never seen anyone be able to make a very sizeable dent in the full order and it's just a waste of food.

I went here last weekend, and had THE BEST BREAKFAST that I've ever had. EVER! ÊAnyone who gives less than 5 stars, is just a HATER, and obviously an idiot. Let's try and find something to complain about, to lower their star ranking. Hmmm.... Too much food for the price. Service was prompt and too good. Waited 10 minutes, that's WAY too quick for such great food. Friendly service. Cool atmosphere BEST BREAKFAST EVER. Yup, probably should give them 2 stars like the dip two reviews below me. If I could give 10 stars I would. I ordered the cheesy omelet, my wife got the pancakes and my daughter got the waffle. Big mistake! We should have all ordered one order of pancakes and shared. We ate and ate and ate until we felt as if we were about to explode shooting buttery and syrupy goodness all over W. Hollywood. Luckily we are able to keep our stomachs from hemorrhaging, but getting up from our seats was a task. Even after over-filling our stomachs we were able to give at least 5lbs. of food to one of the neighboring vagabonds. We even made a friend. He was grateful and probably had a great sugar-coma induced nap later that sunny Saturday afternoon. Next time we go, we are for sure going to share 1 plate, and probably still be stuffed, and HAPPY!

Seriously, you'll be in a food coma for days. Be sure to ask for the half order of pancakes (otherwise you get two enormous pancakes), or you'll be eating pancakes for days! I was starving, but barely made it a quarter of the way through my 'Golden Ticket' pancakes. This place is pretty small and packed on the weekends -- you'll be looking at a half hour wait at least on a Saturday morning. Just wish they were open late-night!

Yes, enthusiastically! I did the usual--tried the standard buttermilk pancakes (as huge as could possibly fit on the large plate) and was not disappointed: very light, fluffy, excellent flavor. The server remembered the extra butter and they LEAVE THE BOTTLE OF REAL MAPLE SYRUP ON THE TABLE FOR YOU TO USE AT YOUR DISCRETION; in my experience an undreamed of first. Extras--lots of hipster stylin' w/o any attitude, beyond fantastic coffee served in an infuser for you to choose when ready is ready, real blues piped in over the sound system, but not too loud. I'm going back many times; the other menu stuff looked great--eggs, sandwiches, potatos, etc. Portions are huge here...one stack is enough for three to split and order stuff on the side PLUS: they REALLY know what they're doing--NO POWDERED SUGAR ON THE STANDARD BUTTERMILK CAKES (YES!-I've said it a billion times). And on the orders where they do add it, they really go for it...gee, maybe that's why there's a line out the door--they do it right here.

This is definitely a place to frequent! ÊI'm always dying for an order of pumpkin pancakes (can be had all year in Berkeley, but not as common down here), so when I found out they served 'em up at this little place, I was there in two seconds flat. ÊWell, more like30 minutes and 2 seconds flat. Ê:/ The pancakes were incredible! ÊSo large and fluffy, covered in pumpkin and massive amounts of whipped cream!!! MMMMMMM! ÊWe also had the Charlie's Scrambles, which was also very good for scrambled eggs. ÊVery heavy on the garlic. ÊMmmm. There are so many different kinds of pancakes that I want to try, but I couldn't even finish my plate!! ÊI ate them for breakfast, ate them for dinner (with another person), ate them for breakfast again, and then had some more for lunch! ÊThat's just how big they are!! ÊStill, I have to go back to try some more. YES!!!

Crazy busy places (like Doughboys on 3rd St.) usually turn me off, but I was betting on the torrential rain downpour to provide me with a shorter line. And it kinda worked. 11am and there was hardly a line. My friend got a parking spot outside (I park opposite for free for 2hrs :) ) and an immediate seat at the bar. Nice. So the staff, incl the hot girl with the bra strap showing, are friendly and efficient. The food portions are legendary. The Addicted to Noisella pancake with whipped cream is too naughty for words. My Hunger Pangs' ham was sweet and juicy, the home-fried potatoes vast, but the eggs a little raw for over-easy. Still, no complaints. Another good diner/brunch spot to cross off of my list. By the time we were thrown out (after 1 1/2 hrs of chatting cause there was a 1 hr wait outside) there was a loooong line. So don't go after we've arrived, especially at lunch time, cause you'll have to wait. cause I talk too much :)

Just looking at your plate of food will make you want to shit bricks. Great place to crawl into the morning after a long night, and one of the only breakfast places open within a five block area. My brother recently took me to breakfast at Griddle Cafe while I was in Hollywood for a work conference and it was the perfect cure for my conference partying - yes, domainers party. The Eggs Benedict was off the chain and looked like it was going to eat my brother alive and my Shrimp and Pesto sandwich was good, but I'd get it without capers next time. One word of advice: don't wear your pajamas to breakfast, especially in public and after 10AM. ÊOkay, so just don't wear your pajamas in public like ever.

Based on the acclaimed ratings on Yelp, I proposed to have breakfast here Sunday morning of our mini vacay in Hollywood. We arrived around 10am and it wasn't severly packed. We were seated promptly on the center island stools. Besides the large portions of food, you immediately notice the array of ridiculously hot servers :) Ours was particularly hot and provided adequate service. I ordered the "Some like it hot scramble" which consists of chicken tequila sausage, jack cheese, avocado, and a spicy chipotle sauce. It was nice to have a "hearty" meal under $10 after spending shitloads on expensive sushi :P My cousins had the french toast and traditional eggs and bacon plate. Both were also delicious..the french toast slices are HUGE and they have the thick cut style bacon! P.S. The OJ tastes like its freshly squeezed....hey it prolly is and they have a huge candy jar on the stool island :) P.P.S. Don't come here if are watching your figure or eat like a bird

I came here since some friends came from nor cal and were staying in hollywood and wanted some breakfast after a night of partying. The boyfriend and I met up with them that morning and took them out the eat at Griddle Cafe! ÊAfter hearing so many reviews about them and their portions and plus their pricing, I figured it was best to take them here. Coming in with 9 people, I was worried that we would have to wait half the day in line for a table, but the guy was cool and told me it would be a 15-20 minute wait. ÊYay! ÊSo about 20 minutes later waiting in the scorching HOT sun, we got seated inside! Yay! ÊWe sat at a booth right below the only working ac vent in the building! ÊDouble YAY! Ê We all took our orders and everything came out excellent! ÊI got the banana nana pancakes but sadly, mine got lost and it never came out which I wasn't too upset because while I was waiting for those, I shared my boyfriend's baked potatoe omlette which totally filled us and it was really yummy too! ÊI also got to try the chicago omelette too which was also really good! Half of me wish I could try the pancakes as big as my head but half of me was glad that it didn't come out because I don't know how I would have been able to eat it! ÊIts ok, next time! ÊIt's just another excuse for me to come out here and try it again! ÊYum!

I would give this place 10 stars if I could. I knew when the wait was 45 min at 9 am - this would be a great place. It did not disappoint. Wait staff was friendly and quick. Food came out fast. Interior is ecclectic cool and reminds me of my fave breakfast place in San Diego. It was really hard choosing - so many great options on the menu - but we got the Peanut Bubba french toast and Pumpkin Pancakes. Both were so yummy and HUGE portions. I preferred the pumpkin but both were awesome. Pumpkin had a wonderful flavor and they serve it with a dollop of pumpkin puree on top. Scrumptious! The chili menu looked great - definitely want to check this place out for lunch. So worth the wait.

Pretty much a perfect place to pig out for brunch. The wait will be worth it. I got the Some Like It Hot scramble and my friend got the Addicted to Noisella stuffed french toast. Both were soooo good. The scramble had spicy chicken sausage, eggs, jack cheese, onions, avocado, salsa, and ranchero sauce. I got it with chili cheese bread, which was perfect to balance the spiciness. Plating wise though, definitely not as impressive as the MASSIVE nutella stuffed french toast with a dollop of whipped cream on top. Soooo delicious, but pretty sweet and might get sickening to eat the whole thing by yourself unless you really like nutella. I finished my plate and ate a bunch of my friend's french toast, but I decided to let some of it go since we were gonna go get dessert a few hours later. lol!! For two, we didn't have to wait too long. Maybe 15 minutes on a Saturday around 11:30. Inside, the place has a nice diner feel, but with high ceiling and some exposed brick. I saw a guy at the bar finish a whole order of pancakes and he got a free hat for doing so. He did appear to be in a lot of pain during those last few bites though. The scramble was good, but I think next time I will try one of their pancakes. :P This place is a must if you're not too far away.

The Griddle needs to change their name to GARGANTUAN! This place has enough reviews as it is so let me sum it up for you real quick. Definitely a must try breakfast/brunch place if you you are ready for a FEAST. I brought my friend visiting here as our last hoorah in LA before leaving out of town. ÊLet's just say that we could barely move to the airport after because we were having some serious itis. Luckily, we came on a weekday so we got a cute spot right outside right away along with free parking on the curb. ÊDouble sweetness! We decided to split the two dishes together to have both worlds of the salty and sweet. We got: - Creme de le creme ($10.95) - Hoagie omelette ($9.95) - Fresh squeezed orange juice ($5) The Hoagie omelette had italian sausages, cheese, grilled onions and peppers all rolled up into one fatty omelette with additional toppings on top. ÊIt was served with potatoes and a french roll. The serving lived up to my expectations...it was monstrous! Ê It was very cheesy and the crispy hash browns went well with it. ÊThe omelette was nothing too special but it still fulfilled my breakfast craving. Ê3.5 stars for the omelette. Now, the Creme de le creme! Mmmm Mmm Mmmm! ÊThis was a graham cracker crusted french toasted in cheesecake frosting and powdered sugar. ÊIt comes in two massive pieces drizzled in that sweet frosting. The menu gives a warning that it's for "cheesecake lovers." This dish was a plate full of good sweet lovin'! Ê 4.5 stars for this dish! I didn't realize until later that the small glass of "fresh squeezed" OJ was $5. Say whaaa? Unfortuantely it wasn't pulpy the way I like it or anything different from the ones I get from the supermarket. Save your money on this one. Overall: - huge yummy portions - cute "hollywood" breakfast/brunch - Go during off peak hours - Save two hours after your meal for mad food coma...zzzZzzzzZzz

As soon as the food was lain upon the tip of my tongue, an extraordinary feeling rushed through my body, sending a chill down the ol' spine. ÊEpic, heavenly, good old-fashioned bliss. ÊThen the next bite, and then the next, and oh my, I was in a state of complete satisfaction. ÊHow could something so splendid exist...let alone be made to perfection? ÊI cannot remember the last time I had a breakfast this grand and to be honest I don't know if this restaurant's spectacular feast was the cause of that. ÊI ordered the "Chicago Charlie's Scramble" as I believe it was called. ÊIt was then soon after, my friend ordered the french toast and offered a piece on my plate. ÊWow...the sensation is impossible to put into words. ÊNo other french toast had tasted like this one small piece. ÊI never knew french toast could be pushed to such limits. Ê And they have a bowl which contains Reese's peanut butter cups and starburst...good thinking. So EPIC...

Everything that breakfast should be! The only reason I don't give it a 5 is because we were placed in the back room which was pretty shady, and took away from the atmosphere like in the main dining area. This is what I had: Red Velvet Pancake: red velvet is not overrated!!! I know there are people out there that think it is, but I promise you, if you try this, you will change your mind. It almost, ALMOST tastes like red velvet cake, but at the same time, it keeps the consistency of a pancake, and therefore is still breakfast in my book. The cream cheese frosting, is also perfect. It's sweet, light, and even though at first glance, it looks like they don't give you enough, remember, that your eyes are bigger than your stomach. It's more than enough. Caballero: It's a giant breakfast burrito. It was good, but being from Austin, I can get this anytime. Creme de la Creme french toast: This french toast is crusted with graham cracker and topped with cheesecake topping. WOAH. So this one dangerously skirted the line between breakfast and dessert. Actually, I think it just plain crossed the line. Nevertheless, it was delicious. I think for breakfast I would just go with the plain Mom's french toast

Blueberry pancake - Three enormous stacked pancakes infused with blueberries and topped with blueberry yogurt. It was fluffy, and pretty tasty. French toast - Two big thick slices sprinkled with confectioners sugar. This one was also good. Overall the food was delicious, but the experience was short of stellar (aside from seeing Jessica Alba leave from the backdoor with paparazzi all over her that is ;-) ). ÊThe scruffy looking guys kept yelling out names and walking up and down the sidewalk where people were waiting. At least three times, he yelled at the top of his lungs as he was passing by my ear. The tables and seats inside were super miniature in size and placed very close together. The wait for the food took as long as the wait for a seat, which was about ~20 minutes. All in all, delicious food, but bad atmosphere/experience.

If you're going to have breakfast anywhere in LA or Southern California in general... you must venture to the Griddle Cafe. I would often drive by this small place and wonder why there would be a huge crowd. ÊOne early rainy Sunday morning, my boyfriend and I decided to go because we thought everybody would be either asleep, inside because of the rain, or at church. ÊWell, little did we know that the crowd that usually waits outside decided to huddle indoors that day. The wait was surprisingly not that long. ÊIt helped that there was only 2 in our party, so we didn't require huge/special accommodations. ÊAs soon as we glanced at the menu and tables around us, we finally understood the hype. ÊIt took a while, but we finally settled on sharing the strawberries and creme waffle, two eggs scrambled, a side of extra-thick bacon, and french pressed coffee. We struggled finishing the food and we were sharing one waffle. ÊEverything was rich, fatty, and scrumptious. ÊI was on a strawberry-flavored cloud. ÊThe saltiness of the bacon and eggs balanced out the sweetness of the waffle. ÊThe french pressed coffee was pretty good. ÊBut it still wasn't as strong as I'd like it to be. ÊIf you ever had cafe sua da at an authentic Vietnamese restaurant, you'd understand what I mean. I love this place. ÊThe food is top-notch. ÊNo complaints here. ÊJust a few crumbs at the corner of my lips and a slight tummy ache. ÊNow if you'll Êexcuse me, I have the sudden urge to do sit-ups.

Dear Griddle Cafe, I miss our old times together when i would take a 2hr lunch paid by our music vendors and used the excuse that it was a "working lunch" my ass. Gotta love a place that will serve pancakes larger than your emergency donut wheel. Maybe i can stash a pancake in my trunk and use it next time....jk I love the Griddle. Yes, it gets packed up the ying yang so get your ass here early (before 10am weekend & 11am weekdays). Over the years ive tried a few diff items off their menu and most are extremely satisfying and a hit with me. The Griddle has a decent selection of pancake's, waffle's, omelette's, chili (3 or 4 diff ones from chili my soul daily), salads, burgers and sandwiches. My go to meal for breakfast / brunch is the poached y papas benedict. Man, i love those soft poached eggs on top of a large piece of ham with 2 huge potato skins slathered with hollandaise sauce. I, sometimes add a bit of spiciness to my meal by throwing down some hot sauce on it. I also like the idea of serving coffee in a personal french press. Their coffee is like an instant wake your ass up cause its hardcore strong which i love. The peeps that work there are pretty cool, you can sit outside and enjoy the sun while you try to make a dent in your meal. On our last visit we ended up taking home 2.5 pancakes that were eaten over 3 days for breakfast at home. Come hungry or don't come at all suckas.

Went here cause the Red Velvet Pancakes looked amazing, and YUP, THEY WERE! Really really sweet and a huge pancake I tell you, cause I didn't even finish half. My girlfriend got some type of benedicts on potato skins, they were OK. Next time I'm here, I'll be sure to share a pancake. The only thing I didn't like was the wait; must've taken us 45 minutes til we were finally seated, and we were starving.

Griddle Cafe is my favorite brunch place in LA! It's cozy & homey, everyone's super friendly, food is DELISH, and the portions.............the portions are GINORMOUS! So, you better be ready to grub away! They are known for their Mom's French Toast! Like it says on the menu, it really is cooked to perfection! So, if Êyou haven't tried it already, definitely try it! However, as a person who always prefers savory over sweet dishes for breakfast, I go for their egg dishes! "Tequila Sunrise", "Caballero", "Gone Shrimping", "Chicago Charlies"...these are the egg dishes I have tried and I LOVE all of them...I am drooling at the very moment! Also, the chili............yummmmmmmmmmmmm Their Banana Nana pancakes were also heavenly, and I am not even a big fan of pancakes! The only downside? The crazy long wait... I've given up couple times after getting discouraged by how many people were waiting outside... I do recommend putting your name down, walk across the street for some Coffee Bean & chat away with a friend while waiting! Cuz, you WILL wait a long time unless you are an early bird (which I am not...)

I'll make this review short...this place is frickin' awesome for both Breakfast and Lunch. If you can go on a weekday, you'll be in heaven because it's not as crazy it sounds like it is on Weekends. Both times I went on a Monday morning/afternoon and there were tables-a-plenty. The Apple cobbler french toast is both delicious and ridiculous (honestly...who can eat that much), and their chili (I had whatever their spicy one was that day) is a delicious greasy treat that serves as a great way to have something meaty and a crazy-good piece of corn bread (again...the piece of corn bread was the size of a brick). It was one of my favorite places to eat while I visited LA for three months...unfortunately I didn't get to go their that often (curse that city and the need for an automobile!)

I had the Black Magic pancakes (Crushed Oreo cookies mixed into the batter, topped with powdered sugar, whipped cream, and more crushed Oreo's) and my friend had the "Peanut Bubba" Crunchy French Toast. They were absolutely incredible and I can't wait to try the rest of the menu. Next up will be the espresso shot and chocolate ship pancakes.

Best breakfast in LA - hands.down. However, it's all about patience and knowing what to order. Ive been to the Griddle about 7 times within my year here in LA and have introduced numerous LA newbies to this deliciously tastey spot. "Life-changing bfast" is what I like to call it, and they always agree whole-heartedly. Ê Note: Be prepared for a 15 min - 45 min wait in the hole-in-the-wall Êsmall, extremely crowded space. The host is probably the most rudest person in the joint, but I promise it's alll worth it in the end. ((Perhaps it would be a good idea to sneak a chewy bar in your bag just in case on those awful hungover mornings, but only one!!)). Though not all 7 times were amazingly delicious (many a time I've encountered dishes here that would've definitely deterred me forever if I didn't know enough about the place! *some of the egg dishes*), I think I've got this down to a science. Let me break it down for ya: 1. Chips Ahoy Chocolate Chip crusted french toast - Vist after visit, I'm constantly befuddled as to HOW DO THEY MAKE THIS AMAZING PIECE OF HEAVEN IN FRONT OF ME!?!!?! In all caps. With that many exclamation marks. Its just amazing. Be aware that these french toast slices are prettty hefty. They are not only encrusted in Chips Ahoy chocolate chip cookes but also somehow hidden inside as well. The crunchyness of the cookies coupled with the delicious soggyness of the french toast. .topped off with their not-too-sweet whipped cream . .mmmm so many emotions! In other words, just order it and let your life be changed. 2. ÊHot Chocolate Marshmallow French toast - Before you give me a quizzical look as you recall their menu Ê--- it's not on it. It's off of a secret menu. Exclusive. . .even better. And for good reason too! The actual french toast tastes like hot chocolate!! Now, I'm not the hugest fan of extremely large roasted marshmallows on top of anything. .but it definitely brings a balance to the french toast that allows you to inhale all four pieces without feeling like it's missing anything. Feels like I've gone camping and had my marshmallows roasted for me while sippin on some hot cocoa. 3. Tis the season - Pumpkin pie pancakes. WHOA. Thanksgiving during anytime of the year?! Sign me up. Pumpkin pie is my fav, and so are these pancakes. The middle tastes exactly like pumpkin filling. . in a pancake. Be careful though - we usually ask for a one stack (instead of the usual 3 -- they are seriously larger than your head. believe us.) so we can leave ample room to indulge ourselves in more bites of other griddle amazingness. 4. Red Velvet pancakes - You like the cupcakes? Then definitely try it in pancake form -- it's what they are known for! They aren't sparing on the cream cheese frosting either. I'd do a one stack too since it caan be a tad overwhelmingly sweet. 5. French press coffee - It's probably one of the only places that I crave, yes craaaave their french press coffee. No clue why. . . Anyway, the smallest is definitely enough for 4 cups and is the perfect pick-me-up after an insane previous night and while devouring enough to put you into a food coma. Deeeeelicious. 6. Bloody Mary - pretty strong, and pretty delicious. Best cure for a hangover. ever. Next on the list: Holey Moley (extremely healthy version of pancakes) and the blueberry pancake . . . . Tip of the year that will blow your mind: HUGE PARKING LOT IN THE BACK OF CVS FOR THE GRIDDLE!! I bet that just blew your mind.

This is a place where you leave your diet at the door. The food is awesome and it's worth the splurge. We waited about 20-25 minutes. We got the Scotch on the Rocks pancakes and they were so tasty. It's almost like a cake. The portions are HUGE. It's definitely plenty for two people to share. Then we had their version of huevos rancheros. This was a great dish too. The chicken sausage had a great flavor and a nice kick. This place is worth the wait. Next time I want to try the burgers. I saw so many people get that. It looked awesome.

The vibe and the crowd totally remind me of any great breakfast place in Oakland, and the breakfast was delicious. I split an order of the breakfast tacos and the nutella french toast with my accompanying party and we both loved it. I didn't get the pancakes but they looked HUGE and delicious. Our waiter was clearly on crack, but also attentive so I can't complain. The downsides: The espresso was very so so. And the fact that we went on a Tuesday at 11 am and it was still ass packed. I can only imagine what this place is like on the weekends. I next time I went back and ordered the driest Tuna Melt known to man. Drastically knocked this place down from its high horse. I mean really, how do you serve a tuna melt with no mayo and no cheese?!

Went back to The Griddle again today and finally managed to get past the breakfast menu and try a sandwich. I felt a slight twinge of panic after the waitress walked away with my order. Most places known for their breakfasts put very little time, thought or effort into other menu items. Lucky for me (and my completely satisfied stomach), The Griddle is not one of those places. The Italian Vegetarian Sandwich is served on grilled 6 grain, parmesan cheese bread. It has tons of artichoke hearts, some of the best roasted red pepper I have ever had, grilled tomato, provolone cheese and a generous slather of basil pesto. The only bad thing I can say about the sandwich is that it was falling apart, making it impossible to pick up and eat. Overriding this logistical problem however was the taste. One word...incredible! It was good enough, that I would not hesitate to order it again, even though I know I looked like a big wuss eating a sandwich with a knife and fork. If it's your first time at The Griddle, ignore this review and go for the breakfast. You kind of have to. However, if you have been here before, take my words to heart: venture past the breakfast pages and try a hearty lunch. You won't be sorry.

The Gridddllleee.... my mouth is watering as I say it aloud. Huge and I mean HUGE portions of fatty mcfatty dishes. Many types of french toast, pancakes, and waffles filled with choice toppings (or fillings) of oreos, bananas, chocolate, butterscotch, whipped cream, pumpkin pie filling, powdered sugar and the list of greatness goes on and on and on... Agree with some of the other posts that the service can be kinda slow, and don't bother on a weekend. But I guess there's a price for so much rich savory-ness under one roof.

If you are in Los Angeles, make sure you stop here. I've been to the Griddle Cafe a few times now, and I don't live in LA, in fact I am up in Canadaland. I have never had to wait for a seat either, although I sit at the bar each time, maybe thats why? Start off by getting a French press coffee, mmmm so good. The people watching is great, you never know who is going to be there, and the people sitting near you are generally interesting as well. Now the food! I've had the Barry Yellow (massive pancakes with lemon and raspberry folded in throughout), Tequila Sunrise (tortillas, refried beans, eggs, jack/cheddar cheese, tequila spiked rancheros sauce) and the Golden Ticket (banana, caramel, walnuts, streusel, more!). I managed to finish the Tequila Sunrise, but the other two are more like plates to share, just too big to finish! But the taste is awesome, the service wonderful, and I will keep coming back here.... its how it should be!!

This place is, in a word, Great. It's the quintessential brunch place--crammed full, noisy and full of deliciousness. Just what I am looking for on a Sunday morning. The waitstaff do a good job despite how slammed they get, and the guy who works the host job is out of this world. We wanted to wait for a table instead of sitting at the bar (warning, this may add 30 minutes to your wait) and he constantly kept us updated. The list of things from the "griddle" is extensive. Being completely overwhelmed (and not actually being a red velvet fan), I opted for a delicious omelet ("my soul" its called) instead. It was enormous and yes, it did touch my soul. YUM. Fortunately for me, my boyfriend eats like a 5 year old and ordered the nutella stuffed french toast. I don't know if I have ever encountered a more decadent dessert, never mind breakfast. We took half of it home and had it after dinner (score! 2 for 1!). If you are anywhere near Weho you have to check it out!

Unfortunately for my starving group and I, Saturday mornings are prime time for Griddle Cafe...and every other brunch place out there. It was an hour and a half wait (we had a group of 13) but they cleared out a cool back room for us and there we were, on little leather cube stools and benches under dim pink/purple fluorescent lights, looking through an extensive menu of pancakes, eggs, and everything brunch. Two girls and I decided to get the banana nana pancakes and the Chicago Charlie's scramble. Others ordered their own stack of pancakes, like the bluesberry, the golden ticket...yeah. A lot of pancakes. Needless to say, it was too much for us to handle. After the eggs (which were PERFECTION by the way), we were already comfortably full. But we had to try the pancakes. We HAD to. And after the first layer of our triple stack we slowly died of intense food comas; our group began to moan and groan of full bellies and tired bodies. Our banana nana was moist and full of banana - tasty and well thought out because we ran out of syrup rather quickly. The boys who ordered their own stacks managed to devour at least 1/3 before giving in to the take out boxes. The two girls and I devoured about a quarter of it before giving in. Still, others finished their pancakes, but only because they shared with 4 1/2 people. (cheaters) Quick notes: Pancakes come in stacks of 3 - if you choose to have less, it's only about $2 off. There will almost always certainly be a wait on the weekends. French press coffee is a-m-a-zing. Eggs beat pancakes here. JUST ORDER EGGS, I'M SERIOUS. Free parking at Rite Aid around the corner. Breakfast is served all day!

Want pancakes? Yes please! Granted when I come here and get the chocolate chip pancakes I take about 5 bites and i am done, but VERY worth it. One thing everyone should know if that you can order one pancake instead of the normal three. Wait can be upwards of an hour, but no one minds when you are waiting for when is in store!

Normally I would give 4 stars but there were just a few too many "ok" things for me. First off, in order to get in to this place and not have to wait like 40 minutes, you have to come when it opens, 8am. Even then you have to do a few circles around the neighborhoods to get street parking. ÊThe place is not that big and you do feel cramped with lots of chattering. If you are looking for a "read the newspaper and enjoy your morning coffee" kind of a thing, I wouldn't suggest going here. Service is slow once it gets packed so you really have to be patient. This place is known for their huge pancakes ($10~$12) that can feed like 5 people. We had 6 adults and 2 kids and ordered 4 plates. A velvet pancake, a banana-nana pancake, nutella french toast (my favorite!) and the charlie scramble (includes potatoes, bell peppers, onions and sausages). With two french coffee presses Êand 2 orange juices, the bill was about $100. They do charge 20% gratuity for a party of 6-8. It was a pretty pricey breakfast out of the norm but enjoyable cuz you can share and try different stuff. Hubby is not necessarily a fan and for me... this place is kind of like a once a year kind of thing.

Got there at 7:45am last Saturday, just before they opened. Place was full by 8:30am. Ordered the Golden Ticket and French Press Coffee. Ate 2/3. Had the super burrito from Taquerias El Atacor #11 the night before, so I wasn't in top form. I'll be back for a rematch. UPDATE 2007-11-24 Ordered: Blueberry Pancakes French Press Coffee I went back for a rematch this morning. On my first trip here, I was a little cocky and went in unprepared. I proceeded to have my ass handed to me. The gauntlet was laid down on that ignominious day. But this morning the challenge was well and truly met. Arrived at 7:40am. Sat in my car for 15 minutes, getting my mind right. As I made my way from the parking lot, through the Rite Aid next door, staff and customer alike seemed to be nodding at me in silent acknowledgment of what was about to transpire. I entered the arena and was seated in my corner of the ring (a.k.a. the counter). In this corner, in the khaki trousers, weighing in at 190lbs, hailing from the great state of New York, South Korea's favorite son, the gook who can cook, the gimp pimp with the limp, the man with the hollow leg, Chris H. And in this corner, the defending champion who needs no introduction. Sporting blue polka dots, topped with blueberry sour cream, stacked 3 high and 12 inches across, served with a forklift, accompanied with its own zip code and time zone, circumnavigated by Magellan, the king of carbs, the flour tower power hour, the Mack flap jack stack attack, more than a snack, smack it down, it will slap you back, the Griddle Cafe BLUESberry Pancakes. After 15 hard fought rounds and two pots of coffee, a maple syrup stained canvas is all that remained of the once and former champion. Apparently I'm only the 14th person in 6 years to accomplish the feat. Who's next?

This place is crazy, in the best sort of way. Ê Black Magic, Peanut Bubba, Noisette, Hear me Roar.... all sorts of amazingly unique breakfast food creations that are so wrong they are right. ÊOreos with pancakes? yup! ÊWhile we did not have that at our table, based on the success of the dishes we chose. ÊAt first, I thought I made the wise choice of french toast as the size of the pancake stacks being served were about the size of manhole covers. ÊAnd there are three on each plate. Ha! ÊThey got me -- the bread used for the french toast certainly would not have fit in any bread box I have ever seen. ÊYes, flavors and portions are a bit decadent, but presuming you dine here only once in a very rare while - indulge! ÊIt's not like you are really going to finish your plate anyway.... I hope! Def an experience worth trying! Totally concur with other yelpers - great people watching, fun location on sunset. And def. a place for celeb sightings -- Beverly Leslie was there while we dined (officially known as Leslie Jordan). ÊInside is a fun vibe, though very loud. ÊDining outside is surprisingly good tho you are right on Sunset. ÊJust be strong and don't feel too guilty about the 30+ people waiting on the sidewalk for you to leave your coveted table.

This makes it a perfect place to just order a lot of stuff and share with a group. Ahhh banana pancakes, some type of omelette and french press coffee yummmmmm Try it @ least once.

Let me lay this out for you in a few simple bullet points: 1. Split pancakes between two, if not three or four people. 2. Coffee, OJ, and sides are a bit pricier because the pancakes are absolute robbery on the diner's part. 3. Best breakfast I have ever had. The End.

Please tell me what is not to love about a stack of pancakes big enough to satisfy 4 adults, filled with anything your little heart could desire from Kahlua to bananas, served with a side of delicious french press coffee? ÊI really can't think of anything so if you do please let me know. The Griddle is probably one of the best breakfast places in Hollywood. ÊThe staff, all of which you may or may not see on the big screen within the next few years (this is a HUGE film/tv industry place), is really friendly and always gives great service despite the huge crowds that roll through there. ÊIf you go on the weekend after 10am and before 2pm be prepared to wait up to an hour for a table because it's just that damn good. Not in the mood for flapjack goodness (you must be crazy!!!) Êno need to worry there are plenty of other options on the table including some great egg dishes, and their lunch menu including sandwiches and soups isn't too bad either. To quote a competitor's tag line "Come Hungry, Leave Happy". ÊIn this case it's actually true.

ÊI think my friend summed it up when she said "How can serving this much food be legal?" ÊLOL Also, I think their REAL maple syrup may be the best I've ever had!

Does place need another raving review? Welp... it's gonna get one! ÊMy family and I were on vacation and had to try it. ÊGood God Almighty!! The FOOD: My hubbs ordered a full stack of buttermilk pancakes that came out piping hot and fluffy, they were bigger then his face! They came with real Vermont syrup, not that fake stuff. ÊI ordered scrambled eggs and hash browns that came with toast and turkey sausage. ÊMy potatoes were the perfect combination of crispy on the outside, tender on the inside and great seasoning. ÊMy son wanted lunch, so he ordered a hamburger. ÊThis was best tasting thing at the table. ÊThe best burger I've tasted from a restaurant. ÊIt was huge and juicy with huge pile of caramelized onions on it. ÊIt was accompanied by a huge side of hot, crispy, seasoned, steak fries. ÊYUMMAY! Ê The portions are OUT OF THIS WORLD BIG! You'll need to unbutton and unzip yo pants when ya leave, and then take a nap! Customer service: ÊOur waiter was a pro! He looked like he could've worked with a blindfold on. ÊAttentive, fast, funny, he was just all together on the ball. ÊI didn't even have to ask for anything, because he was always one step ahead, and the place was packed. ÊHe really seemed to enjoy his job and he was such a people person, not to mention was kinna cute! I only had a few small things that I would improve. I wished they had a kids menu, the sausage that came with breakfast was just ok and there's a long wait, but it was worth it. Ê I will definitely go back to The Griddle when I'm in So Cal again.

Amazing french toast. Amazing pancakes. I ordered the Chocolate Chip Cookie French Toast. I think it was about $11 or so. They give you a big portion! I barely finished one slice. Haha. They give you a load of whipped cream. Everything is so fresh, it's awesome. I went on a Friday at about 1pm and we had to wait 15-20 minutes before we got a table. It was pretty packed that day. Service was great. Atmosphere great. What more can you ask for?

My first time here. Dare I say "only" time? There's a lot that is good, and a lot that is bad about this establishment. The GOOD: - Amazing menu selection. Ê - Utterly unreal pancakes and french toast. Portion sizes are gargantuan. It's like a breakfast version of a funnel cake at the county fair, only larger. Ê - French press coffee, rich and dark - yum! - Excellent OJ The BAD: - The absurdly long lines (at least on a Sunday morning) - The dungeon-like interior lighting - The extremely crowded interior. No wonder the waiters all seemed harried and surly; they had to worry about narrowly averting collisons with diners and other waiters, and had to pause in their mad dash to let patrons pass by. - The single-stall ladies room (are you kidding me?!?) - The prices for stuff like coffee ($4.00) and OJ ($5.00). Yes, the coffee is french press.... but that's double what it would cost at most breakfast places. And five bucks for a glass of OJ? - They're great at sweet dishes, but not quite as good at the egg dishes. My "protein" scramble (can't remember the formal name) was so boring and bland: Egg white, spinach, diced tomato and odd little turkey maple sausage rounds, but no herbs or other seasoning. It was nearly flavorless. To say I could have made it at home myself is an insult to my cooking skills. [Tip: For an excellent protein-centric egg dish, go to Cafe Vida in Pacific Palisades, and get the Balance Bowl. Beats the pants off of this dish!] Would I go here again? Not unless this were my local hangout and I had a TON of time on my hands, neither of which is the case. TIP: Park in back of the adjacent Rite Aid. Despite the Rite Aid signs everywhere, the lot is actually shared between Rite Aid and a few other places, including Griddle Cafe. And validation = free parking (despite the confusing "$2.00 for each 20 minutes" sign).

Loved Griddle cafe. It's pretty dark inside, which is good for those stuck in some hangover hell. They play weird bluesy music. Tons of good-looking guys and ugly chicks, which struck me as odd until I realized we were in West Hollywood. We sat at the bar, which was quick seating, and we got there early, around 8:45am. Once we left around ten-ish, there was a line nearly down the block to get in. I would advise all of you to get here before the 9am crowd, because the food is great, but nothing is worth that long of a wait when your tummy is snarling and growling for food. The red velvet pancake was HUGE. It was a thick CAKE that literally encompassed the giant plate. One person cannot consume it. Unless you are like some of the 300lb people who also frequent this place and eat a stack of three. I digress. It was more cake than pancake. It was covered in cocoa powder and butter. It was too sweet, I think. I should have gone for the french toast--that looked like it needed to take a wondrous journey into my stomach. I also shared a delicious omelette--the ingredients I can't remember, but you can definitely assume that everything here tastes fantastic. But the shining star of the breakfast was not our Christian Bale lookalike waiter. It was the french press coffee. So fresh. Not an ounce of bitterness and just full of delicious coffee flavor. If I wasn't always so jittery with caffeine, I would go out and buy a french press right now, so I could duplicate the experience. Just sit there and smell the coffee. It's warm and aromatic. It's 12.95 and comes with refills.

I personally think that they have the best French Toast in town! And their French Press Coffee? Man, it is the perfect beverage to prevent a sudden attack of food coma potentially triggered by Griddle's ginormous serving. I think they make their own roast which, if this is true, earns them more points in my book. Griddle also serves a number of items and I always try to mix in some savory omelette with the sweet and the buttery. Note: It would be a good idea to actually have someone with you when attempting to order more than one item since again their servings are ENORMOUS. Of course, the place has a long wait during weekends but between the bevy of eclectic patrons and the celebrity look-alike staff (watch out for the young Ray Liotta and Josh Hartnett cutie pies serving the counter!) your time will be occupied. Definitely a good brunch place to try.

The best pancakes EVER! Massive is size and options galore! ...great thing is they also offer healthy alternatives such as cottage cheese and fruit sides. The wait (and there always is one) is bearable if you're throwing back mimosa's. ..upon request of course. Customer service is fantastic and the staff is ultra accommodating. Seating is snug but the patrons are friendly. =) They also offer cute li'l "banquet" rooms for groups. They're cozy, loungy feeling and nicely lit. Great for tourists - they offer souvenir shirts that are displayed in the back. The only thing this place is missing is a BAR to belly up to for mimosa hour. ;-) ...parking in the back (Rite Aid)

I didn't see the griddle, but I certainly tasted its flavor. Sweet, sweet decadence wandering delightfully amongst my taste-buds... But today marked my first time going to Griddles. Though I live a block away, this was the first time I'd actually entered the doors. I've convinced my "regular thang" to pick me up some breakfast a handful of times, but I've never ventured out of bed pre de noon to officially mix with the Saturday Breakfast Crowd (and a motley bunch they are). Well, I should've done it sooner. The menu is riddled with delicious diversity for the palate. And the mixture of people is pretty interesting. I saw one of those typical LA plastic women who couldn't smile if she tried (botox) and a couple of musclebound shaved head guys. Plus there were the hippie types and the out-of-towners. It was nice to actually get up in time to see the sun on a Saturday. And to mix that with a 14-in pancake and an egg-white shrimp scramble was a tear jerker...**sniff sniff** It's just so beautiful! Don't drink the green tea though...I've tasted it before. I think it costs like $4.99 for a one gallon barrel...that's real.

When I first heard of the legend of their famous pancakes I was hard press to believe how big the portions were and how flavorful the food was, but when I actually went here last week instead of studying for a final I had a feeling of worry...but check in an hour later, I could be said that I had the biggest smile on my face and a full stomach. So here's deal, I had some black magic pancakes (oreo pancakes) and some steak fries...verdict: Delicious, not doughy at all, and very tasty. Ê Ê Ê The Êfries weren't salty, oily, or burnt, but actually crispy and golden (my brother took a pic, if you want to see it) As for my brother, he got a dish with a Chicago name, and from what I saw, the dish was wiped clean, Our friend was straight beast mode, ordering black magic, cabellero burrito, and a alcoholic beverage, but he didn't finish. Service was slow and the waiter was in a rush, but I'll give him the benefit of the dont seeing how it was a full house. Overall, this is a must try.

If you wake up on a Sunday morning and have a hinkering for some pancakes, this is the place to go. ÊBut make sure to bring along 3 or 4 friends, because their pancakes fill up the entire plate - hence, they're huge - and they're stacked 3 or 4 high. ÊYou can get them loaded with your favorite topping, whether it be strawberries, or blueberries, or any of the other multiple choices they offer. And the waffles are huge too. ÊAlso if you're not quite awake, you might want to try their French press coffee. ÊIt's sure to wake you up. Ê A bit pricey for breakfast but well worth it.

This place is obscenely delicious. I've had: Saturday Morning Fever Pancakes: Yes, they're sweet, yes they're way too big, and no, never try to finish them alone. Seriously wonderful though... booze in my pancakes? Ok! Strawberries and Cream Waffle: Perfection... and not so gigantic like the pancakes. Tequila Sunrise Eggs: Awesome, though make sure you're in the mood to have chipotle... because there's a lot in here. Poached y Papas Benedict: Whoever thought to put eggs benedict on potato skins, I want to shake your hand. This is delicious. I have never been in here when this place isn't ridiculously crowded (and I've only gone on weekdays). The parking is difficult sometimes, it can take awhile to get your food, and it is LOUD inside. However, that's because it's crowded... and for good reason. HUGE bonus points for them serving coffee french press (and for the free refills). Perfect for hangover food, just take an painkiller before you go in because of the noise levels.

The best breakfast place in Los Angeles. Period. Seriously, I have their pancakes, take them home, and eat on them for two weeks! They are ginormous!!!! I've tried every kind on the menu and every single one is scrumptious. They also have this healthy thing with spinach and egg whites that rocks (much better with cheese, I warn you). The kind of coffee that is served in self-steamers that you have to wait two minutes for. Seriously, forget about refills on them (even though the menu says they are included). It's way too busy. It took me many months of going there before I even realized they also have yummy sandwiches and other lunch-type food. Awesome. One of the few places that I will happily stand in line for the food, and on weekends, there is ALWAYS a line. The only downside of this awesome restaurant is that they close for some bizarre reason at 4 pm every day. What's up with that? But so completely worth checking out. I don't wanna meet the person who was able to eat the ENTIRE pancake serving.

The Biggest and Bestest Pancakes in the world. ÊThe moment I walked into the Griddle and saw their pancakes for the first time I was blown away. ÊI knew I need to order me some of them delicious looking cakes. I have been to The Griddle multiple times and have tried The BluesBerry, The Golden Ticket, The Banana Nana and the Good Old Fashion Pancakes. ÊThey are all good and I recommend you try one of them when you go in for your first time you can't go wrong. ÊIf you not in the pancake mood you can order up their eggs Benedict they are delicious. I recommend sharing the order of pancakes they are very big and filling and worthy of at least 2 people to finish them.

This place is like crack for the pancake junkie. I'm talking monstrosities for pancakes and with almost 20 different varieties, my head almost spun into another dimension. These aren't for the light of heart either, with flavors like "A Time to Love" (pancakes filled with streusel, butterscotch chips, and caramel and topped with powdered sugar, whipped cream, and caramel). Now, I admit my appetite is not along the lines of a pro linebacker for the Chargers (yay!) but there were THREE people working on our stack and we got through about half. So note to self: split the order because there's no splitting charge! Another plus with a very minor negative: If you order coffee or tea, they'll give you your own kettle/french press. I had tea but I'm told the coffee was amazing. The downside: Expensive. My tea was $4. The coffee was actually a little cheaper at $3.60 And of course, in true West Hollywood fashion, I would venture to guess all the waiters have their headshots in their back pockets :)

Round 2... Check your vaginas at the door, grow and pair and belly up to the bar for a stomach busting breakfast. ÊUnfortunately for me, I packed my pussy and I didn't finish this time around. ÊI tried. Instead of an order of my favorite, a tall stack of pancakes, I ordered a short stack and and a half order of french toast, in large part because of our yelp reviews. ÊI'm a pancake man, but... ÊI'm a convert. ÊFrench toast for me, thank you, and, scrumdidliumptious gourmet sausage on the side. I have 2 other POIs (points of interest)... Ê1...

omgahh... DROOOOOLLLLL. I went here two days in row it was THAT good. enough said right? First time my friend and I got: Mom's French Toast and 'Some like it spicy' eggs. BOTH WERE SOOO GOOOOD. French Toast was hands down the best french toast ever. I don't even like bread but this just melted in your mouth. My friend and I about died when we took our first bite and went to french toast HEAVEN. GET MOM'S FRENCH TOAST. just do it...!! 'Some like it HOT' eggs was also delicious. The perfect combination of eggs, chicken, veggies.. they give a side of chips so you eat it like chips 'n dip. It's really really good. I LOVE eggs and this made me look at eggs and breakfast in a new angle. You won't be disappointed!! Day Two: Four of us go this time. BLACK MAGIC-- Oreo Pancakes: HUGE HUGE HUGE. My guy friend ate about 1/5 of it. Super sweet, it's like eating dessert for breakfast. GOOD but not my type of breakfast. "Say Cheese"-- Cheese Omelet was whatevers. Another friend got Mom's French Toast and died to french toast heaven.. I got the "Chicago Charlie's" Scrambled eggs.... pretty good but I wasn't orgasming in the mouth. Seemed like atypical omelet. I liked the "SOme like it HOT" scramble better. You should def go here. There might be a crowd but I didn't have any trouble sitting around 11a-12pm. Good stuff. Maybe my go-to breakfast place :)

Love this place! Parking in the rear. Same as the rite aid or whatever that pharmacy type store is next door. I have tunnel vision when my mind is on those yummy treats I'm about to consume inside the Griddle Cafe! MMMMMMMMMMmmmmMMMM!! Actually parking can be a MOFO at any time during the week even in the lot. And,yes, the wait is not short. But I'm never in groups larger than 3 and usually it's just me and one other person. So I have rarely had to wait more than 15 minutes. But I did one time wait for about 45! But all will be forgotten after to take the first bite of breakfast HEAVEN!!! Trust and BELIEVE!!! Mama's french toast is hands down the best "regular" french toast I've EVER had! I order it without the powdered sugar. cuz, for me, that's just a wee bit excessive. Sugar AND syrup? Um...no thanks...But most others seem to just take it all as it comes. If I order pancakes I always just order one pancake. Didn't know you could do that until I had been there a few times and wasted my money and TONS of food by ordering (and not being able to even come ÊCLOSE to finishing) a full stack of three! They are the size of frisbee's and a good half or 3/4 inches thick!!!! They also have alternative meat options like chicken or turkey sausage. That's plus for me because I won't go anywhere near anything with pork on it! Not cheap...but you could conceivably get two or three or 4 regular meals Êfrom one order...really.

There are only a couple of places that I have to hit up when I'm in town, and this place has just been added to the top of the list. ÊDon't be scared off by the crowd of people wrapped around the building outside because it is worth the wait. ÊBesides, we didn't wait too long, maybe 20-25 minutes for two of us on a Sunday morning. Ê Ê It was hard to decide what to order from the menu since everything looked mouth watering. ÊI ended up having the "Poached y Papas" benedict (hollandaise sauce covered perfectly runny poached eggs on top of ham and potato skins....yes, potato skins, I kid you not. ÊWhoever came up with that is genius! ÊWhat a great substitute in place of English muffins.) ÊI washed this down with fresh squeezed orange juice. ÊMy friend ordered their french press coffee. We also shared a red velvet pancake with cream cheese frosting swirled on top. ÊIt tasted pretty much like a red velvet cupcake. ÊIt was very good, but after a few bites though, it became a little bit too sweet. Ê We may have ordered too much and could have easily shared one savory dish and a pancake between the two of us. ÊInstead, we ended up taking three leftover boxes home. ÊFor the quantity and the quality of food you get, this place is well worth your money. As for our server, he was charming, attentive, and super CUTE. ÊLike a reviewer before me, he reminded me of a younger Christian Bale. ÊCome to think of it, most of the people who worked there were attractive. ÊHmm...makes you wonder if that's a criteria to work there...or maybe it's just a Hollywood thing. ÊWhat made our meal even more interesting was that we happened to be sitting across from some famous comedians. I wish I knew about this place when I was living in LA and am already longing to return so I can try all the other things on the menu.

I've been here 3 times already and loved it EVERY single time! I love the poached y papas (sp?) eggs benedict they have. Their omelets are delicious too. Haven't tried the sandwiches yet. The long wait is well worth it. Last time we went, a friend ordered the black magic pancakes (the ones with Oreos), and they were amazing! The french press coffee is also a nice touch. I really like the dark roast. Parking is usually not too bad (lot in the back near the Rite Aid). The only downside to this place is the wait. However, the food majorly makes up for it and you never feel like you're being rushed once you're seated. I truly love this place!

Griddle Cafe -- how I miss thee. ÊNot only does Griddle have amazingly large portions and delectable food, it's also located in prime celebrity-watching territory. ÊI once saw Steve Sanders there and felt the urge to tell him, "Donna Martin Graduates!" All of their pancake offerings are amazing. ÊIf you can actually finish your portion, you deserve a gold star, and you will immediately fall into a deep food coma.

Oh how I look forward to brunch each and every time I go! EVERYTHING on the menu is great! Breakfast all day plus yummy sandwiches and tacos. I like to take a big group to share cause I can never decide on just one! Some of my favorites are Omelette "Shrimp Pomodoro", "Baked potato" omelette with cheddar and bacon, "Some like it HOT" Scramble, and the "tequila sunrise eggs" To drink some mimosas or Irish coffee ;) and then to finish it off order "Mom's French Toast" or "Scotch on the Rocks" flapjacks....amazing! Besides the food being amazing, the staff is too! We always get mimosas on the house for some reason! Also, be prepared to wait for a while. If you have a friend that doesn't mind arriving early and is selfless have him get there early and put you on the waiting list. IT IS COMPLETELY WORTH THE WAIT!!!

Take note that each pancake order includes three 12-inch diameter pancakes. Highly recommend sharing an order with one, if not two or three other people. Keep in mind that the toppings and batter additions like peanut butter, cream cheese or chocolate will be very satiating too. Also sharing will keep your bill more reasonable. Our group had four entrees, three drinks and two sides and the bill came out to $70. I was shocked by how pricey breakfast turned out to be. We had half to three-quarters of our main dishes leftover. Again, think about sharing your pancakes. Pancakes were good and there are plenty of choices. The wait to be seated was twenty minutes for a holiday (July 4th) at 11a. Then another fifteen for the food. Not too bad for a busy restaurant. By the time we left the seating wait was up to thirty minutes. Suggest you come earlier than later and browse the menu while you wait.

I had the nutella french toast with brown sugar carmelized bananas on top--- I almost died from sheer delight. It's definitely done in the down-home diner style of atmosphere.

THE BEST WAFFLES IN LA! They claim to have a "secret" ingredient. I don't know what it is, but it makes the waffles taste hearty/nutty. So good with the brown sugared sour cream and strawberries! Also, portions are GINORMOUS! The waffles are the only thing that are normal in size (to me at least). But if you dare order pancakes or french toast, be prepared to get a doggy bag for 2 days of leftovers. I was amazed at seeing how much food everyone had in front of them....three pancakes stack up to the size of a BIRTHDAY CAKE! I would like to try their chili next time. They have a vegetarian black bean "espresso" chili as well as regular meat chili in all sorts of flavors and levels of spicy-ness. I noticed other people had egg white omlettes which is good for those health conscious people. Sure it's noisy, crowded, and you might have to wait 15-20 minutes for a table, but it's worth the wait for the reasonably priced menu and huge plates of food. Overall, very good comfort food!

Did I really wait outside on the sidewalk at 1:30 on a Saturday afternoon for 30 minutes to eat pancakes. Yes I did. And did I wait another 15 minutes to get get my pancakes after I ordered. Yes i did. Did I love every single bite of those huge fully flavorful hot of the griddle cakes. YES I DID! Wow! I was impressed by this place. They know how to do breakfast. I knew I was in for a treat when we placed our name on the waiting list inside. I glanced around and saw everyone's' dishes. One lady had ordered the pancakes with sweet potatoes. The presentation was fantastic. I swore they probably had to wipe the saliva dripping from my mouth as I walked out side to wait my turn for their de-lish food. There was two of us and we shared an order of the blueberry pancakes topped with a sour cream blueberry blend. It was tough to decided between all of the variety of pancake creations that were on the menu. We had to ro-sham-bo to decide between the blueberry, Teacher's pet, the raspberry/lemon cakes and another... The cakes where huge, hot and fluffy. The sour cream blend was fantastic. We ordered an extra Êside of it and they brought it right out. Of course, the two of couldn't finish it by ourselves. We maybe killed a third of the pancakes. A shame because they tasted incredible.

They don't need yet another review telling you how amazing they are. ÊSo, I'll just warn you, an order of pancakes is more than enough for three people.

People are always looking for a fun, well priced, and above all GOOD FOOD dining place in L.A. ...well, the Griddle Cafe is it! For breakfast the Griddle is a MUST DO location. If you're a regular then you already know that servings are HUMUNGUS!! Pancakes the size size of the 12" plate they are served on and you got your choice of anything from traditional buttermilk flap jacks to Tequila Pancakes!!! But my favorite is the French Toast! Four HUGE slices of Texas Toast grilled to perfection and smothered with butter and powdered sugar. Add the maple syrup and you're in business kiddo! But only order this bad boy if you're really hungry, or be sure to take a friend along to help finish up your meal. This is a place where you need to bring those relatives visiting from out of town to. It's not to much of a lunch spot (my opinion) but breakfast is a sure thing. The place is small but it's full of energy and fun folks. The wait staff is the best in L.A. (tip them well), and you never know who will be sitting in the joint...since it's in the heart of Hollywood. (Sunset and Fairfax across from the car wash). But, be prepared to wait for a table. It's not a big place, but it's worth the wait. Go check it out, you won't be disappointed.

Ê If you come here on a weekend for brunch, you might want to come early... the line is pretty long. ÊUnless you're a celebrity, they let you in right away. ÊOtherwise you'll have to wait a while.

I've had the Peanut Butter and Creme de la Creme French toast which is AMAZING! ÊLOVED IT! ÊPeanut Butter French Toast was covered with Powdered sugar and dipped in peanut butter then fried! ÊI didn't need any maple sugar and its perfect for those who love peanut butter. The Creme de la Creme is the Cheesecake version of the french toast. The topping tastes like cheesecake and it made of creme cheese mixed with whipped cream. sweet but not overly and very filling. Be prepared to share this with 4 others at least. They have 3 variants of chili that they put in their chili my omelette. I opted for the vegetarian one which was ok, good but not Grrrreat. I'm sure the meat one is better but I am trying to not eat so much meat. Portions are big, service is great with a hot waitstaff and most importantly the food is good. They are also pet friendly and brought my doggie a water bowl. ÊThe only downside is that there is always a wait but the plus side is that portions are so big it quenches that hunger pretty quickly.

I guess i should have researched the menu options more before going to the Griddle Cafe, but I ordered just the regular, plain buttermilk pancakes, because I like to judge my breakfast places by their plain pancakes. That was a huge mistake. While they give a LOT of pancake (I had half of my first pancake before giving up, and they give 3 of those monsters), the pancake was just mediocre. I guess I should have had their special pancakes, so my mistake. my boyfriend ordered one of their special omelets though (don't remember what it was called, but it was with steak) and it was really good. I also ordered a side of bacon, which was also very good. Ê The service was also pretty good. they were super busy and it took a while to get our food, but the servers were really nice. Since I didn't like my food though, i didn't really feel that great about the restaurant in general. overall, an a-ok restaurant, but I would be willing to go back to try their special menus.

A delicious brunch spot filled with pretty people. Seriously, the servers here are ridiculously attractive. But lets talk about the food. Pancakes the size of a plate (FYI, if you are poor or not that hungry, you can order just one which may be enough to totally fill you up). Ginormous omelets chock full of goodness. Yummy french press coffee. The downside -- this place is always packed (try to con one of your friends who lives close by to put your name in before you get there). I have seriously waited over an hour for my table. The other downside -- the oh so attractive servers are not always the most attentive or brightest of the bunch. Just anticipate that they will forget your water refill and enjoy the eye candy.

Wow!!! I haven't given 5 stars in a while. ÊMaybe I am just ornery or just going through a misanthropic spell. ÊOh well, regardless, I am out of it now!! Wow is all you can say of this place. 1 hour wait -- who cares. ÊThe crowd is eclectic and educated so no pains in the asses or cutting. ÊThe host had a dry sense of humor that kept people entertained and me on my toes as I heckled him. Ê:) Place is slam packe inside -- who cares. ÊThe staff is super cool and knows how to handle gaggles of people (Pictures to be loaded soon showing the action) Menu -- straight forward and amenable to many a patron. They know what they are good at and known for so it's easy to "test" the place at your pace. What we got -- (which was WAY too much for 3 people) 2 mimosas Ê-- tasted one pretty dec. OJ and coffee -- Coffee is french press (Nice detail of the joint Êand fresh coffee to boot) I got the Eggs benedict which comes on potato skins instead of an english muffin. ÊWOW!! Êflavor country. ÊSoooo good. Êthe eggs were perfect and the texture contranst betwen crunchy potato skin, firm ham, and yolky egg with Hollandaise was sublime. My sister split a protein bomb scramble with her friend. Êvery fresh and very very good. ÊI only had a bite so can't really comment much. ONE blueberry pancake. Ê-- wow -- batter is fresh and fluffy yet not dry. ÊThis particular pancake comes with blueberry sour cream. ÊAt first I made a face, but once I tried it, I understood. Êit's a perfect companion to the pancake. Per the reviews on here we had to try the French Toast. HOLY CANOLI!! Êthis FT rivaled my mothers and that's sayin' a lot. ÊWhen I try FT "outside", if you will, it's usually with Texas toast and crap. Êit's either doused in the egg mix and soggy or dry as bone in the middle. ÊThis one was indeed made wit Texas toast but PERFECT!! wow, words can't really express what happens when you eat the French Toast. ancillary niceties -- Ê6 to 7 types of hot sauce; REAL Maple Syrup; copious amounts of ketchup; Êawesome blues music piped in; and a mystery room in the back for big parties.

Some friends were visiting from out of town so I decided to take them here for breakfast. ÊIt was about a 15 minute wait on a Monday around 11am. ÊI was too afraid to tackle the pancakes so I tried the "Poached y ÊPapas." ÊNow that's a good Benedict! ÊI love that they use potato skins instead of English muffins. ÊA very nice touch. ÊThick quarter inch slice of ham, two perfectly cooked poached eggs and a delicious hollandaise sauce. ÊI added avocado which was good, but not really necessary. Little known tip: While it's not on the menu, you can order a single pancake or a 2 pancake short-stack instead of the standard order of 3. ÊI would definitely recommend doing this unless you are a competitive eater.

This is my all time breakfast/brunch/lunch place in the world. Ê I take every single friend and family member who comes to California to visit to this place. Ê I have never been anything but overjoyed with my food and service. ÊYes, there will be a long wait if you come during peak hours, yes you will probably be seated very close to another party, so know that ahead of time, bring a newspaper to read, and suck it up and enjoy the fantastic food. Ê A few of my favorite things on the menu are the peanut bubba french toast, gone shrimpin', and the broken heart burger and fries. ÊBut, I have been here like 10 times and have never been disappointed. ÊPortions are HUGE, be prepared to share or take some home. Ê Also, the guy who works the front of the house on the weekends is awesome. ÊHe seriously holds down the fort and keeps things moving, all with that trusty notebook of names.

I stumbled upon Yahoo's, "Best Pancakes in America" article and just so happened to suggest it to my best friend when I came up to visit her in California. Ê Thanks to the trusty yelp reviews for this restaurant I knew that we would have to arrive early to beat some wait time. ÊWe got to the Griddle cafe around 915 and there were about 10 people waiting outside. ÊI got us on the list and, since there were only two of us, our estimated wait time was 15-20 minutes. We ended up being seated in 10 minutes!!! ÊOne star for them. Next, since we came to try their pancakes, we just HAD to try. ÊI ordered the "Mounds of Pleasure," short stack (by recommendation from our great waitress). This consisted of chocolate and coconut and boy was it a doosey!. ÊMy friend ordered "The Golden Ticket," which was bananas, caramel, Êand walnuts. We ordered a side of bacon to help offset the sweetness of the pancakes. The pancakes were HUGE it seriously was my own episode of "KA'ILI VERSUS PANCAKE" I barely made a dent in it and I was FULL. ÊThe great thing was that there was chocolate and coconut in every bite I took from it :o) ÊIt was rich, sweet, and delicious all at once. Ê Since we can now say we've tried the famous pancakes from Griddle Cafe, we know for next time we are either, SHARING an order of pancakes with someone, or ordering one of the more traditional breakfast foods. Ê 5 stars for the creative dishes, great waitress & bussers, and short wait time. ÊBest advice: GO EARLY, you'll enjoy your meal more if your wait is short.

The Griddle is within walking distance to my house so I have been there a few times already since I moved in in June. I have to say that their pancakes are some of the best I have ever had. The good ol' fashioned ones and the red velvet are so delicious. They are monstrous in size, but you can order 1, 2 or 3. 1 is plenty since it is the size of a full plate. There is always a line, but it is organized and goes pretty quick. They have light, medium or dark roast individually french pressed coffee. Last time I was there I have a Tune Melt sandwich (The Big T Melt) and that was delicious too, though so big I took half home with me and ate the rest later on. The price is not bad either. Not super cheap and not too expensive. I am sure to go back!

In 4 years of eating out 5 or more times a week in Los Angeles, never have I so desperately wanted to return immediately to a place. Yeah, there was a wait, but YES! It was worth it. Just walked across the street and got a coffee to sip slowly after putting our name on the list. The inside was unimpressive, a never-updated diner. The menu, however, has an endless supply of modern twists on old classics. With probably 10 different types of pancakes, all of which caused instant salivation upon reading their descriptions, you'll have a hard time choosing, and please remember that the pancakes come in stacks of 3, and each one is the size of a dinner plate, so expect to take them home. I tend to prefer, at a place like this, to go for the "classic" item my first time around. If they can do the original really well, then it's worth coming back for the unique stuff. Let me tell you, Griddle Cafe does the classics well! The classic french toast was my choice and it was the best I've ever had. This shit was to die for. Please eat it. The portion was big, but I was still able to finish it off with a side of an egg and a (shared) side of bacon. I'm on a stupid master cleanse right now, but you can bet in a couple of weeks when my body is ready, I'll be back in line for breakfast here.

Yeah, the Griddle is one of the best places to go for breakfast in L.A. hands down. Parking is ample since it shares the Rite aid parking lot but this place gets SUPER crowded in the mornings. If you've been here you know what I mean. If you don't show up early expect a lengthy wait to be seated. But it'll be worth it trust me.... The thing about the Griddle is all their food is good. Never had a bad meal here suprisingly given the number of times ive been here. With pancakes the size of yoru head, how can you go wrong? Portion sizes are HUGE. You will probably never finish an entire meal here thats how big. So overall the crowd is the hipster-ish to the regulars, no real problems with anyone or service here. Dining area is pretty cramped inside since the restaurant is pretty small and spaced very awkwardly, but it's understandable how they try to cram everyone inside to accomodate the number of people waiting to eat. I recommend the pumpkin pancakes, mmm mmm good. Dont know if it's seasonal but it's the reason why i keep coming back.

I hit up the griddle for brunch on a recent visit to La-la-land. And for Griddle banana pancakes, I ABANDONED MY VEGANHOOD! Only for that one meal mind you. But man was is gratifying to order me up a stack of panCAKES stuffed with brown sugar baked naners. Never mind that I only finished 1.5 of my 3 pancakes and could neither breathe normally or eat again for 24 hours. Extra star for the attractive wait staff.

Large portions, noisy atmosphere, and there's usually a line. But don't let that stop you. Just bring some friends to help you eat those giant entrees of breakfast-y goodness! The french toast is tasty. The pancakes...enormous and yummy. Omelettes are a hit or miss cuz I'm kind of picky about what I like in my omelettes. They make great bacon...nice, thick, and slightly crunchy! I wanted their chili, but they're phasing it out and replacing it with...tacos? We had a couple of police officers sitting near us...they seemed quite happy. Overheard a couple of conversations about the film industry and some writers sending in scripts of stuff...so it's definitely an entertainment hotspot. A great place if you like noisy nooks, trendy people-watching, and food the size of your plate.

Heard about this place on good day LA. Decided to go check it out and am I glad I did. SOOOOO GOOD!!! ÊProbably one of the best breakfast places I've tried. Ê Nutella french toast- *drool. ÊEvery bite was incredibly delectable. Blueberry pancakes- I've never seen soooo many blueberries in a pancake! ÊAND they top if off with a blueberry cream! The pancakes were moist, not dry. Egg tacos-had to try this one and I'm glad I did. ÊLight fluffy eggs with pico de gallo and avocado in a corn tortilla served with beans. ÊSo simple yet so good. Ê cappuccino- I was a little "iffy" about this one, but it proved once again to be yum! It was also one of the biggest cappuccino's I've ever had! The food is definitely worth the trip and the wait. ÊThat may be one of the only downfalls. ÊIt is very busy and you are most likely going to have to wait 45min-an hour no matter what time you get there. ÊInside dining area is small and crowded and they do their best to get you in and out. ÊI would recommend looking over a menu while you wait. ÊI will surely be back!

It's a holiday today (presidents day) so decided to hit up this place to try out their famous extensive breakfast menu of french toast n pancakes. To our surprise, it was actually quite pack upon arriving at 1 pm. We get free parking here but they share it with rite aid so it took us quite a few attempts of circling around before finally securing a spot. We entered through the back door and walked through a long hall while bypassing the restrooms to get to the front. A kind gentlemen wrote our names down on the guest list and had us wait outside for around 30 minutes before securing a spot. Service was quite friendly and price range were from $10-$15. Interior decor was casual American. Kind of like a old time diner. I ordered the "Golden ticket", which was a dolled up version of the popular banana nana pancake. The difference was just an extra $1 dollar but you get walnuts, caramel n streusel. This was a pancake folded with brown sugar glazed banana. It has a strong fragrant of banana and would highly recommend it if you're a banana lover. The pancakes were huge and overshadowed the plate to a point where you only see the pancakes but not the plate. It comes in a stack of 2 and its presentation was nice as it looks fresh of the grill. The pancakes was lightly crispy and had walnuts in every bite. It was warm, fluffy and heavy aroma of buttery bananas. I like bananas but was kinda overwhelm because it was really BANANA in every bite. The other item we got was the Creme de la Creme which was french toast with powdered sugar, graham crackers and drizzles of creme cheese. It's almost like a cheesecake fantasy but on a french toast. This sounded amazing but the taste was a miss. It's pretty huge but definitely not comparable to the pancakes that just came out before it. The toppings were really good; as it was just right and were not too sweet nor heavy. Sadly the french toast itself disappointed me. My standard of a good french toast would mean that the toast itself should be very buttery but still have that freshly dipped taste egg batter and lightly grilled to a golden brown color. The toast should have that light hint of egg taste without shadowing the butter. It should be light n'crispy when you bite into it while fresh. Sadly the toast here was pretty stiff, not crispy and had no hint of egg taste to it. Overall this is a must try place because this is the best pancake, french toast experience I've ever had while living in LA all my life. I mean...don't expect this to like blow you away because afterall...pancake is still pancake. I admit that they do have some of the most amazing and creative selections. The combinations together is definitely mouth watering. Your eyes will wonder off onto the others plate as they come out. That is how tempting it is if you like sweet breakfast. I will for sure go back to try their lunch menu as I saw some great looking stuffed potatoes and mountain load of wedge fries.

Came here for lunch on a Tuesday around 12:30. Plenty of street parking as well as a free parking lot behind the restaurant (enter on Fairfax). There was no wait! I got the "Addicted to Noisella" Stuffed French Toast (~$10.95). Basically two BIG pieces of french toast w/ TONS of nutella in the middle of it and drizzled on top. SOOO good. yum yum yumm My friend got the egg white Omelette "My Soul" w/ chicken (~11.95). It was huge as well. The salsa made it refreshing and a bit citrusy which was very good! The potatoes were alright.. The waiter was super friendly and answered all our questions about what to get. Definitely want to go back to try everything else!

This was recommended to us with the warning that the wait would be totally worth it. We waited about 20-30 minutes outside for a table. We ordered a pitcher of mimosas ($35 btw, we didn't know this until the bill came). And the waiter gave us a challenge: Finish the pitcher before the food arrives and he'll give us another pitcher on the house. We tried, but failed. And believe me, I tried. :) But he went ahead and topped off our pitcher anyway. As for the food, I'm not sure if we just didn't order the right entrees, but none of us liked what we got. I ordered the Some Like It Hot scramble and it was just okay. It came with either tortilla chips or bread, but our waiter brought out both so I could see which I liked better. I liked the bread much better. My friend ordered the Eggs Benedict and really didn't like the sauce on it. I should have gone with my gut and ordered the French Toast. Maybe next time! Great service though! Oh and it is super loud inside. So beware if you're hungover from the night before.

Went on a Friday morning - just got seated right before the lunch rush. ÊIf you show up on a weekend morning, be prepared to wait for an hour, it's a super popular place. Ê French press coffee - don't be a wuss - order the dark roast, you won't regret it. ÊGreat, strong, flavorful coffee, and is a MUST with the great breakfast you're about to have. ÊOn the other hand, their hot chocolate is pretty bomb is overloaded with two handfuls of whipped cream. Ê Some Like it Hot Scramble: soooooo good, especially with the chili cheese bread. ÊIn fact, just go ahead and order an extra side of the chili cheese bread b/c it's perfect to eat with the scramble. ÊFresh ingredients, perfect melding of flavors of the pico de gallo, avocado, creamy chipotle sauce and sausage. ÊMy favorite scramble by far. Red Velvet Pancake: it's only one, but it IS the size of your skull so beware. ÊIt's a one of a kind, a must try, and is like eating a giant cupcake for breakfast. ÊIt's got a swirl of REAL cream cheese icing on top. ÊAwesome. Ê Parking is street and can be extremely painful to find. Ê Service is decent, this is the only place that maybe they're lacking. ÊI chalk it up to them being so damn busy turning over tables that you can be neglected for a little while. ÊOtherwise, the servers are nice when you do get them.

Cons: - Must find street parking. - Always a wait. - Service attitude is quite lousy. The staff was quite unfriendly. The two guys handling the wait list and seating treated us a bit like bouncers from a Hollywood Bar... - Closes at 4pm everyday. Tip: Carpool. Drop a friend off to put your name on the waiting list first before looking for parking. Tip: Come here in a large group and you will never get seated. Tip: Follow them on Twitter and send them a message with your name, arrival time, and party size. They will try to put you in front of the line. Tip: Skip the Fresh Squeezed Orange Juice. It's a small glass and it costs $5. Tip: Skip the lunch menu. You didn't come here to eat Tacos. This is a breakfast place. Order the breakfast. Even if you don't like pancakes or french toast, order it. Tip: Plan a trip to the gym afterwards, to avoid stroke or heart attack. Bottom Line: Griddle Cafe is the perfect breakfast joint for those who want to go right back to sleep. The food here will put you straight back into a food coma. The pancakes and french toasts here are among the best I've ever had. I felt compelled to subtract one star for the sub-par convenience and lousy service. With the long wait, limited seating, and lousy service, ordering take-out here might not be a bad idea. But if you're hungry and don't mind the wait and the lack of service, sit down and have yourself some nice french press coffee to go along with the massive pancakes and french toasts. You won't regret it.

I love the Griddle Cafe and have been going back for breakfast as often as I am able to indulge myself. ÊGranted if you go on a Saturday or Sunday morning, you might have to wait a bit, but they turn around tables as fast as they possibly can and get you seated. ÊThis is when it's an advantage to be dining by yourself, because there's almost always a seat for one available at the counter. I have never eaten anything but the original waffle with a side of bacon well done. ÊThat's because the first time I had the original waffle with a side of bacon, it was so delicious that it became a food I crave. The ambience of the place reminds me of the South. ÊPeople at the counter will sometimes talk to one another...complete strangers talking, which is *gasp* such a rarity in Los Angeles that it's worth noting. ÊThe servers and staff are relaxed and friendly. ÊAnd once they've gotten to know you, if you're a regular, they'll call you by name. ÊAnd if you're me and eat the exact same thing...they'll remember your order. Ê If I'm feeling down and want to indulge myself, breakfast at The Griddle Cafe is a day brightener for me. ÊParticular kudos to Alex, Kevin, and Michael...all of whom make me feel like a valued customer.

I wish they had a place like this up North because I would frequent it very often. The food is like no other-- huge portions and unique breakfast combos. We ordered the (sorry, I don't remember the actual names of the dishes) french toast w/ nutella smothered on it and it was really to die for. The other dish we had was like eggs benedict except instead of an english muffin on the bottom it was potato skins. The pancakes we saw that people had ordered were HUGE-- I've never seen pancakes this big. There is usually a long wait, but we went on a weekday and it wasn't too busy so we didn't wait too long.

So the pancakes are ridiculous. The other reviews have established that. When we left, I saw a man sorting through the trash looking for recyclables to add to his shopping cart of cans, so I thought I'd ask him if he was hungry, He was, so I felt slightly less badly about wasting all that money, a styrofoam to go container, and so much food. ÊIf I went back, I'd order the French toast with Nutella (which is what Kathy ordered) or the tacos that Justin ordered. We were curious about the chili, so we took one to go. It was the garlic chicken one, which was way too expensive for the portion size (we got the cup for like 8 bucks) but it was odd and strangely addictive. And the fresh chips that came with it were yummy. The coffee is also very expensive but worth it-- French press right there at the table and tasty. A note about the waitlist: don't mess with the guy running the wait. He will call your name once, and if you don't answer immediately, you're dead to him (his words, not mine). We didn't hear him call "Kathy for three" and someone else pretended to be us, so when we asked if we were soon, he said, "I just sat Kathy for three" and when we assured him we were the Kathy party, he actually went to the table to kick the imposters out. They had already ordered, so he let them stay, but he was not pleased. They got us in right away at the counter. I wish I could have dealt with the wait at Applebee's like that! There is no ass-kissing at the Griddle. I found myself watching a tall drink of water in a Notre Dame cap serving some of the outdoor tables. I hope he's a wanna-be actor and that he makes it, just so I can watch him again one day.

The Griddle is definitely a MUST STOP place if you're in L.A. ÊThe food is amazing and the atmosphere is cozy. When walking in from the back, you have to take a peek in the 'VIP' room, cause you never know what celebrity is gettin' their grub on! Food: Pancakes and French Toast are B.I.G. and amazing. Service: Was spot on, the few times that I've been there... Venue: Cozy and crowded...long wait, but worth it.

Went here today and Im soooo glad i did. I ordered the french toast noiselle (with nutella) and damn! it was good. It tasted more like a dessert than breakfast. It came with a huge slice of french toast, stuffed with nutella and whipped cream piled on top. ÊIt was so simple, but it just tasted so perfect... I would drive down to LA for the breakfast any time, which i will now that i got a taste. My total for just the french toast came out to about $15.00 including tax and tip. This place is kind of pricey, but its definitely worth it. Service is good, small place. Parking is on the street. Highly recommend!

Took my dad here for a breakfast treat and was lucky enough to be able to go in the middle of the week at about 10:30 a.m. so, while it was still crowded -- we were able to get a seat no problem -- a crowd really started to form when we left however. Had the peanut bubba -- and it was pretty amazing -- my only complaint was the amount of whipped cream they put on it -- I pushed nearly all of it aside because it was just TOOOOO much sweetness for me (and I looove sweet). My dad had their ham and eggs (hunger pangs) and he said it was pretty good... and he, not knowing the portion sizes, also ordered blueberry pancakes which came topped with blueberry yogurt. I had a bite of them, and they were OKAY... my dad really liked them though... which was really all that mattered. I also had a side of potatoes -- those were pretty darn amazing.. Yeah, A LOT of food -- and didn't come close to finishing... I think our tab ended up being just around $50 for the two of us. A pretty high-profile star was dining there, and everyone was really cool about it -- no fanfare or craziness -- so we could dine pretty much without interruption... HOWEVER -- it is INCREDIBLY loud when it's busy... and there were times I had to yell to talk to my dad. Service left something to be desired... but I'm pretty forgiving... considering the food is awesome and it was fairly busy... I would definitely go again, just for the yumminess... I can forgive whatever minor negatives there were...

The answer to why America is fat. ÊThe surface area of one pancake = the size of a human head (or a pie X radius (4 in.) squared.) ÊOne order at Griddle's = 3 of these pancakes. After hearing about the crowd, me and my pal decided to hit up this joint right at 7:50am on a Sunday. ÊPeople were already waiting outside for the cafe to open! ÊBut we didn't have to wait, except for the cafe to open. ÊAs a result, I had to order the dark roast and my friend tried the Irish Creme Coffee. ÊA few sips and we got our fast metabolisms revved up for the main course. I tried a little bit of "black magic" and sank my fangs into the Oreo-crumbed 'cake. ÊMy friend nabbed the "golden ticket" and had a mouthful of the brown-sugared-banana-ed-carameled-walnutted-?streuseled delight. Both were very hearty and a pleasure to have inside my belly. ÊWe also ordered a side of bacon. ÊSurprisingly, the large strips of pork had very little fat and grease.

I hate to do this...but I totally don't get it! I woke up really early last weekend so I can go to this place before the wave of people got there. The place was cool and everyone seemed to be enjoying their breakfast. I already knew what I was going to order because I looked at the menu several times before coming and read so many good reviews. My boyfriend got the Good Ol' Fashioned Pancakes, and I got the "Peanut Bubba" Crunchy French Toast w/ a side of bacon. We also ordered a French Press Coffee which was really good. The food on the other hand was just OKAY....nothing special. The first few bites were good, but the portions were ginormous. There was no way we could finish our food before it gets soggy, but at the same time you don't want to waste it...so we packed it to go. I rushed to my parents house to try to get my little brother to eat it. Normally he'll eat anything I give him, but he simply was not interested. The french toast was way too soggy from the whip cream that was on top. My dad on the other hand decided to eat Êthe pancakes...or at least attempted to. He commented that it was not that great. Next thing I know, he tossed the left overs on the ground in the backyard, saying, "I'll give these to the birds!" I thought that was hilarious. What's even funnier was my dog Chloe. She ran out to check out the goods that my dad had thrown away. She sniffed it, and quickly rejected it. She buried it right away...and I doubt she was saving it for later. So that was my experience at the Griddle Cafe, and the AFTERSHOCK that preceded thereafter. I so wanted to LOVE this place....but it definitely was a miss for me. =( The bacon was good though, and so was the coffee, but that's about it!

After reading the reviews of this place, I decided that I had to go. We got there around 11:30ish on a Saturday morning. There was this huge line, but I think we caught the end of the rush. Quote for wait time was 20 minutes, but we were seated in a much shorter time. The host was really friendly, but our server was abrupt. I'm not sure if it was because it was a busy hour or something, but he was a bit rude. The menu boasts of trying to customize to the customer. I asked if we could get a smaller order of the fries or have the chili on just half of the fries. An abrupt "No" was the response. Onto the food. The Charlie-something wasn't very good, but that could be the fact I don't particularly like scrambled eggs. The Devil's Delight (chocolate french toast) was okay, the crust area was overcooked. Some of the other dishes looked divine, the sandwiches, eggs benedict, and corn bread. I'm giving this place three stars, because A) It is pretty pricey. B) I like more variety in my dishes. Yeah the portions are huge, but I'd like to get pancakes and some eggs included.

Great breakfeast place. ÊHonestly the french toast is semi orgasmic. Êthe coffee is served in individual presses and did i mention Êthe French Toast????? Ê Portions are HUGE! ÊI'm a good eater and i've not been able to finish a plate yet, gotten close but not a full finish. ÊNever ordered anything and been disappointed. Ê The only reason i gave it 4 instead of 5 is the incredible crowds that develop in the prime hours and the very limited outdoor seating. ÊWait staff is good. ÊMost are friendly, only one bad experience in my 10+ visits, though they seem to be hired on a measure of convential beauty. ÊIt is LA though i guess. Multiple TV's playing different channels.

Okay, I was next door at the DGA for a filmmaking conference, and decided to try this place out. When you order the pancake, just a word of warning: Êthe pancake is HUGE!!! ÊAnd it goes to the very edge of the plate. ÊI ordered three, and should've gone with just two. ÊIt was so big, and so good. ÊThere was a blueberry sour cream on top of the pancake, which went very well with the pancake. Great service, and fast, and the coffee was fantastic.

The Griddle should be a go-to on your list. This place is so good and the menu is large. I came here with a few friends one Sunday morning and we decided to each order something different and share. I recommend using the "Sharing" strategy so you can try a little bit of everything. A few things that were delicous.....The Shrimp and Pesto Scramble, The "Regular" French Toast, and the pancakes are phenomenal. The eggs benedict was actually just Okay but I'm a benediction addict so I have pretty high standards. Expect a wait of about an hour at this place but it's well worth it if you manage yours and your friends expectations. Put in your name, shoot across the street for a coffee, and just people watching on Sunset until your name is called. You will be one happy camper once you leave this place in addition to being unproductive the rest of the afternoon.

RED VELVET PANCAKES! It was definitely worth the 30 min wait in line for the red velvet pancakes. From my understanding it is only available on certain days- so be sure to call first for its availability. You can't go wrong! Other than that, the omelet that we ordered was just OK. It wasn't anything special. Also, be careful with ordering too much.. their portions are HUGE!

I've been wanting to try this place sooo badly. ÊI only like to carbo load for breakfast/lunch once a month because normally I like to splurge on dinner. ÊSo, when the time finally came around that I was craving carbs in the morning, my friend, who is always waiting for me to want carbs, was excited and let me choose the place since he was just happy to be getting any carb action. ÊIt was big portions at the Griddle Cafe for me. I had the Peanut Bubba and he had the Bluesberry pancakes. ÊWe ordered a side of turkey sausage since we knew we'd need some salt to help us eat more sugar. ÊOur server was super nice and the food came out quick quick quick. ÊIt was also 10am on Saturday - no wait and we got a booth. ÊThe Peanut Bubba was pretty rich and sinful, but not as rich and sinful as the POLAR BEAR at 26 Beach (that comes with ice cream!!). ÊThe Bluesberry was enormous and pretty tasty, but it got old pretty quick. ÊWe had to re-energize our taste buds with the salt of the sausage and then we were able to keep on trekking through the vaste wasteland of carbs, carbs, and more carbs. All in all, the food was good. ÊNothing to dream about (like my recent trip to Mastro's) but then again, I have never been too impressed with breakfast foods. ÊI highly suggest ordering some salty stuff to balance out all that sugar. ÊAnd, I am the last person to o-d on sugar.

Here's the thing: do you like pancakes? ÊDo you wake up sometimes and think, I want pancakes with things in them, bananas perhaps, or maybe just butter and syrup? ÊAnd you're excited and then you eat them and are sated for the month? Or do you love pancakes? ÊIf you were on a desert/dessert island, would you want pancakes as one of the 3 types of food you were allowed to bring with you? ÊCan you eat your weight in pancakes? ÊWhen you read the New York Times do you just see pages of "Pancakes (pancakes) -- Pancakes pancakes pancakes. ÊPancakes, pancakes. ÊPancakes"? ÊI do believe that people like you exist, so: ...if you're a crazy pancake enthusiast, please go to the Griddle and do not even bother reading my review. However, if you just LIKE pancakes (and if you maybe even prefer bacon and just want a vehicle for syrup), you should maybe think twice about your trip to Griddle Cafe. ÊI like pancakes. ÊI ordered some stellar-seeming pancakes, the Banana Nana variety if you must know. ÊThe first bite: aces. ÊThe second bite: pretty good. ÊThe third bite: I was done. ÊThat's the tragedy. ÊThese pancakes are so big, but they're not the kind of thing you want to take home and stick in the fridge and revisit. ÊNo, these specialty pancakes are ephemeral -- they exist for a delicious moment, and then you do not want to see their dirty mugs anymore. ÊThey vanish into the ether. ÊYou can get on with your life. But not if you've just paid for a pancake you'd have to put in a freezer bag and ration out to yourself to ever finish; and you know, you feel kind of guilty sending it away, because it was mere folly to begin with. ÊThis is not sustenance! ÊThis is pancakes! ÊYou don't want to mess with this size of pancake. ÊThese are not follies, not treats. ÊThey want to be your dinner, but they'll always just be enormous pancakes to me.

I've only been once, so I can't say too much about their other foods, but frick, are their pancakes amazing. Bigger than your face, 3 stacks high, loaded with heart attack goodness. Breakfast may get your day started, but don't expect to get a boost of energy after eating Griddle pancakes. It has quite the opposite effect, inducing food coma. I went with 4 buddies and we were way too ambitious in ordering 4 different kinds of pancakes and 1 kind of french toast (creme de la creme, Hello fanciest french toast i've ever had. Goodbye Burger King french toast dunks). We also "ate" oreo, blueberry, boysenberry, and golden ticket--rightfully named, my eyes pretty much lit up as if I'd just discovered Wonka's golden ticket, sweet, nutty, caramel goodness. Though they are large, the cakes are a bit pricey but worth it every once in a while. I'm excited to try other items on their menu. Parking and seating seem to be the biggest problem because it's understandably crowded. Service was good but a little slow. Try to go during down times, if there are any...

CAUTION: ÊThis is a rich meal on its own. ÊIt's dessert at nine in the morning. The meal is so rich that the whipped cream is an experience on its own.

My favorite Breakfast in Los Angeles! The Griddle specializes in two things: Pancakes the size of a large plate and Chili. Yes, I'm aware those are a strange two things to specialize in, but no place in L.A does either better. ÊTypically, you'll need to wait outside for a short time until they can seat you, but they are very efficient and the wait is never that long. Ê As you wait, you will be able to pick out who has come to The Griddle before and who has not based solely on their pancake order. If they only have 2 gigantic, platter-sized pancakes on their table, they ordered the short stack. That means they frequent the Griddle and know how big their pancakes are. If you see 3 of these abnormally size Griddle Cakes on a plate that literally are now bigger than many birthday cakes, you know they are first-timers that ignored the waiter's warning about the size of the pancakes. Happens every time. Once you get in the restaurant you will see their large Chili board broadly displayed for the diners to see. It lists all of the several Chili's they are serving that day and under what category of spiciness that chili falls under. ÊWhen you order the chili omelette (which you really should do) you can pick from any of the listed daily chilis. But Chili and pancakes are not all they do perfectly. ÊYou can order French Pressed Coffee with free refills and they make one of my favorite Eggs Benedict in the world. ÊThey are served on Potato skins instead of English Muffins. (Never said this was a health food place, did I?) If you haven't been here yet, now's the time. Hell, I think I need to go tomorrow after writing this.

Came here on Black Friday and got seats right away at the counter, hurray! It made it easy to strike up conversations with friendly neighbors :) We started with some great coffee in our individual french presses, which is always a great touch (and free refills!). It took a lot of debate, but boyfriend & I finally decided on splitting THE GOLDEN TICKET (buttermilk pancakes w/ banana, caramel, streusel, walnuts) and a side of pork/apple SAUSAGES. The pancakes were even bigger than we'd thought.. we weren't even able to finish half of it. They were delicious pancakes, but it's a whole lot of the same flavor to stomach. And they aren't great as leftovers. Still a damn good value though, at about $11.The sausages were good, though not very flavorful. Everything else that came out of the kitchen looked really yummy too... We'll have to come back at some point, hopefully with an army of friends to share the huge portions with. OH parking lot in the back = awesome

ÊThe Griddle is a Three-and-a-Half. Ê Everyone knows the food here is delectable. ÊWhen my inevitable fall from grace happens, it will be fed with bacon from The Griddle.

Another restaurant that is only minutes away that I've just recently ventured to. ÊLocated right next to the Rite Aid and the Directors Guild this is a cafe with ample parking in back. Ê Decided to head on over on a Sunday at around 10. ÊParked in the Rite Aid lot behind and walked in through the back entrance. ÊWalking up the ramp...be sure to hold your breath as the stench from either the dumpster or the smell of urine may knock you out. Ê Walked inside and headed to the front to put our name down. ÊLuckily we only required a table for two but noticed how packed this place was. ÊLuckily we only waited for around 15 minutes before we were seated. Opted for the hoagie omelete for the savory dish:(http://www.yelp.com/biz_É). ÊThe sausages were tasty but was disappointed with the fact that the eggs were not cooked together with the ingredients. ÊI also would have liked the onions to have been sauteed a little bit longer. ÊStill a decent omelete but don't think I'll be going back for one. For the sweet dish, we ordered the addicted to noisella (http://www.yelp.com/biz_É). Ê ÊWho can say no to nutella sandwiched in between french toast? ÊThis was the highlight of the meal. ÊFor people who can't handle sweet dishes....you may want to reconsider ordering this one. Will definitely head back to try some of their pancakes.

Been here a few times before. I forget how annoyingly packed it can get. I remembered how parking is always horrendous and so we ended up parking about a block away. Ê Upon arriving, we noticed the line was long. We walked in and we placed our name on the list. The name was like allllllllllll the way down on list too. We barely crunched it in on the bottom. Geesh, whatever, we are hungry and we can wait. Well an hour later we get seated and sat at the counter. We were like, could we have just signed up for the counter from the beginning and got seated quick? the host's answer was "sorry, we are very busy" and walked away saying "enjoy". WTF? fine, whatever, we are hungry and did not want to ruin our meal. So I order the banana nut pancakes. I was like, maybe I should not but I think today I can finish them all. HA...yeah right. I think i left half the plate and my friend who ordered the french toast left most of it too. I was glad she ordered the french Press Coffee at least. That was good and we pretty much drank all of it. I noticed the fellas next to me had ordered some omelette mix with potatoes and veggies and stuff that was immensely large. When served the guy's face was in surprise of how much food was served. My mouth dropped and almost laughed. Seemed like everyone when served laughs at the amount of food stacked on a plate I started thinking to myself. how much food do they actually throw away here? Jesus! Ê Although, the pancakes were good. I can't help but to think that the entire rave or hype about this place is solely the serving sizes. nothing more. The food is somewhat mediocre, say the least. i think i have had better pancakes at Denny's Anyhow, i was sorta disappointed but at the same time satisfied. I dont think i will come back here again. and it is not about the food but i think mainly because of the crowd and the pretentious crowd that seemed to fill t he place.

Went for brunch around 1pm on a Saturday, had to endure a 30 minute wait so walked around in the Sun for a bit. Came back and were seated pretty quickly, spent 15 mins staring at the menu and attempting to be discreet whilst watching what my neighbors' were eating. I have never seen bigger stacks of pancakes in my life. NOT the easiest decision to make, faced with the menu, everything looks so good (am not used to having dessert for breakfast though, which is what most of the 'breakfast' options seemed to be). Awesome food, quick service, cool atmosphere, but if you are not familiar with American portions, be careful, this place is generous! Will definitely go back when I am next in LA!

Breakfast was delicious!! However, when we drove by the crowd looked big, so we called. We were told the wait would be no more than 20 minutes, so despite our better judgement, we parked and put our name on the list (again told only 20 minute wait). After waiting about 45 minutes we finally got a seat inside. It was very busy, very crowded, and we could have become best friends with the people sitting next to us because we were so close together! Waiter finally came and acted like he had better things to do than wait on us . . . but after waiting 45 minutes, we were starving!! We ordered the 'Teachers Pet' pancakes (buttermilk pancakes with cinnamon apples cooked right in) and 'Hunger Pangs' (three eggs, a slab of ham, and delicious potatoes). The food was so good!! Almost worth the wait! Tip for future diners . . . if there are only two or three of you, order one item on the menu and share. The portions are huge :)

Oh my god could these pancakes be any bigger? Made me feel like I turned into a little kid and the waitress was my mother yelling at me to finish what was on my plate. It was chaos trying to find a seat but once I did then it was all about deciding which pancake to have. Choices choices choices. It was pretty noisy and crowded while I sat in there and didn't really feel like a place I would want to go to relax and have some breakfast on a lazy Sunday morning. I gave it three stars instead of four because I couldn't help feel I was wasting food after I only ate a 1/8 of my pancakes. I like the flavors but not the size. If they had an option to order them in a smaller portion then they would go up in my book.

Hmmmm...I don't know what I can add to 400+ reviews, but I'm going to give it a shot because I LOVE breakfast food!! My DH and I came here for breakfast today and it was definitely worth all the hype! We got here about 9 am (Saturday morning) and there was no wait. It was busy inside but we were seated right away wit awesome service. I had the Apple Cobbler French Toast and it was amazing!! My DH had the short stack of Banana Nana pancakes which were good. We also shared the 2 egg breakfast with bacon. I had to dock them one star because the bacon wasn't crisp and the eggs were a bit over done. I have to say that they are probably better known for their griddle menu (hence the name) than their egg dishes. Wished we lived closer...we would frequently visit!

Their pancakes could suffocate a small infant. They're also sweet enough to give you 2-3 cavities before you leave. But if you're looking to forget that diet and treat yourself to dessert for breakfast, this is the place to go. Expect an hour wait on weekends, but it's worth it.

This is as good as it gets for big tasty breakfast food. The pancakes are as big as your head. I had a pumpkin pancake as a splurge for a my birthday. ÊONE pancake ladies is enough for you and your friend. There is whipped cream and pumpkin pie filling on it. This is my special occasion breakfast place, kind of divey and one of the coolest spots for breakfast on Sunset. Go early or you will not get a seat in a timely manner, this place gets packed after 10 am on saturday mornings.

This is the spot for an LA breakfast- alive and carefree, there's so much energy Êin this place! Don't come here if you are in a rush. Seating is cozy- shoulder to shoulder cozy- but it's so loud in there that the coziness actually has a purpose. Not the most aesthetically pleasing place but you easily forget that once your food arrives. The portions are large so arrive hungry-scratch that, with a burning hole in your stomach. I had the "Poached y Papas"- but I should have had the "Addicted to Noisella" aka the Nutella stuffed french toast- absolute heaven on a plate.

I woudn't call this a breakfast joint per say as its menus includes burgers, tacos, sandwiches, and even cocktails. Also, many of the breakfast items are so darn sweet they border dessert status! You walk into this place and immediately I feel like a sardine. People squished everywhere...tables are too close together....everyone is trying to talk over everyone else. Its hectic and its loud. I even saw the busboy drop 2 plates JUST as I was waiting for a table and no one flinched. Like I said..the menu is very expansive, but you can't come to a place called griddle cafe and not get something that's on the "from the griddle" part of the menu right? So I got the "Hear Me Roar" pancakes (strawberries&frosted flakes) and the "Cabarello" breakfast burrito. The pancakes were unique. I will give them that. Frosted flakes? Who came up with that idea? They were (like EVERY darn person says) giant sized. However, I noticed that they were kind of dry and the fact that there were frosted flake in them only exaggerated the dryness. They also put a SMALL dollop of whipped cream which I thought was weird given the actual size of the pancakes. The breakfast burrito was large too but the only side that came with them were SUPER SALTY chips (boo!). The burrito itself was yummy and was a nice break from the pancake taste. I don't think this place is like the holy grail of breakfast joints...but its a fun atmosphere if you want to be apart of the hustle and bustle. It's also fun trying to see the inventive pancake ideas they have and giving them a whirl. I'd be cautious though...there will be LONG wait lines if you come at traditional hours and parking may drive you so insane you just decide to go somewhere else. Griddle Cafe...I'll be back...but this time I will bring 2+ more friends to help me eat your gigantic cakes.

Went here with my brother and it is definitely worth the wait! You cannot go here and not order the french toast! Arguably the best french toast that I have ever had! (And trust me, I've had some really good french toast like Sears in San Francisco) The eggs benedict was also good, but it is different. It doesn't come on an english muffin! It comes out with four potato skins, a large slice of ham, and poached eggs. The cool thing about that is it is very easy to share but I think I would prefer an english muffin to potatoes.

after a night of debaucherous hedonism, the party doesn't have to stop there. Self indulgence continues at the Griddle Cafe. All the food is heavy, packed with flavor. Just ask for syrup on the side. Of course, parking is a huge issue, so go on off-peak hours or try to park at the parking lot in the Director's Guild of America next door. Across the street, you can park at the La Salsa/Coffee Bean lot, but it is a paid lot. But you can always grab coffee after your meal in the Coffee Bean for some celebrity watching in Perez Hilton's "office".

Oh my god, this place was AMAZING. Most of the portions seem ridiculously enormous but I ordered the Apple Cobbler French Toast and the portion size was just perfect.

Good things come to those who wait. Yes, you will wait a while to be seated, but it is worth it. You better be hungry because the portions are HUGE. Not a single item on the menu has disappointed. My favorites: Poached y Papas Benedict, and Addicted to Noisella French Toast. Pro tip: do not order a full-stack of pancakes. A single pancake will do.

Today the Griddle taught me a few things about how to make the world a better place . I want to share them with you 1) i would like all potato food items to be in BRICK form 2) i would like 3-8 different types of hot sauce on the table at all times, all of them of the EXTREMELY hot variety 3) Pancakes should be no smaller than john maddens head. 4) the clean plate club should have a half plate club clause for meals at the Griddle 5) coffee should make your insides want to be on your outsides for a split second when you drink it but then should make you feel like you cant live without it. 6) private bathrooms 7) sometimes all you need is one meal a day. 8) eggs really do go with EVERYTHING 9) all sausage should contain tequila fin.

A great breakfast place is such a wonderful treat because I feel that there aren't that many 'great' breakfast places around in comparison to lunch and dinner locales. ÊWhen I first arrived at Griddle Cafe, I was a bit horrified to learn that there was a line waiting for us (along with the parking situation). ÊHowever, first impressions are more than deceiving and Griddle Cafe is a great breakfast/brunch locale that is overloading with food and flavor. Ê Griddle Cafe has a pretty expansive menu filled with breakfast and lunch (and I guess dinner) items of all sorts. ÊHowever, I was told their breakfast was pretty sweet so I focused on that on this run. ÊTheir breakfast menu consists of a variety of pancake themes and egg/skillet themes. ÊI had the 'Tis the Season' for about $10.50ish which had a great pumpkin flavor to some gigantic pancakes. ÊMy gosh, I haven't seen pancakes these huge in the US at least and they are more than good enough to feed two people. ÊThe pancake itself was delicious though with a great pumpkin flavor that wasn't overpowering or too sweet and had some cream and pumpkin sauce I believe on top to make it the complete package. Ê(Condiments are also there from salt/pepper/maple syrup). ÊMy friend ordered the 'Gone Shrimping' dish for $11.50ish which had eggs mixed with shrimps and chick peas. ÊAlthough not as intimidating as the large pancakes, there was a decent portion and a fairly good taste to the eggs. Ê The drinks, admittedly, were a bit more lackluster for our take. ÊI had the orange juice for $4.00 which was fresh squeezed although I really felt it was overpriced eve for its decent size and taste. ÊMy friend had the toffee coffee which was a bit too sweet and oddly flavored. Ê The decor of the restaurant really has that Highway 60 diner type of feel and although room is tight, it never feels that I didn't have enough room to maneuver around. ÊThere were both booth and table seats for larger parties. Ê There is a bit of a wait when I arrived around 1pmish. ÊSince the restaurant is so jam-packed with customers, they do have lines outside (separated into two-somes and three or more parties). ÊDon't let this dissuade you too much though as we got in in about 15-20 minutes. ÊThe service was also pretty good with regular check-us and friendly chatter. Ê Parking-wise, I went a few streets down (on Sunset) and found some free parking in the inner roads. ÊSure you'll have to walk a bit but it does beat having to pay a bit for street parking. Ê All in all, Griddle Cafe is big on its love for food and backs it up with great taste. ÊThe line and the drinks kind of made me feel a little iffy at first but the entire package is one made out of maple syrup and awesome-ness.

Hands down, my favorite breakfast place in the world. I could die for their oreo "Black Magic" pancakes. So good! Almost everything I've tried on their menu has been delicious. My favorite egg dish is the fiesta scramble. It has a great spicy kick and those tortillas are fantastic. And the griddle potatoes, crispy on the outside, soft potato deliciousness on the inside. It's my favorite breakfast potatoes that I've had anywhere. There is a bit of a wait sometimes, but it's usually not too bad. I went around 10:30 AM on a Saturday and the wait was like 10-15 minutes. It's always packed inside and pretty loud and boisterous, and even though that's not my ideal dining situation, it does add a certain amount of character to the place. The real downside I think are the HUGE HUGE portions. One order of pancakes can feed 3-4 people! I wish they offered like half portions, cause I never finish anything that I order. Aside from the potatoes. I clean that stuff up.

Excuse me, waiter-- there must be some kind of mistake; you seem to have brought me the order for the ENTIRE TABLE. Three pancakes here is seriously too much food for 97% of the people living in LA. Yet...you want to eat everything on the menu. Again, and again-- ÊThese are the kind of pancakes where you look at them and frown, because you just can't figure out how you're going to get syrup and butter on them with out it spilling onto the table. There honestly wasn't a single thing on the ridiculously long list of elaborate pancakes and french toast that I wouldn't order, given the opportunity. The service was great and friendly all around-- no small feat considering how packed it was. In fact, the only drawback about this place is how busy it can be on the weekends. Things get fast and furious, and yeah-- you'll totally have that typical 35 minute L.A. brunch wait. But my lemon and raspberry pancakes made it soooo worth it. And the complimentary-just-because second cranberry and champagne drink didn't hurt, either.

Griddle Cafe is easily one of the BEST breakfast places in town. The food there is delicious and the staff and service is also friendly. The french toast and 'banana-ana' pancakes are DELICIOUS! They have several varieties of pancakes and french toast and I can't wait to return and try other flavors. Their food comes in HUGE portions so make sure you go with an appetite or plan to share. Also, if you're going on the weekend, be prepared to wait for a few minutes.

This place far exceeded my expectations. Came here on a Sunday afternoon and as expected, there was a long wait. However, it took less than 30 minutes. This is a really small cafe and they crammed as many tables as they can. We had the please of sitting at the bar. The service was excellent, the waiter was really chill and nice. While we were waiting for our order, we were scouting at other tables to see what everyone else was ordering. Then I see this huge plate of red sea and I couldn't take my eyes off of it. I finally proceeded to ask the couple next to me what it was and she responded with "Red Velvet Pancake." My small asian eyes immediately got big and I just had to order it!! So I asked our server and he said the special menu ends at 3pm and it was about 3:10pm. He asked the inside kitchen and they gave it an OK!!! I know their french toast is the "must order" but I can't get myself to pay $10+ for a plate of egg dipped toast. So I ordered the next best thing, the "Some like it HOT Scramble" with chili cheese toast and boy was it GOOD! The tequila spiked rancheros sauce was really goood. The sausage were huge chunks so they weren't skimping out on the meat. My friend ordered the "Muscle Bound Scramble," and I wasn't a big fan of it. Only because it wasn't as sauce-y as I like it to be. Ok so the RED VELVET PANCAKES! WOW. they were DELISH! It's exactly what you would imagine it to be, a huge red pancake. It looks like a flat red velvet cupcake and tasted like one too!!! MMM. It was so sweet that there's no need for syrup at all! There's cheesecake frosting swirls on top. I need to come back when they have this special menu again...

I will get out of bed with no matter how few hours of sleep to eat breakfast at the Griddle Caf. ÊI've been there several times and the food and service is consistently great. This place offers a wide range of breakfast treats both savory or sweet, in portions large enough keep you satiated for the entire day. ÊAnything you order is fine - it's all delicious and served with attentive and perky servers. You don't have to worry about leaving with that sleepy feeling as they serve delicious coffee in French presses - ouiiiiii. My recommendation is to go on a weekday morning as the lineup on weekends is discouraging.

So dropped by this place on a friday afternoon, after seeing the reviews I expected a long line, but the place was a little less than half full. I know better than to be deterred by things like that, so we took a seat. There is a whole page on the menu for toast. Not breakfast...not breakfast and sandwiches...just one oversized page Êwith every kind of french toast you can think of...and some you would never have in your right mind, but after seeing that an Oreo French Toast is available, you might quickly change your tone. Now I dont know what everyone is saying that the French Toast isnt supposed to be finished in 1 sitting, its meant to take home...F THAT! I ate mine, some eggs and still had room for some hash browns and to help my girlfriend with her plate. You guys are weak!! Sure its more than you're probably used to, but sometimes...just sometimes you get your money's worth and then some! I had the Peanut Bubba french toast, and I wish I had taken 4 orders of it home, cause its been almost a week and I crave it everyday. We also had the chocolate chip french toast, like the peanut bubba, it was tasty...rich, but not overwhelmingly so...specially paired with some eggs or griddle potatoes. I was tempted to try a salad, but whats the point?? seriously! there is giant pancakes and french toast! dont be a weenie, get a yourself a big cut of of the best french toast of your life, of course under a heaping helping of whipped butter and toppings. Point is, the food: its not too much, the same way you can never have too much money. ÊI dont know what happened to this review...just go eat here. They close early so dont take your sweet time.

Super-friendly, excellent food, great ambiance. I had the Baked Potato Omelette and it was probably the best omelette I've ever had. Just perfect. We got a couple comped mimosas, courtesy of their Twitter feed, to start the meal and it just kept getting better.

Oh I wish I had a giant freakin' pancake, Then I'd stuff my face 'till it was chipmunk styyyyyle. And if I had a giant freakin' pakcake, I wouldn't need another meal for quite a whiiile. An anthem worthy of the giant freakin' pancakes available at the lovely Griddle Cafe. I have to admit, the atmosphere is too cool for the school I used to go to, but nonetheless, I'll bite...into any of their delectable dishes! I was fortunate enough to go with a group of friends who all were down for sharing their pancakes with me, and I got to taste them all, blown completely away by them all. I, on the other hand, went with the "Chili My Soul" Rolled due to a terrible previous night of alcohol overindulgence. Don't ask why, but it seemed like the right choice to calm my stomach, and oh my goodness, it did just the trick! Their ingredients are fresh, their coffee is French pressed (your own personal one for the table), the service is very nice, especially for having to deal with all the scenesters who show up on their doorstep, and the portions are ridiculous. I could really eat the same single meal from here for five days straight, engorging myself each time I dipped back in. When wandering around in the back, I noticed a couple of rooms that are reserved for either larger parties or the coolest kids on the block, I'm not quite sure, but one day I'll learn the secret and hide back there myself! Well done, Ms. Cafe, well done.

Average of 4 stars!? C'mon Eileen! The more I spent time here, my stars for the rating started dropping. Long wait for breakfast food. Expensive -- I could have bought the entire breakfast menu at Tokyo 7-7[/hyperbole]. Bad service (apparently white waiters as eye candy can excuse this sort of thing). The food was indeed yummy for those who crave milky, buttery, and sugary items. Diabetics need to protest this place. I had my foot stepped on and got elbowed in the head while seated. I only stayed in a good mood 'cause an Elite Yelper was great company. But now that my internals did the appropriate chemistry, I can rain the appropiate hate on this place. :)

Still eating it. Yes, HUGE portions of food. I ordered the "Cobb" omelet with the side of tomatoes and they were willing to spare me of the olives and substitute cheddar for blue cheese. It was delicious! My friends and I drove from LA to SF the same night we went here, so my leftovers were left out for HOURS... but the food was so good that I didn't want to throw the leftovers away! Being able to risk a bad stomach ache for leftover food meant that my meal was GREAT. Also had a bite of: "Gone Shrimping", "Hoagie Omelette", the huge pumpkin pancakes, and the "Creme de la Creme". The Hoagie Omelette was pretty tasty, as was teh Creme de la Creme for the sweet-toothed out there. The Gone Shrimping was just okay, but I thought it lacked flavor, and the pumpkin pancakes were probably my least favorite. Cons: eggs were somewhat over-cooked in my omelet, chicken was dry, food came out ridiculously slow for 1:30~2pm in the afternoon when the restaurant wasn't even completely filled. Didn't finish until 4pm. Not related to the meal: much props to their cool interactive website!!

My sister suggested this place for breakfast/brunch while I was here. She also mentioned it as a place where "The HIlls" cast members have been spotted and where she has personally seen ____ from "America's Next Top Model." Now I'm a huge fan of brunch so it was a no-brainer. However, I am no fan of reality tv (you'd think in a town full of real actors, they'd try to make shows to employ more people like writers, but I guess the economy sucks) so that almost made me not want to eat here. It was just the 2 of us and everything sounded so good so we got an eggs dish (Gone Shrimpin') and a pancakes entree (Black Magic). Our eyes were bigger than our stomachs. The pancakes are huge, about a foot in diameter and stacked 3 flapjacks high. We finished off the eggs with difficulty (scrambled eggs, shrimp, capers, tomatoes, and avocado), but had to pack up 2/3 of the pancakes (oreos in the batter with whipped cream and crushed oreos on top) and the garlic toast (not so great, and I love garlic anything.) Ê I would come back to try other stuff, my sis thinks the Golden Ticket is the best pancakes dish. Service was average. Loved all the condiments on the table (3 different hot sauces, green Tabasco, maple syrup, et al). Prices for the breakfast entrees around $10-13 each.

I've been looking forward to, nay, dreaming about my Griddle Cafe quest for ages. ÊAnd I'm sorry to report that it just didn't live up to the hype. Yes, the pancakes are huge. colossal. But there must be more to pancakes than the size. ÊI ordered the blueberry ones and they were so dry. Like a desert in mah mouf. ÊAlso, the cakes did not have much of a flavor to them. They were pretty darn bland. I suppose I am being fairly severe because I was looking forward to Griddle Cafe so much. ÊInstead of saving my leftovers for many pancake mornings to come, I just threw them away. I am sure glad that I didn't have to deal with a wait, because the stars would have just gone down from there.

The place would be 5 stars if the wait wasn't so long and the service a bit quicker. Came here on a Sunday around 1pm and had 5 people. TIP: If you have 6 or more, you can make a reservation. We should have found a bum off the street so we could have 6 and make that resevation because we waited for about an hour. We ended up getting the best table in the house, a large booth in the back left corner, but it wa a long wait. The food was excellent. The pancakes are large and you get a lot of them. I had the pesto shrimp melt which was great. It came with large pieces of bread and surely was enough for 2 meals. Their steak fries are great and remind me of Red Robin fries. Our food did take a while to come out but their kitchen is small and it was packed as usual. Great things can't be rushed I guess.

Man, oh man, oh man, does this place serve some excellent brunch! It's no wonder that LA people take their brunch so seriously. (And I thought that was only in Manhattan.) This place tops as one of my all-time favorite brunch experiences... OF ALL TIME. Maybe I'm just deprived or have been ever since I've moved to DC (thus my review may be a bit inflated), but seriously, the food here is to die for. After a morning hike at Runyon Canon, this was the perfect way to compliment our feat. Not exactly appropriate after working out as it's utterly (and fantabulously) carb-tastic, but oh well... You only live once! Their menu is quite impressive to say the least. They offer an expansive list of French toast served in various ways, as well as an extensive list of different egg amalgams. On top of the 20-30 minute wait we had to endure, it took us another 20 minutes or so just to decide on what to eat (no wonder there's a constant wait to be seated). We finally ended up deciding on the Nutella French Toast (my mouth is watering just reminisicing about my first bite) and Poached Papa's benedict. It was a smart choice on our end to pair the sweet with the flavorful, both being equally agreeable. I don't usually pine over a meal I've had for brunch, but this one has made its way into my Eating Hall of Fame. Portions are huge, scene is fun and relaxed, and food is simply ambrosial. A+!

Some friends and I went to Disneyland and stopped by here for breakfast on the way back. There wasn't a line to get in, but we had a really hard time finding parking. Then, we had to wait about 15 mins. Luckily my friends and I had our plan down. We called ahead, and two of our party went in to wait for the table while the other two of us parked the car. Of course, I'd never been to this restaurant before, nor did anyone warn me about the pancakes. All I was told was "they're really good." So I went with the "Teacher's Pet," buttermilk pancakes with cinnamon apples. I can't eat pancakes without a side of scrambled eggs, so I ordered some eggs as well. I cannot tell you how glad I was not to get the "Hear Me Roar" like one friend did. We had so many plates of pancakes there wasn't enough room on our table for drinks. The pancakes were the same size as the plate on which they were served...and I had the nerve to get scrambled eggs. The pancakes were very delicious, and the eggs were scrambled to perfection. I was not able to finish my meal, but I had a great breakfast the next day!

This place might have been the best breakfast I have ever eaten. This place does not fuck around when it comes to Breakfast. They do it big! ÊBig portions and big flavors leaving you with a big stomach! I ordered an omlette which was packed with lots of fresh veggies, jack cheese and turkey meat. ÊMMMMMMMMM, Êyeah I'll leave it at that. ÊIt was on point x100! My friend ordered a mimosa and she didn't want to finish it, WTF?! So I finished it and it was amazing. ÊI'm not a big mimosa drinker but it was one of the best I have ever tasted. I tried some of my friends short stack of banana pancakes with brown sugar and I almost creamed myself at the table. ÊNo joke, this is what comfort food is all about. Ê I will be back here some day guaranteed. ÊFlawless

I didn't expect the portions to be this big. I should have read the reviews before I got here. The pancakes here are the size of a steering wheel. One order is good for 2-3 people for pancakes. I had the french toast and the chicago charlie's omelette. The hot chocolate also came out in a really big cup. It's a small place but very homely. The only thing I didn't like was the parking area behind the rite aid. Not a big fan of L.A. parking at all. The French Toast was amazing. You could really taste the butter sinking in and how soft it was got me jumping for joy. It's some of the best french toast I've ever encountered. This is a MUST order if you do come here. I also got the Chicago Charlie's omelette. That consisted of italian sasuage, bacon, onions, green pepper, potatoes, and lots of cheese. I also used the bufalo mexican hot sauce to give it a kick. This was a heavy dish and if you like a lot going on in your omelette than this is perfect. Recommendation: French Toast and Chicago Charlie's Omelette.

Came here on Sunday for brunch with my friend. We got here at 11am and the guy told us that it would be a 45 min wait which was fine to us. We actually only waited for about 15-20 mins since he was somewhat picking randomly who to let in. We felt bad for these two guys that were waiting that got there before us, but were like oh well we're in. Once we were in, the waiter was ready to take our order pretty quickly. After that though, we were waiting forever to get our food. I don't think they have enough cooks for the amount of clientele they get. It might be because I came on Sunday which could be more crowded then the other days. We order the blue berry pancakes. I got to say all their pancakes are huge. It could feed four people if you order other stuff on the side as well. With that being said, I think the pancakes are well worth $10-$13 when you're sharing or you could have the leftovers for the whole day. The pancakes themselves were light and fluffy and filled with blueberries; how pancakes should be. We also ordered their version of huevos rancheros which they called Tequilla Sunrise topped w/ avacado and sour cream. I wouldn't order this again from their restaurant. My friend thought it had too much refried beans. I just thought it wasn't that great. The extra amount that we paid for the avacado and sourcream didn't add much flavor to the huevos rancheros. I guess at this place they melt the cheese and put it on the side and let it get hard. I'm guessing the cheese is mainly for decoration, but yea I don't recommend getting this and just sticking with the pancakes.

Ê I haven't eaten here in years so I had to come back, especially since we were so close and in the area. ÊWe got here a little after 11am and we had to wait for a table.

ÊFunny...I was blocking the way of the host several times that he ended up remembering my name. Ê (hahahahah Ê*evil laugh*) Be prepared because the food comes in huge portions. ÊThat's why we shared! ÊWe ordered the "Addicted to Noisella" Stuffed French Toast (two french toast stuffed with nutella topped with powdered sugar and whipped butter- yum! no syrup needed) and the "Gone Shrimping" (lots of egg whites with shrimp, basil pesto, scallions, tomatoes, and capers) served with garlic toast. ÊSee, our workout wasn't ruined! Ê:) ÊThe food is a little expensive but you are in a prime location for a celebrity sighting or two. ÊHonestly, the money is worth it. ÊOur bill came out to about $30 for the two of us. ÊThe food is really yummy! ÊThe service was excellent too. ÊOur server was really attentive even though the place was a packed mad house.

Oh my wow!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have no legitimate reason to give this place less than 5 stars. The food was amazing!!!! I got the barry yellow pancakes and the others with me got burgers- which I was a bit skeptical about- and another got peanut bubba or Buddha or somenthin like that French toast and it was AbsolUtlEy wOndeRful!! The la vida loca burger was ssssooooo good. I guess the only downfall is that the place is tiny and considering that it wasn't extremely busy when we were in there (Thursday afternoon), the service could have been better ...some of the waiters were somewhat MIA, and others were sitting @ tables watching a golf game on TV.

For once, a place that lives up to it's hype. ÊCome to eat! ÊPortion sizes are generous in all facets. I went with my girlfriend and the wait (which was expected) was not that bad, for the Coffee Bean is located across the street. ÊSpace is like a New York hot spot; small space, jammed packed with customers. ÊNot the most cleanly of places, but as long as the chef or waiter doesn't spit in my food-- food, meet my belly. Definitely not a place to count your calories. ÊWhat to order? ÊJust listen to that little devil on your shoulder. ÊIf you're visiting and not going to come back anytime soon; sample the menu, order multiple items, take it to go, or share. ÊI left a couple pounds heavier, but satisfied nonetheless. If you're a food snob and like to think you have a refined taste, this place is probably not for you!

Headed there Saturday morning with a group of 6. We tried to put our name down while our friends were parking but they wanted us to wait till everyone was there. We were worried we would be in line for a long wait but to our surprise we got seated as soon as our friends arrived in a back room. The room was dark and more lounge like than brunch like so it was a tad bit awkward for breakfast -but I can't complain that much cause its better than waiting in line when your starving! Our table ordered Addicted to Noisella Red velvet PANcake Cabarella The Cabarella is HUGE.. just like they say on the menu, and was easily split between two people. The Addicted to Noisella french toast and Red velvet pancakes were a little too sweet for my tastebuds for brunch but if you love sweets for breakfast you should get this!

Griddle Cafe has the BEST pancakes! I can't remember what I ordered but i'm sure all of them are delicious. They have a nice chewy texture and they are very creative with their ingredients. EXCELLENT. I also got the protein filled omelette which actually wasn't very good. It was too bland but the apple sausage is yummy. Also, there's usually a line so you may need to prepare yourself in case you are starving. And the service is weak. It took forever to get a menu and even longer to get your food. If their pancakes weren't as good as they are, then I wouldn't go again. But...THEY ARE.

Pretty good. Got the "Tis the Season" pancakes I think. Well anyways, the pumpkin pie one. The pumpkin taste was a little weak for me, but the pancakes themselves were good. I don't know how people can eat these pancakes ONLY though. There's like 3 huge ones stacked on each other. The pumpkin ones got a little tiring after a quarter of the "pie" haha. The omelette was good, the "My Soul" Omelette. The potatoes were good. Parking is in the back with Rite-Aid. Cut through Rite-Aid to save you a couple seconds and enjoy air conditioning, or if you don't want to go up stairs, just go around the block. Wait is very short for 2 people - longer if it's more.

Oh Griddle Cafe- if you were a lady, I would marry you. And I would treat you so right. What I would ask in return is a steady production of your French toast all day long, every day. And to not be judged when I begin to resemble a strung-out drug addict, due to my inability to turn down a fresh press of coffee as it comes my way. Everything you do is like music to my tastebuds- you make me want to be a better man- and just let myself go and gain 200 pounds from dining here exclusively. Sweatpants aren't so bad, after all. Although, I must admit, that I have never ordered an omelet, or any other eggery, which at a place known for griddling, seems to me much akin with ordering spaghetti at Denny's(random tip: never do that). I love the fact that I don't have to be tempted to turn into one of those freaks that bring their own 100% pure maple syrup to a restaurant- it's just already there, waiting for me on the table! The wait is well worth it - but for gods sake, you had better wait in the proper place, or... No cakes for you! Next! The proper place to wait is not in the middle of Sunset....even if it seems like a good idea at the time. Bottom line is that I love you, Griddle Cafe- and I don't care who knows it....

Sorry, but the Griddle is over-hyped and over-priced. (And I didn't even have to wait in line for an hour to eat there.) If you've ever driven down La Brea and seen the people waiting in line at Pink's for a mediocre hotdog, then you should know what to expect when you roll up at this place. The 'Tequila Sunrise' should really be called 'Tabasco On A Plate With A Blob Of Cheese.' Simply gross. The blueberry pancakes were okay, but for $12, they should be significantly better than the ones I make at home. (And, no, being gigantic in size doesn't really make up for their mediocrity.) Lastly, $5 for an orange juice and a noisy, claustrophobic space with no natural light? #breakfastfail

Stuffed, stuffy, rushed a bit, and stuff. I think I'm over my phase of ordering WAY too much food and then eating it for the next 2 days. I got the apple cobbler french toast. Yep, tasty but was bored after the second bite. I was kinda hoping the topping wasn't so generic. The toast was interesting as it was an apple bread mix but apple on apple on some cereal = Zzzz. Felt kinda ripped off actually... whatever. Few things to know: Party of 2 or less gets seated faster. French press coffee! It's awesome but it's 3.50+ a person. When ordering, make sure you tell them how many flapjacks you want or else you're getting THREE.

Came here about 7 times, and have always enjoyed the massive amounts of food presented to me. The wait is LONG so I usually only come here when I'm showing out-of-towners around since it's a classic Hollywood spot. My suggestion: put your name on the wait list, walk across the street and chill at Coffee Bean for awhile. Chat it up with your buddy, and the time will go much quicker than standing in line for 45 minutes. Their 'Tis the Season' Pumpkin pancakse are to die for. Unlimited french press coffee. Delicious shrimp pesto sandwich. Yummy Huevos Rancheros. It's a crowded diner, but it's definitely a fun time. Sometimes the wait-staff aren't very patient, and may slam dishes as they place them on your table, but by the time your food comes, you're so effing hungry, who gives a crap, all you can think about is stuffing your face.

This is my favorite breakfast spot in the world, and I am a breakfast aficionado. ÊThe pancakes are unparalleled, both in size and deliciousness, the egg dishes are well-portioned and inventive, and the coffee is strong and delicious.

It is not spectacular, but it is good. What makes it good is the variety of food to choose from, the high ratio of fluffy carb sweet thingies to salty/standard American thingies, and the ingenuity of variations of those carb sweet thingies. Thumbs down for parking, cramped space, slightly sticky ambiance, dark interior, and forcing the staff to carry food in and out the same front door the customers are trying to walk through, too. I am cringing for the day some hapless waiter with a pile o' plates gets into a walking accident with a customer. It won't be either of their faults ... either. Coffee is indeed good, I like their chai latte it's very creamy and light. Not too spicy. Thumbs up for the Black Magic (I think that's the name) Oreo Crumb pancakes. It's just the crumbs, friends, no cookie cream filling, piled high with whipped cream, that gets melty and runny and makes your pancake mountain moist and carefree. If it were not for these exotic toppings, mind you, the pancakes' only boastable factoid would be their gargantuan size. You have correctly noted in previous reviews that they are the size of heads and hubcaps and dinner plates. Indeed, they are. Indeed, you can feast off them for up to 4 days if you behave yourself. Other than these toppings, the pancakes are just big, dense, with no unique flavor. Kind of bland, actually. If you are the type to like your pancakes with just syrup, don't eat these pancakes, they aren't worth waiting in line for. However if you like mounds of fun flavors, DO IT. Pancakes are dense, not fluffy. They only become fluffy when you rake their messy happy topping heads up with the tines of your fork and nibble the upper crust. The rest of the pancake is pretty thick and will choke you without the assistance of some beverage or other non-sexual lubrication. I am actually a waffle fiend. They put something really really weird in their waffle mix. I think it was wheat or something, or wheat bran mixed in, I dunno, but my waffle wasn't made of the same batter as the pancake. Luckily I had strawberries, whipped cream, and syrup to hide the weirdness. Non-carby thingies, omelettes and such, were actually pretty bland and uninteresting. They definitely taste fresh and healthy, they just taste uninteresting. For a semblance of flavor, order something with sausage in it. Our waitstaff was all business and perky. Which at least isn't rude, so it works for me. The wait is indeed long. I'd advise going as early as you can bear or you shall be standing outside on the runway while people judge you and others with their eyes, talk loudly on their cell phones, flip their hair over their shoulders, and gun the engines of their fancy cars down sunset. Not worth it for regular (weekly) trips, but perhaps good for monthly trips.

OMFG. ÊBe forewarned - your cholesterol, blood pressure and blood sugar will probably jump at least 10 points after you eat here. ÊSimultaneously. ÊThat being said... FOOD: Awesome f*cking breakfast comfort food. ÊTheir pancakes are riduculous - BIGGER than the plates they are served on and come in every flavor you could imagine sober or stoned (I mean c'mon... pancakes with FROSTED FLAKES in them? who'd have thunk?). ÊHowever, being a salty-and-spicy kinda gal, I am always a sucker for their egg dishes, which are huge enough to last two meals (even for me, who is a pretty hefty eater!). ÊI should be more adventurous but I always order the Caballero breakfast burrito without chorizo...so friggin delish!!! PRICES: Look pretty expensive on the menu (between $15-$20 per dish on average) but, as mentioned earlier, considering that you could split most dishes into two meals I'd say it's really not bad. Ê AMBIENCE: Very, very crowded and noisy. ÊNot the most pleasant. ÊDon't come here if you're wanting to talk to people in a comfortable environment. ÊEveryone is more or less here for the food. ÊAnd the wait, especially on Sunday mornings when everyone is looking for a hangover cure, is a b*tch. PARKING: Not bad, actually - you can park in the lot behind Rite Aid and enter the restaurant from the back entrance. All in all, I'm glad I live close to the Griddle... but I'm sure my heart and waistline aren't.

The pancakes here are GINORMOUS and unlike anything I've ever seen! A stack of 3 are served on a huge plate and they're so big, the edges hang off the plate! They have a huge variety of pancakes, but I wasn't in the mood for something sweet so I ordered the Chicago Charlie scramble, which consisted of sausage, potatoes, bacon, bell peppers, cheese, garlic, basil and onions. It was at best mediocre and was supposed to come with a side of garlic bread...but they never brought it out for me. When I was finally able to flag down our server to ask for it, she told me it was because they were out of garlic bread and asked if I wanted toast instead. It's extremely busy here, especially on a Saturday morning/afternoon. The wait for a table for 2 was almost an hour at 1pm! But it's definitely worth the wait to get a taste of their pancakes. The one I tried was filled with butterscotch chips and caramel, and topped with loads of whipped cream and powdered sugar. One order is definitely enough to share between 2 people as we didn't even finish half the plate!!

I don't even know if I need to add my review to the mix of a world famous breakfast house. Imagine heaven is made out of pancakes. Then you get to eat it with syrup. Enough said. It's good, always full of people and you won't regret the meal. Food can take awhile, seating may be tough and the servers aren't rude they just have a ton of tables to take care of. It's a great experience and a fabulous meal. Enjoy!

I never crave pancakes until I remember than Griddle Cafe is an option. Ê Damn, that place is good. ÊFor 3 years I lived a hopscotch away, literally, so I was able to send someone in the hungover group to wait in line and be there within seconds of having our table ready. ÊBut yeah, that wait sucks donkey balls. It's a shame I live 3.4 miles away now as we're usually too lazy to drive, find parking and endure the wait. Ê Mmmmm, pancakes.

We were told 30 to 40 minutes. We were actually seated after 1 hour and 5 minutes! We were ready to order right away, as you might imagine, and our waitress seemed annoyed to be there and not at all ready to take our full order. The staff, I was told, were hot, studdly LA Model/Actor types. Well I don't know about that person's idea of hot but all the waiters were average looking and looked like they drank past 2, woke up 5 minutes before their shift, threw on a baseball cap and jeans and showed up with the same urgency as they stood around and watched the game on TV while the food piled up. Only one waiter fit my "hot" bill and he didn't look like he was interested in the game at all and looked like he woke up 3 hours before his shift just to do his hair. We thank him for that dedication but we didn't benefit from his service. We did get our drinks and food in a relatively short time. The portions as previously described, are GIANORmous! I had an egg white omelet and everyone around me had the huge 3 meal pancakes! Whew! We are still full! Getting the bill took time as well, you know we expected our waitress to work, a little. So work little and be disappointed. Food, alot and a great surprise.

Very good looking people and tasty waffles. We got to sit in the break room. I don't know what this was all about. They had a training video going on the TV and stacks of all the years receipts piled in the corner. I guess it wasn't the best seat in the house. I also hired the next 20 actors for my screenplay here.

I woke up at 6am to drive in LA traffic to get here right when it open for my bestie birthday! I wanted to try something new and different for her. We got here right when it open and was their first customer of the day. We order the original french toast, banana pancake, and poached y papas benedict. The french toast was good but I thought were alil burn and blacken. The pancake was okay taste like eating a whole banana. And that one big banana. My favorite of the three was the benedict. OMG! OMG OMG! This is prefect. I would prefer this benedict over any type of benedict out there. They had potato skin that were like potatoes boats that were use to replace the english muffins. The potato skin was already yummy but eating it with a nice piece of ham and the egg with the taste of the sauce... OMG! AMAZING! Ê Service was good! :) FYI: They share the parking lot with rite aid in the back, i think that what the waiter told us, so much better than trying to find street or meter parking! :)

I've been to the Griddle 3 times & figured it's time to write a review on this place. The food is wonderful. Go w/an appetite. You will love everything on the menu. And everything is super sized to be careful, LOL. ÊEach time I've gone it's been crowded. But then again I've going during lunch time. The tables are tightly packed but the atmosphere is lively so you may not mind so much. They put a few tables outside on the sidewalk but I prefer sitting inside. Every time I've gone there's been a celebrity or two trying to eat incognito. No body bugs them or pays attention. ÊSo if you're in to celebrity sightings, you may get lucky. There's free parking in the back, it shares the lot with Walgreens. The prices are reasonable, so no worries on the wallet. I've had: Saturday Morning Fever Pancakes - Bailey's & Kahlua swirled in buttermilk pancakes topped w/powered sugar & whipped cream. It tasted like when my mom make cake with rum in it. Takes getting drunk at breakfast to a whole ne level!! LOL Wholey Moley Pancakes - Whole wheat w/brown sugar. Tasty but why bother be good when you can be oh so bad. LOL Griddle Waffles - whatever the secret ingredient that makes it golden, I'd love to know because those waffles are delicious !!! Bacon & Eggs - The bacon is thick & it tastes like they put some type of syrup on it. Whatever they put it tastes great. I for one will eat there again & again.

I have been wanting to try this place for months. ÊI drive by with my boyfriend, see the line of eternity and keep driving to our favorite breakfast spot of the moment. ÊBut today, today was different. ÊCircumstances had us out and about early, so at 8am, we were hungry and looking to fill our bellies. ÊAnd there was no one outside of the Griddle Cafe. ÊWe were shocked and in disbelief, certain that it must be closed, we drove back and checked it out, sure enough, it was open. ÊWe jumped on the chance to eat at the legendary cafe, without standing in line. Ê We grabbed a seat at the counter and began to peruse the intense menu. ÊThe coffee and tea we sipped, prepared/served in your own French press was delish. ÊI had the breakfast tacos, which were probably the most balanced in flavor of all breakfast tacos that I have ever had. ÊMy boyfriend had the potato omelet, which was scrumptious as well - both of which we will have later on today as the portions are so humongous we took the leftovers with us (close to half our meal).

Quite literally, I would wake up at 6 in the morning and take a 20 minute bus ride JUST to get to this place. The Griddle is love. I've read reviews which complained about the pretentious hipster atmosphere...but that wasn't a problem for the times I went since I always went on a weekday morning (when I guess all hipsters are still in bed...) There's also usually no wait on a weekday before 9am (I've been there about 5 or 6 times now and have never needed to wait for a table). Food is awesome. They have the BEST pancakes. And if you think that's debatable...well, at least we can all agree that they have the BIGGEST pancakes. 10" across...no joke!! There is no way anyone could finish their regular stack of 3. The Black Magic Pancakes are soooooo good but my favorite pancakes are the Golden Ticket. And the Creme de la Creme french toast! Ahhhh...like a love child between a cheesecake and a french toast...and that's the best love child to be. Their savory dishes are just as awesome. Their egg dishes are amazing and portions sizes are still huge. The griddle potatoes are AWESOME!! Plus, I love their french pressed coffee. It's a little pricey ($3.35) but it's unlimited refill (not that you can get through your own first pot to begin with). Prices are great for what you get. Seriously, think probably $15 per person, plus tax and tips and leftovers to last you for AT LEAST 3 days. Service is a bit iffy. There are some really horrible servers (i.e. the "aspiring" actors/actresses) who probably know nothing about the food and give you "I'm going to be a star SOMEDAY" attitude and are rude as hell (avoid the attractive brunette girl with braids and a cap. She's attractive but NOT nice). Bad service puts me off and the FIRST waitress to greet me on my FIRST visit was said attractive brunette girl and since she was rude, I had to take one star off. But then again, most of the other people are really nice (and I really mean that). I would say that 90% of the people who work there are those who make you feel happy when you leave a big fat tip. But then again, that's from my experience on a relatively slow weekday morning. I've heard horror stories about the chaos on weekends so service might suffer a little then...I'm guessing. Atmosphere is great. No frills decor, good food, big portions, GREAT coffee and old-school blues (think Robert Johnson and such...really good stuff). I saw Janice Dickenson here once but I couldn't care less because I had more important things to tend to: the FOOD!!!

I don't understand how people can complain about the wait times. It is a busy, popular restaurant duh, expect to wait! But what most people fail to mention is that the food gets there quickly and the staff is super efficient. Each time I've gone, I've had a party of 5 or 6. We always seem to get seated more quickly Êthan the smaller parties. One time we even sat in the very back of the restaurant in these tacky, but comfy, huge booths. The pancakes are incredible but you should share it. Actually, the portions are just ginormous in general. I've never been able to finish the pancakes or even the "Caballero", my favorite. Oh, and the french toast is so delicious I can't even begin to describe it. Oh, and the coffee comes in it's own little press and it's super cute. Anyway, stop complaining about the wait and go!

This is one of my FAVORITE breakfast Êjoints in LA! I'll happily drive over the hill and into We Ho for a big plate of pancakes, waffles, french toast, massive sandwiches, or just about anything on the menu. French press coffee ensures only the freshest cup of joe to accompany your meal. This is a serious draw for me as I love my coffee in the morning! It has been and is worth mentioning that the portions here are insane! The to-go boxes they have can fit a stack of records inside and with the amount of leftovers you will end up with the size of the box is justified. Be prepared to eat pancakes for the next few days...

Okay, I would add a photo - but there are already a million and how many photos of pancakes do we really need to see? (Okay, I would look at pancakes all day but eventually I would cave and eat a bunch of them.) First of all, I rarely give 5 stars on Yelp... I maybe have two other restaurants that I've rated as being 5 stars. But this place is just too good. First of all, for what you get, Griddle Cafe is reasonably priced. I tried two pancakes. The Black Magic pancake is just that - magical. Awesome. Delicious. STUFFED with Oreos. And the Red Velvet pancake is something to be had. It's very rich, so you MUST be a pancake fan to enjoy the red velvet pancake. Just go some time, but be prepared to wait... I wouldn't come too starving, because it's tempting to order two pancakes. Believe me, one will be enough.

This place is great. Not only do I have no problems with it, the food is also really great. We walked in and had to wait awhile for a table, which is fine. There are a lot of tables, so things the list goes by fast. We choose to sit inside, as opposed to outside, since we did not want to get neglected by the service. I got a breakfast burrito with scrambled eggs, peppers, and potatoes. It was really good. My only concern with it was that it was missing a kick to it. There were diced sauteed tomatoes on the top of the burrito. If it were me, I would put that inside. Anyway, the burrito was on-par with expectations but not completely amazing. The noisella french toast, on the other hand, was amazing. It was the best french toast I've ever had in my life. I feel like their carb foods (i.e. pancakes, waffles, french toast) are better than their savory foods. Iced coffee was really amazing and they give you a french press to pour yourself. The service was good. 5 stars.

Came here for breakfast, ordered a blueberry pancake... to say this was the biggest pancake I have ever seen would be an understatement...

Service was good considering the place was packed (get here early - when we were leaving there was a line outside to get in)

A friend and I waltzed in around lunchtime on a Wednesday. There was no wait, miraculously, and she and I both ordered almost immediately after being seated. We knew what we had came for. We knew what was about to happen. I ordered the Red Velvet panCAKE, and a plate of bacon, while she grabbed some banana pancake thing (I pay attention , as you can tell) and a side of fries. Fries and pancakes, you might wonder? Yes, I would then say. Yes. Seriously, though, it's a great combo. Try it. The salty fries (delicious!) helped balance out the sweet. In case the 1500 other reviews or so didn't drive it home yet, the portions here are huge. Ridiculously so. We knew this going in and decided to get just one pancake each (instead of the stack of two or three that comes default), and trust me when I say that one was enough to leave us both drunken with delight whenever we eventually rolled ourselves away from the table. Thoughts on the dishes: Red Velvet panCAKE: Oh, good god. I love everything red velvet, I should mention, which is why I pushed myself to make it through 3/4 of the pancake before giving up and bursting into sugary, cream-cheesy tears. Worth it, guys. Best damn pancake I've ever tasted. Banana pancake thing: Good! I think. I only stole a bite, so I can't say much more than that. Fries: Delicious. A huge plate, which is nice, and they were expertly seasoned. Bacon: Thick, luscious slabs. A little pricey, but it's easy to justify the cost when you first sink teeth into these rapturous slices of meat. Coffee: I got one of the individual french presses, too, without knowing how to even use one. I pushed the stick thing down almost immediately after I got it, which -- stupid it may have been -- still worked out surprisingly well. Delicious brew, and you get a surprising amount of coffee for the price. The server guy was nice, the weather was superb, and the memories of that red velvet pancake will come with me to the grave. Go there. Just not on the weekend.

1 extra star for the music, everything else only merits 2. Having done a stint working in rural Kentucky, I LOVED the music they were playing--blues and Johnny Cash. Made me remember some interesting memories..... Now for the food/ service/ scene. I don't get it. Once again. This is another LA brunch spot that I "don't get." I sat next to someone "famous" who the manager was gushing over and I had no idea who he was [that was amsuing]. The food was O-K. My boyfriend got the waffle and I got some sort of breakfast nachos thing. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't good. I guess I feel like everything is just kind of thrown together. The pancakes looked GROSS. I started gagging just watching ppl eat them. Just so much. So much piled and filled with just so much.....Like "BIG JIM'S" in middle-of-nowhere Kentucky had more sensible portions [not to mention actually GOOD food]. But I'm getting off topic..bottom line, it's just not that great...

"Worth The Wait" [First impression] Whoa! Look at those portions! Good thing we had a chance to see the portions while waiting in line is all I have to say. The smell in the place is just outrageously mouthwatering. Not ever wanting to waste food, their single portions and sides are a plus! The pancakes alone are the size of a large pizza! No joke. Wish we had bigger appetites but all the more reason to come back the next time we're in town. [Suggestion] *For two- get the oversize single portion of banana nana and mom's french toast. It's plenty of food. Don't forget the nutella on the side. [Tip(s)] *A lot of the meters for street parking is broken so don't risk getting a ticket. There is a parking lot behind the restaurant or drive further down past the parking lot-- there's a lot of free parking on the street near the apartment complexes.

There was a wait for about 30 minutes and a crowd out the door on a weekend morning. I liked the atmosphere, it definitely gave me a taste of West Hollywood.

This place is super busy over the weekends.. you may wanna allocate time before coming here. The menu is so extensive that I always seem to get lost reading it. They have so many omelette options that I kinda get confused when trying to decide. I'll think, "wait, what is the difference between this and that omelette? Oh.. this one is egg white only and that one is not.." why can't they just put it in one line instead of two different omelettes?? I mean, the changes are very minute.. and I can't use that much brain power in the mornings! :( After ordering, be prepared to wait. Food comes, it is good, but not awesome. I would say between good-great, but nothing that really spectacular. Noisy, crowded place. Laid back and good to go to with a bunch of friends.

4/18/10 8:05am by myself at the bar After a long drive from the Bay to L.A. I have decided to stop by the Griddle cafe for breakfast. at the bar 1 French Pressed Coffee $3.75 came with a press coffee in a jar and creamer on the side. Choice of mild, medium or strong. I ordered strong coffee. 1 triple deck of BLACK MAGIC $10.95 3 layers of 12" pancakes with oreos cookie (crumble) top with whipped cream. I can only finished quarter out of it. It was ginormous!!!!! for me. The portion of the pancake is my breakfast, lunch, dinner and breakfast for the next morning. total: $16.13+$2 tips Note: would love to go back for something small. Pro: plenty of parking in the back and enter from the back door, Handicap friendly, seat at the tables, outside and bar Con: this place filled up real quick, if you get there late you may have to wait for a long time. Look at the portion.

Yes, it's popular, and there's a wait even at 10am on a saturday morning. but i love that the wait's not as bad as it seems. the waiter told us that it would be about a 30min wait, but ended up being only 20mins! the shrimp melt sandwich is SO AMAZING!!!!. like no joke. pesto, melted provolone cheese, grilled shrimp on thick sliced bread (kinda like a brioche). portions are pretty big -- the sandwhiches come with a 2/3 of a plate full of steak cut fries (or, you can substitute with other stuff like cinammon apple) i wish they had half orders .... that would be perfect! i guess the only bad thing would be that the tea isn't that great.. comes in a pot and mine was over brewed (bitter, yuck!).. Êbut would totally come back again to try the breakfast food :)

I really like the concept, I do but I don't think anyone can finish their pancakes. Don't get me wrong, I love sweets but there's just a whole lot of pancakes to down. I definitely recommend sharing a stack unless you get a smaller thing like the Nutella French Toast which is just the right portion and who can go wrong with Nutella?! My friends and I made the horrible mistake of ordering a stack each. I don't think we can ever look at pancakes for a few months after that. It became an inside joke whenever we went to a diner... "hey remember pancakes at Griddle?". Other than that, getting there and parking wasn't a big deal since we went on a weekend last summer. There wasn't much of a wait either, I guess we got lucky. Would probably come back but probably would not frequent because it's simply not worth the drive. Pancake lovers by all means take the challenge!

I can say that this place really lived up to my expectation- RIDICULOUS PORTIONS & amazingly delightful! We went on a Friday morning-ish and seriously, waited no more than 3 minutes and were able to get a table for 4. So, I assume weekdays are better than weekends... OR we were just lucky. For the foods, because I am eggs benedict-obsessed (I swear I will open a restaurant or even a truck food stand one day specializing in them), I knew we had to get them. It was sooooooo good and filling. The ham was humongous; it was almost as big as the plate. The potato skins were also a creative, tasty, and different element. The hollandaise sauce was really good too- I would say it was a bit of an overkill because they put so much on but after I ate it, I couldn't help eating more with the side of griddle potatoes. We also ordered the Noisella French Toast. And I agree, I don't know what bread they use because it's also so out-of-this-world huge. It was good, but a bit too sweet. Last but not least, we also shared a side of Griddle Potatoes and it was interesting in a good way... I would describe it as being like hashbrowns but the potato chunks are much bigger and skinned. It had a nice peppery-spicey kick to it. Overall, I would order their eggs benedict again and try some pancakes. For 4 people, we had enough to share amongst and still felt full. Also yeah, it seems like a requirement for guys to work there is to be eye-candy worthy 'cause most of them were.

As I approached the swarm of people outside, I felt the ominous sinking in my stomach. Ê"Holy hell, this place is packed - I'm going to have to wait 2 hours just to sit down!" ÊI reconsidered, but then Griddle Cafe struck. ÊThey sent an aerial assault, throwing a nuclear-sized waft of Oreo Pancake scent directly into my olfactory receptors. ÊBy then, the war was won, I accepted defeat, and put my name down on the gargantuan list to await my turn to get some pancake goodness into my belly. The host is picky about where you stand on the sidewalk outside the restaurant - probably some sort of insurance liability, but if you're on the wrong side of the street lamp, or on the opposite side of the corner of the building, you're going to be asked to move. It's a bit of torture, being forced to stand on the sidelines as you see other people roll up their sleeves and attack their piles of flapjacks, but the wait is absolutely worth it. ÊI was lucky, and most of the groups waiting were large, whereas I was only in a party of 2, so we were able to sit after only a half hour or so. ÊI settled into my seat, ready to take on some serious grub, and was absolutely stunned by the variety of pancakes they had here. ÊIt's too bad (although so so good) that their pancakes are ginormous, because I'd love to be able to try a variety, but instead I settled on the Kahlua and Bailey's. ÊThe pancakes arrived later, topped with some butter, soft, hot, and cakey. ÊWithout really noticing, I ate about half of the serving before my stomach started complaining. ÊThey don't mess around with portions here - you're sure to get your fill. Grudgingly, I admitted defeat and put down my fork. Ê"I'll take a to-go box, please." ÊOh, Griddle Cafe, you haven't seen the last of me!

I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. ÊI remember going with a few friends the summer after my senior year in high school and to this day, I don't think there are any places that have come close to serving the breakfasty goodness that are their pancakes and sandwiches. ÊI have a friend who is a big breakfast food enthusiast and I wish I could bring him here to show him what he's missing out (since he lives in Boston). It's been over two years since and I can still recall how the pancakes lightly sprinkled with powdered sugar and doused with a generous serving of fruits just melts in your mouth. ÊThey're not too sweet or too bland; they're just right! ÊI'm a big sucker for any sandwich with advocados in them and the sandwich that I got was hefty and filling and had a lot of fries to accompany it. ÊJust looking at other customers' orders, you are gastronomically taunted until your order comes. Ê The wait is long (but what do you expect from a place that serves the best breakfast/brunch dishes on the planet!?). ÊPlan accordingly. ÊThe service is great and the waiters are all very friendly, wiling to strike up a conversation despite being swamped with orders! Overall, this place is good food, good vibe, good company.

I have neglected my Yelp reviews and so I am now going to make up for lost time, starting with my experience yesterday at THE GRIDDLE. My mission for my yelp account is to review underdog joints and literally places that no one knows exist. That, The Griddle isn't. And I know it isn't in Mid-City, West Adams...my usual hood...but occasionally I Êventure north of Melrose and if I get hungry I have to eat. But I was horrified when Dante turned the car right on Sunset from La Brea and headed west. I don't support the over development going on in my old neighborhood (Hayworth and Sunset) and yet I am jealous that those residents get all those chomping choices to walk to. WALK being the key word. ÊAnd I didn't want to run into any aging hipsters from the AA meeting either. It was a grouchy day. We crossed Fairfax and I dared mention THE GRIDDLE. I lived a block way from it for 6 years and it wasn't The Griddle then. It was a Persian-style shoe store that burned down and sat boarded up for months. An eyesore in the neighborhood. I was happy when they put up a restaurant there. No one knew how it would take off. First surprise: there was Doris Day parking in front of THE GRIDDLE. Second Surprise: There was NO LINE at 1:30pm! Third Surprise: ÊI agreed to eat there. Fourth Surprise: We were actually seated at our own booth, not the counter. Fifth Surprise: Our waiter, though hip and cool, was nice. Nice!!!! Sixth Surprise: I agreed to try one of the famous pancakes and split it with Dante. (I usually need protein or a salad at this time, so this was a huge risk) The pancake had a name....I'm trying to think....it had something to do either with a Doctor or The South. In any case, there was baked apple on top and lots of cinnamon. When you order these pancakes, you get THREE. Not one large plate size, but three. The nice, hip, yet somehow authentic waiter told us to eat the pancake from the inside out, which was no stretch for Dante. I didn't quite know what that meant but the middle definitely had the bells and whistles in there. After six bites, I was completely full. We literally left half the pancake sitting there and then asked for a box to bring it home to our neighbor Wilson, 10. ÊEverything was fine with the world. And then.... Within 6 minutes of eating the "Doctor... South" Pancake, something ominous happened. ÊDante became a spaced out, catatonic zombie and I became oversensitive, angry and hurt that now he wanted to go straight home to lie down. I thought we were on a date in L.A. and that next we could...ya know, go to Whole Foods: what Angelenos now do for a date. ÊBut the effects of the pancake on two already chemically challenged people were egregious. It became a horrible Friday traffic conversation about neglect and lost years and what "normal people" are doing right! Yet it was my most positive experience at THE GRIDDLE and ÊI will definitely Êgo back; but probably with a girlfriend or a gay man and I will Ênever have the pancake. I will have protein or a salad.

If you want pancakes, go here. ÊYou'd be a fool not to. ÊIn fact, I don't know why you'd go here & not get pancakes. ÊIt'd be like travelling to China & ordering a hamburger. ÊBad idea. Ê The pancakes are serious. ÊThey make 'em large & they do them well. ÊLast time I was here it was after my friends & I were denied entry to the Price is Right. ÊThe Griddle Cafe made it all okay. ÊAnd since it was my b-day, they even made me a pancake with some whipped cream on top, complete with a candle. ÊWell done Griddle...well done. Ê They have many, many pancakes to choose from and just to decide what you want will probably take some time. Ê Ê If you're looking for just a regular breakfast without pancakes, it's probably worth it to go somewhere else cause of the wait and medicore non-pancake food. Pancakes!

Is it really worth the wait? Only if you're totally in the mood for a oversized breakfast! Personally like the Captain Crunch French Toast. If the sweet tooth is pounding...this is my craving. Bacon is good if cooked crispy. Pancakes are HUGE! L.A. hot spot for breakfast. Only open for breakfast and lunch. Parking in back or on the street with meters.

My friend insisted that we go here for breakfast. ÊShe went on to tell me about how HUGE the pancakes were. ÊAnd how no mortal can finish them... blah blah blah. Ê I didn't really believe her. Ê We get there around 11am on a Saturday, and there's a big wait list. ÊAbout a 30 minute wait for our group. ÊIn the meantime, she points out the pancakes that someone just ordered. ÊWOW... they are HUGE. ÊI've never seen a bigger / fatter stack of pancakes before. I ordered "the Golden ticket" . Êits a banana filled pancake with caramel, walnuts and streusel. ÊIt was SOOOO good. ÊI only managed to eat about 1/4 of it before my body was telling me I was going to become diabetic. ÊCoffee was good. ÊThey serve it to you in a french press. Ê My friend got the "muscle bound"... it s a egg / sausage dish. ÊIt was.... how should I put it... healthy tasting. Ênothing she would order again. Ê Overall, great place for breakfast.

First, lets start off with recommendations. The peanut butter french toast (peanut bubba) and Apple cobbler are great. Not too sweet, not too much. Typically their food is quite sweet, but these are almost perfect. If you really have a sweet tooth, you should get the Yellowbrick road, Large pancakes with butterscotch and caramel. I recommend sharing pancakes (1 order) and getting an omlette, this is typically enough for two people.

First off, I love the location of this place. Not to mention, it was a miracle that there was no traffic up to LA on Saturday from Orange County. Definitely the best french toast I've ever had. My parents are really picky about the coffee they drink (they fly in coffee from Costa Rica -_-) and only drink coffee from Le Pain Quotidien in Bev Hills but my Dad loved the coffee here! They have a really versatile selection of brews, from mild to bold, and it comes served in a french press! I would advise getting a half order of pancakes if its just for yourself - its still two large pancakes spilling over the plate! The waiters and service are all really nice, but don't expect too much attention because they get really busy. Good tip, try and get there before 9:30 on Saturday morning if you don't want to wait!

So I am sitting here thinking about the smell of the pancakes I ate today at 11:30am, and it's now 1:50am. Holy Cow, did they smell so good. Never in my life had I smelled something so sweet and heavenly. ÊYou have no idea how long I've waited to come to this place, it has been MONTHS! I wanted to save it as the "special breakfast" to have for my boyfriend's birthday--so worth it, so perfect. Let me just say I was afraid my pancakes wouldn't come with whip cream and powdered sugar as it was not listed so, and they sure did :)--so does that mean they are all? Perfect, perfect. I mean, Perfect. I got the "Hear me Roar" only because I am so not a fan of chocolate pancakes--and that seemed to be the theme in this pancake menu--and to be honest I was expecting to be disappointed. Holy Cow was I wrong, this was better than a Strawberry Shortcake! Let me just say that I am the queeeeen of "drenching it in syrup", but this doesn't even need syrup--yeah, I said! It's so good on it's own! Still, I tried the syrup--because I love syrup :) And it was good, nothing mind-blowing, just perfect, sweet maple-syrup. Still, I ate most of the pancake by itself because it just didn't need any syrup, and I wanted to appreciate the taste--plus the fabulous whip cream more than moistened it, and it is BY THE WAY the best whip cream that I've had in my life! UGH, so good! I can't wait to go back for my birthday--I'm reserving this as my "special" place. I'm a pancake snob, and for the most part I mostly just liked[loved] my own, but this place takes the trophy. ÊI just cannot explain to you all of the deliciousness--and oh my god do you want to just stare at people's food at this place! The staff is friendly, and the waiters all look trendy/hip and what not. The place looks like a diner on tv, and they play cartoons. I went on Êa Thursday morning expecting to find it empty, and it was still busy and full! I asked for only 2 pancakes (thank you, Yelpers), and they knocked off $3, but then the waitress tricked me into buying a $5 dollar maple-turkey sausage that was good, but unnecessary. I was caught off guard. ÊThe $5 orange juice just isn't worth it...yes, it is fresh-squeezed, but it's not exactly good-tasting or anything. (by the way, it's not that big--just the same size as all the cups, so don't let the shape-cups in the pictures fool you) I may just stick to the cold iced-water that they serve next time. My boyfriend ordered the Caballero and said he was disappointed in it, and oh so jealous of my pancakes. He said he wouldn't order it again...because it was a more "healthy" option--how a burrito stuffed with eggs could be the healthy option, I don't know. But anyway, it wasn't exactly ginourmous or anything, but it was more than enough of a serving to make you full. I did try it, and it was spicy (yummily, not overwhelmingly), but he is right in that it was bland--it's "the Simple Man's meal. But really, I'd just stick to regular breakfast here. LOVE IT Do you hear me? LOVED it. The service wasn't super fast, as some of you have listed here, but I don't care...I will wait anything for these amazing pancakes--next time I will just order one. OH MY GOD, SO GOOD.

I can't seem to remember the last time I've gone to a restaurant in LA and actually leave more than satisfied. After a couple of months of nagging from my family, I finally decided to make the trip out to Griddle with my brother and boyfriend. Good thing I brought my brother too because I never would've seen the restaurant and know that parking is in the back. We came around lunch time on a Saturday and waited a good 30 min for our table. The inside was incredibly chaotic and a bit stuffy so we happily took a table outside. We ordered the classic french toast, eggs benedict and banana pancakes. The pancakes and french toast were soooo good. If and when I crave breakfast, I don't think I could ever be satisfied like I was here. The eggs benedict are served with potato skins instead of biscuits, and the hollandaise was perfect. The dish is heavy itself, but the hollandaise was perfect in such a way that it didn't leave that overly cream taste that overpowers the entire dish. The ham is DELICIOUS. I'm not ham's biggest fan unless they are cut into thinner than usual slices on my benedict but Griddle's ham is so good, I was eating it by itself. Their mocha is amazing but not as amazing as their french pressed coffee. I think I died and went to heaven. Nothing like starting off your day with fresh coffee, seriously. We also ordered a side of their steak fries - I know - breakfast with french fries but hey, that's how we roll.. The fries were really good. Crispy and soft and just enough salt, mmmmm.. Tip: If you don't mind the random bums that walk up and down the street, honking on the streets, tourists on the double deckers waving hi, sit outside. During peak hours, outside is less chaotic than inside, surprisingly. Plus, you get fresh air and the ability to hear what you're saying to each other. Also, the host was funny as hell. He made waiting 30 min the most amusing 30 min wait for a table in my life. In conclusion, my favorite breakfast spot.

Griddle Cafe is, hands down, one of the best brunch places around that must be visited at least once in your life. ÊEverything comes in huge portions and tastes delicious. ÊThere's a not-so-secret room in the back with a giant booth and a much more private setting. ÊThere's only enough space for one group and Griddle doesn't accept reservations so getting there depends on the luck of the draw. The pancakes are humongous and come with all sorts of topping combinations that accommodate all types of sweet tooths. ÊAs someone with a huge sweet tooth, I'd recommend either the Scotch on the Rocks or the Yellow Brick Road, both of which include butterscotch chips with various other toppings. ÊThe pumpkin pancake is great for when the autumn holidays roll around and isn't too sweet. ÊJust be sure to order a single for your pancakes instead of going for a short stack -- one pancake is more than enough. Griddle also offers plenty of other options for people that prefer savory entrees for breakfast. ÊTheir omelets are like their pancakes -- large and stuffed with lots of toppings. ÊA personal favorite is their Cobb omelet, which is stuffed full of bacon and chicken and topped with avocado upon request. However, there isn't enough space for such a popular restaurant-- so there is a bit of a wait. ÊGetting here early is the key to beating the 1-2 hour long waits. ÊAnd like all LA establishments, parking is a bitch so be sure to drop off someone to put your names down while the driver struggles for a parking spot in the lot in the back or on the street.

Be prepared to wait for at least 30 mins or more on a Sunday to get seated, BUT it is all worth it. I don't know what his name is, but the lil hostess man that seats you is hella funny and does his job very well. we finally get seated and our waiter was great!. We got our food at a decent time and HOT as hell. i love that. fresh out the stove. I got an omelet and it was delish, but the chicken could of been cut into smaller pieces and have a lil more flavor to it. My friend ordered the banana pancakes and they were not only HUGE but DELISH!!!! My OJ was delish as well. Gotta love a good OJ. Will be going there again for sure and my lil hostess man remembered my name. That always makes a customer feel good!!

First off, let me say--I'm NOT a breakfast person. I'm really not fond of eggs. In fact, I HATE pancakes. I will say it again, I. Hate. Pancakes. But I have changed my mind. Or at least, I have made an exception to my life of pancake/breakfast-hating. My friends brought me here, and I reluctantly went along with splitting the Saturday Morning Fever pancake (Kahlua and bailey's in a pancake? WOW.) and the Chicago-Charlie omelette (YUM). The garlic toast was super yummy as well! Everything was delicious. The wait wasn't terrible, and once the order was in the food came out pretty quickly. Word of advice: Portions are HUGE! I came ravenous, and confused why three hungry girls were ordering a single slice of pancake and one omelette to share but this proved to be WAYYYY too much still! I can't wait to come back here again!

Just like any other brunch cafe, however, what stands out here are the gi-normous monster size pancakes and the possibility of spotting someone famous! Apparently, Redfoo or Sky Blu from LMFAO was seating right outside of the cafe! I don't know which is which, but he had a fro and was wearing a neon yellow Tshirt. When I walked out I just thought to myself, "wow, that's a big fro!" hahah... Ok, the food: Nothing super spectacular except for my banana pancake. These monsters had a golden soft exterior with a whole field of bananas. Yummy, light, fluffy, so simple but so right!

Dammit, I love this place! The ONLY reason I can't give it 5 stars is because of the wait. The staff is really cool about getting you seated as quickly as they can though and that's another reason why I don't hesitate to spend my $$$ there. The food is awesome - the portions are H.U.G.E. I have never, ever seen anyone (not 1) finish a plate of pancakes, but doggone it if they don't give it their best effort. I've taken friends and family from out of town here and they are never disappointed. Personally, I love the fact that they have non-beef and non-pork options for their chili - AWESOME! Their french press coffee is the best too. What more can I say?!

It was our first time to visit this place around 2pm today. You can park in the shared parking lot with Rite Aid so parking is no hassle. We walked in the back of the restaurant from the parking lot and made our way to the front of the place. Wow...it was busy and filled up with people eating breakfast galore! We only had to wait about 10 minutes which was pretty good. The biggest thing I noticed was the portions. Everyone had huge gigantic portions...and I mean gigantic...did I already say huge. Seriously, one portion is enough for two or more people. Two of us shared the Omlette My Soul and the Mom's French Toast. The omlette was super fantastic! Even a lady next to us asked about it...that's how great it looked...but oh my it tasted even better than it looked. We had it cooked with only egg whites and it had everything including some delicious shrimp. The Mom's French Toast was intense. If you get pancakes or french toast, prepare for your sugar buds to meet their capacity level. You will have a rush of sugar definitely come over you! I think next time, we will come with 4 people and order 3 dishes to share among us. The food and portions is what makes this place really good. The service is super friendly and excellent too! I also loved the coffee. You can choose among 3 kinds. We chose the dark roast, and it will come out in a French press kind of pitcher and it's well worth getting it to drink. The only downside to the place is that it's kind of a small space, so when you pack it with a lot of people...it can be quite a noisy environment. It makes it difficult to hear conversation at your table. We did notice that the place really cleared out around 3pm today, so maybe next time we will try coming a bit later at that time.

When I'm in the mood for wayyyyy to much breakast this is the spot! The pancakes are the bomb, as is the French toast. Had an omlette wasn't the greatest. Coffee is strong and plentiful, u get your own French press. I'd go for the oats n honey pancakes, simple, yet special! They have over-the-top options too..(chicolate, fruit, peanut butter etc)I guarantee you won't be able to finish a whole order of cakes, get the short stack, unless your sharing! Enjoy! Expect to wait atleast 20mins to be seated.

A friend and I decided to check out this place on a weekday. Service was very casual with only one waiter. ÊWe ordered eggs benny and a scramble. ÊWe managed to make a dent in each of our meals... we must've eaten enough to feed a small village! We decided to complete our dining experience with the Strawberry Belgian Waffle for dessert... to share, this time! The food was great.

I think this place is severely overrated. Highlight of coming here has been seeing Luke Perry and Ian Ziering having a mini 90210 reunion... not so much the food. Their breakfast is ok... pretty big menu... and their pancakes are good but I've definitely had better. Their egg and omelette options are also just ok. Their servings are immense though so I guess you certainly get your money's worth. There is noooo parking anywhere unless you want to risk it and park in the CVS lot and the wait is usually about an hour. SOOOO not worth it.

Food was great. I ordered "Peanut Bubba Crunchy French Toast." After finishing about half of my dish, I felt like I shouldn't be eating peanut butter for the next month or so. Portions are generous, so make sure to share/split unless you want to take it home for the next day's breakfast... or throw it away because you don't like eating one-day-old breakfast food. I see that this place has a solid 4-star with over 450 reviews, but I'd like to give it a 3 because of the waitress. First of all, she forgets my vanilla latte and brings it after I'm almost done with my food -- half spilled and lukewarm... at least her hand didn't get burned?

This is my new favorite restaurant in town. ÊIf you drive by on an afternoon, you'll see this is no secret, there is always a crowd waiting for a table. ÊI like to go on weekdays when they open at 7am and avoid the crowds. ÊAlso you will avoid what can be surly attitude on the part of the crowd wranger that works for the restaurant. ÊI wouldn't want that job, so cut him some slack anyway, OK, and if he gets a chance to know ya he will cut you some slack too I bet. Since I get there when it opens, I have time for a leisurely breakfast and still can get to work on time, the only drawback being I haven't had the guts yet to try ordering a lunch item at 7AM (the menu DOES say "Served all Day"). ÊTrue I don't care about the clock and will eat (or drink) anything at any time, so eventually I'll get around to it. ÊIt's just that I'm still working my way through the egg dishes (haven't even tried the pancakes yet) right now. ÊHopefully the lunch cooks are there when it opens and if I order a burger I ain't gonna get some stink eye, but I doubt I have any worries there. If you like coffee, a french press is your only option, which is awesome, but be fore-informed. ÊYou get your choice of mild, medium or strong brew. ÊIn the afternoon, there will be various chili choices depending on the day (if you're ordering a dish with chili), however so far the ones I've tried have been rather unusual in flavor and kind of detract from the meal, so maybe avoid the chili if you're a first-timer. ÊI haven't seen any chilis listed at opening (another reason maybe I should avoid ordering lunch at 7AM but we'll see...) Ê To impress your friends and family have them order the pancakes and gasp in awe at their sheer size and volume, besides, most people order pancakes anyway. ÊMe, I'll get around to them eventually I'm sure, but I prefer a Du-Par's sort of pancake experience and besides I never get tired of eggs. Ê You will hear some bluesy rock and roll on the speakers all the time and you get a feeling this place has it's own raison-d'etre and will leave its mark on history and don't even begin to ask me what the heck that meant, sorry. If you are looking for my personal non-pancake recommendation, I recommend getting the Pomodoro Omlette, which is filled with garlic sauteed tomato, basil and Parmesan (unfortunately the Parmesan cheese doesn't usually melt completely). ÊMake sure to add shrimp to that, it's a must! If you live nearby here consider yourself lucky. ÊIf you eat here that is!

I am slowly showing the awesomeness of Griddle Cafe to all my friends. My sister (Nina N. on Yelp) first introduced this place to me and I totally fell in love with my siblings. My friends TOTALLY dug this place! The price is good for the quality and especially the QUANTITY. Especially, those pancakes. My friend's eyes almost rolled out from shock by how huge they were. The French-pressed coffee is definitely a must! I love how it's do-it-yourself and it's hot! I especially LOVE the caballero! So good and friggin huge! The chips that comes with are also delicious. I also like their grilled chicken Sicilian melt. Also very big. Their Nutella French Toast was REALLY sweet and really nutella-y. So, watch out.

Wow. So good. I've been to the Griddle about 5 times, and have yet to try something that isn't amazing. I heard that the line is out the door on weekends, so I always go on a weekday morning, and the wait has never been more than 10 minutes, but it's always really crowded. Not really a spot for the ambiance, as it's really loud, busy and hectic. But the food is amazing! Coffee is served in a French press, the servings are HUGE, and the menu is expansive. I've only had breakfast, and usually split an egg dish and pancake or french toast dish with a friend. And we always take half of it home. I definitely recommend any pancake dish, as they're all very unique and SO tasty. But be prepared to eat it for days, as the serving is enough for several people. oh, and I found out after about 4 times of going there that there's parking in the back, and that you don't have to park a block away. Anyway, there's a reason this place is so popular....I can't say anything bad about it.

The BEST French Toast I've ever had! You are going to need at least 2 people to finish off the portions that this place serves. Or you could finish it off by yourself if you've A) Been stranded without food for days B) Have come off of a food fast or C) You are me! This place gets packed fairly quickly so come early.

So when my friend told me about her delicious experience at the Griddle Cafe, I just had to yelp it. Yelpers seemed to agree and I was on my way. Driving down Sunset, it's hard to miss. You'll see crowds of people lurking around. A good 20-30 people just standing around. And despite the persons everywhere, the wait wasn't too bad! It was only 30-40 minutes! Me and my friend knew the portions were ginormous but it didn't stop us from ordering two things. We got the Black Magic, crushed oreo battered pancakes. It comes in a threes, personal pizza size. They were fluffy, crunchy, and divine. It was so good because it wasn't too sweet, but still flavorful enough to stand on it's own without maple syrup. I think we only ate about 1/3 between us. We also ordered the Omlette "My Soul" with shrimp, with the griddle potatoes. A very good omlette. The eggs were fluffy and soft, and went well with the green chiles. Also the shrimp were done perfectly, nothing worse than rubbery overdone shrimp. All in all, it was a very delectable trip and I'll be back again!

Along with that i got some of their french press coffee and enjoyed the breakfast while sitting at the oval counter. Good stuff, i'll try and be back.

Special thanks goes to the LA Metropolitan Transit Authority and the SoCal Regional Rail Authority for making this breakfast possible. February 18th was the last day I had to use my free Metrolink trip tickets, so that's why I'm thanking them. I just wanted a good breakfast, that's pretty much the thought I woke up with. So I went on Yelp, typed in breakfast, and expanded the map range to cover pretty much all of Southern California from Lancaster to Oceanside. I decided to go for a highly rated place with a lot of reviews, and I ended up at the Griddle Cafe. I rode Metrolink Orange Line, Metro Red Line , Metro Rapid Bus 780 to get there. Sat myself down and ordered coffee, griddle potatoes, and Mom's French Toast. First, I noticed that the portions are a good size. Yes, it's about 8.95 for French Toast, but these are made from slices that cover 2/3 of the marbled dinner plate they were sitting on, and you get two! The sliced ham needed another darn plate to itself, and the griddle potatoes were about the size of a paperback ready to be open. In conclusion. You win people of Yelp. ÊI had great breakfast. Oh yes, the place busied up after 9:00 am on ÊWEEKDAY, so anyone wants to taste the griddle, has to wake their butt up or live in LA. That's a decision that Yelp can't help with.

Finally got a chance to try this place. This is where dreams are made ladies and gentlemen. Thank you all you previous yelpers for recommending the simplest French Toast on the menu. Mama's french toast will change your life. It will make you believe things you never believed before. Crispy, delectable and succulent all in one. And just to think the whole time the gateway to heaven was just a few blocks from me. But just a warning the gateway has a LONG line even on a weekday. Like mama always said "good things come to those who wait". And you'll come allright. You'll come so much you'll have to change your pants after. Coffee...also excellent. Service fantastic. Me----HAPPY.

Ridiculous! ÊBest breakfast in 2010! ÊBravo. We went back the next day to see if it was a fluke, It was not. We had the following and shared everything. French Toast (best of all time) You need this on your table, period! Waffles (best of 2010) Pancakes (Good and big) Breakfast burrito (Huge fresh best of 2010) OJ (Stay away! sour and gross) If you stay away from the OJ it will most likely be the best breakfast you have all year. ÊI am a huge fan and this is a must go.

Heaven on Earth. The Pancakes are Ginormous! One order of any pancakes can literally feed a village. Definitely considering sharing - sharing is caring. The wait for a table was long and my friends and I considered if it was worth it... and let me tell you my yelping friends - the wait is worth it! 5 stars across the board and an LA establishment that you should try at least once! I recommend the Golden Ticket Pancake that had banannas, struessel, carmel, walnuts and other yummy ingredients. Enjoy over-indulging at the Griddle!

Amazing! ÊI had heard a few stories about how big the pancakes were at the Griddle and all I could think about was the little hole-in-the-wall I used to eat at back home that had pancakes the size of serving plates! ÊSo my anticipation finally led me to the Griddle where we got sat rather quickly considering the mass of people waiting outside. ÊWhether they were waiting for a table or just hired extras to make the place look busy from the street, the tactic had me very anxious! Ê As my friend and I walked in, the aroma of syrup and sausage and coffee overtook my senses and we were sat right in front of the kitchen at a long wrap around bar similar to a sushi restaurant! ÊI glanced at the menu and immediately my mouth started watering... pancakes filled with OREOS topped with whipped cream, Fluffy french toast and a plate that appeared to have a generous portion of scrambled eggs, meat, and hot sauce skimmed right past my nose! I promptly ordered a cup of coffee and ÊThe Golden Ticket, a pancake plate served with 3 banana-walnut battered pancakes with cinnamon, whipped cream and struessel topping it. When the meal came out, I couldn't believe the 3 gigantic pancakes were falling off the side of the plate!! My anxiousness finally was fulfilled when I took the 1st bite into this amazing delight! ÊWords cannot express how delicious this was. ÊI finished half of the plate, determined to save some for the next days' meals. Ê If only they had a challenge (like man vs. food) that i could stay and eat the entire plate, I would've finished it all in one sitting, but my ego was put aside for the sake of savoring it another day! I will definately be coming here more frequently now as well as all my family when they visit me on vacation. ÊIf there happens to be a wait when you visit, it will be well worth it. ÊGood eatings!

Stopped in to fuel up prior to our hike at Runyon Canyon and had a great breakfast. ÊHIGHLY recommend the breakfast tacos - eggs were fluffy, the salsa was just spicy enough and they were NOT stingy w/the freshly sliced avocado on top of BOTH tacos! ÊMy husband had the cheese omelette and that was also very good (just a little too plain for me). Ê If you crave the sweet stuff for breakfast their menu won't disappoint. ÊIt was full of creative pancakes and french toast selections. ÊThe "Scotch on the Rocks" was my #2 selection - butterscotch, coconut, pecans (or some other nut, can't remember) and oats...never seen that before but I was so curious. ÊI saw a few people's pancakes and french toasts come up and the portions were HUGE. ÊTo top it all off they had both SportsCenter and The Flintstones on the TVs - two thumbs up. Anyway, go here if you can - yum!

My oh my, the line. A good 45 minute wait, but worth it. The french toast was too soggy for my liking, but BF loved it and devoured entire thing. I ordered a wholey moley with baked bananas inside per the request of the waitress, but it came out sans banana :( Griddle Cafe made it right though by bringing me a piping hot new one and a mimosa on the house during my wait for new pancake. Their french press coffee was fantastic and I would definitely go back!

MONSTROUSNESS PUMPKIN PANCAKE RRRAAWWWWRRRR. Took a special trip from Simi Valley to check out Griddle Cafe. The cafe is decorated kinda similar to how Nickel Cafe is, has the vintage vibe. The service was slow, and I almost want to give them a 4 stars for it, but the food was amazing. The proportion size was HUGE as well, the triple stack of pancakes were amazing. I need to try the red velvet, I will be back that's for sure. They had a decent selection of beverages from coffee, capps, latts to irish alcoholic drinks haha. Parking was a pain in the ass, and nearby street parking is not allowed on the weekends, so it's kind of difficult to get a spot near this place.

If 'Melrose Place' or 'The OC' was a restaurant The Griddle Cafe would be it's name. Whatever you do, don't go here on weekends, you'll wait for days and days and days. If you must, order take-out - it's only a 20 minute wait. Food is very good but the young hipper-than-you wait staff is as incompetent as they are attractive, they're more concerned about their non-existent Hollywood careers than getting their customers orders correct. Make sure they explain the menu! They get a real thrill out of surprises... For example, the pancakes are three huge 12" discs stacked in three - enough to feed 4 people, your eggs get only ONE side (you'd never know that reading the menu). Don't be intimidated by these talentless showbiz wanna-be's.

Have wanted to come here for years and finally tried it yesterday! Ê Took a bit of driving around but we did find parking on Fairfax. ÊThere were 4 of us on a Saturday morning around 10 and we waited about 25 minutes, not bad at all. ÊJust as others have said, the waiters are very good looking but we were pleased to also have friendly and efficient service. ÊI hadn't even finished my Diet Coke when another one was quickly brought. Between the 4 of us we had the Tequila Sunrise, The Golden Ticket, Black Magic and Creme de la Creme. ÊI don't think we finished even half of anything but it was all so good! ÊWe split a side of pork sausage to slightly balance the carb overload. It was a lot more crowded when we left. ÊI can't wait to go back here again!

My Fiance and I ordered one red velvet topped with cream cheese frosting *drool* and one Saturday morning fever, which has bailey's and kahlua and a big glop of whipped cream... Mmmmmm.... They're ginormus so we only ate half of each... But if you have a big appette, you'll be satisfied! I'm kinda sad I couldn't finish it :(...

Best (and BIGGEST) pancakes EVER! Seriously. When you come to The Griddle, you better bring your "A" Game. This place is not for the faint of heart. You're in the mood for a Breakfast of Champions? Guess where you're gonna go? The Griddle! Not only are their pancakes MASSIVE, they are delicious! I've had 'em all and they're all outstanding. Some are sweeter than others, but it's all good. They offer about 15 different varieties of pancakes. My personal favorites are the Banana Nanas and the Bluesberry. Ridiculous, I tell you. We're extremely lucky to have a place like The Griddle in Hollywood. Simply fantastic.

Pancake overload!! My best friend and I came here to try out this place for brunch. ÊAll I can say is pancake overload! ÊWe ordered "The Golden Ticket" Pancake, which was the golden "Bananas Nana" pancake filled with caramel, walnuts, and treusel; topped with whipped cream, caramel and streusel. ÊThis pancake was the size of a pizza and literally overflowing the plate. ÊIt was very delicious, but way too much for just 2 people to eat. ÊI feel like each pancake can probably serve 4 people, so it would be like $3 per person if you split the cost. Ê Ê Yes, this place is a must-try breakfast joint, but be sure to bring some hungry friends or you'll have pancakes for days in your fridge.

What a great go-to breakfast place! We started off on a good note because we were told the wait would be about 40 minutes for 2, but it only took 20. We were seated at the corner of the bar near the kitchen, which didn't bother us. Our waiter was sooo nice and was really attentive, even though it was noisy. I ordered "Poached y Papas" (eggs benedict) with spinach instead of ham. And they put it on fried potato skins instead of the normal english muffin, and it was yummmmy! ÊI would just say- the hollindaise sauce was a bit much for me, especially because they are VERY generous with it. If you're weary of heavy dairy sauces, do yourself a favor and ask for it on the side. My boyfriend got the Bana-nana pancakes and it was delicious!! Huge portions. They also have great maple syrup, and I'm thankful for the real shiz. A great experience overall!

This place is a perfect brunch spot. But make sure you are in the mood to wait for your table...when we went it took about 40 minutes to seat us...but we also went on a Sunday for brunch. I love the little man who screams everybody's name when it's time to be seated. Once we were inside we didn't sit in the main dining area. We were taken in the back where they have a couple of private rooms so we ended up in our personal room. I ordered a mimosa to go with my brunch and to my surprise they were 2 for the price of 1. I also ordered the salmon platter which came with bagel, cream cheese, onions, tomatoes...the works. The rest of my party ordered omelets and breakfast burritos. The portions were both big and delicious. We couldn't finish all of our plates. It was a nice and delicious place for brunch and cannot wait to go back.

Oops I did it again! Every time I go to the Griddle, I get the pancakes and my buddy gets the French toast and we always think that we are going to eat the whole thing. We never do. Not even close. But it's always worth the try. The orders are huge and the food is delicious. . There's something great about getting up late on a weekday morning and eating a breakfast that is like your mom would cook. The reality is that Mom never cooked this much cuz our plates weren't even big enough. Mom didn't serve breakfast all day long, either. Oddly enough, Mom did have a bunch of Hollywood hipsters hanging outside waiting for a table. Hmmm... I like the crowd. I like the food. I recommend the place. Here's a tip. There is a back door and restaurant parking behind the Rite-Aid store. You get to it on Fairfax. You'll never find parking out front.

Great place with Good Eats, but beware of the wait. Luckily we came during a weekday, so their was no wait until the late crowd came along. I suggest you come here with a big appetite. Come to the Griddle Cafe starving because the servings are HUGE!!! Ê OMG...we are a family of four and we ordered the following: The Goldend Ticket - Banana, Walnut, Streusel, Caramel, and Whip Cream pancake. Yummy yummy in the Tummy delish!!! Now mind you this was a 3 stack pancake that literally covered the plate. My eyes were not deceiving me. I was only able to eat a pizza slice worth and the passed it on to my husband. The Breakfast Burrito - This was also huge and came with a side of tortilla chips, sour cream, and slices of Avacado. Husband was only able to eat Êa 1/4 of the burrito. This too was delish! The Original Griddle pancake - My boys ordered this plain and mind you this was for a 10 year old and a 5 year old and there eyes opened wide once they saw how big they were. They very much enjoyed it. I also enjoyed the coffee - fresh pressed coffee nice and hot. We definitley plan on coming back to try other items on the menu. GRIDDLE CAFE definitley will not dissapoint.

I love, love, love Griddle Cafe! I have never had anything I have not liked. From the excellent French Press coffee (request your favorite flavored syrup), to the Hueves Rancheros (Tequila Sunrise), to the amazing pancakes (I dream about the Yellow Brick Road!). You will never leave hungry and you will always have about 2 pounds of pancakes in a to go box for later. Their portions are huge! I usually come here for breakfast on the weekends and there is usually a long line. Coming very early or past the lunch hour cuts down the wait. The wait is definitely worth it! I usually order something sweet (pancakes!) and convince my understanding boyfriend to order something savory so I can have it all! The Griddle is also a great place to bring out of towners. Everyone always leaves full bellied and smiling!

I live a few blocks from this place and every time my partner and I drive down sunset we always see a long line of people outside. I do have to say that I was a bit skeptical about going here at first because usually a place with long lines in Hollywood usually means "overrated" and not worth it. But we eventually caved in to the pressure and tried it out. What can I say... "I'M HOOKED!!!" In the past month we've been to this place four times. I think it's part of our regular Sunday morning routine. We tried coming on Saturdays but its usually super busy as soon as it opens. So we changed it up and now go every Sunday morning at 8... I guess it isn't such a busy start since everyone's probably still at home with a hang over from Saturday night. I LOOOOOOOOOOOOVE their french toast. One of the best I've ever had... and that fact that you can customize it by adding different toppings is great. Their creme dela creme french toast is by far my favorite, with the Banana Pancakes coming in a close second and their Charlie Scrambler coming in third. The portions here are huge.... but the more the better. I never really understood why people post "huge portions" as a negative.... not like they're forcing you to finish it. ;p I took someones advice and boxed my left overs to go for the homeless people around the block on fairfax... however they weren't too keen on the idea on taking it. Ehhh oh well. STILL.... I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! GOOD FOOD AND THE SERVERS WERE FUNNY AND GREAT! CAN'T WAIT TO COME BACK AGAIN THIS SUNDAY!

Usually when my boyfriend and I want to go here, we drive by and we see a monstrous crowd waiting outside. We sigh & then go to Hugo's or Blue Jam. This has happened on most weekends lately. Today, however, I lucked out and got to take my brother on a Monday. Finally. I was able to evaluate the hype. Parking: All meters along Sunset are broken (which isn't Griddle's fault). Luckily, there is a huge parking lot behind the building off Fairfax that they share with Rite Aid and a shoe store. Wait: It was Monday morning at 10.. No wait. Be prepared to wait an hour to 2 hours on the weekends. This place is quite the destination for brunch. Service: waitress was very friendly and made some recommendations. She said DO NOT try the red velvet pancakes and the peanut butter French toast together, despite what some Yelpers may say. Taste sensation overload. To the max. Thank goodness she said that.. Food: Portions are enormous. We took our waitress's recommendation and got one sweet and one savory plate to share: Kickin' and Screamin' Tacos and the Peanut Butter French Toast (which had some spiffy name I don't remember). Tacos came out first and we wolfed them down. There were two of them and they were excellent. Then the french toast came. Between two 20 yo guys who can eat, we made it 75% of the way. It was massive and rich. Think the Reese's Peanut Butter cup in toast form. Surreal. Definitely will be coming back. Just don't know if I'll be willing to wait for an hour or two, only to then want to sleep my food off for the rest of the day.

I went to the Griddle for lunch on a Friday with some coworkers. For 7 of us, the wait was 15 min, which I was told was really short for this place. If you love large portions, you'll love this place. I was the only person out of the 7 of us who had a normal portion - everyone else's plates were stacked to the brim. I had shrimp tacos cause I'm not really a breakfast person. Everyone else had breakfast items. I tried some of the pancakes. They seemed average. My tacos were okay, nothing special. Overall: eh, it's okay.

If you want dessert for breakfast, then the Griddle Caf is THE place for you. I normally like eggs and some kind of meat for breakfast. This place makes you want to forget about eggs, bacon, sausage, and toast. We went to visit one of our best friend and her son during our trip to Socal and she raved about this place. We got to the caf at around 12:30 pm on a Sunday and as we had expected, wait time was about 40 minutes. I ordered "Addicted to Noisella" stuffed French toast. There were two huge pieces of French toast stuffed with nutella and sprinkled with some more nutella and powdered sugar. OMG! It was sooo good. I was only able to eat half of it cause it was pretty rich and really sweet. Some of the other things we ordered was a "Black Magic," an Oreo-filled pancake topped with whipped cream, Oreo pieces, and powdered sugar. That pancake was huge!!! I think there were at least 3 dinner plate size pancakes. ÊWe also had cheesecake for breakfast a.k.a. "Crme de la Crme" French toast, which is crusted with graham cracker topped with creamy, cream cheese mixture, and powdered sugar. Every bite tasted like a New York cheesecake and I had to look at the French toast twice to make sure I really am eating a French toast. The caf was packed with as many tables and chairs that they could possibly fit in the space. Atmosphere was loud and lively. There were TVs showing sports games. Service wasn't bad and breakfast got to our table in a timely manner.

Part of the appeal to Griddle Cafe is it's location and the fact that celebrity sightings are likely (we've seen Adam Brody and Eve from America's Next Top Model). ÊThe first time we went, Casey got blueberry pancakes and I got banana. ÊThe pancakes come in HUGE portions - about 3 pancakes that are almost a food wide. ÊI ate like 1/10th of the pancakes. ÊThe second time we tried the egg entries, which were good as well. ÊIf you want pancakes, I'd recommend sharing, no matter how big your appetite is. The service isn't that great, since this place is SO busy. ÊThe wait is usually at least 30 minutes on a weekend morning. ÊBut I'd recommend it for the experience!

The food was amazing and the portions were HUMUNGOUS! ÊI ordered the blueberry pancakes and were very impressed. Ê The menu was extensive and had so much that it took me about 20 minutes to settle on blueberry pancakes b/c my friends all rave about them. ÊMy friend ordered an omelet that was to die for~ My only qualm was the prices, ridiculously long wait and hard to find parking.

If you eat right, food coma is guaranteed. Among a group of 4 we split the following: 1. The Golden Ticket: My favorite of the meal, but I might be biased since I LOVE bananas in baked goodies. These pancakes are GINORMOUS... 2x the size of my face!! maybe 3x... They were moist and even pretty good as leftovers. 2. "Addicted to Noisella" Stuffed French Toast: Chocolatey, Chewy, amazing stuff 3. Mom's French Toast: Your basic french toast, I didnt think there was anything mind-blowingly good about it, but it was good nonetheless! In general, I think the french toasts had better texture and were more well made than the waffles and the pancakes. 4. "The Griddle" Waffle: Again, your basic waffle 5. Tequila Sunrise: Nice contrast to all the sweet stuff. The sausages were flavorful and tasty! All in all, a great brunch experience! I must say though.. the best pancakes I've ever had were from Pastis in NYC...

I'm sorry but I can't give this place 5 stars with a good conscience. I know everyone thinks the pancake stacks are delicious, the french toast melts in your mouth, and they're ridiculously generous with the portions. I agree, for the most part, because I've had their pancakes, their french toast, and a variety of other breakfast dishes. But the last time I went, I ordered a "healthier" dish with egg whites and turkey sausages. I forget the name but really, for $11, I expected a little more. Sure sure, how crazy can you get with egg whites and turkey right? I'm not sure but I figured if anyone could do it, Griddle Cafe could. I wasn't satisfied with the fact that the eggs were runny and the dish tasted bland. However, I'll still give it four stars for the other dishes, and for the service! AND THE COFFEE. Mmm. I love the man who seats you ... you know, the guy with the shaved head and glasses. I was waiting for my boyfriend for a while but decided to put my name down. He called my name but my bf had not arrived. He told me he'd keep me in mind, although there were plenty of other patrons. ÊSure enough, when my boyfriend got there thirty minutes later (groan), he made sure to seat us right away! He's awesome. I hate the lines, I hate the wait. But overall, I think Griddle Cafe is a great breakfast/brunch/lunch spot and I'm sure I'll be going there for years to come. Except ... I'll go wild and get their pancakes and french toast instead of their egg dishes. *Blech*

This place reminds me of Hash House in San Diego and that includes the ridiculously long wait to get seated. Saturday brunch is pretty much a disaster because you end up waiting out in the cold for a good hour or two. However, they supposedly have the best pancakes ever. I guess best is just another synonym for humongous because these pancakes are the size of small pizzas (similar to Has House). But, I do think that these taste a little bit better. I got the Yellow Brick Road because I am a lover of all things walnuts and they delivered on that. I also had to try poached eggs at any breakfast place I visit so I got the "Poached y Papas" Benedict. Minus stars for overcooking the eggs. That is the cardinal sin of poaching eggs. But, I do think it's pretty creative to serve the eggs and ham on top of potato skins rather than an English muffin. The Hollandaise sauce was sub-par, but I still left feeling disgustingly full from the pancakes and eggs. I might return to try some of their other breakfast items like the stuffed French toast, except I'm not a fan of waiting so long for mediocre breakfast foods.

I almost wanted to do a one star review in the hopes people would stop going! ÊThis place is super popular and crowded. ÊBut I couldn't do that to them. They do it right. The red velvet pancake, peanut butter banana French toast, their bacon and scrambles are all the best. And the workers are quick for how crowded this place is. Well worth the wait.

First and foremost i just wanna say WOW!!!! How much more food can they bring? Today was the first time i visit there with a friend of mine and had one of the biggest meal of my life. The food was absolutely delicious, but waiting in line to get food was quite torturous. I always heard about this place, but never had the chance to actually visit it, so i finally did. I've tried their omelette's with avocado, chicken, and cheese, topped with olives and salsa... to top it off they bring a big chunk of potatoes with ranch as preferred. If you don't mind waiting in line for 20 to 30 minutes, then it's a great place to go. Make sure to have your full party to be seated, otherwise they'll make you wait ;)

I could write a page about how great this place is but instead I'm gonna keep it short and sweet.... I just went there for the first time yesterday morning and i brought my sisters that were visiting for San Diego...I was crossing my fingers that this place would live up to the excellent reviews and it certainly did! this place was way packed by 10am and we had to wait only about 15 minutes for a booth inside...3 main reasons why im going back to this place: 1. huge portions of good tasting and reasonably priced food! 2. excellent fresh coffee! (delivered to your table in your own individual french press) 3. minimal wait time and fast service!

The food - slightly above average. Parking - It's Fairfax and Sunset, so it's a crapshoot. The service - horrible on a not that busy Monday lunchtime The wait - horrible on a busy Sunday brunch We put our name down on the list, our whole party was there, but they still LIED to us, leading us to believe that we'd only have to wait for 15 minutes when we waited an hour and 15 minutes. The second time that I tried the place, we got seated quickly, but the waitress took our order and never showed her face again. She wasn't even in the same salon as we were for the duration of our lunch. The food was alright and their token thing is the size of the pancakes: HUGE. I mean, these pancakes are bigger than my FACE! And I've tried to make pancakes that size so I know it's hard to make sure that the middle doesn't dry out. I had the pumpkin pancake and I tried my friend's Oreo pancake; the pumpkin one was moistened by the pumpkin , but the Oreo ended up a little dry. The chili fries were pretty good; the fries weren't too starchy. All in all, the place is more about the location and the people you might see.

So if you are ever able to finish one serving of their pancakes (which is 3) you will officially be labeled a fat ass. The pancakes are huge! But damn good. Believe dat. I had the Tequila Sunrise which was chili relleno and some sausage and cheese with an egg thrown in there... sounds weird - but who cares, who says weird can't taste good... Ben had French Toast which i didnt get a chance to try but he ate it all so I can only assume that he liked it. This place got really busy AFTER we got there (which is nice) so expect a wait if you're coming here on the weekends... They also close early (around 4pm) everyday. What a delicious way to start the morning!

I haven't been here in a few years because I moved from gentrified Silverlake to the LBC, but I still wake up with a craving for this place at least once a month. Sure, it's kind of grimy, too crowded, and full of would be actors and directors, but it's worth it! There's always some eye candy and someone to flirt Êwith. The pancakes are HUGE and you get three. NOTE: You can ask for just ONE pancake. I've seen the biggest of men fail to finish 2. The chili is great, too. Skip the OJ, they use cheap oranges. It's a novelty diner, if you're expecting more, then pass.

My boyfriend was having some major cravings for pancakes yesterday so of course I couldn't resist taking him to the Griddle (his first time), even though it's been months since my last visit. ÊJust the look on his face when his "Black Magic" pancakes were placed in front of him (3 stacks deep and 18 inches in diameter each, piled high with whipped cream and even more Oreo crumbles,) was worth the trip, but overall, I must say, I was reminded of why I'd give this place 3 stars ("A-OK") at best. Sure, the portions are awe-inspiring, but when you really dig deep into the quality of the food you're getting, it's definitely above average, but not mind-blowing. ÊHowever, I do give points for an inventive, expansive menu, and definitely recommend breakfast over their lunch items. ÊAnd the absolute highlight is their french press coffee...mmm. ÊCan't get that just anywhere. Avoid sitting near the server station towards the back of the joint like we did...something about being that up close and personal w/ the servers and the conditions of the back area detracted from our meal a bit...then again, it IS essentially a diner... BUT the Griddle is definitely worth the novelty of the experience...and you can't beat the people-watching.

Prepare your mind, prepare your mouth and arrange for forklift transportation back to your house. ÊThis place is no joke!

One word: OVERRATED. Unless you like long lines, forgetful and slow service, don't go to the Griddle during prime brunch time on the weekends. ÊI waited 40 minutes for a table for 2 at around 11am on a weekend morning. I'll give them props for their amazing French press coffee. Large pot, the choice of 3 brews. Nice. ÊI got the basic breakfast of eggs, turkey sausage and griddle potatoes. It was just average. My meal came with toast. I ordered wheat. They brought me sourdough. About 10 minutes after the rest of my meal was delivered. How long does it take to make toast? Seriously. I need to dunk my toast in my eggs, very important!!! They had some more interesting options but I was lame in my choice. My date got the Tequila Sunrise. It looked like eggs covered in enchilada sauce. Um, it did not look that appetizing at all to me. Ê Unless you have an appetite bigger than a mack truck and a sweet tooth, I'd go elsewhere. Ê Despite the mediocre-to-poor review, I would consider going back to check out their rumored delectable griddle options on a less busy day and time. But only if I ever wake up with a severe sweet tooth.

Ambiance: ÊAlways packed with people and rather loud. ÊMore of a casual lunching scene - not intimate or romantic (any place that promotes their range of chili flavors is not romantic). ÊLuckily there is quick turnover so waiting is never too long. ÊMAJOR CON - the restrooms are a wreck! ÊConsidering the size of the place it is strange that there is a single bathroom for each men and women. ÊEven if they were trying to create a private bathroom setting as a luxury - it does not succeed when it is left with no toilet paper, no paper towels, ravaged cupboards with open doors revealing gross bathroom utilities ÊSame disgusting status in both the male and female bathrooms - it couldn't have just been by chance. ÊWhen I see such a gross bathroom, I worry about the kitchen. Service: ÊThe waiters are upbeat but always rushed. ÊBecause they have to cover so many tables, they are often forgetful if you ask them to bring something. Food: ÊThe pancakes are delicious and enormous (they would have to be to spend $13 on just three pancakes). ÊHonestly you can feed 3 people an entire meal with these pancakes. ÊI always order an omelet - my favorite is the Cobb omelet (it does not get better). Overall: ÊI would recommend going here for breakfast and lunch food. ÊThere are some minor celebrity sighting to be had at this place. ÊI can only hope that when you show up the bathroom is in a more sanitary state.

3.5 stars -- Came here on a Monday morning and they seated us right away at a table outside. Considering that there was construction, we asked to be seated inside; a few people just left so once again we avoided the wait! Once inside, you could tell that it was a "homey" place: the noise level was high and the tables were tightly placed but no one seemed to mind. I'm not a big fan of pancakes (though it did look delicious!) so I opted for the "Poached y Papas" Benedict while my cousin chose to have the "Addicted to Noisella" stuffed French Toast. The food arrived and looked absolutely delicious. -Noisella French Toast: you really cannot go wrong with Nutella. That in itself is an impossible task; 4.5 stars -Poached y Papas Benedict: it's a pretty hefty looking meal with three large potato skins topped with a thick piece of ham and two poached eggs. First off, the potatoes were great, crispy yet tender. The ham was okay, I thought that it was a little too salty. The hollandaise was pretty good though I think they put way too much on the plate. The eggs were at most decent, it was overcooked and I expect my yolk to be runny and golden not set and light yellow; 3 stars Overall, the service and atmosphere was great but the food definitely did not meet my expectations considering it has such rave reviews.

Get there early and park in the Rite Aid parking lot off Fairfax. ÊAnytime past 10 and you're risking a huge wait. While you wait outside (required because it's too crowded inside), step across the street to Coffee Bean to whet your coffee appetite and kill some time. At Coffee Bean strongly consider using the restroom because The Griddle's restrooms are kinda nasty and have a line. When you do finally get inside, take a sweeping look of the room because you're bound to see a celeb. Ê Once seated, order more coffee and conspire with your friend(s) to split meals - one of you should get the pancakes or french toast and the other should get an egg dish. ÊExpect some spice - their non-griddle food has a Mexican edge. SO DELICIOUS.

Impressive portions. Coffee press. Indulgent flavors. Trendy atmosphere. Bring a friend to share the joy. No one ever said it was wrong to have such a sweet breakfast with flavors I enjoy at a bar--Bailey's and Khalua. You heard right, and what better alternative to have it than in pancakes?? ÊHUGE circles of fluffy goodness get edgy on the plate, though they are fluffy, there's that lingering texture after you eat that destroys some of the flavor.

Brought my grandma here. Was a little skeptical since most of the customers are 30 and under at first glance. I told the host upon arrival that we had an elderly person(there was a little bit of a wait when we got there and grandma is 96) and they sat us right away! I got the red velvet pancake because there was so much buzz about it. It is definitely a pancake, although super sweet. I'm glad I got it. My husband got the French toast because there was also a lot of talk about it. He thoroughly enjoyed his. Grandma got the apple French toast.

ORIGINAL REVIEW POSTED ON 10/01/2007: By the time my food arrived, I had to take a shit so I left (I have an issue with public toilets in WeHo). The french press coffee was a nice gimmick though.

I went on a Thursday morning and it was still busy, but we were able to get a table within 10 minutes.

ÊI had the famous french toast which was about 12" in diameter and at least an inch thick, dusted with a cup of powdered sugar.

The place always has a wait outside so I was expecting the food to be really good. The atmosphere is nice, and I liked the selection of Blues music. They had lots of choices on the menu, with lots of creative ways of doing pancakes. When the food finally came the servings were HUGE....if anyone can finish an order of the pancakes themselves they just might explode. HOWEVER, the taste of the pancakes wasn't that great at all! They were dry and not fluffy at all. They were thick, but more solid than "light and fluffy" like good pancakes should be. I "get" the draw of the place, but when it comes down to it, you are there to eat, and if the food isn't that great why bother? I think it's because it's considered a "cool" place. If you want lots of food that tastes "ok" ( I mean iHop makes better pancakes for goodness sake!), then the Griddle is fine. But if you want to have an actual tasty breakfast, go somewhere else.

The food here is good, but not entirely special. If you scour yelp you can find a couple of places that have pancakes that are just as good in less than massive portions and don't have an hour and a half wait if you come after 8 a.m. for breakfast (i.e. Cici's in Tarzana). I understand part of the appeal is having pancakes so big that you can compare them to body parts but I always feel guilty spending money on pancakes I can't finish and can't take home (they just don't taste the same after). I can eat a lot, but seriously, no one can finish 3 of those pancakes--that's why you see first timers laughing hysterically when they get their plates and pulling out their phones to update their facebook status about the ridiculousity of their breakfast. I also don't like that there aren't any plates that offer maybe one pancake and two sides. All sides (to your pancake plate) are an additional charge (adding additional guilt to the food I wont finish). My taste buds are always conflicted between sweet and salty during breakfast and I like to have a little bit of both to quell my confused mouth. Ê BUT one of my favorite dishes at this place is the Kickin and Screamin tacos; they're freakin' good. You'll get taco all over your hands and face but you'll still shamelessly lick whatever place or body part you can to get some mo'. Overall, the food is good but not always worth the wait/price for the amount of food I can ACTUALLY consume. If I somehow turn into Kobayashi this place would be 5+ stars.

Some of the best breakfast I've ever had! Huge portions. Tasty eggy treats with chipotle tequila sauce. Ridiculously good pancakes and french toast. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because we had to wait for an hour and the guy said it would be 30min when we out our name down. -L

Delicious! Yes, parking can be a hassle. Yes, it's crowded. Usually, these two things alone are a huge turn-off, but I have to say, this place won me over. You like nutella and other evil foods? They have it. And they know how to use it. The decor could use a little upgrade - was initially wary of the oldish looking sofas in cement-coloured rooms, but the food is an excellent distraction (as it should be). Oh yea - if you don't want to feel like a disgusting glutton post-delicious-meal, sharing is an excellent option! PLENTY of food to go around, even for hungry men.

This place is tiny and you can barely walk around in there, but it's worth it! Beware, they are super strict about having your entire party there in order to seat you. So make sure everyone shows up on time so you can get seated. Their pancakes are super unique and I wanted to try them all!!! But I only got to try: Red Velvet pancake: Tastes like actual red velvet cake!! They piped the traditional creamcheese frosting on top and it was so good! It only comes with 1 pancake, but I don't think we could have eaten more than one. It got pretty rich and super sweet. Tis the season: This was a pumpkin pancake. It was everything I dreamt of and more! Very good if you're a pumpkin lover like me Mama's french toast: Really good. As good as french toast can get I suppose haha.

On occasion I get a craving for banana pancakes, and it's usually around that time that I start thinking about the Griddle Cafe and its promise of of sumptuous pancakes the size of LP's on Miracle Grow Êserved in a hip spot on Sunset. But before you rush out to satisfy your carb cravings, a word of caution: the idea of the Griddle Cafe is about 90 times better than the reality. That's because in reality the food isn't all that great (compared to a quality breakfast place like Jinky's or The Omelet Parlor, for example). Then there's the wait, which even on a Sunday morning at 9am can be a hassle. Top it off with an above average noise level, and service that can be spotty at best, and it's hard to see what all the fuss is about.

I am hooked. This place is for people that love big portions of good food and if you are a sweat lover. If you are a diabetic or cant eat that many sweats I wouldn't recommend it. What I ate: I had a yellow brick road to myself. A friend had a regular french toast and another had the original waffle. We went on a Saturday around 3:00 and there was no line at all. You can sit wherever you want. Because they close at 4:00 P.M. So if you want to beat the line just go later instead of in the morning. The food is kind of pricy. Extra bacon cost around $4.00. :P

Everything about this place was great. We only had to wait 15 min for a table outside on a Saturday morning. ÊAnd no, we're not actors nor am I famous. Ê The coffee comes out in a French press and is really good. Who does that anymore? ÊThey really want you to enjoy a great cup of coffee and and a result, they don't pressure you to leave. Everyone raves about the French toast, but I went for the ham and poached eggs instead.. Really good! My buddy had the chorizo and that was good also, despite being a little speecy spicy.

Griddle Cafe is a small cramped joint and you're sitting about a foot away from the table next to you. If you don't mind sitting next to people like me, who like to stare at what you're eating, it shouldn't matter. There always seems to be at least a 20 min wait for a table with no real waiting area...it sucks but it's semi worth it. If this restaurant wasn't located on Sunset and wasn't so over-packed I'd come every week. Their blueberry sour cream pancakes were scrumptious, like having a heaping dollop of blueberry yogurt on top of my pancakes (except it was sour cream). I never knew this pairing would taste so good. My endless pit of a belly could only handle about 1/4 of the plate, so I'd advise girls who care about their waist size to share with a couple friends (or a special boy).

This place has to be one of the most hyped up places in LA. For the most part though, it does live up to the hype. The food is excellent. I've only gone on weekdays so I've never had to wait in line.

This place is a good breakfast/brunch place if you live nearby and there isn't a wait. I've been here 3 times, each time it was a friend's request we go. I don't get the hype AT ALL. It is better than IHOP but nothing worth waiting a half an hour for. I'm a huge breakfast person, and an even bigger fan of sweets. However- their nutella stuffed french toast and their cheesecake french toast (which isn't cheesecakey at all, it's just a whipped cream cheese strip piped on the french toast) are both FAR too sweet for me to even eat half. I have never said anything is too sweet. I would weigh 500 pounds if my friends weren't so skinny that I feel guilty eating 2 cupcakes in front of them. I felt sick all day after eating these two dishes. I eat nutella out of the jar so I don't know how they made it even sweeter than that. Their simple 'Mom's French Toast' is classic. I can eat it all. I can eat plain french toast anywhere though. With that said, ÊIf you have friends visiting from out of town, they would enjoy it if you took them here. Make sure to point out the line of people waiting outside to prove how popular it is.

Dust off those aviator sunglasses and military caps and then head on over to The Griddle Cafe with a hearing aid (YOU'LL NEED TO TALK LOUD IF YOU SIT INSIDE) and an empty stomach. ÊMake that 8 empty stomachs, which you'll need once you see the portions. Ê After basking in the sun for the 45 minute wait, I had a suntan to compliment my hearty breakfast. Ê While my friends ordered the French Toasts (yummy!), I ordered the "Gone Shrimping" meal (Egg Whites scrambled with Shrimp, basil pesto, scallions, and tomatoes). ÊI MUST recommended it if you want to take a break from the carbs and want something not too sweet for breakfast. Although the food was excellent, I gave The Griddle Cafe 3 stars because the extra effort you had to give in order to enjoy the meal was just too much. ÊI expected some sort of wait, but didn't expect it for the food, bathrooms and the check. ÊAnd also, kiss the Parking Fairy if you happen to find a spot in the free parking lot.

Hands down one of the best breakfast places I've been to in LA. They have so many different kinds of pancakes, omlettes, waffles, etc that you will have the hardest time choosing. The problem is you can't get a few dishes and split with a friend (unless you have a huge group) because the portions are INSANE, and frankly, quite wasteful. My friend and I opted for something sweet and savory so we ordered blueberry pancakes and a mexican-food style omlette that was stuffed with avocado, salsa, and chicken sausage. I was about to explode and we both only had less than half of each dish (maybe only a little over a quarter of the pancakes). They have french-pressed coffee which is delicious, and you can take it to go after your meal. Only problem is this places can get packed. Servers are attractive and snooty but that's to be expected of a well-known Hollywood restaurant.

Being on the Yelp's Hot Picks for a few months already, I had high expectations with Griddle Cafe- not a very good sign. Came here on a week day for brunch. Started off with iced coffee, where they gave us a jar of coffee presser that's good for two people. Coffee turned out to be really mild in flavor, a little too watery for my like. The food made up for it. For the two of us we each ordered our scrambled egg dish (shrimp & sausage) and shared a red velvet pancake- which was super good. On first glance the pancake looks awfully sweet, but as I ventured into the first bite, it literary sends you into another dimension. The sweetness and the texture of the red velvet pancake is so well balanced, it was as if the pancake was screaming to be seated in the classics section- and it deserves to be. For next time though, four people would make an awesome adventure for pancake tasting!!

Come here for breakfast, end up eating lunch. Great breakfast food! Chili omelets and blueberry pancakes with blueberry butter is awesome, you have to try it once. Now the bad parts, parking is hard but you can usually get something within 5-10 minutes behind the Griddle Cafe in the Savon Parking lot. Also the wait during breakfast through lunch is easily an hour regardless of what the guy with the clipboard says. Either get there at the crack of dawn or after two, they close at four. The horrendous wait and bad parking hurts this score the most.

As many, many others have already reported, this isn't a place to pop in/out of for a quick breaky-bite. It's a lengthy process to experience, even mid-week. But the food is rather remarkable and a fair value for what is charged. Problem is, it's too much food and therefore, not cost effective to the consumer unless you are a lineman on an NCAA division 1 football team... who hasn't eaten for three days... and is trying to carb up before a big game. I had a frittata, my companion had the blueberry pancakes. It was a usual 30 to 40 mins to get the food, but it was all fresh, hot and tasty. I sort of compare this place to the Grizzly Manor Cafe in Big Bear Lake where there are a dozen or so tables, a 3-4 waitstaff members, and what seems to be only one guy doing the actual cooking. The only difference other than the locale, is that the Griz is less expensive. The wait, the hit and miss staff attentiveness, great food quality and humongous portion "control" is the same. If it weren't for the service and time to order/deliver issues, this place would be a true 5 star WHLWD joint.

5 for the Nutella french toast 3 for the french pressed coffee because it was decent, but it was definitely over priced! Eeeeek! 3 for the A Time To Love pancakes. SO SWEET! My God! 4 for the bacon and turkey sausages (or so my friends rated them) Overall, my expectations were a little too high. Though the pancakes were good, they tasted more like candy than pancakes. The atmosphere was nice and simple, typical American diner style. I will go back because I do want to try the different types of pancakes, waffles, and french toasts. Just keep in mind, get ONE pancake instead of two or three! (It comes with three) If planning on coming here, be ready to wait. Cheers!

I just got home from this place and I can't move. This place apparently has it in their heads that for 9.95 you better be getting the BIGGEST PLATE OF FOOD EVER. For that reason I actually recommend splitting plates... Its so much food. And its all really good food. I had the fiesta scramble, and I think I'll also be having it for dinner. Super flavorful. The staff is charming. The place is clean. The only down side is the wait, but coffee bean and tea leaf across the street helped with that.

Finally figured I would give this place a shot being that I had my first open weekday morning in who knows how long. I read that it got busy after 9am so I made sure to head out a little before 8:30am from my place to make sure I beat any sort of rush. It's awesome that the Rite Aid lot allows for Griddle Cafe customers. Free parking is always a huge plus but I can imagine this place filling up fast if it was a bit later in the day. The place was a lot smaller than I thought it would be but I really enjoyed the set up especially the little bar area that had old cartoons playing on the TV above it. I got the blueberry pancakes (only 2 since I knew how big they were gonna be) sans powdered sugar because I like maple syrup (especially since they have the real stuff) and didn't want stuff to be overly sweet. The pancakes were really good; solid thick batter with loads of blueberries throughout and I enjoyed the addition of the blueberry sour cream. I also went ahead and got some dark French press coffee. I'm no coffee expert but after my first sip I was impressed. It was very flavorful and a nice accompaniment to my pancakes. While the food was good and all I was really impressed with the service. It wasn't too busy but the guy who was waiting on me was really friendly and attentive. Also being that I subtracted one pancake from the normal order I was expecting a subtraction of $3 but it turned out to only be $2. This could be a recent change but just something to keep in mind. I was very satisfied off of my two large pancakes and coffee, however, so I still don't regret my decision. Final thoughts: All in all if I have some free time in the morning I would definitely want to come back to this place. I would love to come with a group so we could order a variety of dishes and share as I enjoy mixing sweet dishes with some savory ones (see my Parkhouse review). I can't speak for the later hours but if you can make it in before 9am there isn't a hassle and you're in for some solid breakfast with good atmosphere.

Lately I've been in a peanut butter phase (no, I'm not pregnant) so I decided to try the peanut bubba french toast: all I can I say is "I just died in peanut butter heaven." The combination of a soft toast (what a oxymoron) and crunchy peanutbutter crumbs placed beautifully on top with fluffy whip cream can be best summed up in one expression: Wow! As for the 'gone shrimping' omelette, it was nice and light just because it was made solely of egg whites. You can definitely taste the freshness in the tomatoes, capers and avocado. I can also tell the shrimp ain't the frozen kind either. So my two meals is a combination of sinful and healthy. Kudos to you Griddle Cafe.

Ranks high on the price/value index. You get so much food for the price that it's almost insane. The omelets dishes are hefty and is a huge meal on itself. The pancakes are crazy large. Regular orders are stacks of 3 pancakes the size of large dinner plates - would literally take you a week to finish it off. The maple butter that comes with the pancakes is delicious. I've learned better and have been ordering the short stack (with 2 pancakes instead) which only takes me 1/2 week to finish. Of the pancakes, I'd recommend the yellow brick road if you like nuts. It's drizzled swimmingly with maple syrup & butter. Btw - if you plan to go for brunch on a weekend morning, make sure you get there by 9am as it can get crowded very fast, with up to 1 hour wait. There's also a couple of back rooms are large parties - you'll have to request that. You can also eat at the counter, which is faster to seat.

I went there for breakfast on a sunday and we had to wait about an hour and a half before we finally got a table. Its a really small place for how popular it is. I gave it three stars because the food was good but there was nothing especially good about it and the portions are much too big in my opinion. For breakfast food that is not out of this world, it was also kind of expensive. I do understand that the portion size accounts for the price of it but I would gladly go smaller on the portions and save a few bucks in my wallet. I got the chicago style omelette, the mounds of pleasure pancakes and a coconut hot chocolate and it was about $30, alot in my opinion for breakfast. The omelette was good, I liked that they used a lot of toppings but it was a bit dry. The mounds of pleasure was really was my favorite part, I am a big lover of chocolate and coconut and it was two of my favorites combined into one. However, I think they did overdo the whip cream and chocolate syrup because it was incredibly sweet. A few bites and I was full. The coconut hot chocolate was delicious, no complaints there.

Probably some of the best French toast I've had. Not too sweet, good texture, and great powdered sugar on top. The protein eggs were decent, but I had to add salt and hot sauce to give it some flavor, probably because it was made sans yolk. There are metered parking spaces around. My only complaint is that when I asked for extra plates, my waiter took too long. I ended up going up and asking some other waiter near the plates to hand me a couple. Also, I would ignore the other reviews that say the portions are huge. I think they are all talking about the pancakes. The eggs and the French toast were not big at all. Maybe I lucked out and ordered the two average sized dishes on the menu.

The Griddle is one of those "must see" breakfast places in Los Angeles. ÊLocated in the heart of Sunset Blvd, be prepared to hunt for parking and stand in a 45 minute line. ÊUsually, I just run across the street to coffee bean for some coffee while I wait in the line. Once you finally get seated, you will appreciate the 'locals only' feel inside. ÊDespite being a huge attraction due to their reputation for massive portions, you still will manage to get an engaging waiter and friendly service. I would have to agree with a lot of these reviews- you cannot go wrong with French Toast. ÊThere are so many types to choose from, and there is no way you can finish your plate alone.

OH MAMA - the Portions are GIGANTIC. I can't stress enough how large they are!!! The portions are HUGE ... did I mention that? haha. I love this place - it's so fun... blues music, cartoons, and good food. I'm there. There can be a wait depending on when you go, but we only had to wait 20min so that wasn't so bad. They do want your whole party to be there when they are ready to seat you - FYI The OJ is so good - Not too sweet or sour- more please! There were 4 of us and we all shared our dishes: Apple cobbler French Toast: I do wish the apple pie filling was a little less out of the can and more fresh ... but it was still good. Chocolate Chip Cookie French Toast: "Hello Lover!" OMG...Disgustingly Good. Poached Y Papas Benedict :I love you for putting a potato skin under the ham and eggs. I didn't have the hollandaise because I'm not a huge fan of it in general. So, I added hot sauce ... so yummy. Couldn't finish it ... there were enough leftovers for the rest of the week.

Great little spot! ÊBring your nitroglycerin pills and defibrillator's cause the food here can probably kill a healthy race horse. ÊAfter a bit of a wait (I try to not deduct from a restaurant due to a wait if it really is busy) I ordered a coffee and "Creme de la Creme" french toast. ÊThe coffee is brought in a french press, which is simply the best way to have coffee. ÊSaying the coffee was very good would be an understatement, it borders on greatness. ÊNot too long after the coffee my tables orders started arriving. ÊDaaaaammmmnnnn! was all I could say. ÊI was looking down at a french toast like no other. ÊCoated in a graham cracker crust with generous helpings of cheesecake and whipped cream on top. ÊIt was delicious. ÊCan't wait to go back to order it again. Ê The menu packs plenty of variety if a sugary breakfast is not your thing and the service seems to be efficient. ÊSure, there is a wait, but well worth it. ÊParking can be kind of a pain (just street parking). Ê If you decide to pay a visit here make sure you dial 9-1 on your phone before you start to eat. ÊThen, while eating, if you start to collapse, dial 1 again. Enjoy!

This place was delicious. I've lived just down the street from it for about a year and a half now, but I've always been somewhat intimidated by the ever-present long line outside of the restaurant. I finally went with my girlfriend last weekend though, and we were both very happy that we gave it a try. The food is well worth the wait (and the line actually moves surprisingly quickly). We shared the red velvet pancake and an order of some sort of huevos rancheros dish (I can't remember the actual name). The eggs dish was just ok, but the red velvet pancake was awesome. Warning though to those with big appetites: it's called "red velvet pancake" on the menu for a reason: you only get a single pancake. Although it was delicious and I had no regrets about ordering it, I did have slight pancake-envy when I saw a number of other people in the restaurant being served some of the other pancake dishes on the menu: all coming in huge stacks of 3. No worries though. I'm definitely planning on going back sometime soon.

I know everyone really likes this place but I really did not! I hated waiting in line for so long especially since some how they forgot to call us. The host guy said someone probably took our table when they did call our name. Once seated, the service was poor. It was really dark inside even though it was Saturday morning and the tables are too close to each other. The portions were big but the food was nothing special. The french toast was too sweet and overpowering to enjoy. Maybe I'll give it a try again... not sure.

Blehhhh... this place is a no-go for lunch. I spy crappy service! Which urks the hell out of me. How hard is it to smile and pretend you care? Really. I haven't had breakfast here but a few months ago I met a friend for lunch and the entire meal was forgettable. As in, not good enough to remember what the hell you ordered and bad enough to pray you'll forget... Forget the rude busboy who tried to rush me to order before I'd even laid eyes on the server once; or the chai latte I had to send back three times because the first time it was cold, the second time it was luke warm, and even hot it was still blehhhh; and the meal, well, does it matter? It wasn't good enough to numb the sting. Bad service and gross beverage... boo! How do you screw up a chai latte? Too forgettable.

Thank god I ordered just ONE old fashioned pancake! ÊIt's the equivalent to four. ÊI don't understand how anyone could eat their serving of three?! ÊThat is absurd. Ê It was delicious! Ê Portions are Texas sized! ÊSandwiches are piled high, fries are stacked, side salad is a dinner salad.... It was kinda embarrassing the size of the food and amount on my small table. Ê The service was excellent! Ê Service was really personable. ÊMy drink was refilled even before I could think of asking. ÊThey cleaned the table off quickly, but didn't give us the check too quickly like they were trying to run us out! ÊTiming was perfect. Ê Three televisions were playing-sports, news, and cartoons.

I am a fan of this place, but it has been diminishing returns since my first visit. The french press coffee is usually great -- but this morning my first batch was filled with grounds. There must have been a hole in the filter. The service here is rarely good, with the struggling-actor waiters often paying little attention to their tables. Though it's much quieter on weekday mornings, it's still a slow-moving place. Still, much of the food is quite delicious. I'm always pleased with their french toast, and a couple of the egg dishes are great as well. The prices, of course, are a little on the steep side for breakfast, and compared to Blu Jam, this place doesn't quite match up. If the hipster crowd is more your style, than this could easily be your breakfast favorite in Los Angeles.

My favorite is the French Toast !! Love it so muccchhhh,,, The pancake was good too but maybe I will get different one next time, the oreo is not really my favorite. It is kinda salty. The Chicago's Charlie was good!! All my friends love it and it was their favorite! Definitely I will be back!!! It was very crowded but we were lucky and we got seated for after 5 minutes wait only!

Bring your wheelbarrow. You will need to be rolled out of the building. You will want to unbutton your jeans to relieve your sore belly. You might even slip into a food-induced coma while trying to finish your plate. Portions are HUGE. Plan on sharing or bring your A game. The pancakes are bigger than your head and when you order, they automatically give you a whole stack unless you specify that you just want one pancake. Even the manliest of men will struggle to eat more than just one. Believe me, there was a huge dude sitting at the table next to us that I would have bet money on finishing his Black Magic pancakes. He didn't even make it halfway through his stack. Ha! My whole family agrees that the Peanut Bubba Crunchy French Toast is the best thing on the menu hands-down. The bacon is the best side-- it's thick and juicy and... hold on. I just drooled on my keyboard. Also good: Golden Ticket pancakes (banana nut with caramel), Creme de la Creme french toast (cheesecake flavored), and the Strawberries and Cream waffle. if you want something savory, go for the Poached y Papas benedict. The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the Blueberry pancakes -- didn't care for the blueberry filling. Breakfast (which is served here all day) is my favorite meal. And The Griddle is my favorite restaurant for breakfast-- except when I'm dieting. :) Almost always a long wait.... worth it every time. Don't go there on a weekend if you're already starving, you will wait for over an hour. Maybe two. If you can make it on a weekday, you will have a very enjoyable visit.

So I'm not from the City of Lost Angels, But if I was i would probably Êweigh 500lbs because of this place. The first time I went was 3 years ago when i was in LA with a couple of my friends for my birthday weekend. One of my friends we were staying with brought us here, and holy wow, happy belly time was on it's way (well after the hour wait for a table.) For the past few years I have been dreaming of the pancakes that are larger than my head and the Benedict that basically took a whole big and potato patch to make. On this most recent trip to LA i made it a point to go here for breakfast with my boyfriend. I was fearful though, because 3 years of dreaming can lead to some false realities. Was that pancake really that good? or am i just romanticizing the whole thing?... Well let me tell you, this is place is exactly the same as it was 3 years ago. We got there and there was a huge line, but there is a Coffee Bean across the street, so I recommend to grab yourself a little coffee concoction, and hope that you're hanging out with someone cool enough to hold a conversation for 40 minutes. The line is kept organized by a pit bull of a guy. Maybe he's a New York transplant, or he has some on set experience with organizing idiots. Either way, he keeps that line in check, and is very strict about who goes in which line and where in that line. It's kind of entertaining. Once we got in, we sat at a booth and ordered our food. I ordered the Benedict but minus the ham, and plus avocado, my boyfriend got the Fiesta Scramble, our friend got the Benedict plus spinach, and i ordered a BLUESberry stack of pancakes for the table. When our food came to the table, our hearts melted, everything was exactly as i remembered and tasted better than i could have ever conjured up in my head. We weren't able to finish all our food at all. The pancakes are great! they top it with blueberry sour cream sauce, and they are packed with fresh blueberries. The Benedict is on fried potato skins, which takes the whole thing to another level. I would suggest coming here to mend a hangover, and it's definitely a destination breakfast place to take someone visiting. The Griddle has that "Wow" factor, and it doesn't seem to be going anywhere any time soon.

I love this place. ÊMake sure that you have an appetite 'cause everything is huge (pancakes, french toast). ÊBut if you don't want to wait in line for a minimum of 30 minutes, get there before 8:00am. ÊBut its worth the wait. ÊMy favorite is the Creme de la creme, since I love both cheesecake and french toast, it's the perfect blend. ÊIt's the best desert for a lazy afternoon. ÊAnd my boyfriend raves about the Gone fShrimpin' Ê I can't forget the coffee served in the French press. ÊThey got those commercialized coffee houses beat. ÊThe coffee rocks with the creme de la creme. I think I will stop by there for a "little" snack.

I agree with Jonathan G that the idea of the Griddle Cafe is better than the reality. I try to check out breakfast spots on Sundays & then head over to the Hollywood Farmer's Market. To maintain good karma, the plus side: a cute spot, nice energy, cute bar area (curious private rooms in then back) very friendly staff, & really nice service Ê-- new to LA, ÊI am grateful when the waitstaff is anywhere but indifferent. That's all I'm asking. Oh, and, bonus for melior coffee & individual teapots. Tres civilized -- while you are waiting -- see below -- On the minus side, the food is mediocre Êat best (honestly, the pancakes could pass for aunt jemima -- add water mix, not even full mix), but what's worse is that it takes entirely too long for the food to arrive, and during said wait, the acoustics in the main room are unbearably loud -- headache inducing, whether or not you were up until 3 am or not. Seriously, the place already has brick walls --- who designed the steel contraption above the bar area? I do not believe it is venting (correct me if I am wrong, please) it is a sound and headache accelerator. I would say redirect to the 101. And then head to the Farmer's Market.

Ohmygawd, the best breakfast EVER. Yeah, huge waits on weekends. Which is why I never go before 2:00 pm, cuts wait time down to 5-10 mins. By 3:00, you'll be seated right away. Note that the restaurant shuts down at 4:00, though... You don't go for the service -- though it's usually adequate -- you go for the pancakes. It's impossible to visualize how large they are without seeing them for yourself. One order consists of 3 massive pancakes. Regulars will usually ask for just 1 or 2 (I recommend 2... even if you don't finish them, that extra thickness is deliciousness itself). Hard to beat the Black Magic pancakes, loaded with the black part of Oreo cookies, but they have several other choices, too. Their egg dishes (Charlie's Scramble, Yumm!) are also top notch. And the coffee is not to be missed. I've yet to have better coffee in Los Angeles. Simple French press style, really good beans. Also some of the best orange juice in the city.

My sister kept pestering me to come to this AMAZING place...I finally did. Yes, they have amazing pancakes; I had the French Toast with cream cheese and a side of fruit. The best I ever had...but let me warn you: this place is crowded and your packed-in like sardines. Parking and waiting sucks, too. I had to knock off a star (not for the parking, not for being packed in like a sardine), but for the FRUIT FLIES!!! There was always a fruit fly here or there...then when I asked for a cup for my fruits, I dumped my fruits into the to-go cup and a SWARM of fruit flies flew out it to greet me! Yes, it was disgusting. I went back on another day, and luckily I was safe from fruit flies! Their pancakes/French toast is worth a little "protein."

When I have friends or family in town, even if for only a couple days, I always find time for The Griddle. Pros: The atmosphere is alive and moving, the menu choices are never ending, huge and shareable portions, nearly everything on the menu is DELICIOUS. Cons:Usually a wait, sometimes slow service, parking can be a bitch, seating is a little tight. Favorite Menu items:Grilled Shrimp and Pesto Melt, Yellow Brick Road Pancakes, Peanut Butter French Toast, The Big T Melt (Tuna Melt), and The Spicy Cobb.

One word for this place: AMAZING. Best known for its pancakes and french toast, this is truly one of the food highlights of LA. My roommate and I got there around 10 am on a friday morning, so we didn't have a problem with parking, and our wait time was only about 10 min. But the place was PACKED. And I mean, you can barely hear the person in front of you. Service was good considering the location and amount of people there. I ordered an egg and hashbrown meal, and it was okay. Nothing to call home about. But my roommate ordered the cheesecake frenchtoast, and it was the best french toast I'd ever eaten. That's why this place gets 4 stars. Only order their specialties (mistake on my end) because they're awesome. Also, come during a non-peak time in order to avoid long waits and a hunt for parking. Will definitely return and highly recommended!

Love this place for brunch. I got the blueberry pancakes...THREE whopping flapjacks with lots and lots of blueberries immersed in the cakey goodness. I thought I could eat it all myself, but all I did was put a dent in it! I was only able to finish one and a half pancakes and I was beyond stuffed. My friends got the nutella french toast to split, a smart move since they didn't end up suffering like me in the end!!! I really want to try the Golden Ticket Pancakes when I go there again. Would also like to try some regular breakfast items like eggs and potatoes. Be sure to get there early or go a little later in the afternoon - otherwise you will wait in line for a very very long time. Overall, yummy place for a great casual brunch!

We only waited 5 mins on a Sunday to get seated!!!! Amazing. It was meant to be. We had the tequila sunrise and the red velvet pancake: The tequila sunrise is their version of ranchoes rancheros and they make it more traditional with a red sauce. Ok, when we initially saw the red sauce, gross. I was actually scared but we were pleasantly surprised as the sauce was very tasty and made the dish. The famous red velvet pancake is one cake and it's dessert on a plate. We shared it and I could only eat 1/3 but it was delish. It's a dessert and too sweet for breakfast. Inside it's loud and if you can come here with just two people, you're better off. Tables of 3 or more really have to wait a long time (40 mins - 60+ mins) . :( Overall, a great place to try. *Check mark off my list of places to try.

Of course everyone has been to the Griddle Cafe... A drag, because the wait is ridiculous. They should really think about expanding....but that would take away the intimacy of the place, and it would be just that much closer to being like every other hole in the wall breakfast place wouldnt it....or is it there already? I always get their plain one stack pancake...im a plain batter with light maple syrup kind of girl. All the others are tasty as well. The HUMUNGO breakfast burrito is pretty yumm. It's huge. Unless you have a big appetite, I would share this with someone. Especially if its the first meal of the day. I've had pretty much everything on the menu. The overall type of food....plentiful portions and I think they serve beer. :) Parking sucks tho. You have to street park it and expect to wait at least half an hour - even if you get there before 11. Theres a coffee bean across the street for some pre- breakfast sipping. :D ENJOY

Apparently, this past memorial weekend was all about breakfast/ brunch. As much damage I had incurred the previous day, I wanted to punish my body even more by eating pancakes the size of double D breasts multiplied by three. Anyways, come here early, or you will face dire consequences....an hour of a wait. Especially on weekends. To the point- Gargantuan portions of delectable eats. Wide array of choices for your lard infused death. Blueberry pancakes- These babies were loaded and each bite had an explosion of blueberries. There's also a yogurt (?) sauce and powdered sugar topping these hotcakes. SERIOUS CAVEAT: I am not joking when I say their pancakes are the size of a porn star's tits x3. Three of us ate an order of these pancakes and had leftovers. Don't say I didn't warn you.. Why not 5 stars? The ridiculously long wait and slow service. Docking a star for that.

As advertised, the sweet stuff here is amazing. I got the peanut butter french toast, and it was as huge as the pictures you've seen here, and really tasty (if not a bit rich). Their omelet was good too: not the best I've had, but certainly solid. Being a "must visit" place for the unique sweet stuff though, it's a five star rating. BIG TIP: There's no way you're going to finish off their pancakes or french toast in one sitting, at least not if you want to function for the rest of the day. Go in planning to bring the leftovers home, and it'll make a great dessert later in the day.

I went there today, super excited! I kept thinking about their delicious pancakes while rushing my co-workers to go to lunch sooner than usual!! I think I must have hyped it up a bit too much, because I wasnt as impressed as I thought I would be. ---When you go there, remember that you can get validation at the Rite Aid lot. Just be sure to bring your parking ticket so that they can validate it for you.. It's up to 3 hours!!--- When I first got there with my friends, we were in a party of 5. I think there were 5 other parties in front of us. We literally had to wait 40 mins, when they said that it'd only take 15. I didnt mind, it had a great view, and some pretty interesting passing by, but thank god it wasnt a hot day! When we were finally seated, the waiter was really helpful and nice about getting us our drinks.. And also we had used the time waiting around to look at the menu so we knew exactly what we wanted. So he also took our order.. but the food took SOOOOOoOoOOooOoOoOoOooOoOooo long to get out. My friends and I ordered "Black Magic" which was the oreo pancake. It was delicious, of course! So the wait was worth it.. But being lunch time, I was pretty hungry, and I was also craving more "salty food", so I also ordered their turkey cranberry sandwich.. Shared that with my friend.. Huge portion with great fries. But I was highly disappointed in the sandwich, because it was EXTREMELY sweet, and the turkey was dry and flavorless. My friend had a side order of ham, and WOW.. It was REALLY big. Around the size of the pancakes I guess, and it was also really good.. Everything was pretty up there in the quality aspect, but I am not too sure about that turkey sandwich, which is one of the reasons why I gave it a star down.. Also, please make sure that you get stamped for a longer time if you do have to wait for seating. Last time I went, I got two stamps, and only stayed there for 1.5 hours, and they STILL charged me for parking. Im sure that this was a mistake, but be sure to voice up the error if this does happen. Be sure to bring cash because I am pretty sure most of the time the Griddle Cafe is PACKED. So you will probably have to pay a few bucks here and there for the parking.. But besides that, it was a enjoyable experience, and I will definitely come back to try more stuff on their menu!

Holy cow, this place is pretty amazing. Ê I came here on a Saturday morning, expecting a long wait but was hoping that the food would more than make up for it. ÊAnd it DID! I ordered a custom burger, and chocolate pancakes (the size of your FACE). ÊSeriously, pancakes that would put Man V. Food to shame. ÊWhat I liked about the pancakes were that they were cooked consistently, no burnt edges or under-done center. ÊOfcourse most humans wouldn't be able to finish these pancakes all in one sitting, so how are they a few days later you ask??? ÊPretty damn good! ÊThe custom burger was cooked to perfection, and the flavors of the bacon, cheese, and red onions mixed real well to complement the beef patty. ÊOverall Food experience 8/10. The staff here are very entertaining, and the runners hustle double time to get food out to you right away. ÊNo complaints in this area. Ê8/10 I ate in an outside table, so I can't comment much on cleanliness but any last comments would be that this place is always packed, so come preparing to wait. ÊNext time what shall I have?? Probably some artery clogging french toast!! :P

Line is freakin' ridiculous. Showing up at the unearthly hour of 9am (that means breakfast, not brunch, at least in my book!) still means there's a line. Seating for groups of more than 4 is very limited. Pancakes as others have said are huge (feeds 2 or 3...). And very delicious-- although it looked like our stack of apple pancakes had sat for quite some time while the rest of the food was being made-- that was disappointing (plus they were kinda limp...). French toast, we had apple as well as plain. Yummy-- although I think the original might have been the best? The apples they used were good but might have been a little overwhelming, just too much food on one plate. I didn't eat very much french toast so my impression is limited-- good but I'm not sure if it's a favorite. Had one omelet, er, scramble and one waffle order, too. Both of those along with the lunch item were the only reasonably sized thing on the menu. Strawberry waffle was pretty good, and fed one hungry person properly. Scramble looked marginally oversized but not by too much, and the sausage in it was damned good. We had one lunch item, I forget what it was, but it got devoured. Of all the various breakfast places I've tried lately, this is perhaps the best. I need to go back to Original Pancake House in Redondo Beach to see how they compare, though-- I haven't been there in years. The people watching isn't as good here at The Griddle as some other places, but to be honest that's more my style-- I want my tastebuds to know I'm at a place paying for the food, not the other people, and that is true here. Oh, one side note: the coffee sucked.

Êthe bread they use for the french toast is the size of your head (they must bake their own bread, because i've never seen bread that size). Êand they give you TWO slices. Êthe ham.. oh, the ham. Êit looks like a pig was just cut in half and sliced up. Êtwo of us shared french toast + a side of ham and still had leftovers. Êyou will definitely not leave this place feeling hungry. Êunless you are kobeyashi or j. chestnut. aside from their ginormous portions, they have creative mouthwatering combinations of breakfast and non-breakfast items, like peanut butter capt'n crunch french toast (what we had), chocolate chip crusted french toast, oreo pancakes, chocolate-expresso pancakes, and a bunch of other stuff i can't recall right now but remember sounding really good. Ênot only did half the menu sound good and look good (from looking at other tables), but our french toast tasted good as well. i would love to come with a group of, like, 30 people, so i could try at least five other things on the menu.

I have waited long to come to this place. Finally, I made it! On a Thursday morning at around 11am, there was no line at all. My husband and I were seated right away. For a breakfast place, it was pretty dark inside. I felt like I was in a bar. I ordered "CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE" CRUSTED FRENCH TOAST. The portion was big. My first bite was excellent. It really tasted like a chocolate chip cookie! There were many many chocolate chips. The french toast were delicious. The cookie crust gave some texture to the french toast. I like it a lot. But I was so done after I have finished the first french toast. I was so overwhelmed. I just can't take another bite. My husband had "POACHED y PAPAS" BENEDICT. The eggs were runny. The HAM was sooo juicy and flavorful! The potatoes were crispy. I had a few bites, and I like that a lot. My husband liked it overall, but there was too much Hollandaise sauce. He was overwhelmed by the sauce. I guess it's never good to have too much of a good thing. Don't be mistaken. The food was very good and different. I just don't think I can eat this everyday. It's good to try at least once! I will go back someday for sure.

The wait sucks...I hate using that language but thats the best word for it. Huge portions, food is creative, staff is attentive and reminds you that you are in Hollywood where people are prettier than the rest of the world. My girlfriends and I love ogling the staff...is that a wrong reason to go to a restaurant, is it trashy...perhaps, but when the guy serving you eggs looks like he belongs on a Romance Novel about a viking you can't help it!

I had their Barry Yellow ÊPancake-Lemon Raspberry filling and the BF had the Chicago Charlie scramble. ÊBoth our dishes were.. ehhh. Probably won't come here again. Waited 20-30 min for our table for a less than mediocre brunch. ÊThe service was really prompt though, considering how busy the restaurant was. Ê For those who cannot eat a stack of 3 pancakes, bc each pancake is probably a foot in diameter, the griddle has an option of only ordering 1 or 2 pancakes for any of their pancake items! they take off Ê$2 for every pancake you take off.. so if you order 1 out of 3 panckes they'll take off $4 from the original price of the menu item ( I THINK). ÊYou should probably confirm this with your waiter/waitress. This was a plus because one pancake is definitely more than enough for me.

I can't lie, the food is really great if you have a sweet tooth. But the long lines are just absolutely NOT worth it. Waiting an hour or longer to eat is just ridiculous especially for breakfast. You will be standing on the busy street too as you wait.

ÊFor breakfast, my son ordered the peanut butter french toast and I ordered the Creme de la Creme french toast (graham cracker crusted with cream cheese). ÊIt tasted like cheese cake!! ÊMy bf, not having the sweet tooth that my son and I have, ordered a scrambled egg dish with turkey sausage. ÊIt was really good.

SICKENING FAUXHAWK CENTRAL. Ê Not like I let people's dumb hairstyles get in my way of pancakes bigger than my face, though. This is just the kind of place where you spend ten minutes agonizing over the menu, and then you place your order with a nagging worry that you might want something else... in my case, I got the banana pancakes and kept thinking about the strawberry waffles with brown sugar sour cream.

I finally got to visit this place after having it bookmarked for a year now. The place was busy, but the wait wasn't so bad. The hostess was very courteous and informative as well as the Waiter. The joint is very casual and modern. It is definitely a great place to catch up with an old time friend because it is so loud that nobody can listen in on your conversation. i like that. My boyfriend and I had the nutella "noisella" french toast and the "pomodoro" omelette with a side of potatoes. The noisella french toast was extremely packed with nutella. It was delicious and pretty but a little heavy on the nutella. I suggest asking for less of the hazelnut goodness because the toast is worth having if you want dessert for breakfast :D The pomodoro came with basil, parmesan, tomato and garlic and an option of egg whites with an additional fee. It was good, but gets old fast maybe because the portion was so large. I enjoyed the meal nonetheless. Especially the potatoes! Ohhhhh the potatoes were good. The meal came out to be about 25 dollars without tip. Park on the street but expect some walking, not much though. Be weary about pemit required parking.

It's kind of overwhelming, actually. So many choices! Do I want pancakes mixed with Kahlua and Bailey's Irish Cream or pumpkin pie filling? Maybe a more traditional pancake with some berries mixed in? Howzabout a nice slice of French toast coated with Nutter Butters? Seriously. And then you start feeling sick thinking about all that sugar coated carbs topped with fat, so you think maybe have something egg-related, a little healthier, right? Again, so many options, all utterly mouthwatering. But if you get the eggs, then you can't have the pancakes! It's a dilemma. So the waiter suggests you get your eggs with a side of one pancake. Brilliant! And since the portions are absolutely huge, you essentially end up with 2 separate ginormous breakfasts for each person. Seriously. You'll have enough leftovers to feed a baseball team, breakfast AND lunch. It all tastes really good, too, but it's really a lot. It was really crowded, so we got seated in this weird private backroom that was painted to look like it was old and grubby...and it kind of was rather shabby back there. Personally, I missed the people-watching and publicly social aspect of restaurant eating by being seated in the private area, but the people I was with enjoyed it for its privacy and quiet. To each their own, right?

Oh look, another Griddle Cafe review. How original. Ê(OK, now that I've gotten that off my chest, I can proceed...) Breakfast is sacred to me. For some reason, I've been unable to find that perfect breakfast that fills me with that feeling that I've both indulged my desires as well as fueled my body for the day ahead. So, after reading the countless reviews of Griddle Cafe, I dragged my wife out of bed on an early Saturday morning and trekked over to Sunset. I wanted to get in early to avoid the crowds. Nothing is going to hinder my experience of griddled foods. And after suffering the constant barrage of old-man quips and swooping eye rolls from my non-breakfast loving spouse, we finally arrived to a moderately busy restaurant. Plenty of tables and no waiting. Just the way I like it. I stayed relatively safe and ordered the blueberry pancakes, while my wife stayed boring and unenthusiastically ordered plain ol' pancakes. I warned her that portions were big and there'd be no way that we weren't leaving with leftovers. After a short wait and some delicious French press coffee, our mountains arrived. It was overwhelming. I was up to the challenge, but still- that's a crapload of pancakes. And that is where I deduct one star. While everything tasted fabulous, and was exactly what I was expecting, there truly is too much of a good thing. In these eco aware times, it seems that Griddle Cafe is doing nothing more than wasting food. Who really wants to eat pancakes for three days straight? Not me. And why not bring breakfast back to it's variety. Cut down on the pancake size and maybe add a side of sausage or bacon. Since when did breakfast become just pancakes? Or just Eggs and Bacon? Where is my variety? Where is my cornucopia of griddle cakes, fruit, bacon, sausage, jellies, and eggs? Why is always an extra side now? I can't reasonably justify ordering 17 pounds of blueberry pancakes and then tacking on a side of sausage. That's just plain excessive. Oh well. It seems that my quest for the perfect breakfast continues, but Griddle Cafe definitely earns it's namesake.

I'm taking one star away because of the wait! However...you should wait. Just make sure you clear your schedule for the day and that you are not pressed for time. The food portions here are sooo big! It makes me question how people in LA are still skinny! The food also is very good. I mean veryyy! I didn't have a complaint at all about my coffee, the food, or the service. The waiters were friendly and laid back. The yellow brick road pancakes is something you should consider getting! It took five of us girls just to eat half (granted we each had our own meal) I was in line angry and hungry...waiting for our names to be called. I def left happy and full...ready to be rolled out to the car... When I'm visiting LA again...i will def come back...I will just make sure I camp out or don't have any other plans for the day.

Mmmmm pancakes!!! Êand waffles covered with big bright red strawberries mmmmmm This is my favorite pancake place anywhere I've lived in the US. ÊHumongous pancakes with a scent that wafts up from the plate enveloping you in a carb high. ÊI could rave that they have REAL butter or that the REAL maple syrup brings me to rapture but NO I must talk about the pancakes. ÊMy favorite is Oats and Honey with my French Press Coffee. ÊA great reason to wake up on Sunday ... and I mean EARLY Sunday before the rush. The waiters are cute and friendly my favorite is the Clark Kent look alike .. delectable.

This place is a little overrated. The only thing I liked from this place is their bacon which is nice and crispy and their coffee which is above average. I know that this place is hyped up and everyone is going to disagree with me but here it is: I know a lot of people rave about their humongous portions. I love big portions and knowing that I'm going to be full. I DON'T, however, want to be eating THAT much. What's the point of serving a plate full of pancakes that you know no one can finish? I have never once seen someone in that restaurant finish their pancakes. They eat maybe a third of it and leave the rest. This is just a waste of food. It's gluttonous. It's also not good when you take it home and put it in the fridge. It turns into cardboard. And to top it all off, it's not even that good! Go to iHop and you can get the same pancakes but smaller and you get sides with it! Order the nutella french toast and it's like eating out of the nutella jar. Imagine if someone gave you half a chocolate cake and said "here is your breakfast." That's what this is like. Then if you try to order something besides their huge french toast or pancakes, you get crappy food. I've tried their chili and I have to say it was quite possibly the worst chili I've had. Even canned chili is better! I also tried their omelets hoping to find something decent and not as gluttonous as their pancake offerings. It's terrible. Eggs are served so dry here. It's like they've gotten used to the pancakes being on the burner the whole time they're open, that they forget how to make eggs and get confused. I've also had their cornbread. It was the size of a brick and I guess they thought "hey why not make it as hard as one." The expectation of fluffy buttery cornbread I had imagined was not met. This is obviously a very trendy place. It's really noisy and there is probably a requirement for the staff to be all young, good looking and able to dress themselves as if they work at American Eagle. Sharing food is definitely an option you might want to consider. Even then, I get really tired of only eating whatever it is; pancakes with blueberry yogurt, french toast, banana walnut pancakes, whatever. The best thing here is the coffee. The waiting and the lines for this place I feel is very undeserved.

You just have to check out their menu to believe the reviews! They have some outrageous combinations, but I've yet to taste something unpleasant. I'm a huge breakfast fan, so I haven't tried their lunch/dinner menu. Yes, their food is sweet, but I don't really think that their food is "a diabetic coma waiting to happen," unless you drown the food in syrup. I think their food taste way better without any added syrup. The original French toast has a vanilla kick to it that if you add syrup, it overpowers the vanilla sensation. I love their "teacher's pet" pancakes! Coffee comes in three levels, mild, medium or dark. I think the only downfall to this place is the parking and its size. Parking can be a pain, considering that they have like 6 metered parking spaces out front on the street. Other than that, you have the local neighborhood and Rite Aid. Rite Aid use to be a nice place to park, but I think they are monitoring their parking now. The size of the tables are a bit too small for two ppl. With condiments already on the table, good luck ordering three dishes! You may want to order two things at a time if you get a table. If you get a booth, you'll be fine for up to 4 persons. They do have 3 bigger booths for larger groups. They have two additional rooms in the back that I've never sat at, so I'm not sure how those are. Overall, I would and have recommended this place to friends. Their breakfast is mouthwatering!

I come here all the time, and normally I wouldn't write a review for one that already has literally a thousand, but the last time I came was for my graduation party. I was really nervous because I always wait like an hour to get in here, but they DID take a reservation for 10 people for Sunday brunch, and they put us in this awesome private room in the back. It was perfect! I couldn't believe how accommodating they were even when it was so busy. You would never know it from their website, but they DO take reservations if you ask! :) Just be on time.

Reminds me of the old Peach Pit on 90210. Big portions. Good french toast. Awesome cobb and pomodoro omelettes. Micro roasted coffee served in an individual french press that will have you buzzing all day. The Wine & cheese on sunset salad with shrimp is also tasty. HUGE pancakes, but the batter mix used to make them is NOT particularly tasty. After years of going here I pass on them and the cooked bananas.

This is one of the places I checked out as a NYer (before I moved to this fine, fine city. And by "fine" i mean, it's no New York...but I'll take it.) PANCAKES. Big ass pancakes. HUGE. It's as if Ben and Jerry are running the kitchen. These pancakes are filled with cookies, candy, cream cheese, caramel, granola, fruit, cereal, sprinkles-- you name it. A stack of 3 could feed a family of four! The cons-- you always wait for a seat with your tragically hip brethren, the tables are pretty tightly packed together, and...it is always, always pricier than you'd expect by the time you get the bill. That said-- this is a GREAT naughty brunch place, hangover cure if you're "overserved" the night before at some bar, wonderful for a birthday, great for out of town guests, and the food is just yummy (and oversized). They don't push it-- but it is totally possible to order 1 pancake (because if you order a stack you'll never finish it) and they also reheat pretty well so you can have it for brunch on Sunday and be eating those things all week long at your hizzouse. Sweet.

Went to Griddle on a Saturday morning around noon. Upon seeing the line, my friend hopped out of my car to give them our name while I drove to the parking lot in the back (very convenient!) to get parking. ÊI was lucky enough to find parking pretty quickly so I went back up front and my friend said the wait was about 20 minutes. We probably waited a little longer than 20 minutes, maybe 30-40, but it went by pretty fast. The wait staff was funny and kept making jokes when they came out and WeHo is a nice area in general. Once our names were called we went into the very loud and noisy restaurant. Definitely difficult to have a conversation inside but it's a pretty cool atmosphere. My friend ordered "Black Magic" which is a pancake filled with Oreo pieces and topped with whipped cream and oreo pieces. You get 4 HUGE pancakes stacked on top of each other so it is pretty impossible for 1 person to finish. I got the "Caballero" and requested potatoes instead of the chips which the waiter said was totally fine. It is basically a breakfast Êburrito filled with chicken chorizo, cheese, potatoes, green chillies, and has sour cream, avocado slices, and pico de gallo on the top. The pancakes were good but it is hard to eat a lot of the dish because they are pretty heavy. But they were absolutely delicious and totally hit the spot. The Caballero was excellent as well and I too had plenty of leftovers to take home. The potatoes on the side were nice too. The spiciness from the chicken chorizo and green chilies (which really weren't too spicy and I eat very mild) were nicely complemented by the tortilla, cheese and potatoes. Overall, an excellent meal with plenty to take home. The pancakes are a bit too much for one person though. My suggestion is to go with 2-3 people and just order one pancake as well as something savory (side of bacon and eggs or an omelet or the Caballero) and just share it all. I would definitely go back and do this next time. The service is also excellent with constant water refills, a friendly staff, and pretty quick service despite the business so that definitely added to the 5-star review. Basically, if you want a great breakfast in the LA area, Griddle Cafe is your place. You may have to wait a bit but it's defintiely worth it and a lot better than over priced, over hyped places in Santa Monica and other areas.

Êand even though i love food and it's usually like a treat to bring some take out or leftovers home, pancakes are not the kind of food that taste good a few hours later. Êso again all i can think of, cause i usually order pancakes is, who the hell can eat that many pancakes?!! i've definitely sampled my friends omlettes and what not as well. Êwell, not HER omlettes, but her omlettes. Êand yes, everything's tasty. Êi mean, not HER omelttes, her her omlettes. Êbut in terms of the baked and pancake stuff, something about the gorge and sugar overload factor here gives me a sense of indigestion! Êi wonder if they have kids portions. Êi'll have to try that next time.

ginormous unique and traditional pancakes. I could barely eat a single cake and most of them come in a stack of three. red velvet is a must try, red velvet cake mix with a thick swirl of sweet cream cheese also seems to be a sprinkle of cake mix . if you like pumpkin try the "time to love". pumpkin pancake with pecans oats drizzled with caramel sauce, huge spoonful of thick whipped cream and extra pumpkin pie mix on top of that. my extra side of two scrambled eggs looked like 3-4 actually. my friends Mexican scramble was huge. the coffee is in a French press and ready for you to press when you get it dark enough. personally I like the fine grounds that are at the bottom of a cup. Êwe came early mid week so easy seating. it sounds like the weekends are crazy though. I heard a rumor that they send tweets out with 50% specials at times.

Griddle Cafe is a once-a-year special treat for me:) It is that special and I can wait in line for an hour to get seated on that day. ÊGotta be in the mood for my fave banana oatmeal pancakes:) The portions are so HUGE, I don't know how one person can eat the whole order, so beware. ÊYou can share the plate with your partner or friend as long as you agree what to order. Delicious pancakes and great french press coffee!

I came here on Sunday, 8/26/10 at around 9:30 am right after I finished hiking at Runyon Canyon. ÊThe temperature was almost 100 degrees fahrenheit, on a particularly hot day. ÊI was super tired and hungry. ÊWe got to the restaurant and wait was approximately 30 minutes, with many groups of anxious patrons standing outside waiting their turns. ÊWhen our table was ready, I hurriedly ran back into the restaurant because I was so excited to eat. Ê I ordered the peanut butter french toast and my boyfriend ordered the Omelette My Soul. ÊThe food arrived fairly quickly. ÊThe omelette dish came with salsa, avocado, and potatoes. ÊPotatoes were good and so was the omelette, but was nothing extraordinary. ÊNow onto the good stuff.... When my french toast arrived.... I couldn't wait to eat it. ÊI took my knife and fork and cut a piece.. I took a bite and it was everything I hoped it would be. It was a good way to reacquire some of the calories lost during the hike, and then some!

This place seemed more about the location rather than the food for me. ÊThe place was packed of course for a Saturday Morning, but we only had to wait for about 15 minutes before we had our spot at the bar for 2 ready. I guess its completely my fault, but the place was a disappointment for me. ÊThe overly large plate of pancakes could feed at least five of my friends, and i was getting full, and bored by the time i hit the center of the pancakes. ÊLooking around i wasn't the only one not finishing, and there's just a lot of food going to waste in my opinion. At $10.00 for just a plate of pancakes is a bit much for myself. The coffee was really good at least, but i would personally save your money for somewhere a little more quiet, and more reasonable portions..

No one can call me a size queen because the size of those things was offensive: oatmeal pancakes larger than a dinner plate, stacked 3 high. Enough for 3 or 4 meals. Super sized x 3. While I can eat an entire box of chocolates the thought of pancakes stuffed with butterscotch chips, caramel and what not made me think you need to premedicate to want something so huge and sweet. Great scramble and love the selection of sauces and real maple syrup there as well as the bar seating. Prices are kind of high. Would much prefer smaller portions for a buck or two less. The place is a little shabby. Not like retro shabby, just shabby dive like. We ended up there as Doughboys was closed (due to a Monday?) but definitely will be back to D. for their flax pancakes rather than these Carb American Styles. If you are dying for a super decadent-damn-the-calories breakfast, Griddle is your place!

Yes the wait is terrible. I went once at 10am and waited a hour and then at 2:30pm and waited 45 minutes (both on Saturday). After 3 though, it seems like you can just walk in and get a table. The portions are gigantic! The waiters are really nice, but slow since there are a million people there. It's crowded and loud. I've had their scrambles and pancakes and the strawberry waffles and they've all been delicious! Parking is impossible, your best bet is the Rite-Aid parking lot.

Huuuge portions and tasty vittles. I'm definitely a fan. It was super crowded on a random Wednesday morning, so I'm guessing it's best to go elsewhere on weekends. The waitress was kind of dingy (she forgot to bring us the straws we asked for twice) but she was friendly. My breakfast tacos were YUM.

Sugar rush! ÊCame here with a friend to try the world famous griddle cafe and both of us left feeling sick and a bit disappointed. ÊAfter waiting about 45 min for a table (we were told about 20-25), we finally walked in and were seated at the counter. ÊThe counter has way too many seats and removing a few would probably reduce the amount of times I bumped into the guy next to me. Anyway, on to the good stuff, the FOOD: Eggs Benedict - This was one of the better things we ordered. ÊNice, large portion, hollandaise sauce was good, and as their twist, was served over some deep fried potato skins. ÊVery tasty and a good deal on their menu. Nutella French Toast - this item is meant to be shared by 2-3 people, just like most of their carb heavy dishes (aka pancakes)...the 2 of us managed to eat most of this, but not without feeling sick from the intense sweetness of this dish. ÊNutella + whip cream + whatever other sugar concoction they threw on top was a little overboard for anyone that doesnt have the sweet tooth of someone in grade school Oatmeal/Cinnamon/Honey Pancakes and Chocolate Espresso Pancakes - I combined these 2 because their pancakes there generally use the same batter and the flavors are made by throwing the "flavors" into the batter as it is cooking. ÊTheir buttermilk pancake batter is not that good in my opinion. ÊIt is very dense, and just not that good. ÊThe 2 varieties we ordered were pretty tasty, but after eating a few bites of each order, you just get "tired" of the food and there is not much desire to continue. While we over ordered by a lot, and only finished about 2/3s of all of that, we did not leave fully satisfied. ÊWe simply just got tired of the food. ÊNothing too amazing. 1 star for nutella french toast 1 star for eggs benedict 2 stars for excellent service (waiter was quick and extremely friendly) -1 star for bland pancake batter at a place that suppsedly specializes in pancakes I'm not sure I'd ever go back based on the waiting time alone, but if there was no line, I would go and try a few of their other items, since their menu is about 5-6 pages long.

Am I missing something? I was expecting some over-the-top ridiculous AWESOME kind of breakfast. I mean this place is in HOLLYWOOD, right? LA has awesome food, right? this place has over 600 reviews, right? and 4 stars? i was completely underwhelmed. i've learned to not set my expectations too high but.... uh, this was not even on the radar. yes, our waiter was pretty hot, but i'm pretty sure he was younger than me and he called me "hon"... ANNND the service was super slow. and the food..... the "noisella"/nutella french toast was good, but sweetly overwhelming. i wanted vanilla ice cream to go with it; it would be a good dessert. my sister and cousin were with me and we split the noisella, the gone shrimping omelette, and the muscle omelette. they were just... ok. i mean, yeah, they were generous with the portions, and the toppings, but again. totally lacking flavor. i had to use a lot of ketchup (yeah, the gone shrimping has shrimp, pesto and capers... wouldn't expect needing more flavor, right? wrong.) not only that, but the gone shrimping was SWIMMING in a pool of egg or shrimp juice. i dunno, but i do not want a soggy, wet omelette! we had the turkey maple sausage with the muscle omelette, and it looked like (and had the consistency of) a hot dog. not even costco kosher quality hot dogs, but the super cheap kind. sorry. i really wanted to like this place - i really did! but it was just sub-par for me.

The golden graham french toast was good. The blueberry and the sugary butterscotch pancakes were good. My favorite was the pumpkin pancakes "Tis the Season". YUM. It was like pumpkin pie in pancake form. So good. I also had the breakfast tacos. Small portions (expensive in my opinion) but delicious. The muscle bound scramble was bland but big. All in all. It was fun. But the long wait and the crowded atmosphere were not great. The food was decent, but I'd rather go to a nice little restaurant with normal portions and normal prices. The pancakes were worth it (because they were MASSIVE... feeds about 4-5 people with human-sized appetites), but that's about it.

I thought it was great, i've heard horror stories about the wait but i guess i just lucked out i only had to wait about 10 minutes for a party of two which is nothing after living in ny. the service was great, our waiter got us a free round of bloody marys. this may be something they do for everyone, but i felt special. the food was out of this world, i got some kahlua and baileys pancakes that could have fed 3 people, but instead lasted me 3 meals. and my girlfriend got some spicy egg/cheese/and chicken sausage concoction. it's hard to say which was better so i'd suggest you get one egg dish and one cake dish and share, and if you bring a third i hear the french toast is to die for!

Had the ham and cheese frittata to start with griddle potatoes to start. Delicious. Had to start scarfing it down however because the Oreo pancakes arrived. I asked for them to come out a little bit after the egg dish. We learned a valuable lesson on this outing. When not in a rush to be anywhere and you don't want some thing until you are finished with some thing else, wait until then to order it. It makes sense when ordering desserts and that is exactly what this pancakes were going to be for us. Quick mention the 7 grain toast was heaven to Jacki and the raspberry jam was excellent even though she said she would bring strawberry. They were the largest pancakes I had ever seen and I was completely prepared to eat them and only them while eating here, but an egg dish off this menu just was too appetizing to say no to. However they came out piping hot with a mound of whipped cream on top that was melting every second, but gotten to just in time. Only the first and a couple bites of #2 were eaten in restaurant. The rest were eaten first while waiting for bus to Venice and then while sitting by Starbucks down town because thats where we ended up. Here it was dipped in hot chocolate, which was ordering mistake #2 of the day. Should have waited til the dipping was going to begin. Debating whether or not I would come back. My time is limited here so unless someone really wants to go, there are just too many spots to try out

There's so many reviews for this place that whatever I write, I'll probably repeating what hundreds of others have already said. With that in mind, I shall summarize my experience here. Been wanting to try this place out for awhile so when the opportunity arose, a few friends of mine and I went for breakfast. We all tried different things. I got the Omelette with the italian sausage and mozzarella inside. It was pretty delicious. A little bland, but nothing a little ketchup wouldn't fix. When we first saw that griddle potatoes that came with it, we were kind of like "what is that?" until we relized it was potatoes. That this is HUGE. But NOTHING shocked us more than the pancakes that my friend ordered. We heard about big potions, but this was just RIDICULOUS. It was GINORMOUS. It was bigger than the huge plate that it was served on. AND THERE WERE 3 OF THEM. But they were delicious as well. They were filled ith huge blueberries and this yummy sour cream sauce. It was pretty out of this world We mostly just got omelettes except for the friend who had the pancakes, and my other friend that ordered the waffles (which were also GREAT). I ordered a latte which was strong (just the way I like it), and 3 of my friends ordered the frech pressed coffee which was very aromatic, but kind of pricey. Speaking of price, this place is not the cheapest of breakfast places, but the portions sort of make up for it. We all had to pay $17~18, inc. tip and tax. I suggest people try this place out. It's good food, friendly service, clean setting. My biggest problem was that the waiters were kind of trying to clear us from our table for the people waiting in line, which is understandable, but still a little annoying.

I absolutely love this old Hollywood breakfast house. It is hyped, and you will have to wait to get seated - but I think you'll find it's worth it. The pancakes are enormous and come in every variety you can imagine. We had a contest to see who could finish them because they are just packed with fruit and nuts and carbolicious goodness. The scrambles are also amazing - especially with plenty of hot sauce. The french press coffee just adds to the fun charm of this greasy little diner. The interior is loud and exciting and everyone seems to be celebrating the joys of a wondrous late morning breakfast. Good people-watching while you're waiting on the sidewalk too. Scrumptious, charming, Hollywood legend.

"GRIDDLE!" is the way they answer their phones at this place. It isn't the most polite way but it did give me a chuckle while getting lost in LA. This was my 1st stop in my glutenous filled day of yelply famous LA food joints. THIS PLACE GETS P-A-C-K-E-D so come prepared with your harry potter and twilight novels because you can probably finish one or two waiting for a table here. The pancakes are the size of a small pizza and the french toast is the best! Parking is an extra rowdy bi-atch here and the joint is way overcrowded. On the other hand the food speaks for itself and that's why it gets so crazy!

Next to "Hash House A Go Go" in San Diego, this has to be the next best breakfast place in all of Southern California. Griddle Cafe is a grimy medium sized joint located on the west side and it attracts all sorts of people: Diva Blacks, Pudgy Whites, Skinny Asians, Fat Asians (me - LOL), punk, grunge, James Dean looking folks and et cetera. So, we parked in the Rite Aid and walked over and signed in (30 min wait) and then was seated near front and was waited on by this skinny, long side burn dood who reminded me of Luke Perry from 90210. I ordered the Momma's French Toast and my friend ordered the Peanut Butter Momma's French Toast and then an order of cottage cheese, turkey sausage and the oversized ham and OH MY GAWD - it was da bomb and I do mean nuclear. Momma's FT is a MUST and u drizzle the maple syrup over it and it's divine. Skip the sausage links (waste of money it's small) but go rt 2 the oversize ham, that's a mean in itself! Anyway, in conclusion - this place is a MUST visit atleast once... the ONLY bad things are the wait AND tho the server was cool was us, he was a jerk to some mexican busboy, calling him a "dumbass" and that he needed to get him some menus and what not - I'm not down with the name calling and being prick, ya know? So for that I deduct a star. Ok - payce out.

I love and hate The Griddle. ÊI love the food but I hate the long wait. ÊIf you try to come here on the weekend you will be waiting for about an hour. ÊI once came here in the middle of the day on a weekday and it was the only time I've seen this place empty. ÊIt's a small place and the food is amazing, which is why it gets so crowded. ÊThe staff does a good job of trying to keep things moving smoothly which helps. The portions here are insane! ÊOne serving can last you for days. ÊThe pancakes are literally bigger than my fiance's head. ÊSo unless you want lots of leftovers it's probably wise to share food. ÊI've only ever had the breakfast food here so I don't know how good their chili is. ÊI've had "The Golden Ticket," "Saturday Morning Fever," and "Peanut Bubba."

Read about this here on my most recent trip to LA, and being the breakfast fan I am, decided I needed to go. First thing you should know is there will be a line, from opening on til past noon. 20 minute wait almost, but it's worth it. Big portions, nice friendly staff, a crowd you feel comfortable with in close quarters (because the inside of the diner is pretty small, and there is little outside seating). My only dislike is that a lot of the pancakes are jam-packed with sugar. My apple fench toast was coated with cinnamon toast crunch cereal. Add a bit of syrup, the sweet bread itself, and the gooey baked apples and you're about to fall into a sugar coma. Wish there were more fruity, light pancake offerings. Aside from that though, plain old good food at reasonable prices. Check it out.

I lived in LA for 5 years and never made it to Griddle...until today! The 20 min. wait was really only 5 min - and we got a table outside! It was so great. The guy who makes up rhymes with your name was outside dropping mad lyrics so that was an added bonus! So I looked at the menu and couldn't decide what I wanted until I saw Creme de la Creme - French toast with Graehme cracker crust and cream cheese frosting - holy moly was it tasty! It was a hard decision to choose something cuz the menu is absolutely mouth watering. We also got the Manhattan Frittata which was pale in comparison to the French toast - but was still very tasty. If you're in LA and have the time to wait I totally suggest hitting this spot up.

The only negatives about this place are the wait and parking. Both of which are good signs that you should probably check this place out. The first time I went there was when some friends of mine & I were just driving by looking for breakfast and decided to check it out. All of us ordered different omlettes and all of us liked everything we tried. The second time I went there I ordered some kind of french toast with a cheesecake topping and some graham cracker crumbles on top. It was amazing. It was a kind of like a deconstruction of a cheesecake on top of some good french toast. I've been back plenty of times since and I never regret going there, even if I have to wait a while to get a table. Its a good way to start a day off.

My parents took us here the other day for breakfast before our flight that morning. Upon looking at the pictures posted here, I was very excited about this breakfast. After the meal though, I was little disappointed. We got there around 8 on the 4th. There was 1 other couple there before us. We got seated immediately and also got our coffee and OJ just as fast. But after that we sat around waiting for our waiter to come and take our order. He helped at least 3 other groups before coming back to us when we were obviously there before them. I ordered the Strawberries and Cream Waffle which came with strawberries and a brown sugar sour cream sauce on top. I was excited about this sour cream sauce since my grandma does a sour cream sauce for cakes, but this not like hers at all. It was barely sweet, mainly sour. I think I would have enjoyed my waffle more if it didn't have this sauce on it. My husband had Kicking and Screaming Breakfast tacos. I was scolding him for getting something so ordinary that we often make on our own, but these were better than the ones we make. It has a chipotle cream sauce on it that is very pleasing to the tongue. He proved to me that sometimes the easy, simple dishes are often the best. My dad got the Poached y Papas Benedict. Now I am a big fan of eggs benedict so I thought how can you go wrong with substituting potato in for the muffin? Well the potato part was good, but everything else was less than par. The hollandaise sauce tasted mainly of mayonnaise which was quite sickening to me. The ham was very salty. I ended up just having some egg on top of the potato and scraping off the sauce and ham. My mom got the Banana Nana. These glorious banana pancakes made up for every other miss in the meal. The pancakes are definitely the way to go when eating here. The pancakes were huge! Their recipe for pancakes is better than any other I have had. The banana chunks were just icing on the already tasty cake. After eating, our waiter still had problems getting back to us. We ended up giving our bill to another waiter and asking him for boxes since our waiter never brought them to us. If you don't want to read all of my rant read this: Pancakes are great! Be reluctant to order anything else, unless it is simple. At least one waiter there is not good. The End.

ÊPlus, you have to eat some so that it will fit in the to-go box! ÊSeriously. Now...onto the pancakes: -Banana nana: (3 stacks) brown sugar baked bananas with buttermilk pancakes. ÊI didn't try this so I don't know how it tasted. -Golden ticket: Ê(3 stacks) basically banana nana, with caramel, walnuts, and struesel, topped with whip cream and caramel. ÊYummy!! ÊTasted sweet from the caramel but had a good crunch with the walnuts. -Bluesberry: Êblueberry pancakes (2 stacks) with blueberry sour cream and powdered sugar.

Brunch at The Griddle Cafe on a Saturday sounded like a great idea. Despite the huge line that wrapped around the corner of the building, we still managed to get our name on the waiting list. Twenty minute wait was actually faster than we had anticipated. When we walked in, we were seated at the back corner of the breakfast bar. All the servers looked delicious and the food smelled great. Our server Kevin, was a mix between Ashton Kutcher and boy next door. Yummy, Back to the food... we came here for the RED VELVET PANCAKES, but when we tried to order it, Kevin said that its only a special that is announced through Facebook or Twitter. REALLY? Is everything reliant on social media? Geez. Luckily we looked at other people's order of pancakes, and it just did not look appetizing. The presentation was horrible. Pancakes were so thick and stacked, it looked like it was overflowing off the plate. So no pancakes for either of us. I had the Tequila Sunrise, which was their version of huevos rancheros. It had a smother of red enchilada sauce with two sunny side eggs hidden under the sauce, with refried beans, and a tortilla on the very bottom. I also had the optional half avocado and sour cream on the side. ÊIt was good, but I kind of wish I tried the Hazelnut French Toast. Oh well, maybe next time? Service was great. Even for as busy as it was, we still managed to get our food fairly quickly.

I had the pleasure of eating here on my last work trip down in LA. ÊIn fact, I specifically went looking for an awesome, bomb breakfast place in between my hotel and work and after perusing many options, this place won me over. ÊInside was PACKED for a Friday morning then again, it was Friday....but a table was open outside so I opted to sit outside and people watch during my meal. I love a place that offers tons of selection for french toast and pancakes and knew I was going to have a difficult decision ordering as I really wanted like 5 different types of pancakes but in the end I settled on the Mom's French Toast and added a side order of egg whites. ÊWait was a little longer than I would have liked but it was packed...when the food came I was happy, it was a generous portion with lots and lots of butter and powdered sugar. ÊI practically inhaled it and spent the remainder of my morning in a food coma but it was totally worth it. Ê Thanks Los Angeles Yelpers for your great reviews of Griddle Cafe.

I came here for brunch with a gf, and we couldn't decide whether to get Êthe pancakes or the tacos. Decisions, decisions....we decided to get both! Cuz I mean....tacos and pancakes just go together dontcha think? Streussel pancakes bigger than our faces! Three of them! Delicious! The crumbles on top were the best part. Tacos w/ homemade tortilla chips? Delicious as well! The service is great and our server even gave us an inside tip on how to eat pancakes more efficiently- start from the middle! Once you eat enough, pour syrup in the vacant center, and ta-dah! We left with about 80% of our pancake dish as leftovers, but we didn't put it to waste- it was polished off later that night! :)

If you are looking for a quick and plentiful breakfast or lunch. THIS IS THE SPOT. I normally don't like places that are a bit touristy in the sense that EVERYONE (well, a lot of people) gets told to check this places out, but I will not deny a place with good food. The service is quick. The portions are HUGE & so is the menu. The first time I checked this place out I had Oreo pancakes which were awesome! We split the pancakes between three people...THAT'S how big they are. This time around, I had the breakfast tacos. If you are into spicy for breakfast, then you got to try it. They were awesome! I would have preferred a hard taco, but the soft taco was still good. We also ordered Banana Pancakes which were yummy. Someone ordered the Muscle Bound with Turkey Breast which was a bit bland, but if you are on a diet or can't really eat flavorful food, then this is a good choice.

i do not and will not ever understand why people RAVE about this place. I've been here a couple of times and drive by it all the time, and the line is always long. I hear sometimes people wait for 2 hours to get a table. It is NOT WORTH IT. Yes, the portions are humongous and the place has an old diner feel to it, but that's about it. I've had better pancakes at Hugo, Square One, and many others. Their french toast is slightly better than their pancakes, but still it doesn't make it up for the long wait.

How could any one give the Griddle Cafe anything less than 5 stars?!! ÊThe food is AMAZING and the portions are gargantuan. ÊI have been here a few times, and I've tried different things on the menu, but I always come back for the Poached y Papas (eges benedict). ÊOne of the best things to get there, its poached eggs with a slice of ham on potato skins topped with a generous helping of hollandaise sauce. Ê Trust me you can't go wrong with that. ÊThe pancakes are also just as yummy. Yes there is usually a wait and yes parking is not always the easiest to find, but this place is worth it! ÊEvery time I came with a bigger group (5+) the wait Êusually isn't that long, probably 15 minutes or less. Ê But the one time I came with just my boyfriend and I we probably waited 30 minutes. ÊI would say try going with a bigger group to get seated faster instead of going as a party of two. Ê One more thing, it closes by 4PM so if you're in the mood for a late lunch get there earlier before it closes!

Pancakes, glorious pancakes, probably my favorite breakfast entree. Now a pancake is really a pancake, batter, griddle, bam. However, at the Griddle Cafe it's not just batter and a griddle, it's a masterpiece. If you're planning to go there for a Sunday brunch expect a wait, however it's totally worth it. The orange juice is perfect, along with each of their dishes that could each feed 4 people generously. However, if you need your morning fix of an iced coffee you will be disappointed, they only serve hot coffee beverages.

Heard of the saying: eyes are larger than the stomach? It's what always ends up characterizing my visit -- without fail. [=THE 411=] This place is only open for brunch, but everyday. ÊIf you have a free morning on a weekday or want to get a work brunch, choose Griddle. Otherwise -- come earlier than you plan to eat on weekends. ÊYou'll end up waiting a while -- no matter how many people you're seating. ÊYou can expect at least a 10-20 minute wait for a smaller group; up to an hour for a larger group. They'll probably seat you outside or in the main dining area for the smaller group, which opens up pretty quickly... Êbut! There are only two rooms that remind me of a private room you might see in strip clubs on TV or something. ÊThere's even a one-way mirror and these metal bead curtain-doorway things. ÊThe lighting is also rather dim... Êso I wasn't sure if I was getting food or... Êwell, you get my drift. [=THE FOOD: PANCAKES=] Why is this place so good? ÊIt's unique and quality is always consistent. ÊAny of their pancakes are good -- whatever flavors you feel like: sweet, savory, or not. ÊI've tried most of them and I haven't NOT liked any of them. But a warning: -Order one order of pancakes between 3 people if you plan on finishing. ÊMaybe 2 for 4 people if you don't mind bringing stuff home. ÊAny more and you'll probably regret it! The first time I came was with three other people; we ordered one type of pancake each... Êomgosh such a bad idea. [=THE FOOD: FRENCH TOAST=] I've only tried their French Toast from friends. ÊDefinitely good, too. ÊBut I wouldn't suggest getting pancakes AND Toast! ÊSame goes for the eggs benedict, though it's not as much of Êa must-try. [=THE FOOD: FRENCH PRESS COFFEE=] But their coffee is some of the best I've tried. ÊFrench Press, if you didn't know, is the best style to brew coffee -- coffee connoisseurs prefer this style to get the most flavor. Ê=] ÊI would agree. ÊIt's quite strong though! [=TIP: PARKING=] As everyone says: parking at Rite Aid down the street.

there's a parking lot behind the rite aid, street parking can be ridiculous. i had the red velvet pancakes & the chicago charlies scramble. red velvet pancakes were amazing. tasted just like a cupcake, moist, delicious, mouth watering. cream cheese frosting wasn't too sweet, it was the perfect compliment to the pancake. i recommend this to everyone! chicago charlie is HUGE. it's a massive portion, enough for 2-3 people to share. i felt like i was eating a plate that was replenishing itself. it was full of italian sausages, bacon, potatoes, cheese, garlicly, onion goodness! my suggestion?? bring a good friend and share this awesome food!

a bunch of us girls were staying in LA for the weekend and wanted a good place to get brunch. obviously being the yelp fanatic that i am i suggested this place. i was able to call in and make a reservation for 7 and was seated promptly when we arrived. this place is LOUD, packed. and you leave with that strong odor on your clothes, purse, hair, etc. yes, they have crazy items on the menu. just from looking around the restaurant you can see that their pancakes are super popular and could probably be shared between 5 girls (1 order) i ordered the eggs Benedict. people say its one of the best items on the menu but i beg to differ. god they sure so love to pour that hollandaise sauce on the entire plate. it was so thick and i felt like i was gonna puke trying to swallow it. i scooped it all to the side so i could see what was underneath. BUT service was amazing. they were super quick and remembered everything. the guys were really cute too ;) dont think ill be back.

Don't know how I missed this place so long. ÊLoud music, very "hip" atmosphere And HUGE plates of good food. ÊThe tables and chairs must have been bought used, they have an old weathered look that adds character, slightly upscale in mood. ÊThe wait staff is also quick, attentive and attractive, both male & female. I was looking for eggs Benedict at 3PM and ended up here. ÊIt wasn't quite traditional, instead of an english muffin it was served on 4 crispy potato skins. ÊIt had a really, really big slab of ham, the eggs were poached nicely and it was loaded with Hollandaise, ÊWe ordered 2 coffees and they brought a small "french press" Êto the table and it was hot strong and fresh. I can eat a TON and could barely finish and wished I hadn't, my wife made it about 1/3 of the way through hers. ÊI liked it a lot, the only downside was 2 orders of eggs benedict and a french press of coffee was $34 + tip so end up spending over $40 on breakfast for 2. Ê It's not Norms but it's also NOT Norms. ÊTreat yourself, all the breakfast items looked great, just go HUNGRY.

I like the atmospere here...perfect for a weekend brunch and reading the paper. However, E likes the star sightings. I was craving a burger so a chili burger is what I got. The meat was tasteless and chewy. Only thing going for it was that it was huge. So based on what I ordered I'd give it a 2 stars, but my friends really enjoyed the food and I'd give the place a do-over, so 4 stars.

I am a breakfast freak!!! ÊI love breakfast and am always looking for places like this...THIS PLACE IS BY FAR THE BEST IN THE WEST! ÊI understand why the long ass line that circles the building...it's soooo worth it. ÊI do recommend either getting their early or if you get there during rush hour which I imagine is all the time, don't go in parties larger than 2. ÊAnything more than this, expect 1-2hours of waiting outside smelling the delicious aroma of what's to come and seeing the food come out to the few tables they have outside is tortureous. ÊThe place inside is pretty cool, crowded though as in, almost no space for walking. ÊThe host was funny, but don't f*ck with him...just a word of advise. ÊBlues music was playing in the background which brought a smile to my face and the ambience was great because everyone was so happy with the food. ÊThe waiters were pretty nice and the food came out in a timely fashion even with the tons of food that we ordered. **Either get there early or don't go with just one other person, groups of 3 and larger will wait a very long time. ÊWe waited for over an hour. Now let's get down to the Nitty Gritty...The FOOD! The menu is ridiculous, it's pages and pages of yummy goodness. ÊYou may wanna get a menu while you wait outside because it might take you 20 minutes just to decide on what you will order. ÊI changed my mind atleast 3 times. ÊWe ordered enough food to easily feed a minimum of 20 people...no joke! ÊWe odered the Red Velvet panCake which was wow...so yum but I could not eat more than like 10 bites...maybe after 4 sittings I could finish one not just because of the size but because It's pretty rich. ÊThe next pancake was the Banana Nana with Brown Sugar Baked Bananas inside...WINNER WINNER...you know the rest! ÊSo tasty, it was an explosion in my mouth. ÊWe ordered a few scrambles but the one that we all drooled over was the Chicago Charlie Scramble...this was the OMG scramble. It contains Italian Sausage, potatoes, bell peppers, mozarella cheese, bacon, garlic, basil and lots of onions. Ê All you can drink French Press Coffee...Delish! We walked out of there wanting to roll out...we were overly stuffed but when the food is that amazing...it's a tad bit difficult to stop yourself. Will definitely be back to try their other items.

i've been here twice now both during work trips and this is my favourite pancake/breakfast place. the pancakes here are to die for!!! and be ready to bring an appetite. because the servings here are ginormous and if pancakes could cover my ass, these ones could. (ask for a short stack or share if you can't consume copious amounts of carbs) i love the french toasts and the pancakes and i love their french press coffee. this is a must-go breakfast place in LA. which explains why they are top 10 pancake places in the US!

Overrated? ÊPa Sha! ÊThey're Super Stupid Sized Pancakes. ÊUnless you are entering into a bet or some kind of contest, why would anyone order something so enormous and more importantly, why would anyone sell them. The pancakes are not light and thus not fluffy. ÊThey are thick and dense and oversized. ÊIs bigger really better? ÊIt doesn't even make sense to me and if I wanted to eat pancakes, which I rarely do, I would go to a place that offers me a more manageable and reasonable portion. It really does seem ridiculous and excessive and kind of "country" like, not that that's bad, it's just kind of, well, stupid. Ê Ê The coffee on the other hand is really, really good. ÊAnd the other dishes look really good and they have nice breakfast cocktails for your early morning fix. ÊI don't rule out the place as it does have a certain charm even with so many posers, but I wouldn't go back for pancakes

So, I made it to LA for the very first time last week, and the first stop on my itinerary was the Griddle Cafe. ÊI had literally studied the menu for a week beforehand, but I couldn't decide which pancakes I wanted. ÊHowever, once I got to the restaurant and actually saw these monsters in person, I decided to get something a little less ridiculous. Ê I got the "Kicking and Screaming" breakfast tacos. ÊThe first taco was delish, but the 2nd one had way too much chipotle cream sauce. ÊMy friend got the plain french toast and they were ASBOLUTELY DELICIOUS (and i know this because i ate half of her plate)... Those back rooms really did look kinda shady (and boring)...

W.O.W! I can't imagine how someone can finish 3 stacks of banana pancakes...but I was surprised to see how huge the pancakes were and plus a side of ham (a side, more like a meal!, see the pic I posted). The pancakes were good but I think it is overpriced but then again, it's ok. You can take the leftovers at home if you feel like eating it again the next morning...The staff seems to be nice and friendly. When we were there, one of the girls was taking the order and her butt is right in-front of our pancakes (yes!)...I guess she has to bend over a little but I wish she could at least looked at us first before doing so...It's a good spot if you want to see celebrities, saw one ;) Oh, they do eat breakfast??!! We'll probably try out other stuff next time we go So. CAL. I'll pass on the pancakes.

Hands down to the best breakfast place ever! The wait to get a table was about an hour plus, but it sure was worth it! We had an order of the Good Ol Fashioned buttermilk pancakes and oh my, the portion was gigantic!! There were 3 pancakes stacked together that were about 12" in diameter. One stack could literally feed 4 people...so do consider sharing as I'm sure you will also be ordering some of their other breakfast items. These were some of the best tasting pancakes ever though - perfectly delicious and moist, and comes out nice and hot! yuM! We also had an order of the Griddle Waffle, Chicago Charlie's Scramble Eggs, Muscle Bound Scramble Eggs, a side of hash browns, and some Mimosas. The waffle was soft on the inside, crispy on the outside, and flavoring had a nice hint of cinnamon. Along with the butter and great tasting maple syrup, both the waffles and pancakes were awesome! The Chicago Charlie's Scramble was filled with generous amounts of Italian sausage, bacon, potatoes, cheese, garlic, basil, and tons of onions! MMmmm, these eggs along with the pancakes/waffles tasted so great, it was like breakfast in heaven! I didn't like the Muscle Bound Scramble much though, it was very plain and need Êa lot more flavor. And the hash browns were a bit of a disappointment because it was all smushed together without any crispiness to it. Other than that, I had a wonderful breakfast. Really, I hate waiting in line to eat but this place was actually worth trying. If you're any sort of a breakfast lover, definitely stop by the Griddle!

It was nice to do brunch LA style for the week away. The Griddle Cafe is right down the street from my brother and friends have been raving about this place for a long time. What was the big deal over pancakes? It was certainly a BIG deal. I went with my friend who is also visiting and we walked over at about 11AM on a Friday.The outdoor seating was already packed. Inside, every table was full and the place was hopping! Exposed brick and 50s style diner decorations were the theme. We waited for about 5 minutes and were seated at a 2-top. I have to say it was a little loud and it felt like we were sitting on the other guests, but that's the appeal I guess. I went ahead and ordered The Bluesberry pancakes. Looking around, I got a little nervous because the pancakes were the size of UFOs. HUGE! The food arrived promptly, but I could hardly make a dent in it before keeling over. For $10, the pancakes were totally worth it. Cool service, good food, and well priced. Can't complain on my end.

The Griddle servers really killer breakfast in Los Angeles. ÊThe food is good, coffee is great, but the wait can be really bad. ÊExpect to wait at least 45 minutes on a weekend for brunch.

My dad and brother came into town to visit me so I decided to take them to Griddle Cafe Êfor bfast before we hit the Kodak Theater and Walk of Fame. I had read about it online as being the #1 bfast place in Los Angeles and was dying to try it. Try and get a table outside if possible because it's stuffy in the restaurant. Be prepared to wait awhile too. I'd suggest getting someone to hop out of the car to put your name down before wandering around to find parking. I was lucky and found street parking right outside. Hear Me Roar - My brother ordered these and they were GIGANTIC. It came with 3 pancakes overflowing from the plate. The frosted flakes were a unique twist to the pancakes as well. You'll never be able to finish it though. "Poached y Papas Benedict" - The only thing worth eating from his plate was the amazing potato skins. Otherwise, don't order it. "Chicago Charlie's Scramble" - This scramble lived up to all the rave reviews on Yelp. It was packed with sausage, bell peppers and bacon - true to the description on the menu. I managed to eat about 3/4 of the plate before I went into food coma. all in all this restaurant is allright...too many tourists, and way too much food. unique menu but I wouldn't go again unless I had friends in town dying to try it before going on the Walk of Fame

Best breakfast I've had in LA so far. Excellent French Press coffee (available in mild, medium, or full-bodied roasts), fresh-squeezed OJ, and pancakes that really should be shared between at least two people. I ended up ordering a single pancake and the "Poached y Papas" Benedict, which was two eggs on a hamsteak on potato skins, all of which probably weighed a good two pounds. OMG awesome. Will definitely come back to try their other items. But be warned; the portions are MASSIVE here.

I had wanted to try Griddle Cafe for about a month now, and I finally went this past weekend for breakfast. ÊI got there around 9:15 and the place was already packed. ÊWe had to wait about 10-15 min. for a table for two, which wasn't that bad. Ê We ordered the french press coffee, which was very fresh. ÊSince we were first timers and don't live super close to LA, we didn't know when we would be coming back here so we ordered way to much food. ÊWe had the strawberries and cream waffles (which was really good because of the fresh strawberries on top of the waffles. ÊThe cream was also really fresh and not too sweet). ÊBeing a big fan of cheesecake, we ordered the "creme de la creme" which was the cheesecake french toast. ÊIt definitely tasted like cheesecake, with cheesecake cream on top. ÊThe french toast was also still fluffy, and wasn't too thick. ÊThe last thing we ordered was the "chicago charlie" which was one of their egg scrambles. ÊIt was pretty standard, but I couldn't really judge it fairly because I was already stuffed with coffee, waffles, and french toast. Ê The portions were huge and definitely meant to be shared, I could not imagine eating a whole plate of anything that we ordered. ÊOverall, the food was just okay. ÊMaybe it was too early in the morning for such rich and sweet foods, but I did not think that Griddle Cafe was as amazing as I would have hoped for. ÊHowever, we did see Janice Dickenson in and out of the restaurant because she was waiting for a table, which was kind of amusing.

M.T. and I went here on her visit to Southern California. ÊWe were talking about breakfast all weekend and finally on a Monday morning we decided we should finally fulfill our breakfast cravings. Ê For a Monday morning it wasn't too bad of a wait, but it was still pretty packed. Ê M.T. ordered the golden ticket and I got the strawberry creme waffles. ÊWhile waiting for our food we realized, perhaps we should have shared an order since it seemed like we were in a giant land of pancakes and breakfast items. ÊThe pancakes were HUGE!! I swear the size of offical sized frizebees. ÊAnd decently stacked too! (3) We obviously did not finish our meal. ÊThe pancakes definately a huge golden ticket that M.T. enjoyed, and my waffles were SO delicious! ÊThe waffels were light, and the strawberries and sauce were yum. ÊThey also had this sour creamish like topping that complimented the sweet dish overall. ÊIt was muy delisioso!! Similar to Toast, it can definately be a scene to be here. ÊI swear we saw Lo from the Hills, but M.T. begged to differ. ÊPerhaps I was so hungry, I was delusional and was seeing mirages? ÊWho knows, but I know for sure the Griddle Cafe hit my breakfast spot for that weekend!

The pancakes are larger than my head! Maybe a slight exaggeration...but the portions are HUGE! Good prices and good food to boot make it one of my favorite places for breakfast food. The waffles and the potatoes are good. The waits are insane so I prefer to get seated quickly and get my food in about 10 minutes. Which is why the best time to go is in the afternoon. Randomly, we saw Eva from ANTM.

My favorite meal of the day is BREAKFAST. After hearing so many people rave about Griddle Cafe, I'm glad that I FINALLY got to experience it for myself. Be prepared for a long wait at Griddle Cafe. On a rainy Saturday afternoon, my friends and I waited over an hour to be seated. After finally being seated, we were all overwhelmed with the extensive menu with soooo many choices. I was so overwhelmed that I ordered two breakfast entrees - the Charlie's Scramble and French Toast. They were both delicious! I also liked how their coffee is in a French press with free refills. The food was totally worth the wait! Oh, this restaurant is really loud, so you will either be shouting or won't be doing much talking. I guess with all the yummy food around, there's no reason to be doing much talking. =P

The Griddle is probably the most universally satisfying breakfast around. It speaks to that childlike urge to sit in front of an endless slab of french toast, swimming in rivers of syrup and butter. *siiiiigh* Good times. The most basic building blocks of a classic breakfast - pancakes and french toast - are made perfectly here. And massive. One layer of pancake here can probably hide an entire order from one of those healthy brunch spots across town. I just don't come that often because the location is dangerously close to the Sunset Strip, and the line is shockingly long. If you're coming with friends, save up your best long stories to kill time while you wait.

I love the 'Poached Y Papa's' Benedict, though instead of the Canadian ham I prefer a slice of turkey and avocado. ÊFavorite Benedict of all time. ÊI always share a slice of pancakes with my friend. ÊThe Golden Ticket is by far my favorite. ÊTaste like a fluffy sweet though not too sweet cake. ÊIt's always just right. Ê Though they have 30 different types of chili, i definitely don't recommend this item on the menu. ÊI've had more flavorful chili.

I went here on a Sunday at 10AM. There was a HUGE line. Luckily we waited only 10 minutes to be seated as we had only a party of 2. We got to our table, ordered, and waited OVER 30 MINUTES for our food to get there. I ordered the "Mounds of Pleasure" Êwhich sounded pretty freakin awesome... ÊChocolate + Coconut what could be better. When it FINALLY got to my table... imagine, melted Chocolate sprinkled with Coconut. That's what it tasted like... completely GROSS! It was Diabetes on a plate. There was absolutely ZERO pancake in this pancake. It was literally Coconut on top of Chocolate. Maybe for desert a bite of this would be ok. But I got a humungus pancake that wasn't even a pancake. With tea, the total came out $18 each. Which is kinda pricey for breakfast. I'd only go back if my friends were already going there and I'd order something less exciting. Otherwise I'd go somewhere else for breakfast.

The size of the pancakes here are just RIDICULOUS. This morning I pulled out my 5-pound box of leftover "Tis the Season" Pumpkin Pancakes, and realized how absurd the situation is. I have now eaten these pancakes for two separate meals, and I STILL have only eaten, oh, about 1/5th of them. I don't think anyone needs THREE of these continent-sized pancakes. Two would still be MORE THAN ENOUGH. I've brought a bunch of different people here & they always love it. The only time we had a problem was when a friend's credit card was overcharged--he used to work in the restaurant industry & would see servers running this scam so he flipped out, but the manager let us know that sometimes the initial draft is overcharged to cover possible tips or something...FYI. Anyways, I looove the french pressed coffee, the decor, the Kicking & Screaming Breakfast Tacos, and ANY of the french toasts or pancakes. Yum!!!!!!

We came here on a sunday morning... the Places was packed they told us 30 min wait... but somehow they skipped a whole buncha people... since we saw people being seated that put intheir names after us =( we were seated in about 30 mins still... that being said the Place was hot, and muggy and you are eating elbow to elbow... super loud so unless you like screaming at the person you are eating with don't waste your breathe. the food... My hubby got the French toast ... he said it was great but ithought it was just ok ... I wouldn't waste calories on that but to each their own... I got the chicago charlie scramble... it was a Giant plate of stuff.. incldung sauages, basil, potatos, bacon, onions, bell peppers and garlic... all covered in a thick layer of cheese... I was straving as only a preggo could be straving and yet i was only able to eat about 1/4 of my plate ... the fresh squeezed Oj was nice too bad it was such a small glass =( I do have to say some of the servers in there are have got to be actors w/ day jobs cause dang there are some good looking guys and gals working there. would I come back ... meh probably not... I don't think it was worth the drive or wait... was it good... yeah but really i could of made that at home or gotten it at ihop

Always a long wait but easily the most unique and awesome breakfast place I've gone too. And apparently drunk brunch is a big thing in LA, so some people here can be pretty obnoxious. Aside from that, their pancake orders are epic. I tried the french toast because I heard it's the best thing ever, definitely the best french toast I've ever had. But the pancakes are huge here and they load your plate up with them. My friends always opt for the omelettes and although I've never tried them, they look quite good too; they have some pretty neat ingredients that they put in them. Expect at least a half hour to hour wait depending on what time of the day you get there, and parking can be pretty horrendous. But it's all worth it, even if you don't consider yourself a breakfast food person.

The best breakfast place in the world, period. The pumpkin pancakes are insane. The french toast is the best in the world and the "Yellow Brick Road" would be on anyone's "last meal" list. But the creme de la creme... their selection of chili is unparalleled (they probably have 30+ different kinds). Breakfast or lunch. Unlike other places with long lines, this one actually makes you glad you waited. ;-) Their potatoes, fresh squeezed orange juice, and their french-press coffee are also all amazing! Sadly, I just found out that the guy that made the chili passed away - and they have no plans to bring chili back. I'm changing my review from 5 to 4 stars. Understandable as this guy was simply awesome - it was the best chili ever. Still... go for the pancakes. I don't even LIKE pancakes and they are awesome. And forgot to mention... HUGE portions!

WARNING: ÊIf you're watching your weight or have a general disdain for heavy food, then this place isn't for you. I had passed by The Griddle Caf for years before I actually ate there. ÊI wasn't too interested in trying this place, because I refuse to stand in ridiculously long lines (unless $100 bills are being handed out). However, a couple of friends suggested this place and we decided to go there on a weekday morning. ÊWe were seated right away. I ordered eggs and turkey sausages. My friends ordered the French toast and the pancakes (I can't remember the exact kind, but I recall apples and cinnamon). The portions are huge! The French toast and pancakes look like they're on steroids. I had a taste of both. The breakfast really lives up to the hype. Best French toast and pancakes that I've ever tasted! Also, the Irish coffee is yummy. I've been there a couple of times since my first visit. My suggestion is to go during the week, unless you don't mind waiting in line.

This place has the biggest pancakes I've ever eaten. An order comes with three, but you can just order one or two of them if you want. They'll discount it $2 for each pancake you don't want to order. I only got 2, so it was $6 instead of $8. I could've just gotten one and I would've been good. Service wasn't great, but the pancakes were really good.

I got the eggs benedict Êwhich I loved, the hollandaise sauce was incredible , I wanted more, the ham was to die for, oooo lordy!

I had to comment since I live in a walking distance from the place and have eaten there quite a few times, and it's annoying reading these reviews where lazy people can't find the giant parking lot in the back. It's very hard for me not to assault anyone right now, but seriously, people?! Please, be more informed yourself when you're trying to inform others! Now the 3 stars. The place lost the 2 extra stars for the long wait and crammed bar seating, yes, but that's only half of a star... The worst part about it is the extremely unfriendly staff! Last time we went at a time they were actually not busy and we were sitting and waiting for a server for an eternity and there was one standing in our eye sight just refilling sugar packets! Needless to say, when someone finally showed up we ordered everything right away and the next time we saw our server ( after whoever at this point brought our food) was to hand the credit card. Now with that off my chest, the food there is delicious, one of the best breakfast places in LA, in my opinion. So if you don't mind the wait and can deal with unpleasant staff, definitely check it out, you might wanna bear with it again just for their food.

So I decided to hang out in West LA for Labor Day vacation. I had researched the dining options before I got there and the Griddle Cafe looked promising. The first day I ate there, I asked for Êan order of pancakes and applewood smoked bacon. Let me just say that I was so happy that they actually sold applewood bacon because that is my favorite bacon. When the server delivers my food, I was so hungry that I was sure that I could eat it all, then I realized that it was 3 HUGE pancakes but boy were they good! Of course, lil ole me couldn't eat it all, I would have taken it back to the hotel but I had no way to heat it up. The next few days I tried their Mom's French Toast, this french toast was amazing! 2 thick pieces of french bread served with REAL maple syrup and Iove the fact that they don't skimp on the butter. I LOVE butter :-). ÊThe bacon on the side was nice and lean and meaty. The OJ was fresh and the service was great! I like the atmosphere too. They play good old fashioned authentic blues music, none of that corny pop or elevator music. There is no wait on the weekdays but on the weekends the line is insane, but it does move fairly quickly so that's not really a problem. This is my breakfast spot when hanging out in LA.

Never order a full stack, unless you have some kind of a death wish. I usually get one of their amazing omelets and then split a single stack or short stack of Yellow Brick Road with my dining mate. Everything is great, including the chili which seems to be rotated through several different varieties. It can get crowded, so get there early and be prepared to wait (and get hungrier and hungrier). Coffee is french-press brewed and very strong, as is the tea.

IF you are starving and want to choose among a million different kinds of pancakes, then go to the Griddle. After hearing people rave about this place I finally got a chance to try it for myself a few weeks ago. My friends and I stopped by on a Tuesday morning after hiking so we arrived with BIG appetites. We each ordered an omelette and a single oreo pancake to share. Our omelettes were okay, nothing too special, but that pancake was amazing! It was GIGANTIC and even with 3 people working on it, we still couldn't finish the damn thing. ÊThe service was fine; our waiter was pretty nice but the host seemed a bit spacey.

I have never been in love with a breakfast joint until now. ÊThis place is hugely popular so expect a wait. ÊBut, if you're into pancakes this is so worth it. ÊIt's pancake heaven! ÊIf that's not your thing, there's a lot of other stuff to please you. ÊIt's very overwhelming looking at the menu, but you'll have enough chance to "study" it while waiting in line. ÊThe place is small, thus the wait. ÊI wish they would renovate into a bigger space. ÊBut, maybe that's part of their charm? Ê I got the RED VELVET PANCAKE and yes, it's the freaking BOMB. ÊBe advised that you don't have to have the entire order. ÊYou can order (1) piece. ÊI wish I knew that at the time because there was an egg dish I wanted to try as well. ÊThis thing of beauty is topped with Cream Cheese Icing. ÊIf you wanna go into sugar shock, then by all means, slaughter that baby up before eating. ÊI treaded softly by cutting into the pancake instead of smearing the icing on. ÊWhatever icing fell into my piece, is what I ate. ÊThank God because it can be quite sweet and for me being a sweet tooth, I can handle a lot of sweet. But, even for myself, this could be too much. ÊBut, it really is the first and still the best red velvet pancake I've ever had. ÊThe consistency was great. ÊThe red velvet didn't taste "fake". ÊThe icing, although sweet, tasted really good. ÊBasically you're eating cake in several flat circle shapes. ÊThe only thing I would do differently is that I'd order just (1) piece so that I can eat something else besides pancake and save the red velvet for last. ÊI'm anxious to go back.

Too LOUD! I wanted breakfast, not a rock concert. I asked the waiter ever so nicely if he could kindly turn it down a tad, but the manager said no. I don't know about you, but when I have a hangover on a Sunday morning, the last thing I need is to have my headache get worse because the manager won't turn down the music. The food was good, the service just okay. Actors. Nice but ineffectual. Better than the actors who work at Doughboys (don't get me started). And the big question: does anyone really want a stack of pancakes this big? Me, not so much. If you want a good breakfast in Hollywood, I recommend Canter's Deli. ÊThey have a REAL wait staff (not actors), literally everything you could possibly want on the menu (plus blintzes and potato pancakes and host of other irresistible things), they don't try to intimidate you with a stack of pancakes the size of your head, and it's quiet enough so you don't have to yell. I wouldn't mind going to the Griddle if it wasn't so loud. Perhaps if they opened another one called The Quiet Griddle. Then maybe I'd go back.

GIANT PANCAKES THAT ARE THE SIZE OF MY HEAD! I got just plain pancakes and I split them with two other people. I could barely handle one. Usually when I walk by this place on a weekend morning its jam-packed with people waiting on line for the next available table. I went on a Wednesday afternoon and it was dead. The service was alright. The server didn't seem to stop by our table too often. The downside about going here is you REEK like the place even an hour or two after you leave. The smell just gets in your skin. Also my friend tried a phone order on a Saturday because he works nearby and wanted Griddle for lunch, they said "we're too busy right now" and hung up on him. Um, isn't he a customer going to pay you MONEY for your product? should it matter if it is busy? I would get in trouble if i did that at my job. A customer is a customer. You lose one star for that business.

We went to the Griddle for the first time as a large group - 10plus for brunch. That was a mistake! Our friend told us about this place but left out an important detail - this place is tiny and not meant for groups bigger than 4-6. The restaurant itself was old with some character. It was showing some major mileage. The bathroom again - taggers paradise! Please wash your hands and do the pull and drop with a napkin before returning to the table. The large booth we sat at had a hole on the bottom. This place reminded me of a DIVE Bar for breakfast. The food was a surprise! The portions were huge. The Oreo Cookie pancake is the size of the plate with multiple stacks. Not a carb counters environment. We ordered that for starters for the group. The French Toast was huge as well. We also had the breakfast tacos - a good choice. Overall not a bad experience, a breakfast DIVE BAR is unique. TIPS - Do all your ordering up front. We decided to add another order of French Toast for the table and the server said it could be 20 minutes since we are at the end of the food line. Huh? Never mind that. TIPS - Parking is a pain, they do share a small lot with Rite Aid, you just have to prey on the people for their spots. Otherwise, bring quarters and park on the street. This place is old Hollywood, with a lot of history, don't expect the new LA Lounge atmosphere. Prices are decent, I would try it again but not with a group though.

Came here for brunch on a weekend, so it was understandably crowded with a huge line outside, and I think it ended up being around a 20 minute-half hour wait, which isn't too bad. ÊI'm not a huge fan of food that makes me want to die or sleep for hours after I eat it but this was pretty good. ÊThe French toast was probably the best I've ever had. ÊIt was super loud and crowded inside, which wasn't surprising, but it does feel a little claustrophobic. ÊGigantic portions, and had a hard time finding anything remotely realthy. 3 stars cause it's really not anything different than the million breakfast/brunch places in Hollywood and I couldn't find a single thing I didn't feel guilty ordering....but once in awhile you just need a gigantic helping of junk food in the morning.

I'm not a huge fan of pancakes and french toast, but I must say, that was some daaamn good french toast I had yesterday. I got the "Addicted to Noisella" Stuffed French Toast..it was basically two humongous pieces of french toast with chocolate hazelnut spread oozing from all sides. I was basically eating dessert for breakfast. It was great. If you can, try to get a table inside. This damn bee kept bugging my friend and I. It kept flying around the syrup container and buzzing around our heads..I swear we spent half of our breakfast just trying to avoid the stupid thing.

Went here on a whim one Tuesday mid-morning with my fella at the time, a couple of months ago. We went specifically for pancakes, which he warned me were HUGE. We got a little booth inside fairly quickly - I don't think we even had to wait. The space is tiny. I'm a small girl, and I think it's *tiny.* Almost uncomfortably so, but not a big deal. The waitress was friendly and attentive enough. The food - we ordered the Eyes Wide Open. It *was* huge! Too much, in fact. I tend to dislike insanely large potions from any restaurant. I mean, it tasted great. But it wasn't anything *amazing*. All in all, it was fine. Since I can walk there, I would probably revisit on a weekday to help get rid of a hangover, or when I feel like clogging my arteries.

I would have been happy with one pancake. ÊBut, no, the 3 GIANT pancakes fill the plate to the rim with a heavy dose of powdered sugar. ÊThe powered sugar will get all over you when you're eating, so be sure to put a couple of napkins in your lap. The blueberry pancakes come with some kind of yogurt or sour cream in the middle. ÊI wasn't crazy about it. My friend got the pumpkin pancakes, which were very good. I'm glad I went here for the experience, but I don't think I would go back.

I don't know what the hoo-haw is about this place, but after coming here last week with my gf, it really wasn't as cracked up as most Yelpers here say it is. Ê We had the French toast, sides of bacon and brown sugar bananas- a star for each side dish. Ê The only reason celebs/writers/etc. come here is probably because it's right next to the Director's Guild and convenient.

This place definitely intends to add to our nation's growing obesity problem... So what do you do about it? Get your order and portion it into 8 servings and eat it throughout the day... I'm sure one plate equals your caloric needs for a day two... I'm not so much a sweets kinda gal... I prefer savory foods and so breakfast has been one of those meals that I just choose to ignore... The only thing I love to eat for breakfast is lox and bagels... which I ended up ordering here... It was a build it yourself set up and so it took me a while to eat... The inside was ridiculously noisy so we sat outside on the patio (sidewalk)... at least I was on the other end away from all the hungry people, drooling as they stare at the food... This is definitely the place for pancakes and sweet sugary deserts and i would eventually like to try some of these evil delights when I one day wake up with a craving for some sugar... Until then...

The food is good but not amazing. ÊAside from gigantic portions there really is nothing to it. ÊTHe hamberger patti is flavorless. ÊThe eggs are flavorless. ÊI don't know if they ever really season anything. ÊDon't get me wrong...it's a joint made for "cool" people but it's not amazing food. ÊAlso, the wait staff always seems super busy and beware if you try to call-in a to go order! ÊEverytime I try to order for pick up they either put the phone down walk away until you finally hang up....or they tell you they are not doing any to-go orders because they are busy. It's whatever.

In My Stomach: a variety of Pancakes (banana cream, nutella something and more) and Sandwiches In My Mind: My eyes say it looks delicious but my mind know that a plate will raise your blood sugar to new heights and your cholesterol levels will out of its charts. Seriously, how can people gorge down all that sugar. But I have to say, the portions were very huge. Pancakes were drenched in layers of sugar, whipped cream and syrup. Beware, if you don't finish your pancake fast enough, it'll be swimming in the pool of syrup. The sandwiches are not bad. We had a big group so we were place in one of the back rooms, it was shady but it was nice to have a room to ourselves. Be prepare for a long wait, we were there for probably an hour. ÊParking: it's a little difficult but you have better luck parking at the Rite-Aid Lot. I've experienced better waffles and pancakes so I might not go back. I guess it might be fun to witness the huge servings of pancakes.

Ugh, a classic study in American excess. Everything here is JUST TOO MUCH. A stack of pancakes that are so big they barely fit on the plate... isn't that gross enough (and impossible to eat in itself) without adding Oreos or bananas to them? Not only are the portions monstrously huge, so is the line to get a table. Drive past here on a weekend morning and see for yourself.... the crowd outside is massive and the wait tends to be upwards of an hour or more. If you're into D-list (or lower) celebrity sightings, this is the place for you. In the few times I visited, I have seen Ian Ziering from 90210, a member of NSync, and one of the guys from the fake MTV boy band movie 2Ge+her. Avoid this place unless you're on the fast track to morbid obesity.

I've heard things about the Griddle for a while. ÊI assumed it would be pretty delicious. ÊYou really can't go wrong with a menu full of gigantic pancakes drowned in yummy extras of many varieties. Ê I've worked in more than one food place and I learn to not take the reviews of others too seriously. Ê Opinions can really vary, and so can the sensitivity of a customer, but but place really met my expectations very well. ÊI was so happy I finally tried it and am definitely going back. French Press coffee really wins my heart. ÊThat was something I didn't know about. ÊMy "Tis the Season" pancakes really hit the spot and were the perfect texture. ÊMy boyfriend's Banana Nut pancakes were awesome. ÊHis chicken sausage and my turkey sausage was definitely satisfactory. Ê We definitely over-ordered though, afraid one pancake wouldn't be enough. ÊNext time we're gonna just order a single pancake or share a plate. ÊBecause trust me, that will be enough! Ê That's one thing to notice about the prices. ÊOn the menu they seem pretty high, but when you get your food you realize you are getting about the amount you paid for. ÊSo I'd say a fair deal in the end for sure. Staff was friendly enough, however perhaps too busy to pay close enough attention to us. ÊI had been waiting to ask for more cream for our coffee when the food arrived. ÊOur server quickly put it down on the table and scuttled away before I could voice myself without asking if we needed anything else. ÊI was left to stare and hope he made eye contact with me so I could ask him to come to the table, and wasn't successful for a few minutes. ÊSame thing happened when it was time to ask for togo boxes. ÊI don't take it personally, I know it got a little busier while we were there, but having managed a restaurant, I really wouldn't want to see that happening all the time. ÊAnd if it happened again the next time I'd just have to get up from my table and go bug my server even though I know how irritating that can be. ÊI babble about it but really honestly only considered it a minor snafu. I liked the atmosphere. ÊNot at all pretentious. ÊCan't wait to go back!

This place always has a huge line of people waiting in front of it, so I went to try it with my friends and see why people would be waiting in such a long, long line to eat breakfast. The food is OK but not great. ÊThe food at Denny's, Norm's or Jan's is just as good, if not better. Griddle Cafe is expensive too for what you get. The service is REALLY slow. ÊIt took more than 20 minutes between when we ordered our food and when it arrived. ÊFor breakfast, this is too long of a wait. It's VERY loud inside, so be sure to sit outside if you want to have a conversation with your guests. I'm perplexed as to why people wait in a long line for a dining experience like this!

Awesome breakfast at Griddle Cafe. ÊWe arrived on a Sunday at about 10:15am and were told the wait for two would be about 15 mins. ÊWe ended up waiting about 25 minutes or so, but it was no big deal. (Note: when we left at 11:30a, the wait was quoted as 45 mins and there were about 3 or 4x the people waiting outside - I'd get there early to avoid long waits). The guy seating us along with our server (do all the servers have to look like Ashton Kutcher? Not that I'm complaining...) were awesome. Attentive and with personality - yay! We ordered right away. I got the cheesecake french toast and he got the banana/walnut/carmel pancakes. We knew it would be way too much food, but we decided to over-order to try a few different things. Both dishes were awesome. The french toast wasn't fluffy or big (kind of flat) but the cheesecake and graham cracker topping was awesome. The pancakes were huge! Lots of banana and crumbled topping. ÊSuper tasty. We were hungry and ate only about 40% of the french toast and literally 20% of the pancakes. The portions are just crazy. I left with a sugar rush and later crashed. We'll be back, but this can't be a 'regular breakfast'.

I wasn't really impressed. It was ok. Not bad. I'd eat it again, but I'd never drive across town for it. If there was no line, and I happened to be within a 1/2 mile radius, I could see myself going to the Griddle. But under no other circumstances. I had an omelet and it was ok. It wasn't great. The potatoes were ok. My friend's poached eggs on potato skins were ok. The hollandaise was a little bit on the congealed side. My toast wasn't particularly special. The tomato slices were average and the coffee was alright. Service was friendly enough, but nothing stand-out. It was... ok. It's probably a 2.5 star rating to be honest. But... it had been sooooo hyped to me. I literally have been waiting YEARS to make it out to the Griddle for breakfast... and it just didn't impress.

Came here on Sunday about 2:40 put our names on the list and got called pretty quickly about 5 min even though there were people in front of us, I guess they didn't want the counter. Ordered the creme de le creme French toast, poached y papas, side of pork sausages and the French pressed coffee mild. Everything was good, we couldn't finish it all. The only reason I gave it a 4 is because our waiter disappeared at the end and we were waiting forever to get a box and change. He gave us the receipt but didn't tell us he was off or leaving or anything as it was about closing time, so we had to flag some other guy down. ÊStill gave our waiter 20% because I'm nice like that and he was very attentive in the beginning and he was cute haha. In conclusion, it was worth the hr drive and I'd def go again.

Popped in here with a couple guy friends after a bar night, so we were in dire need of some good breakfast food to get the day started. We came early at around 10 so even though it was Sunday, the wait was really short and we snagged one of the parking spots right in front of the restaurant. When they led us back to our table, I got a little confused because we passed the main dining room and the restrooms and the kitchen? We finally entered a cold dark room, dimly lit by... red lights? and furnished with furry red couches? The scene was set for a kinky porno, but it was just us three buds ready to chase away our hangovers. The darkness and quiet were definitely appreciated, but lots of peeping toms eyeballed us as they walked by. In the spirit of the red-light-room, we told salacious stories of love and lusts of skanky nights past as we devoured our delicious breakfast fare. I ordered the benedict, which had two eggs, slightly overpoached :(, with ham and potato skins (YES!!!) and an amaaayyzeballs hollandaise sauce. I'd definitely order it again and again and again.

I guess it's my fault for always getting here late but the wait is 45+ minutes and it's always so crowded. I feel so sorry for the poor waiters who must be exhausted and overwhelmed. Their service is relatively impersonal but I completely understand why. The portions are outrageously enormous. Delicious, but enormous. No human being can finish those pancakes. It seems a little wasteful but you will have tons of leftovers.

I am definitely a breakfast person if it includes Red Velvet Pancakes, fresh pressed coffee (ahemmm with complimentary refills), and Abercrombie-esque looking waiters. This little place seats about 50 people, elbow space is limited. Luckily this was our first morning stop so we were seated right away. Our party of 4 ordered the Red Velvet Pancake, Oreo Stack, Peanut Butter French Toast and Strawberry and Cream Waffles. I can not begin to explain how AMAZING the food was, every dish exceeded my expectation. Service, besides being beautiful was very delightful! The menu is fun and has a variety of different options to choose from. My weight and I thank you for staying in LA!

I can understand why people would like this place, but I wasn't a huge fan. ÊThe wait was long and not worth it. ÊThe ambiance was cool, but the place was packed (they squeeze way too many chairs in there) and loud. ÊSome of the other items looked but, maybe I just got the wrong thing? I had the Teacher's Pet (pancakes with cinnamon and apples). I actually thought it was really dry and hard to finish. ÊThe pancakes are not just but, they are OBNOXIOUSLY big, and not in a good way. ÊThey are thick, dry and everyone in my party had a hard time finishing just one. ÊI took a few bites of mine, and the rest (a ridiculously large mound) stayed in my fridge for a couple days until I threw it in the trash. ÊI personally thought it was overpriced, and I know they pride themselves in their huge portions, but I'd much rather prefer reasonable sized pancakes.

After a morning of hiking up in Griffith Park a friend suggested this place. Why not I love breakfast/ brunch. When we arrived there was a huge line and I was hesitant to wait for an hour to eat pancakes. But we waited, about 15 minutes of wait time we where called. Probably because it was party of 3? Not sure. The place is fairly small and pretty busy. I immediately ordered a Mimosa. I had to... It was Sunday and I had just finished my hike :) ... I was advised from my friend to order Pancakes because this place is known for them. I orders the Blues berry- blueberry pancake with blueberry yogurt on top? OMG., those cakes are BIG!!!

If I were to dream about eating breakfast somewhere, my mom's kitchen would be the first choice. The second is hands down The Griddle Cafe, a magical place where breakfast is handmade. I found this amazing cafe off Yelp! and thanks to the ratings and the opinions of others, I now understand why it is has deserved such high remarks. First off, parking was easy and simple since they have a parking lot at the back of their place. And I was lucky enough to grab a table early on a Monday morning because apparently the cafe gets packed with tons of hungry people. The servers are great and it gets quite busy but they definitely acknowledge you when you need service. With my girlfriend, we decided to each order our own entree despite knowing and seeing that the portions are enormous. We ordered "The Golden Ticket" pancakes and "Apple Cobbler" french toast. Both of which were warm, delicious, and made for breakfast of champions. The portions were severely catastrophic as they were plates built for giants. I believe they served 3 pancakes and I was only able to eat one of them. This was the first meal of the day too. The apple cobbler french toast definitely hit the spot as it was warm and gooey apples with a load of caramel. A crisp outside with a soft center fits the criteria for french toast and this place was right on target. Overall the menu is amazing and satisfies your craves for a great breakfast. I definitely would try this place out and take friends because sharing would be a good experience. Enjoy and bon appetite!

I've heard so many good things about this place, and today was the first time I actually got to try it out. ÊLet me just say, when I opened the menu I immediately wanted to order every type of pancake/waffle they had listed on there. ÊPancakes with brown sugar baked bananas?? ÊOh my god. ÊStrawberries and cream waffles? ÊGeez! ÊI finally settled on "Tis the Season" which was pancakes with Êpumpkin pie filling and whipped cream on top. ÊI made the mistake of getting two pancakes instead of one, and about 7 bites into my meal I had to give up. ÊNot because it wasn't good, but because it was simply too much food. ÊI tried to eat as much as I could, because it was so tasty. ÊI couldn't do it though, and unfortunately I wasn't able to bring my leftovers with me so I had to part with my fantastic breakfast. ÊOh, before I forget, the coffee was quite good too! The wait wasn't bad at all, and we were able to get a table right away. ÊThis is probably because it was 11:30am on a Monday, though. ÊOne thing is for sure, the next time I eat there I'm either going to stick to getting one pancake or I'm bringing someone who is willing to split two with me. ÊI also want to try out the lunch menu, because I caught a glimpse of someone's order of chili fries and it looked really good.

This place is wayyyyyy overrated. I kept on hearing what a delightfully magical place this was, so we checked it out. I give them credit for being patient to LA crowd of health nuts and letting 'em sub one thing for another, but I found it to be an average breakfast/brunch place. OK, SO maybe I was a bit harsh or not, so I am adding this tid bit. I decided to stop by there with a friend. I ordered the chocolate french Êtoast. I was in chocolate coma for 2 days it was so good. On the other my friend had blueberry pancakes and she ended up being sick for 2 days. I guess we gotta have strong stomachs for this place.

Decent pancakes. ÊThe toppings are really the focus here. ÊThe pancakes themselves are a little mushy but not in a bad way -- more like eating a bread pudding. ÊVery sweet. ÊIf you don't have a sweet tooth, you have a more limited selection. I have "Tis The Season" which was pumpkin pancakes. ÊIt was three pancakes as big as the plate which I couldn't finish. ÊI think you can order less as I saw someone eating just one --don't know if the price is the same. Also tried the Apple Pie French Toast because my eating partner had it. ÊIt was decent too but I'm not much of an Apple Pie person. I went at 10am on Good Friday which you would think wouldn't be that crowded but still had to wait 15 minutes for a seat.

We waited over 30 minutes for a table for 3 and probably another 30 minutes for our food. The food was good overall and you get very generous portions. We split the waffle 3 ways because it's huge. The coffee served in the french press was very good. We also got a celeb siting. Jessica Alba and her very attractive hubby were sitting about 5 tables away. I would return again but maybe try to go at a non-peak time of day to avoid waiting what seemed liked hours for our meal.

Best place to go for breakfast after a late night. ÊBe forewarned, however: you should have a few hours free afterwards, for napping, as you will enter a pancake coma 20 minutes after eating. My weekend routine has been following a trend: head to the Griddle Cafe on a Sunday morning. ÊOrder the Golden Ticket. ÊEat about 1/3 (between two of us), box the rest. ÊReturn home for massive nap.

One of the top brecky places in LA. Ê Ate breakfast for lunch. A really good thing to do now and again. ÊAnd apparentley so thinks many many people as this place was PACKED on a weekday at 12 noon. ÊSo be prepared to wait and stare at people feeding their happy faces. Yes they have a big menu with real lunch food, but alas , with so few great brecky places in LA, most of the world is doing the happy egg dance! ÊI dont think the owners mind one bit. ÊAnd according to my lunch date, the waiters are pretty hot. ÊNt that you are going there for that are you? ÊWell some of you girls might make an excuse... What can be said is if you are craving breakfast and only want to eat one meal a day, this be your baby. ÊVery large portions of both basic breakfast staples but more importantly, creative and way way bueno variations on a theme for all sorts of morning glory. French Toast. ÊMMMMmmmm. ÊPancakes big enough to Êstop a steam roller and make a construction worker full. ÊOmlettes all good. ÊHuevos rancheros looked awesome next table. ÊMy eggs benny were served on deep fried potatoe skins. ÊNow you might say whoa babe, but you know they were pretty fuckin awesome. ÊDifferent can be good, and this place goes for it in many of their dishes. ÊHigh quality ingredients all around and you can tell. The place is a bit heavy on the grease, but that is what makes breakfast special! ÊBecause its a small place and they are cranking out mass quantities of food, Êthey need a better ventilation system. ÊSo with that, you do leave with that griddle grease smell in your hair and clothes. Ê So if you sneak off to eat here, your significant other or roommate is going to know. So you best be taking them or have a change of clothes in the trunk! ÊOr just live with the fact that cheating can be a good thing. ÊIn this case it could mean your diet, your arteries or someone you didnt want to share with. Ê But with portions this big and good, you really should be sharing with friends, family and loved ones.

Unnnnhhhnhhhnnnnh. That's all you'll be able to say as you waddle out of the Griddle Cafe, toting five pounds of half-eaten pancakes in the largest take-out container you have ever seen. I had to wait three days just to be able to write this review. But it was delicious. As the 579th review, I doubt I can add too much that hasn't already been said. We went on Memorial Day and were seated immediately, despite the line outside. (Only knowing one other person in Los Angeles sometimes has its perks.) The waiter gave us plenty of time with the menu and was open to making suggestions. He also gets major props for dealing with the extremely finicky and annoying couple seated next to us. We got the Scotch on the Rocks pancakes (pancakes with coconut, pecans, oats, and butterscotch chips, topped with whipped cream) and the Baked Potato Omelet. The pancakes were amazing - three cakes the size of a barstool. We couldn't even make a dent. I asked our waiter if anyone ever finishes them, and he said rarely. "Someone once ate five - it was disgusting." Once you have eaten at the Griddle, you'll understand how UNBELIEVABLE that is. Ugh. Wow. I'm impressed/revolted. The omelet was pretty good. Not the best I've ever had, but I'm glad we didn't get two sweet things to share. Next time I will be ready - I plan to take 7 friends and not eat for 3 days prior. Our powers combined, we will eliminate that wonderful plateful of carby goodness.

Do not come here if you're not planning on bringing an appetite! Whoooooo. So much food!! You know those large, white diner plates that usually carry the weight of a couple eggs, flapjacks, hashbrowns and your choice of bacon or sausage? Alright, now chuck all that stuff and completely cover it with three, fluffy pancakes about 12 inches across and 4 inches high. Yup. There's a reason they are served alone. The waitress suggested we order sides (to share) since most people like some savory with their sweet. Feel free to oblige. The pancakes are $7 - $9 and the sides are $1 - $5 accordingly, so sides aren't going to break the bank. They come in huge servings as well. Side of bacon? PILE O' BACON. Side of eggs? PILE O' EGGS. Gettin' the picture? In our group of six, we ordered three sets of cakes, griddle potatoes, a waffle, breakfast tacos and the one who was "eating light" got the Chicken Melt. The pancakes were less Breakfast and more Dessert for someone who has been a very very good girl. I ordered the Hear Me Roar (pancakes with halved strawberries and Frosted Flakes right in the batter) and it appeased my sweet tooth for, ohhhhhhh, the next six months or so. Not a single one of us pancake-eaters used syrup, you don't need it. The chicken melt was equally intimidating in size, so much for eating light! The only normally-portioned plates were the tacos and the waffle, and were the only people who came anywhere near clearing their plate. The verdict - DELICIOUS. Oh man. I'm more of a waffle than pancake gal but I am definitely a fan of these pancakes. Nobody walked away from the table disappointed and everybody we saw leaving the restaurant was saying, "This place is so good!" It is! So why only four stars? Their seating policy for groups is kind of strange. The seating is pretty tight. Mostly just two to four seaters, some bar stools around the kitchen and only three tables that could fit "larger" groups (5+). Their policy seems to be that they will only sit you once your entire party has arrived. Can't sit at the bar, can't wait inside at all. I understand the logic, it's just no fun standing on the sidewalk out front for an hour waiting on the one person stuck in traffic. Meanwhile, people are getting their after you and getting the only available tables, so when your party is finally full, you have to wait an additional thirty minutes to sit. At least the people who work there are super nice and once sat, very attentive. It definitely makes the wait forgive-and-forgettable. I'll be back.

This place is pretty darn good, and I'm happy to say that the food I had lived up to all the hype. The service, however, was lacking. We went on a Friday morning around 10am. It wasn't too crowded - we had to wait five minutes at most. Had to ask for a second menu, but didn't get it. Had to wait longer for our server to take our order. Then they brought over the wrong plate. All the negatives aside, the food was great. We ordered Chicago Charlie's Scramble - complete with Italian sausage, bell pepper, potatoes, bacon, mozzarella - the works, essentially. We filled up on this one before the pancake came, unfortunately. The banana pancake melted in my mouth, and I don't think I need to make another comment on how big it is. Word on the street is that Ian Ziering (the original 90210) owns this place, so he was hanging out with his breakfast as well. Now I don't watch Desperate Housewives, but I guess people were crapping their pants over Jesse Metcalfe who was seated by the front door as I was leaving. I was going to give this 3.5 stars, but I can't hate on the service too much because I know the staff is constantly running around. Besides, I've only had really good breakfast at one other place (NOT in LA) that's comparable. Sooo, the food makes up for the extra half star. And celebrity sightings are a plus. I'll definitely come back again if I have $35 (inc. tax) to spend on two people for breakfast. I have to mention, though, that the pancakes did last me for a couple more days.

Who is ready for a sugar coma??? ÊI am!!! ÊThis is probably one of the best breakfast places in the country. ÊVery creative items that are all equally good. ÊForget being healthy and order what looks good. ÊIf you order eggs, you're in for a disappointment.... Peanut Bubba French Toast - Damn this is good stuff. ÊProbably my favorite thing on the menu. ÊHas a good crunch and you can definitely taste the peanut butter without it being too overpowering. Apple Cobbler French Toast - Probably my #2 pick.

HUGE portions... I wish I could have known a bit more... I ordered the oreo pancakes, a side of ham, and a mexican type scamble served w/ tortilla chips. Luckily, we got there around 2pm on a weekday, so there was no wait for us. Ê Parking: Easy for us. Found a meter spot right away, but it wasn't during peak hours. Service: Good. Our waiter was attentive and did not mess up a thing. Food: portions are HUGE. The ham was the size of a dinner plate. The pancakes could feed a starving country. Ê Drinks: We got the Mochas with a bit of alcohol in them. I forget the name. ÊThey were a bit lukewarm which was disappointing. Ê Although there were no major issues, I wan't completely impressed by the food or the place in general.

Similar to most people, I'd heard about the french toast and got curious. ÊAs it is one of my favorite breakfast foods, I wanted to see some different takes on it. ÊAfter cruising their website, I could tell this was the kind of food that requires a pair of sweatpants and a healthy appetite, but I was game for it. Ê Came in around 10 on a thursday morning, not expecting a crowd, let alone a wait- it was packed! ÊI put my name in and was told 10-15 minutes, but after 2, a few seats opened up at the counter. Ê(A very low sitting counter by the way) ÊAfter checking out everyone's plates around me, I realized one plate is MORE than enough for 2 people. ÊI split the "Creme de la Creme" (about 12-13$) with one other person, an ordered a coffee (about 3.50). ÊFirst off, "a coffee" means an entire french press for yourself, so best to split it if you can- its' a bit expensive for one person, especially if you're normal and just want one cup! The french toast is epic. ÊThe bread they use is Jolly Green Giant size, and its smothered in "la creme", which is similar to the frosting used on Cinnabons- woah. ÊIts encrusted in graham crackers bits, and also has powdered sugar on top. ÊI decided to up the ante and add a bit of their house syrup, inching closer to the possibility of a diabetic coma- Êbut it was worth the risk! Ê Bite after bite, I was impressed- but as I'm a sweet tooth, its hard not to be- ÊI made it halfway through my one slice when I needed to take a break- seriously. ÊThe bread is heavy, and the creme was intensely rich- good thing I was planning on hiking for a few hours right after breakfast. I eventually did finish my one slice and felt the oncoming sugar rush! The service was friendly and prompt, and it is wise to come in off-peak of course. Ê If you have to wait for a table, there isn't anywhere to sit and wait until your table is ready- so if the weather is crappy, you might have to stand outside or be in a lane of traffic inside the restaurant- not kosher. No major complaints, but I realized one huge flaw on their website- no prices indicated anywhere. ÊThat kind of bugged me, but after reading other yelp reviews you can kind of get an idea as to how much things cost.

I've been here twice--the first time because I'd heard so much about it and wanted to check it out and the second time because a friend really wanted to go. Besides the fact that their pancakes are so big they don't even fit on the plate and no one can possibly finish them in one sitting (at least I hope not), there is nothing remarkable about this place. There are so many brunch places that offer better food and atmosphere and you won't have to wait two hours to get a table. On top of this, they don't serve fountain sodas. My ex and I both ordered Diet Cokes and they most definitely brought us Coke Zero from a can (we're Diet Coke/Pepsi connoisseurs so we can tell). I've ordered and tried: Blueberry pancakes: too tart and they put funky sour cream stuff on top, no syrup Pumpkin pancakes: too heavy and generally disappointing Cinnamon-honey oats pancakes: they just sprinkle cinnamon and oats on regular buttermilk pancakes; again, disappointing Shrimp and pesto scrambled egg whites: the best thing I've had here In short, take your pick of one of the many other brunch places in West Los Angeles and go there.

I'd been meaning to come here for a while but the line deterred my craving for hearty breakfast. ÊIt's a bit of an understatement to call this "hearty" because you will pretty much have never experienced pancakes like these before. ÊWe got A Time To Love, which was butterscotch-chipped, caramel filled, powdered sugar and whipped cream-topped pancake stack (3 frisbee-sized pancakes). ÊSo this was more of a dessert and rich with sugary sweetness but it was fun to get cause I felt like I was in a candy store. ÊFor three people, it's still too much. But we also go the Poached y Papas eggs benedict and Mamas French Toast. ÊThe eggs benedict was definitely unique, and the sauce was darn amazing. ÊI won't forget it the next time I am there. ÊThe french toast was also delicious, but if you want to savor the moment and remember why you waited in line (which wasn't bad, about 30 min on a Sunday morning and we waited across the street at Coffee Bean and missed our name being called) then maybe try the Poached y Papas if you're into eggs benedict and the heart-stopper/ cavity-producer A Time To Love. ÊPlus you get some interesting rappers and Jesus imitations while you're waiting in line and the workers (this time) were super friendly and cool.

This is my favorite breakfast spot in LA so far, although I'm eager to try the "not so far away" Blu Jam Cafe. Although the food is pretty great and you can read countless reviews here saying so, what I love most is the vibe. Brick walls. Horseshoe counter for singles and regulars. Dark but not too dark in case you did too much partying last night or don't want to wear makeup. My favorite thing to do is to order a French-press coffee, sit at the counter against the brick wall and chill. I people watch. Edit a script. Stare vacantly into space. And THEN I decide what to order or whether to order at all. Their portions are GY-NORMOUS, but you can order one pancake although that's not on the menu. And one pancake is the size of your face, I swear it. So do that if you don't want to be a piggy or have pancake leftovers for the next four days. There's parking in back behind the drugstore that's also for the cafe (no towing or ticket worries!), but hold your breath as you walk around the dumpsters or walk around to the front because it's super stinky back there and who needs THAT before breakfast? I personally like going in the back door and down the long hallway. Avoid the weekends and you won't find a line. I've been there a lot and never waited.

I understand.. hollywood landmark.. interesting array of choices on their menu...thousands of positive reviews... but the place just didn't blow my mind To start things off, the wait time.. 30 min for a group of 3. I recommend going in groups of 2 because they had nearly no wait time at all. Ordered the red velvet pancake, "peanut bubba" crunchy french toast, and the hoagie omelet. The portions are huge, made ever bigger with the help of a mountain sized whip cream on top. The red velvet pancake KOed me at first bite. Literally whipped my butt with the amount of sweetness emanating off the monster. Before anyone gets their panties in a bunch, one thing you must know about me: I have a major sweet tooth. Any time is candy, cupcake, chocolate time. And this dish whooped that sweet tooths ass. Not just this one, lo and behold, the french toast is even sweeter!! How can that be?? Thank goodness my friend ordered the omelet which immediately offset the sweet aftertaste left in my mouth. I love pancakes like no other, and am a big fan of red velvet cupcakes but this was definitely not my thing. First off, one stack but still way too large and the center was a bit gooey as though undercooked. I noticed other tables had ordered the buttermilk pancake and immediately felt jealous. I had originally debated going the safe route but as my sister says "live a little". Although I feel my lifespan has just been cut in half thanks to that thing.

I'd give The Griddle 5 stars if only the wait list wasn't so long, an egg wasn't so expensive to add to a pancake, and they changed the acoustics inside. ÊOtherwise, I love this place. ÊI have never been disappointed and often I am pleasantly surprised. I've gone with parties anywhere between 2-8 and have always had good service.

Went here about a week ago when we were visiting from NoCal as my husband saw it on some food network. The pancakes were amazing. The stacks of them were a size of a cake. Definitely come Êhungry. I was only able to eat one of the 3 pancakes. i ordered the Orea Cookies and my husband the Red Velvet. Both were amazing. The pancakes were cooked through all the way, great topping and service was excellent. We also ordered eggs and potatoes. Eggs were regular but potatoes not something I would order again as they didn't have much taste to them. Definitely go back for those pancakes. Awesome experience overall.

I'm usually not much of a breakfast person (because I'm still over-stuffed from the night before) but I would wake and eat any day for Griddle Cafe. This place takes the typical American breakfast to a whole new level. Pretty much everything is amazing and portions are huge! I really like their chili and omelets. Also, you must try the pancakes... they could pass for buildings. Make sure you get it to share with a large group and not to eat by yourself... you will certainly die... but at least in happiness. Expect there to be a wait but Griddle Cafe is well worth it. I'm getting really hungry writing this review.

I'm not sure if people in this town know what breakfast is supposed to taste like. The pancakes were their strong suit. Everything else was dry, overcooked, lack of skill garbage. The place absolutely stinks so expect to smell like grease when you leave. The wait was way too long. I feel sorry for the suckers who eat outside like caged zoo animals while everybody watches you eat. I'd rather go to ihop. If the food was good, I wouldn't mind waiting or the smell ad much. Waste of time. One bonus point for the out if order meter so I didn't have to use my quarters. Also the staff are a bunch of arrogant dou... That need to realize they are just servers and drop the ego a bit. But I guess it is LA where everybody thinks they are somebody.

Decided I had to try this place when I came out to visit a friend. I sort of underestimated the size of the pancakes and of course couldn't get through them, but the place was good enough we decided to go back a few days later. Probably a 20 minute wait to get in on a Sat around 10 am, a 5 minute wait on a Tues at 830 am. I'd definately make a point of coming back here when I'm in LA again. Plus it is in WeHo and is shown in the first episode of Noah's Arc, so it gains bonus points from an out-of-towner.

BRING INSULIN. We each ordered sweet dishes. i had the nutter butter french toast & he had layers of oreo pancakes. i felt nauseated after the first slice. and continued to feel nauseated for the rest of the day. but continued to pick at it until it was gone. that was how addicting it was. the oreo pancakes could easily serve four small asian girls. they were on the dry side, and the oreos didn't add much to the pancakes. anyway, lesson learned: next time we'll get something savory to counter the massive carb load.

You want breakfast food that you can't conceivably not like? What about breakfast that will be enough to last you 1-2 meals more once you box it to go? ÊHow about breakfast that will leave you checking your schedule and rounding up your friends to get back there as soon as possible? ÊHow about a breakfast place who's line out the door every weekend speaks to it's greatness? ÊI'm not sure about you, but I consider a restaurant that meets the above mentioned criteria as a winner and growing up a competitive athlete, I prefer winning to losing. ÊThe Griddle Cafe is definitely a winner. ÊThe Griddle absolutely wins in taste, monstrous portions, great price, raucous breakfast joint din, buzzing ambiance. If you've never been, before you MUST try the Griddle's french toast. ÊMy absolute favorite guilty and decadent gastronomical splurge is the "Creme De la Creme" french toast. ÊNothing compares to it, not even Sinead O'Connor. Ê Don't both with anything else on the menu, ahem lunch options, or other sorts of breakfast options until you've experienced the Griddles sublime french toast or the famously ginormous pancakes, filled and topped with gooey, fruity, or sugary goodness. ÊIf you split the pancakes with a friend, the two of you will still have enough left over to take home. ÊI went to the Griddle with an NFL football player once, and even he couldn't stuff all the pancakes into his football player tummy. ÊAnd, the whopping portions of yum-yum in your tum-tum will undoubtedly make for a great photo in which to upload onto facebook with an appropriate caption along the lines of "Look mom! ÊI just fell off my diet!" or "Heaven on a plate, Hell on my Thighs". Oh, and that long, long, long line out front . . . don't sweat it. ÊPut your name in and enjoy the sunshine while you wait. ÊDon't come on the brink of fainting with famine or you may sit down a grumpy little monger and not enjoy the true splendor of The Griddle Cafe. ÊIf the waiting is that tedious for you, bring your etch-a-sketch for the interim, or a book, or hop across the street and pick up a coffee from The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf. ÊJust don't miss your name being called, or you can add eons to your wait time or forfeit your spot completely. ÊTrust me, I know (whomp, whomp, whommmp). ÊJust get your hungry buns to The Griddle Cafe and be sure to write home to mom about it, or better yet, take your mom the next time.

First, a disclaimer. ÊBreakfast is easily my favorite meal of the day. Eggs: good, pancakes: good, bacon: good. Ê L.A. can be a weird, confusing and entertaining place to find a meal. ÊRecommendations should be taken with caution. ÊWe've gone to places that we've been told are "must visits" and been really disappointed. ÊWe were told that this place "okay" Êwith a "be and be seen" vibe. ÊI think the only people who wanted to be seen that day were the servers. ÊThey were all definitly in show business. ÊGood looking, muscled, couldn't be bothered. ÊNot rude, just wanted to make sure we knew who the boss was. ÊOr maybe it's because we were the only people in there with a 3 year old who was throwing the sugars around. The menu was great with a lot of selection. ÊWe could see by the tables around us that the portions were ginormous so we kept it simple. ÊScrambled eggs (perfectly cooked) bacon (applewood smoked) potatoes (kind of soft and mashed then cooked flat on the griddle so they form a delicious, buttery/bacon grease flavored crisp crust) and wheat toast ( unusually good and actually hot-big pet peeve when I order breakfast out is toast that is usually pre-toasted and so cold the butter doesn't melt) and coffee and oj. The coffee came in a french press, my favorite and even though it was decaf it was super flavorful. ÊEverything Êwas really great and piping hot. ÊThe one disappointment was trying to get a pancake. ÊThe menu has a ton to offer and they are the size of the plate. ÊI understand places do this because well, they can. ÊPancakes are cheap to make and if you get a really big portion they can charge you a lot of money and it looks decadent and yummy. ÊBut when we ask them if they'll just pour a small one for our daughter and they say "we can't" it just annoys me. ÊSure you can, just pour a little on the griddle instead of a lot. ÊBelieve me, our daughter had more then enough to eat with sharing our meal, it just would have been nice to tear into one of those pancakes to complete the meal. All in all, as long as we go early like we did on this trip I would go again. ÊWe got the very last table and as we were leaving there were people waiting. Ê I also noticed on the way to the restrooms they have a couple of small rooms in the back for larger parties. ÊAlthough they were down a dark hallway with no natural light and looked like little closets, at least if you go with a group or a few 3 year olds throwing sugar they have a place to put you. Ê Highly recommend it on your next trip to Los Angeles.

Upon entering the cafe and taking a quick glance at the decor and waitstaff--I was immediately reminded of this restaurant back in NYC called Coffeeshop--you know, where everyone looks like they came straight from the glossy pages of a fashion mag or an Abercrombie & Fitch advertisement. Upon feeling the 'I'm cooler than you vibe", ÊI wanted to leave, but my stomach said otherwise and I like to give new places a try. Overall, I liked the decor of the cafe, the service was so-so and the food okay. I ordered the La Vida Loca burger since I like hot and adventurous food. It was anything but 'livin' la vida loca'. First off, Êthe wrong dish was brought to me, but the guy mumbled something that sounded like 'hot something..' and whisked away before I could say, 'hey this wasn't what I ordered. " A full minute later, he realized the mistake. When my order arrived, I was impressed with the presentation, but man looks can be deceiving. I felt that the burger itself was bland with the occasional smattering of green peppers and I guess what made it vida loca was the chipotle mayonnaise. Yaay! a little spice in my mayonnaise--I'm really living on the edge. I did like the steak fries. Mmm, maybe if I decide to return, I should try the breakfast that everyone is raving about.

Everything on the menu sounded amazing, so it was hard to order. Portions are huge! I went with two guy friends, and we only ordered 2 dishes and still didn't finish. We ordered the normal french toast, and it was really good. Nice and buttery, warm and crispy on the outside. MMmmm. We also got strawberry pancakes--they come in stacks of three, and they're HUGE! It was pretty yummy but not amaaaazing or anything.. Overall, I think we needed to order eggs or something to offset all the sugar. Good thing we stuck to the plain/original french toast because it would've just been wayyyy too much sugar. Service was good, timely. We went around 11AM and waited 15 minutes. Atmosphere is lively, a lot of energy, so it's a fun place to go. But if you need to have a serious talk with someone, it's better to go somewhere quieter.

Griddle me this. Griddle me that. Griddle me up some delicious flapjacks! Eating at Griddle Cafe takes a lot of patience. For those who live in or around the area, screw you!

At Griddle, the good things come in the form of ginormously thick pancakes, filled and topped with sweets that would make your dentist cringe. We ordered the "Time to Love" - streusel, butterscotch chips, caramel, pumpkin filling, topped with powdered sugar, whip cream and caramel. Given the filling and toppings, you would think that the pancake would be overwhelmingly sweet, but it totally wasn't! It was PERFECT! I wish I could say that we demolished this baby, but shamefully, we only finished slightly more than a quarter of it; We had filled our bellies with other, unmemorable items on the menu. I ordered the "Gone Shrimping" - egg whites scrambled with shrimp, basil pesto, scallions, tomatoes, topped with capers. Sounds good on paper, but not so much in my mouth. It was very bland and I'm not a big fan of frozen shrimp since they usually turn out rubbery when cooked. Henry ordered the "Chicago Charlie's" scramble - Italian sausage, potatoes, bacon, bell peppers, mozzarella, garlic, basil and lots of onions. A lot better than my shrimp scramble, but still bland overall with pops of flavor from the sausage and bacon. It kind of reminded me of a pizza with no sauce. Now I understand why a lot of people just ordered pancakes and nothing else. Next time the game plan is to share one order of pancakes/french toast and another breakfast dish. I'm thinking... "Addicted to Noisella" - nutella stuffed french toast.. or how about "Black Magic" - oreo filled flapjacks topped with more oreo cookie pieces?? DAMN.

My visit here with my friend was quite unexpected. We ended up just going out just because we felt like celebrating something very minor (last lab assignment for his summer). I got the Black Magic and I must say, the first five bites I was in heaven. But after ten bites I noticed that I hadn't even put a dent in the thing. By 20 or more so bites, I had only finished about 1/4 to 1/3. I was pretty much ashamed. Not only that, by the tenth bite, I was sick of the dang thing. I ended up getting the sausage so I could get some salty foods in me. The point is that this place is a great place for those who love sweets. But to be honest, I rather have a good Mexican burrito for lunch than a cake. And to be fair, I need to come here more to try out the rest of the menu to give it more stars. But to be more honest, I probably won't come here again (because first impression is everything). But I would definitely take friends here if they wanted a feast of feasts (then again, Korean BBQ does that trick).

I salivate any time I pass this place. I finally went back today, and am still amazed. This place has the sweetest most delectable dessert-like breakfast any sweet tooth could swoon over. Mom's French Toast is the must-try. However, my personal favorite is the Strawberries & Cream waffle...the brown sugar cream is to die for. Also, got some Twitter love for following them (@thegriddlecafe)...got a last minute reservation in just by tweeting them...amazing! Overall service is friendly and the vibe is cozy. Best breakfast joint...wish I lived closer!

Pretty good. The guy told us the wait was 30 minutes, but I think that's just what he tells everybody. Because really, 30 minutes isn't horrible..and by the time you wait 30 minutes, you're likely to stay anyway even if you're irritated. Our wait was 50 minutes. Decor/Atmosphere: Nothing special, really. It is pretty damn squishy inside, but the high ceilings made me feel less claustrophobic. It's also pretty loud inside. Food: So, there are like 2000 reviews for this place and it still has 4 stars, so obviously the food here is good. The bf got "Mom's French Toast" (4 stars). He said it shoulda come with other things like eggs, meat, or like toast (haha, more bread)..but he enjoyed it regardless. We had made a bet that if he could finish it, I would pay for brunch. I got the "Some Like it Hot" eggs (5 stars), which was really good. It's not that hot, which is fine with me cuz I can't handle too hot anyway. We knew it was a bad idea when we saw how gigantic the pancakes were, but being the red velvet lover I am, we got an order of their famous red velvet pancakes. Meh..not impressed (3 stars). It woulda been fine with just powdered sugar and the cream cheese frosting, but the chocolate powder (my bf insists it's Nesquik mix) just took it overboard, in a bad way. We also tried their coffee (medium roast)..and I thought it was really cool it came out in a french press. Service: Okay, not gonna lie..I was semi-interested to see what these male model servers are all about. However, I was not impressed..they were normal height, and with normal looks. Boo! Maybe I came on the wrong day. Despite having to wait a while to have menus brought to us, the service was pretty good. Solid 4 stars (minus 1 cuz the male models were not working when I visited). Tips: - Go for a walk, peruse the shelves of Walgreen's next door, or do something else to distract yourself from watching the outside diners eat their extremely large pancakes. Otherwise, you won't be able to stop drooling. - You can call to put your name on the list before you get there, but it's a 6 ppl min. - Parking is in back, or you can find street parking. - Don't order pancakes unless you have 5 other people to share with..or expect to eat leftovers for bf for the rest of the week. - In my opinion, it's a good place to take out of town visitors. Lastly, if anyone was wondering. The bf didn't finish the french toast. But, he still paid. What a sweetheart!

O M G !!! I love this place! Planned on going here for Saturday brunch. BAD IDEA! Lines out the door probably an hour wait. So came back the following Wednesday morning and got seated right away. I love the ambience of this place. Yes it's a little crowded but it was worth it. I like the pictures and murals on the wall. Definitely come with a couple other people so you can get diff dishes and share. We got the creme de la creme french toast (cheesecake filling inside yummy french toast) and the bfast burrito and french press coffee for two. The french toast was amazing. I could eat it all day if I could. The bfast burrito was huge and come with chips. So good! The coffee was good but at $4 a cup? Next time I will just go for the water. The bill came out to about $40 with tax and tip. Expensive because of the coffee. But the food was delicious and so worth it! The portions are humungo! Will be back to try anything and everything else.

AMAZING! It was our first time to this place, and we got in right away. ÊThe place is pretty small, but a very lively friendly atmosphere. ÊOur waiter was great, and very attentive despite how busy it was. ÊThe food came really quickly, and everything was delicious! ÊOversized portions of the most amazing food you'll ever have. ÊI highly recommend the 'Creme de la Creme French Toast' which has graham cracker crust and a cheesecake topping...to die for! ÊThe coffee was absolutely wonderful too, but apparently the brand is a secret (i was even told that the owner won't even tell the employees what brand it is...it tastes like a high-quality columbian coffee).

the food deserves 5 stars for being "OMG" bomb. BUTT, we had to wait an hour and a half for it, sooooo there goes that one star. important stuff: -THERE IS A PARKING LOT behind the restaurant. it looks like it's for the RITE AID but it's also for TGC. free too! street parking is like impossible. -EXPECT to wait, especially on the weekends. and expect to wait, a long long time with a whole bunch of hungry people next to you -the plates are SO HUGE. 1 plate of pancakes=good for 4 girls. -the oreo pancakes... drool worthy. so i was randomly yelping and i found this place and took one look at the oreo pancakes... and was sold. had to go try them! so my girlfriends and i went on a saturday morning, arrived there at 10:45am, and outside there was a hugeeeeeee crowd of people (around 30-40??) waiting for their lucky names to be called. another note to keep in mind, don't bother trying to ask the man with the waiting list if your party is going to be seated soon, he'll straight out ignore you no matter how nice, young, old, pretty, hot, whatever you are. but he's really nice and friendly when it's actually your turn to be seated so don't take it up the butt. anyways, we put our name down and chilled at the coffee bean across the street for awhile. about an hour into our wait, EVA from america's next top model comes rolling up with her entourage and they walk straight into the cafe, no wait.. yeupp, the crowd wasn't too pleased to see that, especially since the majority of them didn't recognize her, but whatevers, i thought it was kinda cool. anyways, lucky us, we finally get seated at one of the tables outside, so we got to eat our brunch with about 40 hungry, drooling, people staring us down the whole time. so us four girls ordered the BLACK MAGIC pancakes (which are the OREO pancakes, it was about $10) and an omelet i forgot the name but it came with cheese, veggies, and sausages.. it was around $8? but yeah when the food came, our eyes boogled at the size of the pancakes. i'd say it was the size of a STEERING WHEEL, and it was a stack of THREE pancakes... so yeahh... our two plates would actually have been perfect for FIVE girls. Êwe each ended up paying around $6-7? so it was relatively cheap, and super delicious. not sure if i'll be back cuz the wait is ridiculous, but i'd definitely recommend everyone to try it at least once!

In a nutshell: It's definitely THE place for your sweet tooth. But they have great egg dishes as well. You'll want to come back for sure :) In great detail: The first time I came here I was petrified. The place was PACKED and NOISY. I really couldn't see any empty seats and I was scared my date and I had to wait for hours! But to my surprise, we didn't have to wait for more than 15 min. That lifted my spirits up a bit. When we finally got to ordering, I was overwhelmed by the number of items on the menu. Now, I did my homework the night before and already decided what I wanted to get (Addicted to Noisella French Toast) but the Golden Ticket Pancake description was so enticing that I just HAD to order it... and boy was I GLAD I did! It was delicious! I was so tuned into my food that I didn't even notice the loud chattering that I was so worried about earlier that day. But beware, the serving size is gigantic! I asked for two cakes (they usually give three) and still I only finished 1/4th of it. I saved to eat later. About $11 for something that can make me full more than once in the day? Yes please! Oh, and my date got the Omelette "My Soul" and I had a bit of that. It was definitely an interesting taste (salsa and sour cream in eggs? ) and my date left his plate almost completely clean so I'm SURE he enjoyed it. He had a bit of my pancakes too and he was hooked on the pieces of banana cooked in the pancake. My second time here was even greater because I was with a group of my friends and we had a great time just people-watching. And I ordered the Creme De La Creme French Toast this time which I believe is heaven on my tongue. I love Cheesecake and I love French toast so it was just AMAZING. I might just order it again, along with a new dish I have yet to taste the next time I visit.

This is by far my favorite place to go to for breakfast/lunch/brunch. Be aware that the wait is long on the weekends (as is expected) because the place is pretty small. The portions they serve are really big especially on the pancakes, so don't expect to finish them. The French toast are amazing; the peanut bubba and chocolate chip are my favorites. The eggs benedict are great too and I love both the pesto/shrimp and the chicken/cheese/avocado sandwiches.

The Griddle Caf is hands-down THE BEST breakfast in Southern California. I've been there at least 10 times now and everything (although, I must admit that the "Hear Me Roar" pancakes and the "Hoagie" omelet gets more than their fair share of my attention) I've ever tried there has been simply amazing. Even the fresh OJ and the French press coffee are awesome. Just beware that a "normal" order of pancakes far too much food for a normal person to eat. Each pancake is as large as a salad plate sized and about a half-inch thick. Luckily you can specify if you want just 1 or 2 pancakes. Also, the place is pretty small and not very fancy (some might even affectionately describe it as a "dive"), but the food is SOOO worth it.

Pancakes and French Toasts are definitely their strong suit. ÊEverything else is touch and go. First, I must have called 3 times before I was able to formally make a group reservation after my initial call to make a reservation. ÊI was finally told to talk to Sergio the day before we wanted to dine there. ÊI did and Sergio made it a point that because they were having 2 other large groups come in at 10:30am, that they needed all of us to be present for our 9am reservation before they will seat us. ÊOK, I got all 10 of us there between 8:45am and 9am, and what happens? ÊThe "table" I was promised was not ready. ÊWe waited another 45 mins before we were finally seated and we were given the giant booth in their outer back room. ÊAnd this was Saturday, February 26th, the day after a rain storm and when the temperature outside was 48 degrees! ÊSo much for wanting to get us in quickly so that we would finish in time for the 10:30 large groups to arrive. ÊWe probably didn't get to order until 10:15am! ÊThe back room was also so dimly lit that none of us were able to read our menus without the assistance of using our cellphones to provide ample lighting. ÊThere is a skylight direct above our booth but I guess they did not think it was worth the effort and cost to have it cleaned to provide lighting. After ordering, the pancakes and French toasts arrived looking spectacular. ÊMost of us were able to only eat about 1/4 or 1/3 of our orders before we were full. ÊThe others who ordered their other breakfast dishes seemed to enjoy their dishes. ÊI ordered a side of hash browns because I have a thing for potatoes. ÊWhat I got looked like it was fried nice and crispy on both sides. ÊThe problem was, the potato chunks were so thick that the crust was like biting into something hard. ÊThe hash browns looked like a brick, and frankly, it tasted like one as well. Ê I guess in the future, it's best to arrive early to avoid lines. ÊGroups of 2 or 4 are the best. ÊDon't even bother with making group reservations. ÊI felt that since we kept our end of the bargain by making arrangements to have all of us arrive before and by 9:00am for our 9:00am reservation (and Sergio was notified that most of us had already arrived at 8:45am), then we would have expected the Griddle Cafe to make an effort to seat us in a timely fashion. Ê15 to 20 minute wait is acceptable. ÊA 45 minute wait out in the cold weather is unacceptable (60 mins for those of us who arrived early). ÊI had one friend who got fed up waiting, ran across the street to get a cup of coffee from Coffee Bean in order to stay warm.

One of my favorite breakfast joints, I first got turned on to this place by one of my friends. Be careful the portions are huge, a single order of pancakes can feed up to 4 people.

When I say giant pancakes, I mean GIANT PANCAKES! So make sure you are hungry! Normally on Saturdays you have to wait in line, so bring some good company and a camera to waste time (well, that's what I did). But once inside be prepared to be overwhelmed with tasty options in gargantuan sized servings, which I suggest you share so you can sample a few things. I recommend the pumpkin pancakes, but so far I haven't had anything that I didn't like.

So, I've been hearing about The Griddle for years and I finally decided to check it out, and... it's utterly amazing. I had the Red Velvet pancakes-- huge pancakes with cream cheese frosting swirls all over. (the portions are huge, so don't eat for like a week, and then stop in.) The pancakes are the size of the plate and the plate is bigger then most humans heads.-- and raspberry infused champagne. Oh my GOD! So great, I had to be rolled out of the joint. Also, I always hear people go on about the wait time... I went on a Saturday afternoon around 1ish, there was a huge line and my guest and I got in in about 10 mins. They're really great about turning tables and getting people in and out and not in a annoying way where you feel rushed. In short... LOVE. I am in love with The Griddle Cafe.

This place is completely over-hyped. ÊPerhaps we were lucky that by the time we arrived on Sunday afternoon the crowds had died down and we were seated pretty quickly. ÊThe meal was not great, so if we'd ended up waiting an hour or more my rating would have been less than one star. ÊI ordered the chili, which was good, but seeing as they don't actually make it on site the least they could have manage to do is heat it to an edible temperature. ÊAs a side I requested the garlic bread. ÊCall me crazy, but I expected something more than a piece of wheat toast with butter and garlic salt. As one of the other reviewers cautioned "don't look up at the ceiling or you'll loose your appetite". ÊWell, the same goes for the bathrooms. ÊI was pretty grossed out by the filthiness of the place generally, but the men's room at the Griddle made some of the gas station restrooms I've been in look like a day spa. Ê The music was also way too loud. ÊI go out to eat with friends becuase I want to visit with them and it helps if you can hear what they are saying. I will say the service was good. ÊI liked our server and she was attentive. Ê Having been a food server in a very busy cafe I have a lot of respect for someone who can stay on top of things, especially when they are are nearing the end of their shift.

I hate to admit it but I first heard about The Griddle Cafe from Rachel Ray's Tasty Travels: Los Angeles. At that time I was still living in Washington, DC and was dying to go to a real breakfast/brunch place my current home town was definitely lacking. My husband and I liked the Griddle but we tend to order the same things once we've figured out what's good in a place. We've never had any of their salads, sandwiches, soups, chili, or appetizers but here's my quick assessment of what you should order, what you should avoid, what you should be aware of, etc. Pros: Omelet Pomodoro Egg dish called "Gone Shrimpin'" (only if you like garlic and shrimp and egg cooked together) Mom's French Toast Wholey-Moley Pancakes Egg specialty called "Tequila Sunrise" (v. spicy) Free pancakes if it's your birthday Cons: Long wait Parking Annoying wannabe hipsters as their main clientele Cramped quarters Not so good coffee (even with the french press)

To be honest the food was awesome, i had the creme de la creme french toast and it really satisfied my sweet tooth. i also tried the golden ticket and the black magic pancakes which were good however the black magic was a bit dry. Also the fries were good, it really helped offset the sweetness of the pancakes and freach toast. the only thing i didnt not like was the long wait which kinda killed the whole experience. from start to finish our meal took a total of about 2 hours. (sat morning) so though the food was awesome and service was relatively good the wait really killed me, but i wont hesitate to go back just as long i have so extra time

I've been here only a couple times so my review is from the point of view of a novice. ÊBoth visits I came away happy and satisfied. ÊThe pancakes are gi-normous! ÊLike bigger than my face! ÊThe size doesn't take away from the taste though IMO. ÊThey are fluffy still and not overcooked considering how big they are. ÊI've had regular pancakes and the banana pancakes. ÊBoth so great. ÊSitting outside was also nice because the people watching can be fun. It does feel a little cramped there though. ÊSo that's something I'm not a fan of.

Holy sweet jesus, there are about 1000 square inches of pancakes in every order - 1000 sq in of eat-until-you-explode delicious pancakes. ÊEven my cappuccino was deliciously oversized. On a weekday, there isn't really a wait. ÊThe only reason I can't give them 5 stars is that the service was pretty spotty. ÊSince it could take about a hundred years to make it through your food, that mostly wasn't a problem.

As far as the food goes...... its great...... the portions are huge, and it tastes fresh and great....... the downsides: -Your packed inside like cattle, they take advantage of all space, so much you cant even wait inside. Its literally like going to a club, you wait in line outside until this short Elvis Costello looking dude says its ok to enter, or sit outside.... -The service is very slow, but then again its so busy so you cant really blame them but still.... come on. -The prices.... its like paying for dinner, but its not really a downside because the portions are Huuuuuggee. so i wont count that against them Actually the only thing that bothered me was the service.... Definitely worth trying.... If you live in LA you have to try this place at least once......

I know some yelpers may kill me for saying so, but The Griddle Cafe is good, just not my favorite breakfast spot. Ê There is always a long wait for a table and it is always loud and packed inside. ÊOnce you get inside the service is great though, especially if you sit at the counter. ÊPortions are large, but you definitely pay for that in price. ÊThe french toast and pancakes are truly amazing........if you like dessert for breakfast. ÊThat doesn't have to be a bad thing, but they are definitely extremely sweet and indulgent. ÊIt is true that you can order only one pancake, but if you do so just to try it, be aware that the 1 pancake will still set you back about $7 bucks. The french press coffee is very tasty, but if you are looking for an affordable savory breakfast that is your more standard eggs, potatoes, sausage and toast.......I would say you may want to look elsewhere.

I finally got to try this place and OMG the serving portions are huge! I was expecting for a long wait but we got a table right away, which was good. The creme toast was amazing...mmmmmm. The only thing that disappointed me was the price of OJ which was $5 and too pricey if you ask me. But overall, this place is great! I'll definitely come back again.....

Unbelievable French Toast. ÊHuge portions & tasty. ÊThe only downside was the 1 hour wait to be seated, but definitely well worth it & a testament to the popularity of this eatery. ÊWe actually drove down to L.A. specifically to try this place out, call it a food run, and we will definitely do it again... Oh yeah, be careful where you park, I ended up getting a $45 ticket for parking on the street which apparently needed a special permit...

If you are going to eat pancakes in LA, here's where you want to do it. No offense to Christopher Z here, but to contrast, I've had pancakes on 4 different continents and consider myself a purveyor of fine pancakes (and coffee). You're going to want to sit inside- the local homeless people are characters and tend to become more aggressive as you travel east of La Brea. One, labeled "Rug Man", comes to mind. I was sitting outside with a date and a man wearing a rug over his head and shoulders made repeated passes, waiting for people to leave their tables with the inevitable 5 lbs of pancakes left. He swooped in and grubbed them down and went on his way. This made for an unpleasant experience. I'd rather have watched that crazy old white guy with the roller skates that shadow dances on Robertson. Another reason why you want to sit inside is because the tables outside aren't as comfy as the ones inside- and you have to eat with 2 dozen hungry people staring at you. At any rate, the pancakes are first rate, as is the kitchen staff. You get your food fast and hot. I eat here twice a year and I usually go in intending on hurting myself and leaving wracked with guilt as I literally watch my abs vanishing before my eyes and reminisce about times when I wasn't ashamed to take my shirt off in public. The patronage frequency of 2xs/365 days gives you just enough time to burn off these puppies. I wish I didn't give a damn. I was happier when I was in New Orleans and no one gave a damn. Get here early before the other locals get up and make your life miserable. Go with a Friend that wants different pancakes so you can trade bites.

My sister and I had breakfast here the other day and absolutely loved it. There was about a 15 minute wait for a table, so we chose to sit at the counter. The waiter was nice enough and uber efficient. I was actually surprised at how on top of everything he was because they were really packed. I got the Sow Your Oats pancakes and my sister got the Noisella french toast. Lets just say that we were raving about the food for the next two days. I had the orange juice which was good as well. The portions here are huge. Giant. Enormous. Can I say more? I ate like a quarter of the serving and was stuffed. A couple across from us split a stack of pancakes, and I think they had the right idea. It had a great, relaxed vibe. Quick note that the music was a little loud. With all the people talking as well, my sister and I had to use our outside voices to hear one another. But how much talking are you going to do with all that food in front of you anyway, right?

Located on sunset blvd is a fun street to be at for starters. Had no problem finding parking in the rear, the wait was about 40 mins so we went across the street and had my first coffee. I ordered the protein omelette, it looked great but it was not very tastey, kinda blah so I ended up adding salt, pepper, and hot sauce. Also I had to sample the French toast which was soaked in butter and an absolute heart clogger, but had to have a bite or two! I also saw one celebrity hanging out there this am from La Femme Nikita cast. Overall the experience was good, great service, the waiter checked on us 4 times,I will be going back for sure to try other omlettes.

2 words - pumpkin pancakes. Stop your complaining....it's a typical hollywood food joint. It's crowded, there will be a wait, and the staff is overworked. HOWEVER...the staff has always been friendly, as attentive as they could be, and my food has always been fantastic. Get the french toast or a pancake of your choice. It's what they are known for. As everyone else has said....bring a friend (or 8) to share. PS- for those scared of the portions....the pancakes are brought out in a stack of 3 unless you specify otherwise. just order a single flapjack of your choice if it's just you or you and another person. It's enough. The cheesecake french toast is also a favorite. All the food is fantastic as a leftover as well. You can't beat that. Love you Griddle Cafe...despite the wait!

I've been a Griddle Cafe regular for over 4 years now, it's absolutely my favorite breakfast place in L.A.. ÊThey have an extensive menu that pretty much caters to any taste and have some of the most amazing and inventive pancakes you could possibly imagine. ÊSome of my breakfast faves are Black Magic pancakes, Red Velvet pancakes, and the Some Like It Hot scramble. ÊI also love their French press coffee, it's absolutely delicious! Although I primarily come here for breakfast, their lunch menu is also good, with everything from salads to burgers and some great sandwiches. All the servers are great but I must give a shout out to my boys Kevin and Trotter, as well as Alex, who mans the host position - they're all amazing! I take all of my out of town guests here when they visit as well and I have yet to hear anyone say they didn't absolutely love it!

I think I must say that this is one of my favorite breakfast places right now. I went there on a sunday with my friends around 10-11. The line was pretty crazy-in fact there were two. But the food was well worth the wait. The red velvet pancakes was a little overrated but definitely nothing wrong with them. But my favorite dish was the Mom's French Toast.

definately says hollywood here, with the trendy hipsters and waiters and waitresses waiting to get their big break as actors...but surprisingly, the people are not snobby at all. very nice and attentive as they can be for as busy the place is...it's busy ALLL the time. first time i came here i wanted to cry and leave..i think me and busy huge crowds dont do well, and being a small location, a claustrophobis worst nightmare. the food here is pretty good...their specialties being pancakes i'd say...so first time going, i made a rookie mistake and ordered one full order of pancakes for myself...little did i know, the pancakes were overflowing the rim of the big dinner plate..and there was a stack of three. i couldn't even finish an 1/8th of it! the pancake was soft and tender...but i got sick of it by the end of my meal and was hating griddle cafe. ever since my first trip, i've yet to order another plate of pancakes...even if i get ONE i think i'd die from a carb coma. my friend usually gets mama's french toast, which is awesome...and i'm not a french toast kinda girl. you don't even need to add syrup...and my friend doesn't even (him being a sugar lover). french press coffee is pretty good..just nice that you can get french press coffee at a sit down restaurant. i've been getting other things on the menu like their omelets, eggs benny (WAY too heavy), shrimp blt etc...not a bad place..can be a little pricey, but if you share, it'll be super afforadable..which u shud cuz you'll have enough food left over for the rest of the day...and i DO eat a lot

Crazy large portions! Sharing is a must, but is so hard to do because you want to try everything. This is a great place to take out of towners. I like their oreo pancakes. Their syrup is in a glass bottle that sits on the table though, which I don't really like. I prefer they bring out fresh new syrup in a clean serving dish. I checked their twitter to see when they would have red velvet pancakes and i must say they weren't great. It was basically a red pancake with hot cocoa power or something similar poured on top (a lot of powder). This was a year ago though, so idk if their recipe improved. Otherwise, on every other visit i've always had really good food and service. We even saw Selma Blair there!

Damn, The Griddle got a lot of reviews which will probably tell you right away that this place has been ruined and revered by LA trend hoppers. ÊGo here and your destiny is to wait but probably be rewarded. **BTW No one gets "The Hoagie Omlet" but me. ÊIf you like, eggs, veggies, cheese home fries and loads of garlic, ignore the candied cakes and go there, in my opinion, it's one of the best on the menu!** The Griddle Cafe is one of those guilty pleasure pit stops most Hollywoodites know about and tell their friends who tell their friends and so on. ÊI too was sucked into this grouping years ago and gladly drank the cool-aid. If I go at all, it would be on a Monday morning on a very rare occasion. Ê The place is Chaos, waiters, crowds, people everywhere who seem to be existing in a place clearly too small for its popularity--(Imagine throwing a cocktail party in an airstream trailer). Ambient blues is always heard somewhere low in the mix of a white noise commotion of kitchen clatter, name shouts and conversation. ÊI feel especially bad for those who sit outside receiving the most gawk factor from the eager waitees. ÊThe only quiet place with leg-room is this two-room VIP/green room section towards the bathrooms where you always get a double-take from passer-bys hoping to get a glimpse of a famous face. ÊIt is equally fun to pretend to be famous in that room by the way! Ê Everything from the griddle looks like it came from level 4 of the NES Mario 3. When you order coffee at The Griddle, you get a french press bucket. When you order pancakes at The Griddle, you receive a CAKE, when you order french toast, you receive a few bricks of bread saturated in sugary fluids only a Mississippian could rationally conceive as a good health option. ÊOn the salty side, the omelets are ripe with garlic, cheese and veggies, the bacon is as thick as your iPhone and the sausage is complexly seasoned. ÊWhat is remarkable is for the portion sizes, everything does taste of top quality. One of the few items on the menu that is exceptional and won't cause a stroke is the oatmeal but you'll be sitting jealous at all the Peanut Butter Crunch laden, home fried plates of "it's not fair" all around. ÊThe other thing (aside from the oatmeal) that is an abnormality about the griddle is for how absolutely horrible the food is for you, most of the clientele appear to look just as scrumptious in the opposite direction. ÊPerhaps everyone there plans for this ritual gastro-caloric abuse well in advance of a retreat of personal training? Anyway you slice it, The Griddle Cafe is going to be stuck in your memory as one of the best/worst things ever to happen to breakfast! CONS-- * Expect to wait 45minutes min - 2 hours max to sit on a Saturday/Sunday morning * Expect to wait 20minutes min - 1 hour max to eat after seated on a Saturday/Sunday morning. * Don't go crying to your doctor when you find out you have enough sugar and grease in your system to open up a doughnut shop after your visit. PROS-- * Probably worth all the above if you're into some of the best comfort/junk breakfast in LA. * Portions big enough to keep your calories filled for the next week. -enjoy~

First off, you will not be seated unless your entire party is with you! After telling the girls in my group this, they failed to comprehend.. "We're gonna run to rite aid!" Ê*rolls eyes...* "Don't get mad if we have to wait another 40minutes when you get back!" Then they returned.. I asked how much longer, the guy said about 5 minutes.. "I'm gonna go check if i parked in a 1 hour zone or not" "dude, wait til we get seated!" then they walk away... Of course, we get called... NO BUENO!! The man yelled at me when only 2 out of 5 of us showed up when our name was called.. "If they're not here in 5 minutes you have to leave!" sheesh! Anyways... ÊOur waiter, Tommy, was a delight! "ooh a table full of girls, nice!" haha.. ÊI wasn't hungry after taking a 3-4am trip to Roscoe's, so nothing on the menu really appealed to me... I am not going to give it less stars because of this, though.. I shoulda went for the peanut butter french toast but I didn't.. instead I was torn between some blueberry pancakes or.. raspberry lemon pancakes.. I dont even like pancakes!! and for some reason, I thought they sounded "lighter" lmao.. a few minutes later, a GIANT plate of GIANT pancakes was placed in front of me!!!! I took 5 bites and tapped out... They were good.. for being pancakes.... But as I said earlier, I don't even like pancakes!! lol I tasted my friends PB french toast.. bomb!! that's what I'll get next time... I tried some type of oreo pancakes my other friend got.. Those were like POW! hurt your teeth, they're so sweet! The breakfast potatoes they have here look delicious as well! I wanted to get potatoes and bacon, but my friend insisted I got what they were famous for.. so I did.. D; Another thing that I noticed... All of the guys working here look the same!!

This is always amazing to eat at... always packed... sometimes a big line the food has always been great for me... The only kinda bad thing for me is the servings are just MASSIVE, like beyond human size... (ok im sure some have eaten the whole servings.. but...) I think the pancakes, you have to share with someone else, just HUGE servings.. When i eat them it barely looks like ive touched them, (and I am an eater, i promise!!) Its just that sometimes i would like to taste a few flavors that you get to do when 2 people share each others different foods... and it just too much food, and a terrible waste... BUT, really, all breakfasts and sandwiches i have seen or eaten are amazing.. A great place to chow down for sure!!! Definitely a fave, and one i take my friends to when they visit me in LA P.S.

The food here is pretty good. Ordered the Some like it hot scramble and Black Magic. Loved the scramble, but I could've gone without the Black Magic. Way too much Oreos on way too much pancake, even for a group. And don't get me wrong, I love my Oreos with milk, just not overloaded in pancakes. Although the food was good, we received our plates with residue of its past relationship with perhaps a similar oreo pancake. Stains of chocolate evidence were still stuck on it as if another could also not thoroughly finish their platter. The meal might have been more enjoyable on clean plates and a less than 20+ minute seating wait. (The wait, i can ignore. ÊThe cleanliness, I can not.)

ÊHmm... now that i wrote that out, it doesn't sound very appealing... but they were awesome! One short stack can easily feed 3 people and still have left-overs. ÊThe other breakfast food is good too, and prices aren't bad, but the portion sizes on everything else is normal. The other great thing about this restaurant is that there's parking available in the (QFC?) parking lot, right behind the restaurant, which saves the $ and hassle of finding a spot and checking the meter. The only thing lacking was the service. ÊIt wasn't too busy when we went, and yet we had to wait forever for our waiter to come by and get our order, check on us, and get out check. ÊOther than that, I love this place & wish it didn't close at 2 or 4pm!! Ê:(

This place is a complete waste of time, 30 minutes wait in line, 20 minutes until a waiter clears to take your order then another 30 minutes until you get your food and there goes an hour and twenty minutes of your life... Food is mediocre at best, granted I haven't tried the much raved on French toast, but the dish I've had was big yet bland, I had to drown it in sauce to have any sort of taste. Hype and hipsters are the only mark of this place.

The pancakes are to die for! ÊIf you go, go hungry bc the pancakes are HUGE! ÊSome recommendations: -Tis the Season -The Golden TIcket -Tequila Sunrise -Poached y Papas -Muscle Bound Scramble The place gets really crowded so sometimes there is a wait. ÊAlso, they don't have much parking.

This place is fantastic! But don't go if you're not ordering the pancakes or the french toast! That's like going to a steak house and ordering fish, seriously. The pancakes are out of this world. Scotch on the rocks is my absolute favorite! Like everyone else says the portions are HUGE! Only order a single pancake, I'm telling you. I ordered a full stack once and I was eating it for an entire week. If you live in LA.. you have to try this place. Keep in mind their weird hours though. They're only open until 4:00!

Alright so let me give you the BAD: Go on a weekend and you'll easily wait an hour to find a table...lines out the door curling around the Director's Guild building. Miss your name being called and be prepared to be scratched off the list and hear "you are dead to me." The feeling is like a nightclub for pancakes and french toast. The host may even give you a time limit on your meal (rare, but happens). Couldn't help but feel they were trying to turnover our table as quickly as possible. OK, now the GOOD: You will have one of the best breakfast meals of your life. The pancakes and french toast are ridiculously, and beautifully, huge! They have blueberry and banana pancakes (two different dishes) that were delicious. ÊI also had the famous Chicago Charlies Scramble that included Italian sausage, potatoes, bacon, bell peppers, mozzarella cheese, garlic, basil, and lots of onions (with a side of garlic bread). They also have a great coffee press, which seemed very popular. Beyond the food, the blues music was great and they had two TV's playing sports...a must for weekends (Golf, Baseball, NBA on ABC). It was a lot like chilling in a southern city, eating a hearty and tasty breakfast, with some LA attitude thrown in at the door. Overall, I loved it very much. My advice for the long wait...grab a coffee across the street at the Coffee Bean and chill while you wait...just don't stray far or you will "be dead" to the host and get bumped. Another suggestion, go during the week and not face the wait...best of both worlds.

Yeah... Ive decided to finally commit to the griddle as my favorite breakfast spot in this city. The egg items on the menu are all tasty but the pancakes... the PANCAKES! I'm still going to eat at other breakfast spots, but I cant justify ordering pancakes from anywhere else. Not only are these pancakes the most decadent ones youll ever have, they're cartoonishly gigantic. They could last you like a week. sometimes I havent even been able to fit my LEFTOVERS into the to go box after I'm full. Thats how much freakin pancake they give you. Its absurd. I dared to try lunch here once... i got a shrimp blt and frankly it was also delicious, which makes me unhappy because it puts ideas in my head of getting non pancake items from this place... and thats not cool! I would give it 5 stars but I can't stand how crowded this place is. It's not worth going to if you wake up past 9 on the weekend... unless you want to wait around for close to an hour. and while the pancakes are good, i would seldom wait an hour for them. Still though... if you like pancakes, and you havent tried this place.... what's your problem?!

The griddle is definitely one of my favorite breakfast places to go. ÊI only gave it a three star because when I eat breakfast I want sausage,eggs,hasbrown, gravy over everything. ÊThat is breakfast. ÊGigantic pancakes/french toasts just doesn't do it for me. ÊI remembered a long time ago I had a bloody mary there and that was a good addition to my breakfast. ÊDon't know if they still have that? Ê Anyhow three stars because the savory breakfast section on the menu is sort of weak. ÊAtmosphere is superb. ÊI love the super diverse mix of people. ÊPeople from every possible walks of life.

Arrive early to avoid the weekend wait. ÊWe sat at the bar and had attentive service and great food. ÊCoffee comes in a french press, the red velvet pancake was pretty big and very rich! ÊIt was SO yummy with the cream cheese topping but I could not finish with whole thing because it was so sweet (I asked for a smaller size but they said it only comes in one size - huge). ÊThe egg and potato scramble was also very good. ÊI would come back but only if the wait was short.

went here with a friend for the first time to see what the hype was about, and it was well worth it! ÊI shared a plate of crem de la crem french toast and the eggs benedict plate, and it was actually a pretty good portion (though the pancakes here looked HUMONGOUS). ÊThe only thing is that they only had one option for the eggs benedict, but it was delicious! the eggs were on top of ham and the potato underneath was slightly crispy mmm~ ÊThe french toast was actually better then I had expected, not too sweet and very tasty.

amazing amazing amazing!! i absolutely love this place. Êit is one of the few places in hollywood that hasn't been overhyped at all~~ they serve GIGANTIC, flavorful pancakes that are available in many different creative, unique options. Êeach pancake dish is so big that 3 to 4 people could share 1 stack (if you order the 3 layered stacks). Êive tried a few of their egg dishes and while the portion is huge, its nothing special. if you come here, you MUST get a pancake dish. i always rave about this place to family members visiting LA and when i bring them here, so far they've NEVER been disappointed. Êthey always go back home and tell me later on how much they're craving the Griddle. some advice: --order so that you have a minimum of 2 people per pancake dish. their portions are so big that there is no way 1 person can finish a dish on their own. --if you order the pancakes with chocolate/caramel/etc. chips in it, ask for half the amount of chips -- its waayy too sweet with the full amount. --have everyone order different pancake flavors and share and pass it around -- best way to try all their different options and not miss out on any one of them --if you have a bday girl/boy, tell the waiter. they'll bring out a giant, free fun fetti pancake. delish. after living in LA for four years, this is by far one of THE best place i have been to. can't find any other place like it anywhere else.

I went to this place with a couple good friends, they had raved about it for months, so i had to try it. We set a date, and my friends did their thing online and when we got to the restaurant, we didn't have to wait at all and we even got complementary mimosas! The place is really small, it looks like a small sushi bar, but the size of this place has nothing to do with the food. They brought us HUGE portions of food, everything was so good, there was nothing negative to say about anything we ate. I had the Red Velvet Pancakes, my friend had the Banana stuffed pancakes, which were also delicious, not to mention the eggs and potatoes that were on the table! The amount of food was so big everyone had left overs and had to take them home. I had food for another 2 days! The only negative thing about this place is that we can't try all the pancakes at once! REALLY RECOMMENDED!

I'm not going to lie; at first, I thought that LA was just like any other city, and that Chicago and New York had LA beat by far. Maybe it's just because I've lived in the suburbs CLOSE BY the city for so far, but never really ventured in. I must say, accidentally stumbling upon the Griddle Cafe was amazing, and reassured me that choosing to stay in Los Angeles for school (fight on!) rather than going out of state (or even out of city) was the best choice ever. Surely, Griddle Cafe is one of the hidden gems that make LA shine!

So I brought some out of town guest to "The Griddle" and I gotta say WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY OVERRATED!!! The huge portions of food were clearly throw together in a rush to meet the demands of the huge crowd (I guess popularity can be a curse) The waitress has borderline hostile with ordering. She was also almost non-existent when we needed her plus she said "We can't separate the bill for two parties at one table but you can split the payment." She made us feel unwelcomed at the table. The food it self was seriously mediocre albeit there was a TON of it. Maybe they should focus on quality not quantity. I do understand that it's tough for waitstaff when it really busy however if you can be pleasant to your clientele maybe you should look for other work. Ê So if you want a loud, crowded overrated, expensive hipster place to eat the griddle is for you. This was not my first experience here, but probably my last.

We put our name down at 11:45a and got seated at 12:30p, not bad. The guy said an hour and we ended up waiting 45 minutes in the shade. We ordered the Black Magic which is the Oreo filled flapjacks. They give you three flipjacks the size of the entire plate. This is huge!! It was good but personally I think it would have been better if they just gave you one flipjack like how they do with the Red Velvet. It wouldn't have seem so overwhelming. We also ordered the "Peanut Bubba" Crunchy French Toast. This was good and huge too! You get two very large French toast. The crunch is just on the outside. The creme kinda tastes peanut butter infused but I don't think it was. Also ordered a side a bacon. It wasn't too crispy which I liked and you get about 5-6 pieces. Very good!

I came here before 8:30 AM on a Saturday morning and the only seats available were at the counter. That gave me the impression that this place had to be amazing because most people in Los Angeles do not get out of bed that early on a Saturday morning. I was told to only order something sweet off the menu, so I ordered the banana nana pancakes. These pancakes were very good. Brown sugar and bananas were mixed in to the pancake batter, which helped keep the pancakes moist. The portion size was huge and I could only finish about 1/3 of the plate. I would give this place 5 stars, but they aren't the best pancakes I have ever had.

Warning you now, be prepared for a sugar coma after eating here. But it'll be a fun trip to the sugar coma. Come on, where else are you going to find Red Velvet Pancakes! Thanks to my twitter addiction, I knew when the red velvet pancakes would be available (hint hint - follow them on twitter @thegriddlecafe - you'll find out helpful insider info, like when red velvet pancakes or other secret specials are available) I had, of course, the red velvet pancakes, which were delicious and pretty much like eating a slice of red velvet cake. I wish the pancake itself had been a little more cocoa-y, but once it had the cream cheese frosting spread all over it, I was pretty much set - dessert for breakfast :) My friends that accompanied me on this sugary journey also had creative pancakes - one got an oreo stuffed (Black Magic) pancake stack (literally a stack!) and the other a pumpkin pie ('Tis The Season) pancake stack. My personal favorite of the three we tried was the pumpkin pie one, it seemed to have the right balance of flavor and pancake-ness. To help cut the sweetness, I ordered us a side of fries, which all of us agreed, definitely helped. The fries were crispy and warm, and an all around nice balance to the pancakes. I enjoyed the creative flavors of the pancakes, and the freshness of the fries, but this place only gets 3 stars for several reasons. One, when we arrived, the staff person who seated us was pretty rude. Two, there was no silverware for one of us for a very long time, despite asking several different servers. (The guy that took our order was nice, friendly, and helpful, but the rest of the staff we interacted with, not so much.) And three, the presentation of the pancakes wasn't very appetizing. This is mostly a comment on my red velvet pancakes - delicious as they were, when I first saw them, the frosting was just kind of swirled on, kind of reminiscent of when I used to frost cupcakes when I was like 7. Just saying. I did enjoy the food though, so I will probably return here at one point.

first off: ÊA MUST WHEN IN HOLLYWOOD! i was with my cousins eating at The Counter right across the street and my cousin noticed a huge crowd of people here at Griddle Cafe. ÊWe didn't know what this place was at first, we assumed there must've been a celebrity inside and paparazzi and fans were waiting outside. Êwe find out it's a restaurant when we yelp the name. Êhow lucky i was that he noticed this crowd of people!! i ordered the Omelette "Pomodoro" (filled with garlic sauteed tomato, basil and parmesan. Êserved with garlilc bread, i added chicken to it) and OMG it was the best omelet EVER! my tastebuds were exploding in my mouth!! the potatoes (on the side) were okay, the garlic toast was better, but the omelet just sets a really high bar. Êand the whole dish could've fed 2-3 HUNGRY people!! Êi barely ate 1/3 of it and i came starving! i also ordered the raspberry champagne and it was yummy! Êi got a slight buzz. =) my husband ordered a burger with steak fries. Êhe said it was okay. Êthe presentation was nice, and i thought the fries were pretty good. Ê i've heard that you can wait from 25-1hr but we came around 1pm and only had to wait 10min. Êwe ended up sitting outside which i thought would've been uncomfortable because there were times where people were waiting to get seated, but i think because we came after the rush eating outside was no big deal. Êbesides, it looked really crowded inside and it was really noisy. Ê I would definitely come back over and over again. Êthey have such a huge selection on their menu and literally each thing sounds so yummy!! Ênext time i go i want to try the red velvet pancakes.

Even though our 1 hour wait turned into 1 hour and 45 minutes, it was well worth the wait! ÊOur mouths watered as we waited in line and admired the plates of food delivered to those that sat outside. ÊA few people waiting in line would ask those leaving how was the food and everyone had something good to say!! That was a plus and after already waiting an hour, we decided to stick it out!

My boyfriend and i drove from orange county just to check out this place! YES, the reviews are right about the sardine packed restaurant, dry hostess, and long wait....but despite all that, our experience was great! We came on a monday afternoon and the cafe was packed! We waited about 20 minutes until we got sat. Jason was our server and he was awesome! He recommended the "peanut bubba" for my boyfriend, and i had the "gone shrimping." The "peanut bubba" was sweet and satisfying, but watch out because it's huge! The shrimp dish was light and yummy! I did order a bloody mary, but to be honest, it wasn't that great. They use soju instead of vodka because i dont think they have their full liquor license. Although, you can order beer, wine, and champagne! All in all, this experience was definitely worth the drive!

There's been lots of rave about the pancakes here and I was excited for ages to eat here. I think that was their downfall - hype. Cause I was sorely disappointed. Not really by the food, just the feel of the place and service. The food was actually pretty good but the bad service really put a damper on the whole meal. No parking lot but we found street parking along Sunset. Anyways the place gets busy on weekends. They create two lines along the sidewalk flanking both sides of the restaurant. There's one guy who handles the list and wrangles everyone. He's not a really people person, ie not a hostess, more like a bouncer. Fine. They won't seat you until your whole party is there. That seems fair but we were on the disadvantage end of that rule when we visited. Our friends got lost trying to find the place as well as get parking so we got passed up and ended waiting another half an hour. Sucks. But not their fault. Finally we were seated. Took us awhile to decide what to get. It was busy and they didn't seem to have enough waiters for all the tables in there. Not that they could probably fit any more people in there. The tables were all packed in there. Our waiter was this guy who seemed incapable of smiling. He was kinda like yeah to everything we said and just took our order and left. No small talk or even politeness. Water and drinks took awhile to come out. Food took a little bit longer. Finally we got our food. My friends and I got the red velvet pancake (only one but big but cost like $10), the French toast and a side of hash browns to share. We realized it wouldn't be enough food and wanted some meat so it took us awhile to call the waiter back over and put in an side order of bacon too. The red velvet pancake was good - I only had a third of it and it was quite sweet. I don't know I could eat a whole one in one sitting - too sweet. The French toast seemed average to me. 2 large pieces of bread though. And the hash browns really helped to break up all that sweetness. The only gross thing was I found a fly in the maple syrup as I was pouring it. Luckily I was pouring it on my plate and not directly on my food. I don't know if it was alive or dead because I killed it with a napkin as it hit my plate. Sooo disgusting. And then half an hour later when we were pretty much done with our food, the bacon had still not arrived. So we canceled it and asked for our check. The waiter was kinda snippy, saying they were still making it. It does not take that long to make bacon, buddy. What we had was good minus the fly-living maple syrup. Way overpriced, bad service, and overcrowded. Sorry, will not be back.

REALLY?! How did I just barely know about this place until now...and it took my gf, Anna D., from the bay area, to tell me about this evilness?! I'm guessing I've been spending way too much time in the O.C. (sorry lobster, not too many eateries there...lol). Ê Warning: depending upon how many people are in your party, which I had 4, you'll be waiting approximately 30-45 minutes for a seat. ÊSo remind yourself to have some coffee or eat a small snack beforehand. ÊOtherwise, you'll be the friend no one wants to talk to due to your grumpiness....just sayin'! As in my case, I had no problem waiting because I was able to play catch up time with my besties. Ê Well, 45 minutes surprisingly whizzed by and we were finally called to our seats (YAY!) and as we opened up our menus, let me just say, WHOA!!! I was like a kid in a candystore and felt a bit overwhelmed by their extensive breakfast and lunch items, however as I skimmed through everything one did catch my eye..."Addicted to NOISELLA" Stuffed French Toast. ÊNot sure why they named it that but basically, it's ÊNUTELLA stuffed in French toast. ÊAre you effin' kidding me?! Hell yah, I'm getting that while my gf decided on the red velvet pancakes, my bff had the breakfast burrito, and my bf/lobster settled for "Mom's French Toast" and we also ordered French Pressed coffee. ÊAbout 30 minutes rolled by and they finally brought out our babies...as soon as they set them on our table, we immediately went for it like scavengers! As soon as I took a bite out of my Nutella French Toast, it was like a scene from "When Harry Met Sally" if you've seen it, you'll get it....hahaha. ÊThe red velvet pancakes were good as well but it was more of a dessert type, breakfast burrito was okay and Mom's French Toast was alright, I can always have that anywhere else. ÊFrench Pressed coffee was good and strong so I was pretty pumped the entire day. Yes, this place is heaven to me and you definitely have to bring another friend with you due to the monstrous sized portions they serve. ÊHey, the more the merrier, right?

Pancakes galore! If you have a fetish for all kinds of different pancakes, this is where you want to be. The red velvet pancake is an over-sized flattened cupcake! Get there early on the weekends, the line can get pretty long & you may find yourself yelling @ the host/hostess for not calling out your name & you've been waiting for an hour even though he probably called your name & u weren't present. The omelets are also delicious.

Despite the chaos and crowds, our server was very attentive and friendly. We had the incredible chocolate and espresso pancakes and one of their egg omelets... So delicious! And the coffee, so perfectly complementing of the sweetness of the pancakes! Very very(!!) generous portions so we ended up taking food home but we were totally satisfied! Parking is a bit difficult to find and it can get pretty crowded... Which is why I can only give 4 stars.

ginormous red velvet pancake. Êit was only one layer covered in cocoa powder and other oodles of sweetness - oh that swirl of icing! nice finishing touch. good, yes. but i've had better. Êi loved the french-pressed coffee. Êpretty good. Ê the one girl a few seats away from me look like she took 3 bites of her red velvet pancake. but her boyfriend's protein plate looked really good. Êmaybe i'll go back for that. Ê the other girl next to me got 2 stacks of pancakes smothered in whipped cream goodness (and maybe bananas) AND ham- as big as my pancake. looks like she took only 3 bites of her double stacked pancake, too. i would say that i ate almost half. Êso maybe i ate 1/3 of it. Êi dont know, but honestly, it was more than what i just described above. Ê i recommend checking this off your "to do" list, just to say you've tried it. SHARE your plate.

I've been meaning to write this review for like 2 weeks. ÊOk, we went here for Sunday brunch a couple of weeks ago. ÊAs usual on Sundays, there was a wait for a table. ÊIt seemed like a lot of people were waiting but I think we only waited like 20-30 min for our table. Ê Ok I am all for outdoor sidewalk seating, but NOT HERE. ÊEveryone who is waiting for tables are waiting like right next to your table. ÊStaring at you probably. ÊJudging your choice of brunch plate. ÊThere is no awning or umbrellas or anything so it seems like sitting outside would be really awkward. ÊAnd there's nothing to look at, anyway. ÊExcept the people waiting for their table. ÊAnd for those of you waiting for your table: WAIT AT THE DGA. ÊNobody wants you staring at them while they're eating and the guy coming to get people comes out to the DGA, too, you do not have to be standing right at the door. Anyway. ÊThat said, we got an AWESOME table. ÊWe got a booth at the back of the restaurant (not the big one, the one in front of it, there were only three of us). ÊGREAT table. ÊPrivate, no one walking by us and around us all the time like at the regular tables. ÊUgh. Ê Anyway our waiter was called Trotter and he was great! ÊTo start we all ordered mimosas, which he told us were two for one at $7.50 each. ÊNow, I am a champion bottomless mimosa drinker so I was bummed at the lack of bottomless mimosas on the menu. ÊHowever, we then discovered you can order PITCHERS of mimosas. ÊSo we asked for a pitcher and if he could just give us one more regular mimosa for a total of four and then charge us for two 2-for-1's. ÊInstead of that, he didn't charge us for them at all and just brought us the pitcher. ÊHe said he hadn't suggested it because it is ALSO 2-for-1 and we would have to drink two huge pitchers of mimosas. ÊWe were like..."AND....??" ÊSo the pitcher is like $35 but it's two for one so between the three of us it was cheaper than bottomless mimosas. ÊAnd it was a lot of mimosa. ÊAlthough to be honest we probably could have killed another pitcher or two, but not for another 35 bucks. ÊAnd we are big drinkers. We must have sat there for like three hours. ÊThe Griddle is a BUSY place, especially on Sundays. ÊTrotter could have turned over our table like 4x in the time we were there, and yet he never, EVER pressured us to hurry up or anything. ÊIn fact, he didn't even bother us unless he saw we needed something or was bringing actual food. ÊIn fact, he saw when we finished our first pitcher and then just brought us another one without a wait or a word. ÊAWESOME. ÊWe tipped him well. Two of us got huevos rancheros and one got an omelette that had pretty much the same stuff in it. ÊThen my one friend ordered a red velvet pancake for dessert, and it IS dessert, my friends. ÊHonestly the huevos rancheros weren't that interesting. ÊI dunno what it was about them but they were honestly forgettable. ÊBut the rest of the experience was so good I still give the place 4 stars.

other than their obscenely large portions, griddle cafe was just average...it's definitely one of those trendy spots that people rave about, but the food doesn't live up to it's hype the waiter recommended the french toast as a first-timer at griddle cafe, but i wasn't so impressed. i've been able to make better french toast since i was in 5th grade and let me tell you, 5th grade was a lifetime ago!

this place used to be my favorite go-to place for a nice hearty breakfast. Êhowever, when i came to eat here with a girlfriend yesterday, it was an uncomfortable experience to say the least. we got there around 8 and were seated fairly quickly. Êthere was only one waiter so it took a while for him to come take our order, which is totally fine. Êa few minutes later, we hear this yelling match going on between our waiter ( i'll call him bob) and another waiter that had just walked in. Êapparently he was late him, so bob walked over to him and the shouting match had begun. i understand that you're frustrated that your coworker was late and you have to carry the burdens of all the tables, but it was embarassing to watch them argue in front of all us. Êas the place was getting busier, those two could not stop arguing. Êas the food was coming out, you could hear them still going at it in the kitchen and in the back of the restaurant. Ê not once did bob come by our table during our stay. Êwhen observing the other tables, he had not been by their tables either. Êwe had to flag down other waiters to get water and our bill. i most likely will not come by as often, but when i get a craving for the peanut bubba crunchy french toast, i'll be here :)

I ordered the Huevos Rancheros and i'm convinced it was the worst item on the menu compared to all the things other people ordered. Don't order huevos here. it had a funny can taste. But this place was sooo happening on a Sunday afternoon. Pancakes looked huge. literally too much dough. I like my pancakes thin. these were thick ones... five or six of them layered on top of each other...I didn't get to try them but the chocolate one looked pretty good. I got to taste the french toast and it was nom nom. the king of the hour, though, was the pomodoro omelette with basil and parmesan. Another point worthy of mention is the individual brew coffees. We sat outside in the early afternoon. this place is a keeper. wait was worth it. I shall come back for more.

My bf and I rode our motorcycles over here for breakfast. ÊWe read the great reviews on Yelp, and we have a group of friends who tried this place. ÊAlthough I normally don't wait to be seated (because I'm impatient, not because I'm Mr. Big Shot, because I'm not), at least I was prepared for the 40-minute wait. ÊThe host was very comical to watch, but turned out to be pretty cool. ÊThe wait was definitely worth it, and I don't say that often. ÊSteve ordered the banana pancakes, and I had the Nutella French toast sprinkled with powdered sugar and drizzled with chocolate. ÊI requested bananas on mine. ÊThey were very accommodating. ÊWOW!!! ÊOMG!!!! ÊAmazing. ÊGreat service and we had fantastic brekkies! ÊI hope we come back.

Why is everything so huge? Ê That was the last question I asked myself after seeing all the photos after our meal. Ê This place was not bad at all. Ê Definitely a good place for groups, brick interior and loud. Ê Good loud. Ê In the end, I was glad that we had a big group. Ê It was nice to be able to try a lot of their large portion style menu. Ê Parking was a bit of a challenge. ÊIt was a sunny Saturday morning so we're not the only ones who had the great idea to check out Griddle Cafe. Ê We waited outside for 45 minutes with a party of 5, host was very vocal about the sidewalk waiting rules and I made sure to keep an eye on the list. I felt bad for the folks that got seated outside. ÊNot really a pretty sight when they serve you with your humongous meal and the rest of the crowd is watching like a hawk if you can clean-off your plate. Ê Awkward. Ê I thought, it was to our advantage that we had a larger party and somehow got seated in a nice cozy corner by the entrance with comfy leather upholstery and a large counter. ÊIt's obvious at this point that we were starting to think of the large portions to be our main challenge. Ê In ordering, I reminded everyone to keep in mind that you don't have to get the full portion. The reviews did say that you can order one instead of a stack of pancakes. French press coffees were served first and our meals came about 15-20 minutes later. Ê Uh, so yeah. Ê These portions look even bigger when the plates are in front of you. Ê(Think... actual size.) Yep, we got our take home boxes ready and enjoyed the meal as much as possible for the time being. Ê My order from the menu was the Tequila Sunrise. For the life of me, I can't remember the rest of the items...but that ranchero sauce with tequila is nothing like I've tasted before. Ê It was GOOD. I wouldn't consider this your Mama and Papa's typical huevos rancheros, Êthe tequila in that sauce leaves you with a clean taste. Not that greasy breakfast feeling. Before I miss it, there's a reason why it's third on the list. Ê A Time To Love--- a freagin' amazing pancake! Ê I felt bad that I didn't get to eat much of this when it was served warm in front me. Ê Streusel, butterscotch chip and caramel....just linger on that. Ê (And try saying it five times.)

Most of the portions that I saw were huge. ÊI ordered Black Magic (Oreo pancakes) and a side of fruit and I tried the Peanut Bubba french toast. ÊThey both were so good! ÊNext time I know to share though, the portions I took home filled the box to its max. ÊIt was busy when I came but it didn't take that long to get a table.

I went to the Griddle Cafe with my sister in an attempt to find a new breakfast/brunch place and as soon as she saw a "red velvet pancake" advertised, it was a done deal. I loved the menu, the pancake and french toast options are amazing (there was one with peanut butter and chocolate on it, any kind of fruit you can imagine, it was mouth-watering). I got steak tacos ( I was in the lunch mood) and she got the red velvet pancake. My tacos were spicy and good, served with an overflowing plate of chips and salsa, but her pancake took the spotlight. It was the size of a plate, with cream cheese icing and a chocolate crumble on top, absolutely the best red-velvet I've ever tried, my sister was in heaven! ÊWe accompanied all of it with a pot of french-press coffee that was great. It was a great dining experience. The waiters all seemed harried despite it not being crazy ( I have a feeling they work them into the ground, maxing out their tables till the minute they close) but the food made up for it. Be prepared to wait, we lucked out and got sat right away cuz we were there on a Tuesday mid-morning. I've gone by on weekends and the crowd looks 50 people strong. I've run in on a Thursday afternoon right at noon and there were hour waits, testy people getting hungrier by the minute. My rating would've been a lot higher had I not attempted to get a gift certficiate from them. I physically stopped by on a Thursday(I needed it by the next Monday), was ushered to the back of the place to talk to someone who said they didn't have access to the gift certificates, threw a business card at me and told me to email. After emailing back and forth with someone from the place, and offering to come down before my workdays to pick it up, they weren't able to accomodate me in a span of 5 days! Evidently there is one person that works here that has the one key to the office which holds the gift certificates, and she comes in for very limited hours. I find it hard to understand why a place makes it so hard for customers to show loyalty and pretty much throw them large amounts of money! We ended up having to go somewhere else, so whatever you do, don't try and get a gift certificate from the Griddle Cafe!!

This place is a bit overhyped because of the size of the pancakes which are as about as big as a vinyl record ,i personally would rather have quality over quantity,the food looks alot better then it actually is,not saying its bad ,its just okay, I had the banana nana pancakes and the ÊChicago omelet Ê, wife had the nuttella french toast, which basically just taste like nuttella on some bread,not that theres anything wrong with that!overall with the long waits and the mediocre food i would not return.

lets be honest, size matters at the griddle cafe. Ê size of the restaurant is small and intimate to create a warm/chatty environment size of the pancakes and entrees are enough to feed a whole country size of the servers can only be described as fit and perfect size of the tables are just big enough to fill with your delicious breakfast size of the condiments are big enough to satisfy my condiment-happy-hands size of the line is too long, but you just gotta tough it out for satisfying breakfast food size of the work force? Êlarge. Êwell staffed and well manned to provide good service size of my stomach comes out of the griddle cafe feeling obese every time. Êno shame when opting for pancakes, think with your head not with your stomach. Êi've always been tricked into ordering the double stack instead of the single because of the price :( Êbut i never finish more than 1/4 of the double stack :( Ê oh, good luck with trying to find parking spots in the back of the restaurant at rite-aid, it's like playing a fierce game of musical chair. Ê great service. Êlast time they accidentally skipped our party on the list but they apologized to us by giving us free mimosa. Êof course, apology accepted :) outdoor seatings (minimal) are dog friendly. Êbring your pooch to brunch while people in line stare at you in envious shades of green! Êthe servers even give doggies their own water bowl.

Underwhelming experience. I heard so many positive things about this place through a friend so we went...and my expectations were high. The wait staff weren't terribly attentive with a general attitude of disinterest in their customers. The food was "ok" nothing that separated it from better diner and breakfast places in this city. There IS a wait, but the place is popular, so expect that on the day that you go. Worth a try for the experience.

Ê i'll also say either i didn't order the right thing, or this place is way overrated. Êwe shared the breakfast tacos and the french toast w/nutella. Ê(i loved the idea of getting to have something savory and something sweet.) Êwe didn't get the mom's french toast because my friend had already had them, and i wanted him to be able to try something different. Êthe tacos (all egg...no meat) were not bad after adding hot sauce. Êthe french toast was a bit sweet.

So my friend took me to this place at around 2 to eat breakfast and this place was packed! So I guess that is a good sign. -Our server was really really cute and so was this other dude, so kudos for having hot guys as waiters. - I ordered a baked potato omelette, stuffed with "griddle potatoes" which were crunchy, scallions, and loads of sour cream and it was delicious! So far the best omelette I have ever had but get the sour cream on the side cuz it was way too much for me. ÊPrice was 10 bucks with a side order of either fruit, cottage cheese, or potatoes and it comes toast. Decent price. - My friends got pancakes, I think it was the streusel pancake. It was one huge pancake with cinnamon and brown sugar on the top and man it was so good. It was sweet without the syrup so don't put a lot maple syrup on top. Oh and when you order pancakes make sure you ask for a short stack because their normal pancakes are like 5 huge ones!!!!! So you can be a pig and still gain weight with one huge one. -So my last verdict: I like cici's cafe pancakes more because theyr'e fluffier. I really want to try the french toast here, looks amazing!!

Dear Griddle Cafe, I hate you. ÊEver since I tasted your delightfully fluffy french toast, aka the best french toast in the world, I have been completely unsatisfied by any other restaurant serving breakfast/brunchy type foods. ÊEven your slightly buttery scrambled eggs, cooked to just the proper doneness, make other scrambled eggs seem ordinary in comparision. ÊHow am I ever supposed to enjoy french toast or scrambled eggs at other establishments ever again!?!?? ÊAnd why must your waits be so very very long when I need the goodness from your kitchen in my belly now?!?!? ÊNo, I'm sorry delightful host Sir Alex, not in 30 minutes, NOW! ÊAnd then you go and serve my green tea in a big fat tea pot, which you know I love because I have a large appetite for tea beverages, and one cup is never ever enough. ÊThanks. ÊA whole freaking lot. ÊDid I mention the attractiveness and pleasant demeanor of your waiters???! ÊYes, I do realize that they are hoping to land a role in the next TV pilot, but did you have to make them so gosh darn cute and agreeable, even when I have special requests like "no butter please", and Ê"can I get a side of strawberries?" ÊIt is really very evil of you to tempt me with the miracle that is your perfectly powder sugared frenchy toast AND your hunky lads. ÊI so wish I could give you less than 5 stars, but the food.... oh the food... it's just so very very good. ÊGosh darn you, Miss Griddle, and your little waiters too!!!! Sincerely, Diana "I have a fever, and the only prescription is more french toast!" H. P.S. Now that I have sampled your bacon (7/1/07), I am officially surrendering the tautiness of my butt and thighs to the sword of your strips of Wilbur. ÊMy arteries thank you for ruining any chance that I will ever become a vegetarian. Ê(If you are curious as to what it sounds like when my arteries attempt to speak, it sounds something like, "glurg, glurg, glurg... frmp.")

The Griddle is another local haunt that survives off of trendy hype and fails to serve up much substance to warrant its high regard and reputation. ÊIt becomes readily apparent once inside, that between the lengthy wait, typical Hollywood clientele, and mediocre service this establishment is far more about the "see and be seen" scene than any gastronomical experience. ÊYes, as many have noted, the portions are huge, but to be plainly honest the food just isn't that good. Sadly, although I'm a breakfast fiend and easily pleased by standard caf fare, in a handful of times here I failed to find an item on the menu that really blew me away. ÊThe best of the bunch was the "Sow Your Oats" pancakes; an enormous stack of 3 hotcakes containing a tasty blend of honey, cinnamon, and rolled oats. ÊDue to the insane size I highly recommend sharing the pancakes and splitting another order with your dining companions to get some variety. ÊBeing a big fan of omelets and scrambles, another time I gave the "Chicago Charlie's Scramble" a go, and while it looks great on paper, when presented on a plate it failed to deliver on any of it's presumed promise. ÊBreakfast burritos are also a favorite of mine, combining two of my most sacred loves; breakfast and burritos. ÊLike sex and sleep wrapped in a tortilla but better. ÊAnyhow, the Griddle's take on this edible Holy Grail, dubbed the "Caballero", is an abomination of epic proportions. ÊSomewhere the chemistry between the chicken chorizo, potatoes, and green chiles went terribly wrong, resulting in a heaping mass of unpalatable nastiness, the soul of which not even the sour cream and guac could save. ÊVery disappointing. I would imagine with well over 300 reviews, a 4-star rating, and the occasional obscene wait to be seated that the Griddle is doing something right, but for what it's worth I just don't see it. ÊFortunately it's not the only game in town, and there are several other preferred options for me to get my breakfast/brunch fix.

i sayyyy 3.5....but i guess i'll give it the benefit of the doubt with a 4 star! so i bookmarked this and have been trying to come here forever and some. either we woke up to late, i got sick, or it was rainin and i don't care for stepping out in the rain let alone to DRIVE all the way to LA for some breakfast even if the pancakes look FAN TA BU LOUS!!!!!!!!!! so yday nite i politely threatened the boyfriend to take me here friday for breakfast and he agreed. therefore we starved ourselves last nite and this mornin but to my crap luck i was stuck in traffic and had to run some lame errands that we didnt GET to griddle till 2pm =( i was a MISERABLE brat by this time and the hunger was literally takin over me. so we drive down sunset a loooooong way down then pull into a little street OOPSies wrong one so we get back out and turn right where rite aid is and park in that lot for free! lotsa spaces. we walk in through the back hallway and pass some private room seatin or whatnot then we get to the dining area. they tell us to walk to the front of the restuarant to be seated...OK??? so we walk there and then we are told to walk back to the booth right where we originally waited..is this some game they're playing? hahaha the decor is laid back very vintage-y. we check out the menu and i am searching because the #1 REASON why i bookmarked and wanted SOOOOOO bad to come to griddle is because of the BOYSENBERRY PANCAKES!! and hard as i LOOOK and i scan multiple times front back on ALL pages even lunch and eggs i still cant find it. to my LUCK they NO LONGER SERVE BOYSENBERRY PANCKES!!!!!!!

Reasons why my ass is fat . Oh, let me count the ways. 1.Peanut Bubba Crunchy French toast. 2. "Some like it HOT" scramble + cheese bread 3.Poached y Papas Benedict 4. Muscle bound scramble It was a lovely Friday afternoon and we finally arrived to Griddle cafe with eyes bigger than our stomachs. We've done starved ourselves for this historic moment! Finally, a chance to try one of my Los Angeles bookmarked brunch spots! You could only imagine how ecstatic i was! The wait was only 15 minutes and we brought back to a "special" area that was a mixture of a dungeon + pimp's hangout; it was nice nonetheless. As we perched ourselves onto the huge gray couch, we were briskly greeted by our server. Sah-weet! The little bubble of joy started us off with their french press coffee (medium and dark roast). The food was quick and portions were, indeed, huge. At the end of the meal, i was left vomiting nothing but lascivious praise: Oh, Griddle baby, hubba, hubba for you peanut Bubba; keep it hot, steamy hot, and a final innuendo, you could poach my papas with your Benedict, any day. UH huh. this is love.

I finally made me way here! ÊCame late on a Saturday (I think) (maybe a Sunday...) and still had to wait almost 20 minutes for a table. ÊPlace was packed! ÊI got coffee--nice touch with the individual french presses and the multiple options on coffee types--and the banana pancakes. ÊThey were very good! ÊBacon was very good! ÊEverything was perfectly acceptable--but if the only thing that separates this place from every other place that serves breakfast in LA is that you have to take your pancake leftovers with you because you couldn't possible eat them, it isn't enough for me. ÊI probably won't make this place a habit.

I went to Griddle Cafe for a lazy sunday breakfast yesterday at 3 PM. The place was packed and my friend and I had to wait 20 minutes for a table. Luckily there was room at the counter so we just sat there instead. I ordered the Hear Me Roar Pancake, and my friend got the Banana Nut Pancake. After about 20 minutes, our food arrived. At first sight, my jaw literally dropped to the floor. There were 3 HUGEEEE pancakes on my plate with strawberries in them and frosted flakes on top. There was also whipped cream and powdered sugar for the extra flavor. It took me a few minutes to figure out how to eat it properly. I didn't know where to start! As soon as I cut into the pancakes, the warm aroma of fresh flapjack goodness reached my nose and I was in heaven. I began to devour this beast of a breakfast and savored every flavorful bite. When I came back down from this pancake high, I realized that I had barely eaten 1/4th of the food and was completely full! I don't know how anyone can finish these, they are just too big. When the waiter came by I asked him for a to-go box, and I also asked him if anyone has ever finished eating all their pancakes and he replied "Yeah, I've seen it a couple times". I also ordered some lemonade which is really good, but not cold enough (at least there were free refills). They had a couple TV's on the walls each on a different channel. One was showing golf (boooorrrrinnggggg), one was tuned to CNN, and the other one was showing old cartoons. The overall vibe of this place is kinda hectic since it gets really crowded, but that shouldn't stop anyone from enjoying the delicious pancakes. Griddle Cafe is officially my new favorite breakfast spot. The Pancakes were tasty, the prices were great ($10 for 3 huge pancakes) and the atmosphere is fun. I think everyone should have breakfast here at least once in their lifetime.

oh griddle cafe. i hate that i love you so much. warning. the portions are ridiculously over the top. i *highly* recommend sharing one dish. an order of pancakes is 3 dinner plate sized pancakes. and an egg scramble is a small iron skillet full of eggs, meats, cheeses, etc. if you can eat the whole thing by yourself i worry for you. i know it can be hard to stop eating pure deliciousness, but put the fork down and take some leftovers home! i often find it hard to decide on sweet or savory for breakfast. but when i come to the griddle, i always go with sweet. and a side of bacon. seriously, i think they have the best bacon in LA. this coming from an on again off again vegetarian. my biggest complaint is how packed it is. it can be hard to navigate around to your table or bathroom. and it can get really loud in there. that being said, i'm always surprised at how attentive the staff is. seriously one of the best restaurant staff in LA. and if you hate the wait. go on a weekday. if you're in LA my guess is you're either visiting or you work freelance. so stop going in on saturdays and sundays and stop complaining.

Man this place is great 100% food satisfaction!!!!!!! I was a bit down after I had to wait over 1hr on a sunday for a seat. But I was keeping positive because of the great reviews. Well, This place is alot about great food and loads of it. We ordered the creme ala creme which are 2 huge french toast with graham craker crust and a cream that taste just like cheesecake, we ordered the chicago eggs which comes in a whole plate amount with sausage,bacon,onion,green/red bell peppers and cheese with a side of garlic bread, and The Golden Ticket which is 3 huge ass pancakes with banana, walnuts, cinnamon and whip cream. OMG! Everything taste so great and it was alot to go around and take home. The service is great inside. They also sell burgers and Chili which that will be my next mession over there.

Worth driving all the way from Costa Mesa just to have breakfast here. ÊThe pancakes are legendary. ÊThe french toast is to die for. ÊThe omelettes are spectacular. ÊThey use only top-of-the-line ingredients in everything on the menu, and you can definitely taste the difference. My last visit was to meet my friend and former co-worker Andrew D. for a sort of "goodbye" breakfast, as he was moving up to the Bay Area the following week. ÊWe each had both french toast and an omelette (I know, total gluttony, but it was worth it). ÊBetween the two of us we had the peanut bubba french toast (oh god, it's like having a giant butterfinger bar for breakfast, deeelicious), and a cheesecake french toast which doesn't seem to be on the menu, at least not the online version, but Andrew's down with the owner so maybe they made it special. ÊHowever, the cheesecake french toast was insanely good (it tasted like, well, cheesecake on toast), so if you go and don't see it on the menu try asking for it anyway, I guarantee you won't be disappointed. ÊAndrew also had the chili "my soul" omelette and I had the cobb omelette. ÊBoth were amazing, the perfect balance of egg and filling, and the eggs were perfectly cooked - fluffy and yellow and not overdone in the least (which is my complaint about most restaurant-made omelettes). Ê I wish I lived closer, I'd come here all the time. ÊThen again, if that were the case I'd probably weigh an extra 200 pounds and need, like, quadruple bypass surgery once a week, so maybe it's better that I stay far away. P.S. We came here on a weekday morning so there was no line, but if you come here on a Saturday or Sunday be prepared to wait a while. ÊThat's my one and only complaint about the Griddle, the often lengthy wait for a table, but the food is definitely worth it.

Probably 4.5 stars. Portions are huge. You can easily share a stack of pancakes between 2 people and still may not be able to eat it all. A stack is 3 huge pancakes, a short stack is 2 and I say some people order a single pancake. We ordered a "short" stack of the "The Golden Ticket" pancakes - brown sugar baked bananas cooked inside buttermilk batter filled with caramel, walnuts and streusel. They are topped with whipped cream, caramel and streusel. They were delicious! I didn't need any syrup since all the ingredients made the pancakes themselves quite sweet. I like the occasional large pieces of banana and walnuts. We couldn't even come close to finishing the short stack between two of us. We also ordered the "Apple Cobbler" french toast - apple bread rolled in a cinnamon crunch batter, served with baked cinnamon apples. I actually started out eating these and was able to polish off one of two pieces myself. Again, delicious! I loved the crunch that the batter gave to the bread. I also enjoyed the apples on the side. Again, no need for syrup since the dish is sweet by itself. I also tried french press coffee for the 1st time. I really enjoyed it since the coffee gets nice and dark with a bold flavor.

ÊA year filled with Peanut Bubba French Toast, The Golden Ticket, Banana Nana, Teacher's Pet, Black Magic, Hear Me Roar, and of course my favorite, Cheesecake French Toast.. amongst other sweet items I've fallen for. ÊThe French fries are pretty darn good, as well. ÊI can't help myself. ÊI adore the Griddle. ÊIt will always be my amour when it comes to Sunday brunch.

Looking for a place to eat your own body weight in? Looking for a sugar high that 4 red bulls just cant give you? Looking for a hole in the wall that serves you just about everything that can fit in that hole? Looking for outrageous Breakfast items that make you say, wow? Looking to gain some of that weight before summer is here? Then you have come to the right place, my friend! Came here on a Saturday afternoon, 12pm and waited in line for about 30 minutes, got seated by a real nice guy and was sat at the bar. Perfect spot in my opinion! You have the view of the kitchen and a birds eye view of the whole place! FOOD: like it? then you'll love it here their specialties is breakfast, and the boy they can really make it! the guy in the back that is in charge of the egg entrees is supper quick and amazing to watch. he is always cooking at least two or three things at once while he still has time to serve. AMAZING... the servers are really good looking and its amazing to me that they can keep in shape in this place...Service is quick and they are on top of who's coming in and whose going out...a must when this place is packed from opening to close....they have an arrange of choices and you can get an idea of what you want once you walk in, pancakes are bigger then the plates and you can get either one, two or three....they have a hand full of butter on them (if you get original) or a pound full of whatever you get as a topping! What did i get, you ask? Well, i got the waffles and a side order of the griddle potatoes, and my boyfriend got the french toast. HUGE HUGE HUGE He got two french toasts with a mountain high blob of butter and powdered sugar. and i got a plate sized waffle with a huge blob of tasty butter and powder sugar everywhere. The griddle styled potatoes were supper yummy and had thing sliced pieces of onion in it to add flavor, Damn near perfect i say! The french toast was one of my boyfriends top best after he tried those and ate everything off his plate. The waffle was the best tasting waffle i have ever had, and the syrup they serve here is real. (what is real you as? whats the difference from my letgo my eggo waffle syrup i buy for 3 bucks?) EVERYTHING, real syrup is actually very thin and watery, its real sugar and actual juice from the syrup trees and a real bottle of that stuff can cost you about 10 bucks. So i was supper surprised they had the stuff! anyway back to my favorite part: FOOD it was excellent, the potatoes were blasting with flavor and the waffle was cooked perfectly. It didn't get all mushy after i added the syrup and it wasn't too crispy (overcooked) it was just perfect. they serve pancakes, waffles, eggs. omelets, special eggs, egg whites, bacon-sausage, burgers, fries, burritos, pretty much a one stop for all you can imagine! Overall: This place gets packed, and on the weekends its worse, you get a booth if your more than a group of 4, but your wait is just a tad longer. the servers don't rush you, even though this place is smothered with hungry people out front (i like to think this is how zombies would react if it were brains being served rather then pancakes) the service is nice and genuine, the food is cooked up pretty quick, but still cooked perfectly and presented very well and the place is one of a kind. CONS: the place is cramped! expect a a long wait....Good luck with finding a spot to park...your elbow to elbow with random people.....if you cant eat all your pancakes your laughed at....(depends on your server and what mood they are in...lol) This place is a must try if you love breakfast, hell even if you just love food its a Êmust try! Portions are big enough to share and i always recommend that....Also you can take home everything you don't eat, so don't feel too bad you big baby! enjoy, tee hee

I can't believe I'm going to say this, as a jaded and suspicious San Franciscan who has a low tolerance for bruch lines: worth the wait, even the half hour over what they quoted us. So much food, and so good. We shared the "Yellow Brick Road" pancakes, butterscotch walnut caramel. Veggie burger and fries were excellent, loved the kale ruffage so much that I didn't even mind that they don't have pickles, which is usually a dealbreaker for me. Also appreciated the variety of hot sauces at our disposal. Yumtown.

Amazing food! We went on a Friday mid-morning and the wait was non-existent. I have heard that on the weekends it can be a little long. The coffee was served in a french press (awesome and so much better than coffee that has been sitting in a pot for a while). I had the Mounds pancakes (I asked for one....didn't think I could handle 3). It was like having dessert for breakfast. I will most definitely be going back to try some of the other items on the menu. The service was amazing and spot on!!

two weeks ago i needed a huge break from a stressful month, so i decided to take the bf to griddle cafe. we got there at about 9AM, and parked in the Rite Aid parking lot and walked through the back door of Griddle Cafe. the place was probably less than half full which i was surprised. we were quickly greeted and since it was a nice day, we decided to sit outside. i ordered a french press coffee and the bf ordered an ice tea. the french press came in a press that probably had about 3 or 4 cups worth of coffee in it, and you can still get free refills! just wait about 3 minutes, and you got your fresh coffee right at the table! :) i ordered Mom's French Toast this time and wanted the bf to get some pancakes because i knew it would be something he'd like, but he decided to get Chicago's Charlie Scramble, which had italian sausage, potatoes, bacon, bell peppers, mozz cheese, garlic, basil and onions. it was really tasty! it even came with a side of garlic bread. it was so buttery and garlicy. mmm and the french toast was soooo good! it was so moist and "meaty". and when you eat that one piece that had the huge ass glob of butter on top... oh man. its delicious. the waitress also suggested that a side of bacon goes really well with the french toast. oh yes. the bacon was super thick and bacony delicious. Ê we are definitely coming back again, so the bf can try some pancakes. i want to try a diff kind of french toast. i always think of the line in 40 year old virgin when that drunk girl says "im f-ing huuungry! i want some frEAANCH toast!!" hahaha

Walter, myself and our girlfriend (whom we're trying to convince to join YELP) Erica went out for brunch this morning. ÊThe past few times, we'd gone to the Alhambra IHOP. This morning, we were feeling a little different. So, we thought we'd try some place new. I'd been talking about the Griddle Cafe a while ago, and how I wanted to go there to check it out sometime. So, we took a ride down Sunset to the Griddle!! We were shocked. ÊThis place looks jam packed and kinda small. To our surprise, there is a lot of space in the back. ÊWe got lucky and got the room with the SOFA!! Awesome, considering each of us needed naps after TRYING to devour our meals. There are before and after pix, if you look closely!! Anyway, the sofa room is so nice. The sofa has tons of over sized, plush grey toss pillows, lit with primarily natural light from the sky light above. I thought that was pretty!! The light was real nice, pleasant and not jaring. PERFECT (since last night was a crazy night at the LITTLE ROCK in Tarzana, CA) Aside from the room we had, we had tons of food. We thought, it's breakfast, we'll do it BIG. We had no idea that doing it BIG would mean doing it HUGE!!! *(Christina forgot what she'd read in the reviews and we didn't bother to look at other people's plates as we walked in.) That's why we ordered four different things. My pancakes were tasty, drizzled with boysenberry juices, dusted with their magic powdered sugar, and prepared with boysenberries right in the pancakes. ÊThere was NO need for syrup. The natural juices and sugar from the boysenberry fruit, itself, was just enough! Walter's peanut butter french toast was amazing. There were NUTTER BUTTER crumbles on top, not to mention icing and powdered sugar. ÊWhen we asked Sergio about them, he said that they rocked! He's the one who mentioned the nutter butter factor. ÊThat's what sold it! Walter LOVES nutter butter. Without the icing was better, not as sweet and still crunchy! Erica's apple cobbler french toast was amazing too. It is made with some super tasty apple bread. ÊI thought that there were nuts in the bread, but I was wrong. The apple cinnamon apples, like pie filling, on the side were perfect. You can't eat to much of that pie filling with this french toast. There's no need, but also, it'd be too sweet. Another thing we liked about breakfast this morning is that the coffee was refillable via french press. I thought that was awesome. Well, it impressed me anyways. Yippee! The omelette we had was so good. I'm a fan of garlic but not usually this much garlic will be appealing to me. Today was time for a change, something new, something different. The omelette was packed full of cheese, garlic, onions, and fresh tomatoes. Typically, it comes with basil too but I am allergic. SORRY!! It was so good just like this though. If there were one person that I could think of who would love this omelette, it would have to be my MOMMY. So, Walter and I think we should take her out for breakfast sometime. Too bad it's horribly bad for DADDY. Guess we'll have to go while he's out on his own. haha Take a look at our pictures. LOVED IT!! Service was awesome and the food was HuGe! total cost: $47.95 (including tax, w/o tip) ASK FOR THE SOFA in the BACK!!

Hands down the best french toast in town. It is just amazing! Although the limited time hot chocolate french toast wasn't as good as the ones on the regular menu, it was still worth the try. The one star is for the long wait. If you want to go on a weekend, make sure to go either really early or after 2:30, otherwise you are almost guaranteed with an at least 45 mins wait. ÊThe service in general was good, but i don't like how this place has become so touristy. Overall i would definitely go back every so often, just not during the rush hour.

ok - so they serve really GIANT yummy dessert-like pancakes and breakfast burritos the size of our governator's forearm but be warned: you're going to have to stand outside with all the faux hawks and ed hardy hats for close to an hour. *also* not sure if anyone else has noticed the giant painting of the sad, teary african eyes looking down on all the excess below and wondered to themselves why there are three pancakes the size of hubcaps, smothered in caramel and whipped cream in front of them when everyone knows goddamn-well that 60% of said dish is going to end up in the dumpster. HOWEVER, it has graciously been pointed out to me that they *do* have 'to go' containers here, so if you trust yourself to finish your plate in 1-100 sittings, then the food is well worth the price.

I love it because you KNOW you're getting freshly brewed coffee that way. Our server was super nice. They have a cute little bar set up. My only warning is... bring a sweater! They blast the AC soooo high! I was hugging my coffee cup the whole time. Be prepared to FEAST!

The Griddle Cafe's flapjacks are a worth while contributor to the low-carb diet's demise. Irresistible with their melt-in-your-mouth fluffiness, Griddle's specialties have catchy names and toppings to make hotcakes even more delicious. Hair-of-the-dog types will appreciate Saturday Morning Fever, 'jacks with Kahlua and Bailey's blended into the batter, while others can play lapdog to their sweet tooths with Black Magic, a stack of pancakes with Oreo crumbs mixed in the batter. Breakfast is served all day (and a good thing too, because on weekends the line often stretches out the door); those with a spicy craving can opt for the 4 to 6 chili varieties offered at lunch or go low-carb (this time, anyway) with Griddle's delish variation on the chopped salad. A blues soundtrack contradicts the party in your mouth.

I love this place. ÊThe food is never disappointing, the menu has a million options for whatever you may be in the mood for, the prices are more than fair. ÊThe wait on weekends can be brutal, but worth it. ÊThey serve their eggs benedict over fried potato skins (pretty innovative!) and their portions are huge!

Luscious. ÊSexy. ÊPleasingly moist. ÊThese aren't words that typically come to mind when describing french toast but at the Griddle Cafe they don't serve breakfast, they serve food porn. Being forewarned about the gnarly line, my friend and I steeled ourselves for the worst when we woke up late on Sunday and got there at 10:30AM, easily one of the worst times to get Sunday brunch. Ê We were told it'd be 20 minutes, we got seated in 5 so I think its hit or miss with the wait, sorry haters! ÊOnce seated, we got down to business and perused their gigantic menu. ÊHm....pancakes smothered with bananas, caramel, and walnuts? ÊSlices of graham-cracker encrusted french toast coddling a cheesecake filling? ÊThe option of having chili on oh I don't know everything? ÊBoth breakfast and lunch served all day?! ÊIf this wasn't a breakfast spot made for stoners, I don't know what is. Ê Everything sounded delicious but I had to go for the french toast; there was so much written about it on Yelp and I do like a good french toast but have been sorely disappointed in the past so this was an opportunity for that breakfast standby to redeem itself. ÊFrench toast seems like an easy feat: Êdip bread in egg batter and fry on the griddle. ÊNo matter that its a simple recipe, perfection is still elusive. ÊMy french toast was hitting all the high notes: Êdelicious bread perhaps Hawaiian sweet bread, challah, or brioche sliced thick; a not too sweet egg batter; and a lovely consistency, fried a bit hard on the outside and just moist enough inside. ÊSoggy french toast is the nast, but the saving grace is the thickness of the bread and what I can only guess must be a brief skinny dip into the batter that gives it that slight puff to make it airy but doesn't weigh it down with liquid. ÊBonus that it was gigantic, topped with a slowly melting dollop of salted butter and a light dusting of powdered sugar before I drowned it in real maple syrup. Ê My friend ordered the Poached and Papas, your basic eggs benny but instead of an English muffin sopping up their lovely hollandaise, the benedict is paired perfectly with their hollowed out potato skins. ÊThe potatoes skins are the perfect vehicle to scoop hollandaise straight off the plate, load it up with benny fixings, and devour it all in one bite. ÊWell maybe 3 or 4 bites but if you've got those kind of skills, you go ahead on. ÊOn the side we split an order of thick cut bacon. ÊMaybe its the Filipino in me, but I quite literally jones for crispy pork especially if its just a lil burned. ÊThe bacon here is nearly perfect. ÊFor the most part its crisp, not too fatty, and well hell what's wrong with thick cut bacon? ÊTop it off, my friend had the french press which he said wasn't bad while I got the party started with a Bloody Mary. ÊMy Bloody Mary was meh, I've had better, I like mine spicy and more like vodka with a splash of Bloody Mary mix but I did appreciate the refreshing cucumber slice. Based on the food alone I'd keep the Griddle Cafe at a 3.5 but they definitely earn that half star with their abundance of eye candy. ÊYou could get whiplash with the servers that work there and thank you whoever chose the thinner cotton T-shirts for your swag. ÊThe crowd is a nice mix, not too Hollyweird and not too touristy. If I was in LA again, I wouldn't definitely say I'd come here but I would keep it on deck. ÊAnd bring a neck brace if you decide to go, you can thank me later!

decided to come here for breakfast before starting our day of site-seeing. Êplace is crackin, there was a 40 minute wait. ordered the chicago charlies scramble and a regular orange juice. charlies scramble consisted of big chunks of italian sausage, whole cloves of roasted garlic, potatos, onions, bell peppers, bacon, and mozzarella cheese. served with garlic bread, YUM. im sure my breath was kickin after that, but who cares cuz it was good. portions are huge here, i couldnt finish my plate (i usually do!). the guy next to me ordered some gigantic pancakes bigger than my head. stacked 3 high, i would have been amazed if he finished it all himself, but he shared with 2 friends and they still couldnt finish it all. wish this place was in sf so i could come back soon. staff is very friendly, and funny. one of the guys was moving a chair, accidently bumps me and says "oh sorry, dont mind me im talking to myself. this wont work, no it wont work." comes back and bumps me again, "sorry again, talking to myself!"

Terrible. ÊThe food and service was awful. ÊNot worth the wait! We waited for 2 hours (which I understand since we had a party of 6) and they server came quick, but we never saw her again. ÊNo one refilled our drinks or asked if we wanted anything else to eat. ÊShe only came back to give us the check, which was just a few minutes after our food arrived. ÊThey want to get you in and out! ÊThis was obvious. ÊI hate places that have become so big that they do not care about their patrons. Additionally, they automatically added 20% for gratuity. ÊI have no problems tipping the 20-25% when it is deserved, but this was absolutely not deserved. ÊWe had to flag someone down to refill our drinks. ÊI even waited and looked for our server because I understand that others have their tables to with but we were given the worst looks. ÊTHE SERVICE WAS TERRIBLE! Plus, if you're a foodie... stay away! ÊGo to Blu Jam instead. ÊIt's a million times better!

Much like other reviewers, I'm not sure why this place is so popular. Long wait, mediocre food. Over the years, I've gone there because it's a favorite of friends. We end up going extra early to avoid the wait, and then I feel bloated and ripped off after eating. The one thing I like is the host. He's been there forever and ALWAYS nice. He has the horrible job of herding the hipster cattle. I swear bouncers at Hyde have it easier than he does.

I checked this place out after reading all the yelp reviews. I did not get pancakes, waffels or french toast, which is what they seem to be famous for. I had the breakfast tacos and they were great. Its a small place so be prepared to be rushed in and out. We were able to get seated after just a short wait. I must advise you though, make sure you are with your whole party and that everyone sticks around. I ran to use an ATM right next door at Rite-Aid while the rest of my party waited and they almost didn't seat us. I knocked off a star for the mediocre service and snippy attitudes of the employees.

This restaurant is what is wrong with American cuisine. ÊThe portions are so big that you can probably feed a whole family one 4 on one plate of pancakes. ÊBut the service was not great because the space is so tight that they almost trying to rush you. ÊI had the oatmeal, which was worse than instant oats. ÊThe bananas tasted like stale, brown bananas and the bacon was under cooked. ÊThe only thing that was good was the nutella french toast but how can you even say that's good because of the way it was cooked? ÊYou put nutella, whipped cream and strawberries on anything and it will taste good. ÊNot worth the hype or the weight. ÊOVERPRICED even compared to Huckleberry's in Santa Monica.

If you tell me that you eat breakfast on a consistent basis then you're a damn liar. ÊChances are the last breakfast you had came from Denny's at 3 AM after getting trashed at Club Ritual. ÊBreakfast has become a lost art, but fortunately, Griddle Caf provides some incentive to get up a little earlier to catch that early morning meal. At first glance, the place looks like a bustling, old fashioned diner apart from the pair of anachronistic wide screen plasmas on the walls. ÊBut I didn't complain. ÊI enjoy a little SportsCenter with my breakfast Most of the times this place is crowded so anticipate a wait. ÊI was fortunate enough to skip the wait time, and after we detailed our orders to the waitress, she asked if we wanted just one pancake or the full three pancake stash. ÊA lifetime of Eggo Waffles and iHop pancakes fostered within us a sense of arrogance, and without a moment's notice we told the waitress to bring us the full stacks thinking that these pancakes really couldn't be as big as everyone said they were. We were sadly mistaken. There were four of us that day and not one of us was prepared for the colossal Everest sized mountain of food that we had to climb: Mom's French toast, a scrambled egg dish, and two full stacks of "Golden Ticket" and "Saturday Morning Fever" pancakes. ÊHaters will claim the pancakes aren't THAT big, but only by diving into the fluffy goodness will one be able to comprehend just how preposterously massive these pancakes really are. ÊTwo jam-packed Styrofoam boxes of leftovers speak for themselves. Though the pancakes themselves were delicious (as I expected), the superstar entree of the trip was Mom's French Toast. ÊIt was soft, delicate, and full of rich flavor; so amazing that I'm surprised the American government hasn't yet usurped the title of "French" from the title French toast. ÊEither way, Freedom Toast or not, it was hands down the best I've ever tried. On the other hand, the scrambled egg entree (called Gone Shrimpin') wasn't anything spectacular, coming off on the bland side. ÊBut then again, the place was called "Griddle Cafe" and not "Scrambles" so in all honesty I didn't really expect much. Price is little steep ($10+ per entree), but gargantuan portions and pancakes concocted from some of the most creative and delicious batters will easily help you forget the price tag and the wait time.

this would be the backdrop of a typical weekend on the streets of los angeles. right shmack in the middle of sunset boulevard your eyes will behold the throngs of angelenos, greatly anticipating, and all vying for their turn to fill their stomachs with what awaits them inside this cafe known as the griddle. too bad they're all still drunk from a previous evening of debauching each other to realize that this place is over rated and better food awaits them elsewhere. no the food here isn't very good at all. minus a star. no the service here is nothing outstanding - even sluggish. minus a star. nothing here is worth waiting more than it takes - which is a ridiculously long @ss time. minus another star. once again people are misled to believe that just cuz you are served more food than you can possibly eat in one sitting, as long as it is mediocre to decent - then it is fab. Êpuh-lease people. Êstart listening to your taste buds and not your eyeballs when it comes to the food. Êand when you wait THAT long to be fed, anything decent that hits your palate when you're famished will taste like heaven.

I was pretty grumpy after waiting for over an hour to have breakfast at 1:00 pm. Low blood sugar, long waits and smoking hipsters could not ruin this place. I loved the gourmet chili with the possibly homemade tortilla chips and sour cream. Best ever. In an attempt to balance things, we chose to split one of the healthiest things on the menu (the egg white scramble with pesto, shrimp and garlic toast) with one of the junkiest (peanut bubba french toast with crumbled nutter butters and whipped cream). It was worth the wait and worth the indigestion that followed.

I had to write an update because, frankly, I can't stop thinking about my last meal at The Griddle. It was our first stop after jumping in the rental car at LAX. It was Saturday at 1:30 and of course, the place is packed. We only waited 30 minutes for a party of 6 and, YES, the same host is still there! Such an efficient guy! So, we got seated in the back "private room" and still got amazing service by the same guy that served us 2 years ago. The wait staff there is unmatched in skills and looks! Funny tip. The mirror in the breeze way from the back entrance is actually a two way mirror. Anyone in the back room can see you picking your teeth! HA! We had a blast people watching once we figured that out! But, the real kicker is the food. Oh the food; it is so good. I would give anything to get food overnighted from The Griddle to my doorstep. Although, that's probably not a good idea. It sounded good in my head. I would really miss the good looking waiters, the hipster decor, and the crack like maple syrup. The peanut bubba french toast has ruined all other french toast for me. I can still remember taking my last bite that day and just savoring it. The Scotch on the Rocks still rocks, the french press coffee was a real winner at our table too. I still forewarn, JUST ORDER ONE PANCAKE, NOT A STACK OF 3. It's not advertised, but you can do this! Also, I'd advise to stick with their specialties items and steer clear of normal 'lunch' food. I don't care if you "don't like sweet stuff' whine whine whine...just go for a pancake or french toast and you won't be disappointed. I once got a burrito and then WISHED I'd gotten pancakes, but alas, I cannot go back in time. Anyway, for 6 people our meal was only $120 tip included. So reasonable. Dear Griddle Cafe, I miss you so much. I've been dreaming about you. I can't wait until I'm back in your comfy booth with my hand wrapped around a fork eating your amazing breakfast. Please open a restaurant in Columbus. I'd be so grateful! Hugs, Liz

Sometimes my eyes and my taste buds don't see...eye to eye. haha All these pictures looked sooo good but i know I don't like having an overload of sweets, or sweets for breakfast. ÊSo my friend and I decided to split one sweet dish, and one salty one b/c I NEED to try a pancake, and I need something savory to balance it out. ÊSo we opted for 1 blueberry pancake because it seemed like one of the more tame ones, omelette pomodoro, and a side of sausage. ÊOoh boy was that cream cheese topping on that fluffy blueberry filled pancake mighty scrumptious. ÊIt was good for the next 3 days too. ÊNext time, I will be brave and try something a little more crazy.

This place is for real. Forget about Êthe 40 min wait on a Friday or the waiters who are overly busy. The environment is great and the food is even better. It might be the best breakfast cafe I have ever been to. Try the peanut butter crust french toast. Nothing compares to this breakfast/dessert (it is extra sweet). I would recommend this place to everyone.

The Griddle should be a mandatory meal stop if you're going to be in or near Hollywood in the morning. ÊI don't know what it's like at lunch or beyond, because I try to be there at 8 when it opens. ÊYes, by 8:30 there's a line to wait in. ÊHell, I didn't even know they had a lunch menu until my third visit! The pancakes are their signature dish, and they are huge. ÊCartoonishly, Scooby-Doo huge. ÊAnd they're creative, including one with Bailey's and Kahlua, with bananas and caramel, and it goes on and on. ÊI recently had the Apple Strudel French Toast, which was thankfully a little smaller. ÊThe egg dishes are large and delicious too. ÊThe other signature feature is their French-press coffee, of which they offer three intensities. ÊThis is a classy touch. Ê The service is quick and friendly, the clientele is very industry-heavy, but not pretentiously so. ÊPeople have production meetings and so on, at either indoor tables and counter or the outdoor seating. ÊWhen I was there this past week, there was soft Delta blues playing from the speakers, which added a calming underscore to the hum of activity and conversations. ÊI'm a big, big fan, and always recommend my friends stop in. ÊAll have become instant fans. Ê Arguably a can't-miss dining experience, perfect for the neighborhood.

if you like pancakes then this is your heaven. there are about a dozen different kinds. on my only visit (so far) to the griddle cafe, i ordered the bluesberry. these are the best blueberry pancakes i have ever tasted. they serve you 3 10 inch in diameter cakes with some kind of cream sauce on top, mine came with blueberry cream sauce. the pancakes aren't the only delectable thing on the menu, one of my friends ordered a chili omelet with potatoes. the griddle cafe knows how to make potatoes, mmm tasty. the only problems i had with the cafe are that the portions are unnecessarily large and the wait for a table can be really long. i will definitely be back there on my next visit to LA. if you go, go starving.

Crazy, insane wait for brunch, but on the bright side the host managing the waiting list was also crazy & insane which kept it interesting. Coffee served in a french press, yum. Eggs benedict innovation: served atop potato skins! Yes, the slab of ham was overkill, but tasty just the same. Oh, and they serve Cap'n Crunch french toast :)

The food and beverages here are amazing, but it will take you 2 hours to eat breakfast. ÊWe waited about 20-25 minutes for a table and then our food took about 30 minutes to come after we ordered. Ê I didn't mind because I had planned on a leisurely brunch with my girlies, but if you're not prepared, it could get really frustrating. Luckily the waitstaff is wonderful, making it hard to get angry with them, and the coffee and mimosas are awesome, so you have something to sip on while you catch up with your friends over breakfast. ÊI had a wonderful experience here. I got the espresso and chocolate chip pancakes. I could only finish 3/4 of one, but I took the rest home with me. ÊEverything we got was delicious. MY 2 girlfriends got the peanut butter french toast and the nutell french toast and both were DELICIOUS. ÊTip: If you only have 2 people, the wait will be much shorter.

my favoritest place to get breakfast in LA, the griddle's menu is perfect for my unsophisticated palate - yes, it's that of a five-year old. Êit's no wonder i love the french toast encrusted in oreo cookies (i am salivating just thinking about it) peanut butter cap'n crunch. Êpancakes are huge (like spilling over the platter, HUGE) and just as packed with sugary goodness. portions are GINORMOUS so i usually split a savory plate and a sweet plate with a friend. Êthe menu is not your generic omelettes and bacon like at other brunch-y places (ie. toast, quality). Êyes, there is usually a wait, but it is well worth it. we generally go for a hike at runyun in the mornings (to compensate for all the calories we would be consuming) before heading over in our sweats (nobody gives a crap what you look like because they've all just come over from the gym). parking is free and available in the rite-aid lot next door.

Talk about LARGE portions. They say the portions are large, and they ain't lyin'. It's great! One meal can last at least 2-3 days worth of lunches. Don't worry though, the quality is not diminished, the food is great. I got the Some Like It Hot, and it was delicious. If you get the pancakes, keep in mind, that you can take it home and heat it up in the oven. The pancakes are also very sweet and tasty.

I don't think this place needs yet another vote of confidence, but I just had to give up my three cheers for the Griddle! Pancakes -- amazing. The side of your head, literally, but absolutely delicious. French toast ... BEST. EVER. Fluffy, pillowy goodness --- I love it with just a pat of batter and just a slight dribble of maple syrup as not to mess with the goodness that is this fried bread. Come here in elastic pants because you WILL be full to the brim. My favorite spot to frequent when I'm feeling like I deserve a fat day!

What can I possibly say that the other 1900+ people didn't? ÊOh holy goodness - this place is IT for obnoxiously huge and amazing breakfasts. ÊGriddle Cafe is an EXPERIENCE. ÊCome early, eat lots, and plan for a nice long nap after you leave. ÊMy party of 8 each ordered something different, except for two orders of Red Velvet Pancakes... so that each of us could try a little bit of everyone else's food. ÊRed velvet pancakes. ÊRed. ÊVelvety. ÊHeaven. ÊWith a nice caulk gun swirl of cream cheese goodness on top. ÊWrap me up and I will eat my way out. ÊEventually. ÊI can't remember what everyone else ordered but I do remember a miscellaneous explosion of chocolate chips, cinnamon, pumpkin, eggs and sausage, more red velvet, and I think Oreos making its way across my tongue at some point. ÊYou can't go wrong. ÊNothing you order here will disappoint. ÊThe coffee is French pressed. ÊThe hot tea is steeped at the table... loose leaves and a hot pot of water. ÊAnd the service??

Ok, I created a yelp account JUST so I could post a review on this place. It's that good. ÊHands down the best french toast I've EVER had. Went with a friend at noon on a Sunday and there was a HUGE line outside but surprisingly only a 45 minute wait. ÊThe guy regulating was really cool and the wait actually went by pretty fast. Sat at the bar-ish area in the center (which btw is a great concept idea) and ordered the french press coffee. ÊThey brought the press over to us and it was ridiculously good. Onto the food....I'm almost at a loss for words. ÊI have a bit of a sweet tooth and needless to say this place it my new heaven. ÊI got the P.Bubba French Toast and my friend got a scramble with fresh basil, garlic, peppers, onions, and cheese. ÊBoth were cooked to perfection. French toast was crispy on the outside but not too tough and overcooked and the crushed nutter butters were to die for. ÊBeen craving these since Sunday. The veggies in my friends eggs were super fresh. I know other people complained about the price but we both thought it was appropriately priced for the portions and quality of the food. ÊYou do get A LOT of food so maybe consider sharing or getting a 1/2 order...or hiking Runyon after :)

FINALLY, a restaurant I can say kicks Norcal's ass and any other region I've been to for breakfast. ÊFor the second time I went to this place blessed with the wonderful opportunity to go into work later in the morning. ÊWhy not go to Griddle on a weekday? ÊScore! ÊThis time the bf and I ordered the Mother's french toast and the Chicago scramble. ÊBoth were great. ÊThe Chicago scramble was a little on the bland side by itself, but the french toast was PERFECT! ÊSo soft and the right amount of chewiness to complement its sweetness. Ê Lets just say the bf is the biggest creature of habit minus my mom who will rarely try new restaurants and go to new places. ÊWhen the bf wanted to go back to the Griddle to grab breakfast, that said A LOT. ÊSheesh, who knows this place might just be a regular for the bf and me.

French press coffee and pancakes/french toast that don't need a drop of syrup because they are alredy so damn rich= a typical morning at griddles....they loose one star solely for the ever present crowd and craziness whether its a monday at 9am or sat/sun brunch.

The Griddle is a good place for breakfast. I've been here only once and for Sunday morning brunch so I have no idea how the dinner experience is. ÊThe food is tasty (pancakes and omelettes are probably the most popular dishes here), but the restaurant is extremely crowded (it's pretty popular). ÊI think you need to get here pretty early on a weekend morning if you want to not have to wait for a long time to be seated. Parking was ridiculous, as is the case with pretty much all of Sunset Blvd. I ended up having to circle around for quite a while to find parking in the lot near CVS behind the restaurant. Ê The food is good. ÊThe portions are HUGE so come hungry and be prepared to take leftovers home. ÊI'd recommend splitting a pancake between 2-3 people. ÊI especially liked their blueberry and pumpkin pancakes. ÊI ordered their regular food (a BBQ burger with fries) and that was pretty decent too, though i'm not sure if it was worth it for the price. I'd recommend sticking with pancakes or omelettes to get your money's worth and to truly experience the Griddle.

Being the alpha male that I am, I avoided my friend's warning of the gargantuan size of the pancakes, and opted to order a pancake dish AND an omlete. ÊWhen I saw that the pancakes were as big as a steering wheel, I immediately regretted my decision. ÊI think with the omlete, I was able to finish off 1 and a half of the pancakes (you get three).

So after seeing this on the Food Network, this was the first place we went once we got off the plane and into our rental. Place was easy to find and parking was easy. It was packed so there was a little wait but we had the big booth in the back. I love booths so I was happy. I had the Ê strawberries and creme waffle?

holy shit. Êmothers french toast. Êim a BIG salty food eater. Êthe first time i ordred the french toast (a cute lil blond chic waitress told me that IS THE DISH TO ORDER) not so much a fan of eating something sweet as a main dish. Êbut.... mother's french toast's HOT BUTTERY MELT IN YOUR MOUTH SWEET BREAD that just kicks you in the brain. Êone bite and you are HOOKED. Êi kid you not. Êmy mouth is watering just thinkin about it.... eat it w/ or w/ out syrup it is that frickin delicious. order it with a side of pork apple sausage and a side of brick hashed potatoes (surprise bits of onions... yum). Ê Êu are good to go.... as well as be rolled out the door. wait staff thus far has been great, the WORSE is the WAITING for Êyour food to actually get to ur table. Êcoffee is pressed, but its only eh. Ê i have not had anythign else on the menu yet BUT the mothers french toast. Êand this french toast ALONE gets 5 stars... (more if that were an option.)

i love this place. Êanytime anyone visits from out of town THIS is the one place we always take them. Êthe whole fun experience starts with the guy at the door who takes your name. Êhe's no nonsense on the verge of curt, but with a hilarity that takes the edge off. Êyou can't help but love the guy. Ê(i love when he wears his "chicks dig me" t shirt with the baby chicks on it.) we usually don't get there until around 11 AM. Êat that time the wait is about 40 min to an hour. Êbut it's totally worth it. Êeverything comes in ginormous portions and it's almost all fantastic. Êthe only thing i didn't really love is the chili. Êit was really, REALLY salty. Ê(they have several chili choices at any given time. Êit might have been just the specific one i got.) Ê i LOVE the wild wild east sandwich with chicken breast. ÊYUMMMM. Êi love their salads. Êi love their griddle potatoes with EL YUCATECA hot sauce. Êthose are the stand outs, but basically everything is awesome. the only thing i don't like is that their pancakes come in such a ridonkulous size and stack. Êi think 4 people could EASILY share one order of them. Êi always look longingly at other peoples' pancakes but never order them myself, b/c i hate throwing food away and it's the one thing you can't take home as leftovers.

Nutella stuffed french toast with powdered sugar and whipped cream! I wanted to devour it the moment it was placed in front of me. It was sinfully delicious, down to the very last nutella filled bite. Everything is huge here, huge and tasty. One pancake is approximately the size of a smallish pizza, you definitely wouldn't need a full stack, or even more than one for that matter. You must go early though, as there will be a wait, but it is sooo worth it.

So i read the reviews and decided i had to try it. ÊWe had a party of 6 it was all of our first times and everyone pretty much ordered their own breakfast, big mistake when ordering pancakes! They are huge!!! We had four different types of pancakes at our table, they were all delicious but one order is enough for three! I had a waffle with strawberries on top which was oh sooo good, someone else had the tequila sunrise(their version of huevos rancheros) which was amazing! You must try to potatoes, i think it was my favorite part of the breakfast. My only complaint is that this place is incredibly loud! I would say twice as loud as a crowded bar, ÊWe had to yell our order to the server! But the food is great! I will come back.

One thing is for sure and there is no lack of eye candy at this place. ÊMy friends and I came upon this establishment on a Thursday afternoon, we got seated at the booth in the back corner, a tad too big for a party of 4 but comfy nontheless. ÊHaving heard lots of good stuff about the pancakes, we decided to order the "yellowbrick road" (butterscotch, caramel and walnut) and for our savory it was the "some like it hot" scramble. ÊThe portions were indeed HUGE, but aside from that the pancakes were off balanced. ÊThe isolation of the flavors created a clear distinction of the sweet and made it super sweet and bland. ÊCut out all the fluff (caramel, butterscotch, etc..) I was left with pancake batter that was medicore at best. ÊAs for our scramble, I was anticipating an explosion of flavors in my mouth with the tequila spiced ranchero sauce, the spicy chipotle sauce, the pico de gallo but nope...again it was an isolation of flavors where the saltiness and flavoring of the tequila chicken sausage made the other parts of the scramble tasteless. Ê This Êplace is ok and since I'm always in the mood for breakfast, if there comes a day where my sweet tooth is itching or I feel like I can eat a horse, then I will come again. ÊBut stand in line and wait for this on a weekend (as the rumors have it)? ÊNo way!

i love breakfast! came here on a random friday and we had to wait for like 5-10 minutes and got seated (around 11am-12pm)... it was busy. the place has a rustic feel and a diner decor going on. the menu is has a lot of different things to eat. the menu is not crazy. my bf got the muscle egg omelette thing and i got the one with italian sausage, onions, peppers and other stuff egg omelette and drank some OJ. they give a more than a good portion. i looked around and i saw people order pancakes and french toast...they make some HUGE PANCAKES! you can literally share it with like a 3-4! looked so good!!! they had different kinds of pancakes and i like that! i will definitely try the pancakes and french toast next time... it is a bit pricey for breakfast but it was sure delicious. it is kind of hard to find, definitely looks like a hole in the wall place. coming here for the first time did not know where to park. suggestion is to street park. the service was good even though it was hectic... the waiters are very nice and friendly and willing to help you out with the menus or recommendations. come here for breakfast and have a huge appetite!

"Who's the master???" ÊShouts the French toast fairy. French Toast!!!

Ê Well I didn't have to wait long for the food either I order the "Peanut Bubba French Toast," with bacon and eggs and my friend orders the "Poached y Papas Benedict."

ÊThe place was packed but we found rock star parking in front - it was a metered parking but whoever was there last still had a little less than an hour of time left - score! ÊWe walked in and asked for a table for two - we were seated right away. ÊI ordered two banana nana flap jacks and we also ordered a spinach tomato something omelet (we were sharing). ÊThe order arrived after about 10 minutes - surprising since the place was soo busy. ÊThe pancakes were bigger than the plate they were served on!

I kind of feel like the griddle has a case of overhype going on. yeah, it's pretty good. their pancakes are huge, and pretty tasty. their egg dishes are just so-so. after hearing people rave about it and then waiting thirty minutes for a table, my expectations were pretty high... and not quite met. worth it if you're a pancake aficionado, or if you happen to walk by and notice there's not a wait. otherwise, LA's got way too many great breakfast places for me to come back here.

This place is awesome.....I stopped by yesterday morning to have breakfast with a friend. When we got there at about 9am on a Saturday the place was packed, but we only had to wait outside for a few minutes, which was nice since I was starving. I had a red velvet pancake and some scrambled eggs....the pancake was huge, hanging off the edge of the plate. My friend has these Chicago style eggs with Italian sausage, bell peppers, potatoes, mozzarella cheese....etc. Both plates were delicious and more food than either of us could finish. Overall it was a great experience, service was friendly and fast...combine that with good food and you've got a 5 star experience.

The experience on a weekend is similar to what other's have said - drive by, stomach initial shock at how long line is, park, get in line, look suspiciously around to make sure no one is "cutting you", final get a table, oh, it's at the bar. ÊCrane neck to see football game score. ÊService tends to be slow but just because they're so busy - everyone there was super nice and rather apologetic considering it's that way every weekend. I had some sort of super chocolate pancakes - they were rather absurd. ÊNo doubt they were good. Ê My only beef is the lack of variety - I want pancakes, I want eggs, I want bacon, I want jam, I don't want 3 absolutely gargantuan chocolate pancakes with no variety on my plate. ÊBut for those that love their pancakes, in all varieties, you can't beat the experience here, they were pretty fantastic. ÊI personally will be in search of the shorter-wait-more-plate-variety breakfast spots.

Amazing! A couple friends and I came here for brunch one Sunday morning. The line was long, luckily there were only three of us so we got seating in 10 minutes. Make sure you have your entire group there or else it will delay when you get seated. I don't recommend coming here with a large group of people because the restaurant has a small capacity. None of us had ever been here and the menu was overwhelming, in a good way. We ordered their red velvet pancakes, nutella stuffed french toast, and their "Muscle Bound" scramble. The red velvet pancakes were HUGE but light and fluffy. It's served with a cream cheese sauce on top. The nutella stuffed french toast is very rich with a generous serving of ice cream and whip cream. The scramble balanced out all the sweets we ordered, and was light and healthy. The portions are huge and the three of us only finished 2/3 of what we ordered. It's a lot of food for a reasonable amount of money.

If you can stand a dry host, crowded cramped spaces and LOUDNESS, this review should be 4 stars, but for me it's just 3 stars. The Original French Toast has fantastic vanilla flavor. The Poached and Papas (add avocado and sub ham for bacon) is great. And the pancakes look fantastic, although all the toppings make them look more like ice cream sundaes. No doubt a ton of people love the place. I just think you have to like that kind of atmosphere to really be able to enjoy the food.

This place is all hype. ÊI think people like this place because of the enormous food portions they give you. ÊThe service is complete crap, no one greeted us when we walked in, then our server got our order wrong. ÊI have had better pancakes at IHOP.

Best breakfast in LA. ÊPeriod. ÊJust make sure that you exercise for the rest of the day to burn it off. ÊThis is a must for out of town guests, get there early on the weekends. Also a secret that is not on the menu is that for pancakes & french toast you can ask the waiter for one or two stack, opposed to the standard three stack which is impossible to finish.

Huge portions plus its freaking good!!! i dont know how else to explain it. The place was great. Went here yesterday with a couple of friends for lunch. The line was long obviously. Depending in how many people you have but a minimum of 20 min im guessing. Parking might be the only problem. You do have street parking but its la might get a ticket if u stay for a while. Also a parking lot behind rite aid but its usually packed. Ill comeback here again and again and again!

I'm not much of a breakfast person, so to give four stars to a breakfast place is a big deal for me. Blueberry pancake- what yumminess! =) Three stacks of fluffiness that just melts in your mouth with real and plentiful blueberries topped with blueberry yogurt. Drizzle with maple syrup and it's so delicious. I will definitely go back again because I want to try the Nutella french toast! Just remember to arrive early because the wait can be on average 20 minutes- especially during weekends. AND, definitely plan on sharing because the portions are humongous!

I'm not a big breakfast person because I just simply can't wake up in time for breakfast and just rather sleep in. When I do grab breakfast I like a nice home style breakfast and I think Griddle Caf really has that feel. I went to Griddle Caf one early morning for breakfast. They really made me work for my breakfast by having me wait in line and smelling the scents of bacon, syrup, and pancakes. The wait wasn't too horrible and I had an appetite worked up. The menu had a lot, a lot to choose from but I settled for Mom's French toast and some banana pancake. The French toast was really good. I walked in thinking, French toast, how great can it really get? The French toast was actually really good. It was fluffy and had melted butter dripping into ever crevice of that piece of bread and topped with powdered sugar and syrup. Delicious! The plate of pancake was enormous! If I took the stack of pancakes and placed it under my shirt and on top of my belly I would have looked 4-5 months preggers. ÊYes, that much. Do you really need that much pancake for breakfast?! Anyways, the pancakes were just ok. I think I prefer the pancake in a box mix. I like bananas but I think it was too overpowering in the pancakes. I would definitely go back for more French toast but not anytime soon. I'm still working off those calories. I give this place a 3.5 and bumped to four star with the good service.

Griddle Cafe, I've saved my 200th review for you! I'd heard rave reviews about the french toast and am a huge breakfast person, so I had to give this place a shot when I was in the area. For such a popular place, I didn't think the wait was that bad (if you've ever been to the Boiling Crab in San Jose, then this is cake). We were quoted 30-40 min for 2 at around noon on a Sunday. The guy regulating the wait was super nice - esp considering his job as the gatekeeper holding back an impatient, hungry mob. Stephen N. and I got 3 things: - Mom's French Toast: I added fresh strawberries and sliced bananas on top. This was amazing! Fluffy cinnamon brioche inside, lightly crispy sweet outside, a touch of powdered sugar, and a drizzle of maple syrup. Some of the best I've had. - Tequila Sunrise: Pretty good. Not really my cup of tea, here or elsewhere, as I felt like most of what I was consuming was sauce. - Blueberry Pancake: I love breakfast, but I hate pancakes. I like french toast, waffles, eggs, sausage, etc, but I always get tired of pancakes after a few bites. Griddle Cafe gets my 200th review and 5 stars for converting me to their pancakes. The pancake isn't your usual mono-textured flapjack - it's fluffly, crispy, sweet, and a little salty. The blueberry pancake would have been great on its own with maple syrup, but the blueberry sour cream seriously blew my taste buds. It was like blueberry butter Êbut yogurt flavored, if that makes any sense. SO GOOD!!!! I've been dreaming of the pancakes since Sunday. PLEASE SEND ME BACK!!!

Good Gawd. I've read the reviews, yeah, I heard all about the big portions, blah blah blah. But, oh sweet mother of all things great and small, when I beheld it with mine own eyes ... it was breath taking. When my "Black Magic" Oreo-crumble-covered panGARGANTUcakes were lowered in front of me, my knees went weak. At that moment I carefully raised myself up, and with hand over heart, professed my continuing allegiance to this wondrous land of ours, where a man can sit down to pancakes the size of trash can lids. America? Land of the free, home of the brave, BIG-ASS PANCAKES. Amen.

Soo good, but good lawd is it tiny. ÊI didn't notice the big crowd when I was outside, as you can just gaze into the Sunset Blvd. distance...but claustrophobics stay clear--tables are poorly laid out, and you'll be constantly bumped by chairs, whipped by flying jackets, and otherwise have your style cramped. ÊThe pancakes were huge, but you only get a couple, so you'll need some chicken apple sausage along with a few other sides to fill up. ÊGood grub, but by no means the top breakfast spot in the area.

Ooooohhh this is the best breakfast placce I've been to yet. Let me see- I still have the receipt from them. Between the two of us, we got: Breakfast blend tea, lemonade, chicago charlie's scramble, side of boysenberry rain pancake, two eggs and pork apple sausage combo. The total was $32.70. Now that's normally a little more than I'd like to spend for breakfast, but for Griddle Cafe, I will say it's worth it!! Plus, we had a lot of left over. The side of pancake is actually one huge pancake, and that alone is enough for breakast. Contrary to how it looks, it's actually pretty light and soft and not disgustingly sweet. I loved it! I also enjoyed my scramble, a good compliment to pancake. The tea is served in a huge tea pot and lasts the whole meal and more. The service was great, and we got to eat outside in the LA sunshine.

Come early and with a HUGE appetite. We arrived at 8:30-ish on a recent Sunday and were seated right away, but before 9 there was a line outside. The portions are humongous. I had "Kicking and Screaming," two egg tacos that the waiter had described as the best item on the menu. And was he right!!! Others in my party ordered the "Rise & Shine" pancakes (with espresso and chocolate chips) that were delicious but barely fit on the plate, and the ham & cheese frittata (I forget what it was called, but it came with a slab of ham steak that covered the whole frittata and the most amazing breakfast potatoes on the side). Despite the wait, no one seemed in a hurry for us to leave, which was a nice change. I will definitely come here again.

Alright, I know there isn't much left to be said about The Griddle Cafe that hasn't already been said, but I wanted to give it my compliments. ÊIts pancakes are unparalleled: great selection, great price, and great taste. ÊMy favorite are the Eyes Wide Open, although the Banana Nana are quite good, too. ÊSure, it's tough to finish the entire plate, and I never have, but there's no sense in complaining about that (I can't believe so many people do)! ÊWhy not take them home and enjoy a tasty treat later in the day (or over the next 2 or 3 days)?!? ÊBesides, the presentation oozes cool, and it's such a treat to see out-of-towners' faces when your server brings you that giant plate of pancakes! I've read some complaints about the crowds and the service. ÊSure, it's a bit crowded, but what do you expect from a place as good as the Griddle? ÊAnd really, if you're with good company, the wait isn't so bad. ÊI'd recommend Coffee Bean across the street, but I don't drink a ton of coffee and I much prefer the French presses at the Griddle. ÊAnd the service isn't bad, either. ÊSure, most of the servers are aspiring actors or actresses, but I've never had bad service. UPDATE 10/08/07: I've eaten at the Griddle a few times since my original review, and I've tried many new dishes. ÊThe Mom's French Toast and the Devil's Day Dream (well, just about every variation of French toast, I suppose) are AMAZING, as is the Poached y Papas Benedict, which just might be the best thing on the menu. ÊIn addition, the bacon is, bar none, the best bacon I've ever had in my life. Ê To sum up my original review and this update, the Griddle Cafe offers the best breakfast in LA because of its great menu and reasonable prices, and it's well worth the wait. ÊIt's a must visit restaurant in LA, whether you're a local or a tourist.

For my second attempt at the griddle I decided to stick with the french toast creations. This was a preventative measure, as I did not want to attempt to finish an order of pancakes again, it just is not possible. 3 of us split the Noisella (nutella stuffed), cheesecake, and chocolate chip cookie crusted french toasts. The chocolate chip cookie french toast was the only dish we ordered that I had tried before, and it still remains the best french toast creation on the menu. The nutella was a little overwhelming, as there was a good amount and it sticks to the back of your throat, really dominating your palate. But this is what the griddle does, they take a flavor and they push it to the limit, so if you like a certain thing (e.g. nutella spread) then you will receive it in a large quantity and be very pleased. Same goes for the cheesecake french toast, which was graham cracker crusted and covered in a super rich cheesecake icing. They aren't joking when they say on the menu, for serious cheesecake lovers, it is seriously cheesecakey. I do want to try the plain Mom's french toast and get the apple cobbler french toast, which I think is the second best french toast dish they have. Ê I had a small bite of the Saturday Morning Fever pancakes (kahlua and bailey's infused batter), which were good, but could not imagine eat much more than a few bites. Again, I think the french toast creations overshadow the pancakes in the taste department, and at a more manageable size, are the smarter choice. Always get a side of bacon, super solid and the french press coffee. I'll be back because I'm still day dreaming about trying the devil's daydream french toast.

i don't care if this place is overhyped, has a ridiculous line or is the breeding ground for all hollywood actor types. it has the best version of eggs benedict in the world. before i begin to describe this heavenly experience, let me set up the scene. diner style, and you wait outside for an hour or so before you get to sit down. they have the biggest pancakes in the world, and it's fun to see all the anorexic la girls take a bite and then take the rest "to go." ok, i would probably do that too. but the eggs benedict (poached y papas here) is...transcendental. imagine, if you will, perfectly poached eggs, sitting atop canadian bacon and fried potato skins - yes, you read that right. instead of your mundane english muffins, griddle cafe one-ups the rest of the breakfast world by using fried potato skins. it's perfection. i could go on for hours. but there's more - the entire concoction is drenched with their house-made hollandaise. did you know i live for hollandaise? you do now. in the griddle cafe version (aka the perfect version), the entire plate is covered in hollandaise. as in, the first time i had it, i wasn't even sure what i was eating because i couldn't see through the sauce. in fact, i might not have even had eggs on my plate! doesn't matter, perfection. yes i eat it all. my only rule is that i go here with people i've never gone here with before, basically to prevent me from going here weekly. there are anorexic la girls i gotta keep up with!

I really like the coffee, had a french press filter and ordered the eyes wide shut pancakes filled with chocolate. I tell ya, its too much, and was good but not that great. We also tried the omelet but wasn't that special. I think i will try waffles next time..

This place is great for breakfast. ÊThe pancakes are enoromous (big enough to feed 2 to 3 people). ÊThe strawberries and cream waffles are the best and the coffee is strong! ÊThe service is nice and friendly. ÊThe worst part about this place is the wait and parking. ÊGo check this place out and skip lunch afterwards.

mmmh...saw the pic and decided to yelp. a great whopping plate of french toast and their french press coffee. that's all i ever get here. we also enjoy it when we're lucky enough to get a table outside so we can dine with our dog. the weekend crowds unfortunately, almost make it not worthwhile. one thing though... don't eat there when it's crowded and the short, skinny balding guy with glasses is hosting tables. on enough occasions to notice, he seats people without giving them menus, which exacerbates the weekend log jam (no orders, no free tables anytime soon) and laughs at people's names. he's snide and bitter, but not particularly funny, like david spade. i had a teacher once who hated kids, so i always questioned her career choice. i knew a restaurant host once, who hated customers...

came here on labor day! there was a long line waiting outside. its such a small place no wonder its so packed! our wait was only 45 mins. the wait was quick. we got the yellow brick road, my boyfriend fot something like eggs benedict but on potato. and i got the omelette. the staff was nice. the food came by quick. the omlette wasn't that great, but the eggs bendict was super good, and so was the yellow brick road. the yellow brick road is to die for. the pancakes were so huge! that we took it home. and wasn't able to finish it. but it was delicious. this place was also cheap too. def. a place to go to if your in la.

The pancakes here are so gigantic, I could only eat 1/4 of them. I took them home and it took two days to finish them off. They are literally bigger than their plates, and they come in stacks of three. And they are excellent. Closed for dinner, FYI, and the parking is pretty challenging.

You've died and gone to pancake heaven. The Griddle is nirvana for those of us who occasionally find ourselves staring longingly for what IHOP promises and never delivers. The Griddle is a caf, specializing in breakfast concoctions that are simply amazing. Not only do they have a dozen monster pancake specialties, but their coffee is freakin' fantastic. Each coffee order is served in an individual French press made to your strength request. Because it's next to the DGA, however, the parking sucks elephant butt and the tables outside are always jammed with wannabe starlets and their scummy boyfriends who think they're the next Johnny Knoxville; which should tell you their relative intelligence. Average price for two people is about twenty bucks before tip.

if you are a fat fuck or just eat like one like i do, then this is the place for you. Ê(and god i hope i don't go to hell for writing that line.) Êi'm totally serious. Êthe portions at this joint are gigantical. Êbut disproportionately so when compared to the drink sizes, oddly. Êso, let's say that if your entree was a super big gulp, then your drink would be a mini juicy-juice juicebox. Êthe more that i am thinking about this, the more it perplexes me. Êisn't it usually the other way around? Êever order the mega size drink at kfc? Êit looks like a bucket and even has a handle like a bucket. Êtry setting that in between your legs on your drive home. Êyour crotch no likey. griddle cafe has the atmosphere of a greasy spoon but has flat screen tvs and lots of pretty attractive people. Êthe waiters aren't bad to look at either. Êbonus. it's amazing to me that all of these lovely skinny people lounging around west hollywood frequent a place like griddle because...oh did i fail to mention how big the portions were!? Êanyhow, the griddle cafe is known for their huge pancakes of creative flavors and concoctions. Êthey stack them three high and are about the size of a record. Êi'm not talking 45s here people. Ê i ordered the 'bluesberry' pancakes -- i like to order classic menu items as a way to gauge how good a restaurant is sometimes -- and was quite pleased. Êthe pancakes were fluffy, the blueberries were almost as big as violet beauregard, and they were doused in powdered sugar and topped with blueberry sour cream. Êi thought the blueberry sour cream was a nice touch. Êi also ordered a medium roast coffee -- they offer you a variety of roasts --which was served in a french press. the french press charmed me, but the coffee was too watery. Ê my girlfriend ordered a cobb salad which was leafy green and topped with huge chunks of chicken -- i'm talking mcnugget size. Êwe both agreed that the bacon was a little fatty, and the dressing was on the too spicy side, but she took the leftovers home anyway. Êher orange juice, in comparison to the tree that she was served, was skimpy and overpriced at $5.00. Êi was able to finish about one pancake and took the rest home as well. Êi took the liberty to weigh the thing and would approximate that the remaining two pancakes with styrofoam container came in at about 2-3 pounds. Êyeah. the griddle cafe is good. Êcareful, on the weekends, though -- there is usually a long wait time. definitely a great place to go the morning after a drinking binge -- you'll get more than enough food to sop up the alcohol, and your life force for that matter. Ê Êtry checking out the server counter to see how much bigger and more ridiculous the sizes of the entrees get. i think i saw an omelette that was about the length of my forearm. Êdo you remember playing super mario bros. 3 and going whoa when you reached level 4 giant world/big island? Êconsider yourself warned.

I broke my Griddle Cafe hymen this past week and am now craving the warmth of it's delicious food. I reluctantly ordered the red velvet pancake based on hearing how great it is, even though I was not craving it. At this moment I would like to thank those who pushed me in this direction. The pancake was massive, moist, red, flavorful and covered in cream cheese frosting... yet managed not to be too sweet for breakfast. Additionally I ordered a french press that provided delicious coffee. I would like to add that parking is easy and makes the restaurant very accessible.

the order. original pancakes scramble w/ spinach and chicken the pancakes are delicious. its easy to get tired of these humungous offerings. one order is enough to feed 3 people. great fluffiness. definitely a must, but bring some friends along and share the scramble was a bit lackluster to me. maybe it's because i got the healthiest one; that is, the one without all the cheese and sausage. on the bright side, the scramble was moist. i like their lousiana hot sauce alot. a bit pricey but portions are pretty generous. didn't have room for french toast-but it's a must next time around.

Upgrade time, 5 well deserved stars! I had been craving some Griddle love for quite some time, so I knew the second I was taking my next LA trip I was going here without fail. ÊThankfully on a Sunday morning at 9am there was only about a 5 minute wait despite the rather impressive crowd beginning to gather out front. ÊTo say that the entire dining experience went off without a hitch is not doing justice to this place, staff, cooks, bussers, waiters, and the infamous host. ÊI love that guy, there is just something about his no-BS just give me your name and I'll give you a time that is really endearing; the best way to describe it is "East Coast Style (as in go to NJ/NY and you'll get it, otherwise your a lost cause). Just a side note to all those that complain about it being to cramped, get over it. ÊThat cramped, hectic, loud (and I mean LOUD) atmosphere is what makes the Griddle so special. ÊAnywhere else I would be annoyed but this environment completes the dining experience. The food: ÊHome run, A+, 5-stars, yada-yada. ÊOrdered a fruit bowl and french press (medium roast) to start and we were promptly served said order. ÊThe fruit was fresh-cut, seasonal, and oh so good while the coffee was stellar and easily some of the best I've had in a breakfast establishment in a LONG TIME! ÊI went with a stack of 2 "BLUESberry" pancakes (sour cream on the side) and killed them off. ÊM went with the "Barry Yellow", she killed hers too. The pancakes were served very hot, had the proper texture, and a good amount of fruit folded into the batter. ÊOnce the ubiquitous Griddle maple syrup was added I was having a pancake orgy! ÊI got enough bites of M's cakes as well to know what is up next on my hit list. ÊIn addition to the pancakes, I had a side of egg whites to fortify the diet with some protein. ÊOnce again, the whites were cooked perfectly, served hot while still fluffy and just a touch underdone. ÊM and I also split an order of bacon and despite a small burnt end on 2 of the pieces the thick-cut bacon rounded out the meal. ÊWe even managed to impress our waited by actually cleaning both of our plates, a rare feat at the Griddle. ÊI will be back. P.S. ÊPlease people, why the F*** do you order a stack of 3, super-rich pancakes knowing what you are going to be served based on the yelp reviews and then complain that the portion sizes were too big? ÊI always know enough about a place to modify my order and it would be nice if others did the same instead of wasting food! ÊRant over!

yummmmm. this is not the place to go if you are on a diet or would like to enjoy a leisurely meal. but it's worth it. the breakfast tacos were deeelish, albeit a little on the small side. the nutella packed french toast was enormous and delectable. i loved the menu! interesting combinations and so many choices. i am looking forward to going back and trying other things. we lucked out and didn't have to wait but even at about 11am on a weekday, it got super packed so i plan on never ever going there on a weekend. the only thing that sucked was the espresso. it was brown water. it was seriously disgusting.

Glad we came here! First off, there was a ton of traffic so we made it just in time, arriving around 3:30pm when they close at 4. They gave us menus, sat us down right away and didn't try to rush us at all. I asked the waiter what his fav french toast was, he said mom's french toast...it was amaaaaazing! Came with 2 huge slices of fluffy french toast, and I got a side order of bacon that was super thick. My bf ordered the omelette "my soul" and it came with a huge order of hash browns, and 2 slices of toast (your choice of bread). He ordered an orange juice to drink and I ordered an ice coffee. They actually bring out an entire pot of fresh brewed coffee that you push down to brew yourself and pour over a cup of ice. I will def be coming back here a couple different times to try all their other items. :)

Eh. I don't see the big hype over this place. It's tiny...too 'LA' and the portions are just unseemly...they perpetuate the typical obese american diet. ÊIt's just kind of gross. I much prefer quality than quantity. ÊYou would be much better sharing a plate of pancakes than finishing it yourself. ÊThe coffee is good though, I will give them that.

THE BEST BREAKFAST SPOT!!!! My new favorite breakfast spot! I like coming here on a weekday when it's not so busy. The portions are enormous and really overwhelming - total American gluttony but ohh sooo good. Actually, it's kind of a problem, I mean if I order pancakes and get a side of ham there is no way in hell I'm going to finish even half of it. I end up eating a perfectly designed square out of the center of my pancakes. Not only do I feel awful for consuming a full days worth of calories in 1 sitting, I feel horrible for wasting this really good food. But I think I figured out an ordering technique for breakfast at The Griddle. First off go in with a partner willing to split the meal with you. Get 1 order of pancakes, a side of eggs, a side of breakfast meat, and if your feeling really hungry a side of potatoes. You're basically ordering a mini buffet table where you can dress your plate up any way you like; Mmmm, a wedge of blueberry pancakes, a little scrambled eggs, some bacon, and potatoes. Boom! A little taste of everything where you have portion control thus saving yourself from the glutinous pigs that we Americans are. 12/23/07 Okay tested my ordering theory out and it's perfect - although I'm still stuffed but now I guess 2 people feel like pigs instead of 1. Ha!

This is place is amazing thats all I can say. Never heard of this place until yesterday but I found out it was my friends favorite spot so we hit it up for lunch. The place was packed. Personally, I love breakfast food. No matter what time of the day it is. When I looked up the griddle on here and looked through the pictures, I had decided that I wanted to try the peanut french toast as shown in the main picture. Drenched with butter and whipped cream and powered sugar my heart literally skipped a beat from excitement. It tasted just as good as it looked. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that they charge $5 for a glass of OJ with no refills. If your in the area for lunch you should totally try it out. It will be worth your time.

This place is a must-go whenever I'm in LA. I'm a huge fan of breakfast..I can eat it anytime anywhere, so this place is a godsend. I advise you to starve yourself before coming here...skip dinner the night before if need be, because you will have to be rolled out of the restaurant when you're finished with your meal. The pancakes are ginormous and delicious...one would not be able to finish them on their own. ÊI really liked the "Poached y Papas" Benedict...instead of the classic english muffin this dish is served atop seasoned potato skins..yum! The "Peanut Bubba" Crunchy French Toast is great for those with a real sweet tooth (a tad bit too sweet for my liking), but the real treat for you french toast fiends is "Mom's French Toast." My SO thought they were the best he's ever had and I'd have to agree. I haven't given their lunch menu much of a chance, but their chili and cornbread I wasn't so crazy about. I'll be sticking to breakfast for now. Also, the service isn't spectacular so be prepared to flag down your server as it gets pretty hectic inside.

Omigod the best brunch place ever. The pancakes are literally enough food to feed a family of four. Everything on the menu looked absolutely delicious and it was super hard for us to decide what to get. The boy and me decided to split the "Eyes Wide Open" pancakes and the "Fiesta Scramble" so we could have our eggs and carbs. Pancakes that combine espresso and chocolate - how can you go wrong? ÊEggs with loads of cheese, chilies and more- yum. ÊBoth were absolutely delicious and there was no way we could finish the pancakes. Also super cute french press coffee makes me smile. This place fills up fast and there usually is a wait so try to show up early or during week.

The first time I heard of The Griddle Cafe I was watching Diners, Drive-ins and Dives on the Food Network and The Griddle Cafe was on it and I had to try it out since my sister lives there and it wasn't that far from her. The next time I visited my sister I took her there. We both loved it. The food and the service was great. Every time I visit my sister I gotta take a trip to The Griddle Cafe. It is a MUST. I also met Jodi and just for coming in and telling her that I was friends on Facebook we got complimentary Mimosa's and she brought us fried Oreo s that were on the house. It was the first time we all had it and they were good. Also the portions are HUGE!!! You gotta try this place out.

Found parking quickly about 2 blocks away on the curb for free in a residential area. Walked up and the place was packed inside and out yet we were seated immediately in a big booth tucked away around the corner from the door on the right. I ordered the "Creme de la Creme - Graham cracker crusted French toast drizzled with our must have creamy cheesecake topping and powdered sugar." LET ME TELL YOU: BEST THING FOR BREAKFAST EVER. I'm not exaggerating. God, I crave this all the time now. The service was spectacular; VERY friendly, helpful, and prompt! The atmosphere is great too -- there's a giant bar in the center and if I remember correctly, the cooking action is going on right there in the center -- or at least some of it.

do you wonder why americans are obese? look no further than the portions at the griddle. please split one normal dish and then get a side if you need a little variety. their granola sucks! it is actually worse than granola from the supermarket. it tastes bland and fake. don't test me on this one, you will be the only one hurt if you order it. i think they get it at smart & final. the french toast is pretty awesome, might be the best in los angeles. i have seen celebrities so many times here that i am now bored of celebrities. if you want to find some just eat here enough times. most things are good, and no one ever thinks of the salad but their salads are tasty! the breakfasty foods are of course exciting, but some of them approach caricature. and i'm not talking about the portions. i mean, like if you like frosting on your breakfast, and you order something with some frosting, it is too sweet/colorful/rich etc. they take something that would be tasty and they hyperbolize it until you have to scrape some of it off and put it on a separate plate. i hope this makes sense. it's as if you had an overzealous aunt who makes you breakfast. she heard you like blueberries so she made blueberry based flour, compote, blueberry gel and baked it with a blueberry glue-sauce.

ÊWe waited a solid 45 minutes (which gave us time to wander to a bunch of cute shops) and ended up being seated at the bar. ÊThis time I had the creme de la creme french toast.... SO GOOD. It was covered with graham cracker crumbles and this amazing cream cheese spread. ÊNo syrup required... My friend had the Caballero which was eggs and chiles and sour cream and salsa... YUM. and on saturday mimosa were 2 for 1. This place is awesome and totally worth waiting for. :)

This place is great. The biggest panacakes I have every seen! I'm generally the type to clean my plate, particularly when an unhealthy breakfast item is placed in front of me....not this time. Be sure to show up early on the weekend (or anytime during the week) because the line can reach epic proportions.

I've come to grips with it... I'm a Hipster. I go to places based on what everyone else says is cool. The Griddle over exceeded my expectations &amp; all the chatter was right. The prices are amazing & in spite of being packed, we got seated without me getting pissed it was taking so long or light-headed from starvation. I had THE BEST french toast & potatoes I can recall having in a very long time... and it wasn't a million bucks. Anyplace that has you torn about what to order because of the menu AND all the plates of yummy goodness is a great idea. I will be going as much as possible very soon! The only thing that would make The Griddle better would be complimentary sweatpants...

This place is awesome for brunch. Love their french toast and their pancakes are enormous. This sorta reminds me of the Chinese dim sum.

By the time my family and I got to the Griddle Cafe, we were STARVING. We had just driven up from San Diego wanting to try some Roscoe's, but to no avail--the line was way too long and we had been sitting in L.A. traffic since 10 AM with no breakfast. So, after giving up, we searched Sunset Blvd. for some decent restaurants, only relying on the advice of my sister, who goes to UCLA, but has no knowledge of anything outside of Westwood. We ended up picking this random joint and we didn't regret it at all. The food was wonderful--I had a "Some like it HOT" scramble, some of my other cousins had a Chicago scramble and another one had a "My Soul" omelette. Honestly, you can't go wrong with any of them. They all liked it, and so did I. It also helped that because we were such a big party, we get sent into one of the rooms in the back. Service was impeccable. One drawback to this place though. If you happen not to come with a big group of people, you'll probably find yourself in a cramped dining room with a ton of other people. The wait will also be pretty long, which is why I'm knocking off a star.

I must admit....the pancakes are HUGE. However, a bit dry. Not too dry, but dry enough for me to notice. ÊI really liked how they serve micro-brewed coffee and bring out the french press for you to serve yourself. They do this for the green tea, as well. ÊDefinitely a plus. The location isn't all that desirable. Ambiance is a bit grim. The food--well, let's just say I've had better. I ordered the "some like it hot" omelet with a side of "potatoes." ÊI got eggs, chips, and hash browns. ÊSince when do blah blah potatoes translate to "hash browns"?? Call it what it is!! Plus, in my opinion, eggs don't mix with cheddar cheese. For the price I paid, they should have served Feta cheese or somethin' else. I can't say that I'd go out of the way to eat there again.

Our favorite breakfast place hands down. ÊThe pancakes are the best! ÊThe pumpkin pancake is in a class of it's own. ÊThe golden ticket is also very good. ÊThe bacon is nice and crisp. ÊHe have also had burgers here and they too were yummy. ÊThe only minus, not reflected in the final tally, is that it can take a while to get a seat. ÊThe place is always busy unless you get there in the late afternoon. ÊAnother tip is to get a half order of the pancakes, they are huge, a half order is doable.

Entering through the back, you go through this long hallway, past the smoke, and weave your way through all the busy-ness to the front. Me and the other two people I was with didn't have to wait at all because there was tables open outside, so we took one. I wouldn't sit outside again because it's very noisy since you are right next to the street. But I don't think I would like sitting inside either, because it seems so crowded and even more noisy than outside. So minus one for nowhere good to sit. I got the creme de la creme french toast...it was pure heaven. But the griddle gives you HUGE portions so SHARE. And it was about $11. Anything you want with it, like bacon or eggs, is extra. I love how they serve the tea and coffee. I'll go back. I want one of each pancake :)

If you're gunning for the scenester route in L.A., you'll mostly find yourself in fairly upscale, dressed up hot spots where you dine on exotic stuff and run up $200 bar tabs. Mixed in with this, though, are a few little dive bars and restaurants where the novelty is how they're a little dirty, as it makes them feel a little unexpected and so "anti-Hollywood". The Griddle is one of these establishments. It's located on Sunset, east of Crescent Heights, meaning it's well into Hollywood territory, but still close enough to where visiting isn't entirely inconvenient. This mix also makes the crowd a little cool and ecentric - you'll see musicians, actors, producers and other creatives, as well as executives, agents and managers - nearly entirely young professional and definitely sexy. I've never been there when it wasn't beyond crowded with a line waiting outside for seating. The minute you step inside, it's instant chaos - cooks yelling, plates clanking and the buzz of people in various stages of conversation, wrapped up in an environment that feels a little grungy, a little artsy, part diner/part cool coffee shop. It's an interesting mix. The portions are ENORMOUS. People rave about the famous pumpkin pancakes. But, to be honest, this place kind of stresses me out. - the noise, grimy feel, tables mashed together. It's almost too much for something as simple as breakfast - especially after being out late the night before. The whole place is well run and well maintained but it doesn't ever really shake feeling a little too dirty - during our last visit, we sat on the sidewalk near the exterior wall and everybody was grossed out and wouldn't put their handbags anywhere but their lap. The food comes in abundance but you can tell the quality of the ingredients is very cheap. It'd be fine if it were at roadside diner prices, but for what you'll pay at Griddle, you can go elsewhere with better food and a more chill breakfast environment. I will say the staff is always really cool (even if the service is slow from it being so busy) and there's great parking behind the Rite Aid. If you go, have the pumpkin pancake. It's the best thing on the menu and more than likely a big reason why people keep going back to this restaurant.

I love breakfast joints. I dig the food here. Its not healthy, its not fancy and it ain't refined. Its straight up fat and flavor in unapologetic huge portions. If you're watching your weight, don't come here. It will do you no good. I tend to like sweet things in the morning. I usually go for french toast, the thing is I don't like maple syrup. I know, "that's unamerican!"...yeah, i don't care. I don't like it. What I do like is having French toast so rich and sweet that is doesn't need anything extra. Griddle has (or had...it wasn't on the menu last time i went) something called ÊDevil's French Toast. Its chocolate bread with chocolate chips inside made into french toast, then covered with dark chocolate syrup and whipped cream. Its every fat kids dream and it always gets people's attention when it passes them. Its really rather remarkable to watch a slew of adults turn their heads to catch a glimpse of this when the waiter brings this to me. Immediately regretting their orders. Its like I'm watching a beer commercial and the super hot chick in a bikini is walking by the college kids in slow mo. They also have something called cheesecake french toast. Its super thick slices of bread fried in graham cracker crumbs then actual cheesecake goo is piped on top. Then covered in some more graham crackers crumbs and whipped cream. Again, fat kids dream. I can never finish either of these items, i always eat one slice and save the second for later. Usually within the next 2 hours. The one savory dish I go for is the Pappas Benedict. Its just eggs benedict served on top of potato skins rather than an english muffin. And i tend to substitute the giant slab of ham with bacon. Its bomb. They of course give you way too much food. Kudos to you if you can finish. I'm impressed and slightly disgusted by you. The coffee is pretty kick ass. I'm a major coffee snob, and when i say that I don't mean I go to starbucks a lot, or that i visited or lived in ÊSeattle for 2 seconds. I mean, its a family business. Its in my blood. I have every kind of coffee maker you can imagine. Regular automatic drip, espresso machine, stove-top percolator, french press, whatever...Griddle has good coffee. They use the french press which brings out the most flavor out of the grounds. Its gonna be stronger than what your used to. They have 3 different levels of roast for you to choose from. So if you don't like strong coffee, then go with the lightest roast they have. It will be good. And if your coffee cools down (crazy!) then the wait staff will be more than happy to get you a smaller fresh pot. The only real downfall in this place is the massive crowd outside waiting to eat. And once inside it tends to be filled with people who are cooler than you or think they're cooler than you. And it gets loud, combination of the music and people wanting to be heard. If this place were less crowded and less hectic, it would be perfect

We walked in at 1130 on a Monday and skipped the 30 min wait for a table by grabbing two seats at the counter. I had the "Poached y Papas", which is basically eggs benedict on potato skins. Joyce had the "noisetta" (nutella) french toast. Great food, interesting crowd of friendly folks, very friendly Êwaiter, quick service, great coffee... I dunno, maybe we caught everybody on a good day, but what's not to like? In a class with Dottie's and Mama's in SanFran. Highly recommended, if you don't mind a little side of chaos with your food.

When I think pancakes, I think of the Griddle Cafe. It's best to go on a weekday so you don't have to wait a long time in line. If you do go on the weekend, get there early or else the wait will be about 45 minutes long. The pancakes are HUGE so it's wise to share. They have the coolest pancakes ever.....Kahlua, Baileys, Banana Nana, Oreo....etc. Oh - the guys that work there are HOTT. I've also seen celebrities there twice in the past. Once Tyra Banks and abother time Ian Ziering (Steve from 90210). Anyway, I really recommend this place.

Typically when in a foreign town we try to look for new and exciting meal options but we could not pass up stopping here again. What has become our Valentine's yearly ritual this too has been added to the list. This place is simply awesome. The wait can be a bit aggravating only because the host is a bit peculiar but for the food who cares! This time around we had the Fiesta scramble, eggs benedict and one blueberry pancake. The scramble had everything under the sun including corn tortillas, green chile, cheese, sour cream, olives and pico de gallo. This thing was HUGE, a whole plate full that I only made a small dent in. The eggs benedict were out of this world, it came with semi hollowed out potato skins fried crunchy and a huge slab of ham, it was divine, I stole many bites from my husband's plate. The blueberry pancake was so frickin special, HUGE sprinkled with powdered sugar and blueberries in the batter. I also loved the blueberry sour cream served with it, it was a sweet and tart explosion. This place is as good as it gets for breakfast, there are many many items on the menu and so hard to decide what to get. I'm just glad I don't live in SoCal otherwise I would be here every weekend. P.S. Our waiter was a Robert Pattinson look a like with a slight tan of course. The male waiters here all look like models, maybe they are all waiting tables before landing their big break.

This is by far the best breakfast I've ever had in my LIFE! We Êwent on a Friday morning as I'm told weekends are packed. It was four of us, we each started with their known french coffee which tasty and eye opening. Out comes 4 coffees the real way to make coffee with the pressure level you press down on your own to determine its strength. Now to order, after reading all these reviews I knew I wanted to try the "Tis the Season" pumpkin pancakes. My father had the omelet stuffed with potato cakes and our relatives and the eggs Benedict that sat on what looked like potato skins instead of an English muffin, thats how they make theirs and the fourth person had a basic egg whites dish. Out comes our food, mine was literally the best pancake I've ever had in my life, some of the most amazing flavors ever! See my photo, this was my left overs, as you can see barely Êtouched it was so huge, this is enough to share with a friend. ÊWe even tried a bite of their famous french toast which I would order next time too. I cant praise this spot enough, you must try it! Good Stuff, Stuart

coming to griddle cafe is definitely an all-day kind of thing. Êyou get there around 11 or noon, wait anywhere between 15 minutes to an hour, eat your heart out, then pass out in a food coma for the rest of the day. Êbasically, i come to the griddle when i'm positive it's a useless kind of day. Êbut it's completely worth it. Êfrom the attractive aspiring-actor waiters to the french pressed coffee, griddle is wonderful. Ê the pancakes are to die for and are basically bigger than your face, the french toast is glorious, and their egg dishes are massively wonderful. Êi often go and get a stack of 3 pancakes (pretty much enough food to feed a small african village ...for a week) and eat 3/4 of one and take the other 2 1/4 home and slowly nibble away for the next few mornings (or nights). Êdefinitely go here with an empty stomach and expandable waistband because you're going to need someone to roll you out of here. Ê it's good to follow them on twitter because they'll have red velvet pancake specials or brunch specials (with free mimosas!) between certain times on certain days and it's worth it. eating a red velvet pancake for breakfast is amazing. it's like you're 4 years old and sneaking a piece of birthday cake into your room for breakfast. completely ridden with guilt but oh-so-satisfying.

The food was amazing. The portions were beyond belief - particularly the pancakes. We had to share a stack because not only were there a lot, they were just slightly larger than the dinner plate it sat on. It tasted fresh, not created from some pre-made batter stored in a refrigerator somewhere in the back. The burgers were also huge and tasty. The service, to my surprise, was actually pretty good and we were a pretty big group. The wait for a table was about 10 minutes and you'd have to wait outside. But that didn't bother me as much.

YUM!!! loved the red velvet pancakes, the hash browns, and the french press coffee. the pancakes are indeed HUGE (i went with 4 ppl and we ordered 2 pancakes and hash browns and we didn't even finish one pancake!). go with people to share with and you'll be good. and make sure you check out when the owner tweets about the red velvet pancakes being available.

I returned to the bay area and the next weekend I was craving pancakes from here and I rarely ever eat them. This review is for the pancakes. These are the best ones I've ever had ..evah, evah, evah. There are so many cool ones to choose from too....struedal, strawberry frosted flake. Off the Chain!!!! The cool thing is you can just order one if you want and its the diameter of a small tire. The breakfast was alright too. Love this place, I guess there's a reason everyone does.

This is a great breakfast joint. Known for there huge pancakes dishes but should be known for there very strict "hipster-only" entrance policy. seriously- I always stick out... My favorite thing is there personal french press coffee. Don't expect anything less than a 20min wait on weekends.

Griddle cafe is THE place for pancakes. ÊThe "banana nana" definitely left me in a happy place. ÊYou also have to try the French pressed coffee. ÊIt's SO GOOD. Ê Expect a wait but the line bursting out the doors are definitely deceiving. ÊI only waited for about 15 min (party of 2) on a Sunday morning.

Stopped for breakfast on Sunday morning around 9:30. The cafe was busy but we were seated right away by the very conscientious host. The number of people waiting outside for a table when we left was daunting, so I'm glad we made it in under the wire. The seating is pretty tight and the servers are hustling, but even with the commotion, the waitstaff and general feel of the place is very friendly. We had the "Wholey Moley" whole wheat pancakes with brown sugar crumbles (comically huge stack of 3 cakes that I didn't make a dent in) French Toast with a side of sausage, and medium roast coffee - all of which were delicious. I'll definitely make a return trip.

the problem with the griddle cafe is that everything on the extensive menu sounds fabulously delicious. the first time here i shared a saturday morning fever pancake with my friend, then scotch on the rocks the next time. (disclaimer: i'm really not an alcoholic!) i've heard about the huge portion sizes here so i was wise to only order that one item. when our breakfast came (we were eating it during lunch hour) like 5 minutes later, my friend and i could not contain our amazement at how ginormous our pancakes were. the stack came with three cakes and was at least 8 inches in diameter... the cakes were as big as the plates they were served on. the pancakes smelled so fresh and were so tasty, but i think there's only so much you can have at once, because not only are the hotcakes extremely filling, they are also super sweet. i suggest having an order of pancakes, share it with someone, and order at least a side dish of something salty to balance out the taste. also... it took me a few times to realize that the entrance of the cafe is not on sunset blvd, but where the parking lot is. it is not necessary to cut through Rite Aid to get to restaurant entrance on sunset blvd.

The Griddle Cafe is a Los Angeles experience in itself. ÊIt's always crowded like crazy on the Sat & Sun mornings we make it there. ÊYou'll see all sorts of races, socioeconomic levels waiting in the line outside to come in & eat some of the best breakfast food I've ever had. ÊThe staff is rushed but still cordial. ÊThe waiters & waitresses are all attractive in their own ways. ÊThis is ALWAYS the topic of conversation for my family. There's the scruffy guy who, to me, looks like Viggo Morteson from the Lord of the Rings movies, there's our waiter today who had that I-hate-that-I'm-this-good-looking kind of feel to him. ÊThere's the dude who reminds me a little of the Latino guy from Desparate Housewives & some other tall, handsome dudes that my wife & sister always ask me to help rank. ÊThe waitresss are usually hot here too but the talent was substandard this day. ÊBefore we even got the food, my wife already said,"this makes making the trip worth it." ÊWe ordered: Eggs & Potatoes Benedict- the hollandaise sauce was off...it almost tasted vinegar-y but when I mixed it up w/ the avocados, life was good. Ê 'Tis the season- The best pancakes you'll ever have in your entire life. ÊThink of a pumpkin pie experience but in the form of a stack of 3 smothered in butter, whipped cream & pumpkin pie filling. ÊIt's the stuff of life. Shrimp Omelet- a 3 egg omelette with shrimp & pesto. ÊPerfection. Really good OJ People watching in ths place is always fun you see all kinds here. ÊBirdie did it with me & asked questions like, "how come those boys are holding hands? ÊOr "I can see her panties." ÊI can see the innocence of my child slowly washing away with every question. Good food. ÊGood service & we really absorbed the LA life for an hour.

Griddle cafe is definitely worth the wait. The wait can be long, so I always try to arrive early. There is also free parking in the back. The food! Everything that I've had from there is great.

Breakfast perfection! ÊGreat egg dishes that stray from the usual breakfast fare. ÊThe array of pancakes is mind boggling. ÊAnd absolutely delicious. But be ware, order to share. ÊPancake portions are full plate-sized, and way more than one can eat. ÊThe only dilemma is which to order: the gold brick road is especially yummy. ÊAnd let's not underestimate the importance a great cup of coffee at breakfast. ÊThe Griddle brings you a French press pot of Êfinely roasted coffee that make the wait in line more than worthwhile.

My boyfriend and I recently made the trip down to LA to visit my kid brother. We decided to treat him to brunch, and as usual, I consulted Yelp to track down the best breakfast food in all of LA. Once again, my fellow Yelpers were right! The wait was pretty insane (around 45 minutes,) but it was SO worth it. Unfortunately, after our waitress took our order, the food took FOREVER to arrive. However, the waitress was super sweet! She apologized for the long wait, and offered us OJ and/or mimosas on the house. They serve their coffee in a French press, my favorite way to brew caffeinated goodness. They even ask you if you want mild, medium, or dark roast! I ordered medium, and it was amazing. In terms of food, my brother ordered some sort of shrimp scramble, my boyfriend ordered eggs benedict served over potato skins, and I ordered cheesecake French toast with a side of bacon. As if that wasn't enough food, my boyfriend and brother decided that splitting an order of Oreo pancakes was a great idea. Griddle Cafe makes their pancakes the size of a dinner plate, and serves them 3 at a time! They were absolutely amazing, however. Plus, we gave the leftovers to my brother, who was happy to have a meal that wasn't dorm food. I didn't get to try my brother's scramble, but he said that it was very good. My boyfriend and I sampled each other's plates, and agreed that the food was absolutely incredible. The cheesecake French toast is definitely a contender for the best French toast I've had, along with the banana stuffed one at Zazie's in San Francisco. Definitely park in the lot behind the Rite Aid. The wait is so long, you would either get a ticket or pay up the ass in parking fees if you go anywhere else. We're definitely coming back here next time we visit LA!

What really iced the cake for me on this great restaurant is they have COKE ZERO on tap and seasoned salt dispensers on the table. Nothing better than crunchy steak fries and seasoned salt! Also, don't forget the chips and salsa. They blow away anything i've ever had at any taqueria or family ran mexican restaurant.

Easily one of the best breakfast joints I've ever had the pleasure of eating at! Right in the heart of Hollywood on Sunset Boulevard, the Griddle Cafe hosts a hipster and very diverse group with one of the most extensive and out-there menu's seemingly possible. It's pretty packed, and apparently once in a while you can sight a celebrity or two at this LA favorite. Watch out, though, for the insanely oversized pancakes--they're known to be amazing, but near impossible to finish. Although I didn't order the Red Velvet pancakes with Cream Cheese sauce, they are the famous course at The Griddle and looked pretty darn fabulous.

I'd been wanting to go to The Griddle Cafe for some time now. Breakfast is one of my 3 favorite meals of the day. I found out about this place online and read a lot of really good reviews. I prepared myself for the epic wait everyone keeps going on about, but that was the least of my troubles. (Granted, you get seated a lot quicker when you're a party of one.) Before I went, I perused the menu on the website and was salivating at the huge selection of breakfast sweets and treats. I saw pictures of their plate-sized pancakes and knew that that was precisely what I wanted, it IS The Griddle Cafe after all. I wasn't sure what to expect price wise because there were conflicting gauges on various websites and The Griddle doesn't list the prices on theirs. When I got there, I was shocked that the pancake I wanted was $10.95, no eggs, no bacon. However, let it be known that you get 3 of these huge flapjacks. Cool? Not really. It's like never-ending pancakes at IHOP: seems like a good idea at first, but really you're stuffed with a bellyache after the first round. So, three plate-sized banana filled pancakes doused in powdered sugar with one tiny scoop of butter. So dry! Even after trying to slather the butter on just half a cake, still dry. When I took my first bite of my "brown sugar-baked banana" pancakes, I stopped and thought, "Huh, I've made this so much better at home." The bananas tasted nothing like they had been baked in brown sugar and the pancake itself was just too dry, I'd have been better off eating cardboard. There were also remnants of someone's chocolate chip pancakes burnt to the edges of mine. I think The Griddle Cafe is one of those hotspots everyone goes to so that later they can tell everyone that they've been going there "since before it was cool." I can sum up my entire experience by saying: 1 person, 3 pancakes, 1 egg, and a few slices of bacon = $23.00. When did breakfast get so out of control?

The only good thing about this place is the huge portions. I've had their omelet and got sick afterwards. Pancakes are ok, and i've had better. The line is long and it's not worth the wait. The service is awful and the server tends to be a space cadette who forgets to bring my drink or toast.

This is definitely a popular brunch spot on the weekends, so if you don't want to wait 45 minutes to an hour for a table, drop in on a weekday. I have had so many awesome lunches here! There are very few things on the menu that aren't terrific, and if you know your own palate well enough, the menu descriptions won't trick you into ordering something you don't like. Heaping sides of steak fries if you want them. Really yummy salads (try the spicy ranch dressing!). And the Poached Y Papas is hands-down the most decadent benedict I've ever had. I order it with bacon instead of the ham steak, but it's great both ways. The opposite of heart-healthy...but great!

Waited one hour for a table and another half for food.... =( Anywho, I ordered a cappuccino, Golden Ticket, and sausages. The cappuccino was somewhat bitter since they used a dark roast, but I could care less; however, Êthey sprinkled cinnamon on it. I am not much of a cinnamon fan. So, it was kind of meh. The Golden Ticket: I knew the portion size would be big, but it wasn't big...its was rather ginormous! I was only able to eat 1/8 of it. The first bite was OH-SO-HEAVENLY. It was so soft, fluffy, and buttery. The walnut and banana complemented each other. It almost melted in my mouth. It was the best pancakes I have ever had. But then...after a few bites, it became okay. And after a few more bites, it became too cloying. The flavor became too overwhelming so I had to take a short break. The sausages. They were not bad but kind of overpriced, 3 links for $4 something. Ê All in all, their pancakes are great, but in a very moderate amount. I would suggest going with a group of friends and then splitting it. Also, order something salty alongside.

The only thing I can say is that I am glad my coworker told me about Griddle Cafe. Okay, that's not the ONLY thing I can say. We went on a Tuesday around 9:30 am and we didn't wait at all for a table. Our server was friendly and very quick. Since it was our first time we wanted to try a little bit of everything. We ordered: 1. Barry Yellow Pancakes- These pancakes had lemon and raspberry in the batter. I wasn't a huge fan of these because they were a bit too lemony for me. I'm willing to bet that the rest of their pancakes are fantastic though. 2. The Griddle Waffle- A single waffle with butter and powdered sugar. Honestly, it was one of the best waffles I have ever had. It didn't need any extra toppings. Just a little bit of their delicious syrup and it was great. I would definitely get this again. 3. Chicago Charlie's Scramble- This was great. Eggs, potatoes, italian sausage, bell peppers, etc. The whole thing was wonderful. We ordered coffee which comes in a french press. My only complaint is that it's basically $4 for coffee per person. I can't wait to go back!

i ordered the apple cinnamon pancakes and my friend got some chicken breast sandwich that actually tasted pretty darn good. Êthey have decent food here, but the portions are, let's say....humongonormous?? my triple stack of pancakes was seriously enough to feed a small third world country family for about 2 days. Êi have to say that i felt pretty confident walking into this place that i would be able to polish off a good amount of food. Êbut as i started my journey across apple cinnamon land, the adventure became more and more of a challenge. Êwhen i finally tapped out, fair estimate says that i finished about 1 out of 3 pancakes that was served to me. Êwhen the waitress brought out my pancakes, i couldn't see ANY part of the plate they were sitting on because they were completely covering it. Êthese are some SERIOUS portions. Ê needless to say, i walked out of the place with my head held low in shame. Ênext time, i'll definitely have to take some reinforcements with me. park in the Rite-Aid lot.

my boyfriend and i came here over the summer and i remember it was SOOOOOO hot. it was one of those days when it was almost 100 degrees at the beach, so i don't know why we thought a hot breakfast would be a good idea. anyhow, we shared the enormous blueberry pancakes. i thought the blueberry sour cream on top would be weird but it was way good. and, like everyone has said, the pancakes are HUGE. like giant monster huge. like me and my boyfriend barely made a dent in our shared order of pancakes. it wasn't horribly crowded when we went mid-morning, but for some reason the service was sub-par. my boyfriend ordered a side of bacon which never came. when we reminded our server, he came back 15 minutes later...with eggs. what's that all about? so while the pancakes are quite good, i'll probably stick to my neighborhood since it wasn't mind-blowingly amazing enough for me to make the drive. but if i'm ever in the area to begin with, i'll definitely stop in if i'm in the mood for something sweet, huge, or both!

Came here Saturday morning around 9ish and it was jam pack! The two of us sat at the counter. It was REALLY noisy in there. : .. ÊI got the Tequila Sunrise which is Salsa roja, tortilla, beans, eggs cheese stacked with a side of chicken sausage. It was alright not too exciting. My sister got the waffle which was one of the best waffles I have eaten but you only get one and it cost $7.95! I would have gotten pancakes since we were in The GRIDDLE Cafe, but the size of it really scared me. It was SO BIG, 3 stacked! I would come back here to try the pancakes and that's it.

I don't know how this place is always so packed.... ÊI drive by it and shake my head. ÊI ate here about a month ago and it was mediocre at best. ÊAnd by that, I mean, it pretty much sucked. Not only did we have time to do the crossword as we were sitting in the bum dominated courtyard of the director's guild but we waited for almost an hour. ÊAn hour, despite that the bald host hit on my in front of my friend and kept telling us, "not you, yet, I remember you" and leering. ÊGood thing I was with a friend, it was creepy. Ê Finally, we get seated, at which point we are famished. ÊWe have been waiting for an hour, already.... well, we get to wait more. ÊThank God that we were seated in front of the huge jar of candy, since I ate a lot of it while we waited and waited and waited. Ê We ordered, finally.... Êhe got the eggs and chili, I had the breakfast burrito with bacon. ÊI will give them that they let you substitute easily, since I'm not a big chorizo fan. ÊI personally am not impressed by the menu, it seems hard to find something you want. ÊI don't want an entire order of banana pancakes.... shouldn't that be a side? ÊDessert for breakfast? I already ate all that candy while I was WAITING Êfor someone to take my order. Ê Regardless, a breakfast burrito and a glorified omelet are not hard to make, Êwhy did it take 45 minutes. ÊAt this point, I've given up my whole sat afternoon for a breakfast burrito and a jar of candy.... ÊFood was not spectacular. ÊIt was fine. ÊI ate about half and left the rest, the salsa was too runny and made the tortilla soggy on the bottom, basically inedible. ÊThe eggs were good. ÊWhy isn't the burrito served with hash browns or home fries? ÊInexplicable. Ê Maybe this place is better during the week, when the clientele is mainly out of work people who have 2 hours to devote to breakfast, but in my mind? ÊThere are places that pay you for 2 hours of your time.... unless it is amazing, it's not worth the hassle. ÊAnd this falls way way short of even good. ÊI recommend the candy and avoid the creepy bald guy. . .he should be in the back, not manning the front of the house. ÊGlad he thought I was cute though... thanks!

Griddle baby! Listen- here's my tip- go there before you get hungry, right when you're on the cusp of hunger, not once you've gotten to that point cause you will have to wait. Now let's get to the food- cause that's what it's all about. I'm big on finding a great cup of coffee- and the Griddle's got it- French Press. I've been here a couple of times and somehow had the self control not to order pancakes or french toast, but I've seen and tasted them and yes ma'am, they are delicious! I opt for scrambles and omelets- they have a scramble with tomato, basil, mozarella---go there! Or, try the Chili My Soul omelet- also fantastic! Their menu of "griddle items" (pancakes and such) is seemingly never ending and just thinking about it makes me want to go, but alas that god damned line!

The food here is a solid four stars while the atmosphere is one star. ÊWe came at around 1pm and were sat almost immediately. ÊThis cafe is depressingly dark inside, unbelievably cramped and loud. ÊThe quarters are so close that the waiter's shirt kept brushing the top of my food when he would pass. ÊThe tables were a bit greasy and made everything feel a little grimy as a result. ÊWe got the pumpkin pancake, Saturday morning fever and the the apple french toast and all were delicious and they got the food out to us quickly. ÊDef ask for one pancake as it is HUGE and takes the price from $12.95 to $6.95 (this is an estimation, I don't remember exact prices) and it would be a challenge to even finish one of these pancakes. ÊWe didn't have anything savory except a side of potatoes, which were passable but nothing spectacular. ÊI wouldn't come back as the bad atmosphere trumped the quality of food.

One of my least favorite things about Los Angeles is the inconsistent food I typically find there, but Griddle Cafe is a shining exception! On our last morning in the area we happened upon Griddle Cafe while trolling Yelp for a decent brunch spot. The positive reviews don't begin to do it justice! This place has an amazing menu (ranging from red velvet pancakes to delicious latin-fusion egg dishes like the breakfast tacos that I had). The staff are friendly and efficient and the atmosphere reminds you of a gallery opening or the bar just before a live performance -- everything is buzzing! I can't recommend Griddle Cafe enough and I plan to eat there again and again given future opportunities!

SO GOOD. I have had a lot of french toast in my life, but HANDS DOWN, best french toast ever. HUGE. I don't know what they do to make it so delicious, but if you haven't yet, you must try their original french toast. Two pieces of french toast the size of a book, piping hot, and perfectly moist. The place is always very crowded and noise levels are high, so don't expect to be able to converse with your friends without shouting. Staff is super friendly.

The menu mentioned Creme de la Creme (or something like that) french toast was a must for those who love cheesecake. Me, being a big cheesecake lover, had to order this.

Quaint, a little derelict and very popular. The pancakes here were just too huge. They scared me frankly. Trust me, I can eat a whole pancake here if I tried but that would have to serve it to me in 24 pieces separately. But when it comes to your table, my stomach just churns and I lose it. Yes, food intimidates me but I'm not anorexic. Food is good, but there is more of a scene than anything else. And the 30 minute and more wait is designed and done on purpose. It's like a club in there sometimes. BTW, free parking is available down Fairfax and Crescent Heights. This is for those who want to walk off the 20 kilos of pancake you just ate.

This is a great place for people watching, but you'll wait a long time for a table. Griddle arguably has the best french toast in LA -- the Devil's Daydream. ÊThey should play 70s black metal when they serve it at your table. ÊThe pancakes are enormous and you'll never finish 'em.

unbelievably good breakfast spot in west hollywood. Êthe menu has tons of inventive options, like red velvet pancakes, chocolate chip cookie crusted french toast, etc.. Êthough it has plenty of diet busting, high calorie richness-and-sweetness choices, they have a few healthy items as well - egg white omelets, etc. Êeverything is over-the-top delicious, and coffee is served with your table's very own french press.

Mmmm, the griddle. ÊIf you have any respect for pancakes or french toast at all, you owe it to yourself as a hungry, food-fiending human being to go to this place. ÊBut, don't come here and form any opinions about the place before you try one of their spectacular pancakes or french toast items. ÊAnd, believe me, they have a lot to choose from, and each one just sounds more crazy and decadent than the previous one. ÊI don't even really like peanut butter-y foods, especially for breakfast (besides the occasional recess puff cereal bowls), but the Peanut Bubba French Toast was amazing, no joke. ÊThe Golden Ticket was crazyy good, too, even though I am not a big fan of walnuts in my food! ÊJust be prepared for a really, really sweet meal. And, when I say sweet, I am not talking about the surfer-dude-totally-wicked-rad kind of sweet, I am talking about they-must-be-hiding-some-oompa-loompas-in-the-?back-with-huge-vats-of-sugar-and-syrup-goodness kind of sweet, know what I'm saying? But the BEST thing about this place, besides their delicious food, has to be the portions they serve it in. Don't think you can walk in here and finish a whole plate, or even half your plate. ÊYou definitely get your money's worth; heck, I think my leftover pancakes lasted me an entire week (maybe, maybe not). So, don't throw a little hissy fit when you see that you have to dish down $10 for some pancakes and toast for breakfast because it's actually more like putting down an investment for food for the next few days. ÊI decided to hold back on the extra star because I tried their omelettes, specifically the one filled with your choice of chili, and it didn't really blow me away or anything. Their sandwiches are pretty good, but not life-changing either. ÊReally, your best bet with this place is to stick to the 2 pages they devote to purely pancakes and french toast. Trust me, you won't be disappointed (or even breakfast-less for that matter for a while).

Mmm, overrated. We ordered the waffle-came w/tons of powdered sugar on top and it was heavy. It didn't specify that it was a 'whole wheat' or 'whole grain' but it wasn't a standard waffle. I asked for my potatoes well done, as I like them crispy. They weren't. Turkey maple sausage-it's ok and a nice change but not great. We ventured from the west side as the 405 looked scary due to the rain. We were going to 'More Than Waffles' in the Valley and were side tracked. The best part? My coffee in individual French presses and you choose the roast. Love that, and I'm not even a coffee drinker.

We put our names on the list around 9:45 am on a Saturday morning, walked around the block, popped in Rite Aid next door, and breezed into our seats shortly after. Food came about 30 minutes after that, which was just enough time to make me really hungry, and I needed to be to deal with the strawberries-and-cream waffle and some of hub's Mom's french toast. Finally I had to just stop eating because I was going to hurt myself. The bacon is great, the coffee is overwhelming, and overall definitely worth the wait.

Griddle me this, griddle me that, griddle me all morning so I wanna come back. Griddle, you can griddle me anytime. I'm an LA dude, but not an "LA" dude, feel me. I was born and raised in LA and the Sunset strip, clubs, VIP attitude is not my thing. Being humble and keepin' it true, now that's my thing. Sometimes I feel like a New Yoker trapped in an LA dudes body. Now, like me, the griddle is humble yet packs a powerful punch. Pow! Second time I've been there and it was bomb! We waited 40 minutes and unlike some other spots, the crowd was multicultural and diverse. What that means to me is that the food at griddle hits all types of varied taste buds. Ok, so we sat at the round bar and were greeted by what had to be a male model who I'm pretty sure doesn't indulge in any food at the griddle. He was cool, friendly and on it. We had iced tea and iced coffee served within seconds. Although I love breakfast, I'm a vegetarian and a very picky guy on top of that so it can be tough to appease my palate. I ordered an egg white omelet with tomatoes, onion and avocado along with potatoes and 1 big phat blueberry pancake. My girl ordered the fiesta scrambled. Food was served in a timely manner and boy oh boy what a breakfast feast. The eggs were good, potatoes were very good and the blueberry pancake was huuuge. The Fiesta scramble was big as well. Next time, I go to the griddle I will make sure I run before hand so that I'm ravenous enough to actually finish my meal. Food was really tasty, the quality was there and I dig the non LA, fun atmosphere. The only draw back was that they charged me $7.95 for one blue berry pancake. Next time, I better get the phat stacks pancakes for that price. Overall, very good and kept me stuffed the whole day. GGGGGG Griddle Unit!

The portions are huge!!! I ordered Mom's french toast with a glass of their fresh squeezed OJ. My sister had the BLUESberry pancakes. We went on a Monday hoping the wait wasn't as long as the weekends. We got seats in about 25 minutes. Waited another 15-20 minutes for the food. The food is great but I don't know if I would go again. We got sat at the horseshoe counter so we were inches away from our neighbors. It's just a little to close for comfort.

i ADORE this place! i've been there 3 times so far, and each time has been delicious! i did finally learn (on my 3rd try) that 1 pancake stack is enough. i had breakfast for a week the first time i went and ordered a full stack haha. not 100% sure of the names but from what i remember... -mounds of pleasure pancakes - chocolate + coconut = if you love that combo, you will DIE with this. almost dessert-like. -pumpkin pancakes - perfect for eating in autumn =) the flavor is perfect -lemon ricotta + raspberry - refreshing with fruit, a bit tart if you like that i haven't had any of their eggs or other meals, i am too much of a sucker for pancakes (in general). one part of me wishes i could eat there every day and try everything on the menu, but i'm sure my stomach (and arteries) would be very upset if that was the case lol. you do have to wait a long time, especially brunch time on a saturday, but it's worth it to me. the place is very small, but the service i've had has been good. the guys in the front trying to seat people always seem pretty stressed out and flustered however (but i can understand and don't take it personally).

To be honest I was very hyped for this trip I had on a saturday afternoon , so much that I was completely happy with waiting in line for 45 minutes just to be seated in a crammed little restaurant with tiny tables. ÊBut.. regardless the wait wasn't too bad because I was utterly excited to try this place (...and I bumped into Jeanine!! from So You Think You can Dance!! ) Ê I drooled over the menu because each entree sounds absolutely delicious. But we ended up getting a pumpkin pancake and a egg omelet dish. Sorry I dont really remember the names.. but thats also because there was nothing really memoriable about either of them. ÊI was sligthly disappointed... Its not like the food was bad. It was decent... but definately not worth the hype. The portions are large though! In general, Its a little restaurant that I would stop by to once in a while if I was really hungry one morning and there was no wait... but there was a wait... so im not sure this place would be on the top of my list to come back to again.

I'm a small guy but with a big stomach. This place was absolutely wonderful to experience. Ê Unfortunately, when a place is as popular as this cafe it's hard to find it without a crowd. Êespecially with their hours of operation. Very few places have actually made me full & content when walking out. Job well done, made my inner fat man smile.

I've been adjusting my sleep schedule to London time and finally awake earlier enough to make it out to breakfast. I tried the Griddle Cafe today and it was AMAZING! I had "The Golden Ticket" pancakes. It came with bananas, walnuts, caramel, and steusel mixed into it. One order is three ginormous pancakes that are too big for the plate. You could share it with three other people and everybody would be full. ÊThere were so many Êdifferent choices for pancakes and french toast, its ridiculous. I also split the "some like it HOT" scramble with my friend. It's like an open faced mexican breakfast burrito. I was a little disappointed that they don't serve corned beef hash. The bacon was alright. This place is definitely a hot spot. I went on a Monday and the place was packed! Best of all they serve breakfast all day! http://www.anitaeat.com

Hubby is obsessed with French Toast, and he swears up and down this is the best place to get it in L.A. Every single thing we've ordered here has been amazing, especially the incredibly huge pancakes and the always-perfect coffee. Needless to say, this is our favorite place to get breakfast, though the parking situation can get quite maddening, especially when you're starving for those pancakes!

ommmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm nom nom nom. i don't usually like getting breakfast in the morning because it gives me food coma, but who cares when you just had griddle? 5/5 THE FOOD & DRINKS: - red velvet panCAKE: came covered in cream cheese frosting, and had a little bit more cocoa than most other red velvet cakes i've had. the frosting makes it a little heavy, but it's still noms. 4.5/5 - the golden ticket: i don't know what i was thinking when i ordered this by myself. i got 3 pancakes since they didn't ask me how many i wanted (you can usually choose how many), and trust me, i was eating that for the next week. the pancakes were a little too sweet for my liking, but it was delicious all the same. make sure you ask for no whipped cream if you plan on taking it home, since it'll just make your pancakes soggy. 3/5 - yellow brick road: god, i love butterscotch and caramel. this one hits the spot. you'll just have to try this one for yourself! 5/5 -french pressed coffee: super cute, but pretty expensive. you can't share it either, or else they'll charge you. kinda sucks, but their coffee has always been delicious. 5/5 THE SERVICE: - i've always come here in the morning, and have always been seated pretty immediately. the waiters are all super, super friendly and make sure to come around to check on you, even though they're almost always busy. they're also extremely humble, too. case in point: georgia b. and i saw a celebrity couple there once, and the waiters just shrugged it off like any angeleno would :) 5/5 too bad i'm not going to be living in LA anymore, or else i would be here few weeks for brunch :(

yayy have come here twice and it's been ridiculously delicious and excessive each time. i found out there is free parking in a lot on the right after you turn onto fairfax with validation... great! and yes there will most likely be a lengthy wait... but it is worth it! favorites so far have probably been the black magic oreo pancakes and nutella french toast (which i asked them to combine with the peanut bubba once by coating it in the peanut butter crunch and it was super good)... red velvet pancake was good too but the frosting is pretty sweet and apparently the one thing on their menu that they don't like people changing so they can't put less frosting on...? french press coffee is great and necessary for me to pair with any sweet griddle dish... also have sampled some friends' savory dishes and they were good as well. so everyone can go gorge themselves and be completely stuffed and happy!

I liked this place. ÊI had dark chocolate french toast that was topped with whipped cream and also tried the pecan pancakes with butterscotch. ÊIt was more like dessert than breakfast, but I'm not complaining. ÊThey have good portion sizes and you definitely leave the restaurant satisfied. ÊThe restaurant has a homey/divey atmosphere, which goes with the theme of the restaurant. ÊThe service was okay...our waiter wasn't very friendly or warm, but he provided us with our meals in a timely manner, which was fine. ÊThis place doesn't seem to have air-conditioning, so try to eat outside during hot days - it can get pretty toasty inside.

For my first visit, I ordered the Nutella French Toast. Pretty damn good. For my second visit, I ordered the Oreo pancakes, a full stack. Pretty good, but slightly dry, like a cake with no frosting. It was great washed down with their awesome coffee (I get their dark roast and drink it black). For my third visit, I felt like eggs, so got the Pomodoro omelet. Side of fresh fruit was fresh and sweet, the shrimp in the omelet were plentiful and tender, and the only negative thing about the omelet was that it had a toooonnn of garlic (which isn't even a bad thing). For my fourth visit, I ordered the Strawberries n Creme Belgian Waffle, with a side of bacon. Yeah, the bacon's pretty damn good here: thick and meaty. The waffle was honestly just okay. Again I felt like it was like cake with no frosting to cut the dryness. The brown sugar sour cream topping was good, but then again I kept thinking I was eating straight sour cream. I mean, straight sour cream mixed with brown sugar. All in all, I'd get the pancakes again (like the strawberries and Frosted Flakes version), but by far the best from this place is the French toast, the bacon, and the coffee.

Went here earlier this year on a Sunday morning around 9:00 a.m. and found nearby parking easily and got seated immediately. ÊI had read Yelp reviews before going here but I do not recall reading about just how huge their portions are, so it came as a surprise to see the huge pancakes coming out of the kitchen. ÊThe pancakes could easily feed 2-4 people (depending on how hungry the people are). ÊIt looked like we barely put a dent in our food and we had quite a bit of leftovers to take home with us. ÊMy sister ordered the Wholey Moley (whole wheat) pancakes and I ordered the Creme de la Creme (cheesecake) French toast. ÊMy French toast while tasty was much too much and just too sweet. ÊCouldn't help but get it though, I love cheesecake! ÊNext time I will split the Wholey Moley with my sister. ÊI can't wait to come back again, for both the food and eye candy (servers and customers)!

It was about 11am on a Thursday morning, my girlfriend and i were hungry for some bangin breakfast for the buck. We hit up Griddle Cafe and thought wow this place is jam packed! We entered and sat down anxioulsy waiting to see the menus. We eventually go to it and ordered our Ojs with the red velvet pancake and the peanut bubba french toast. We waited about twenty minutes until the food was ready. We got the food and started to drool on the portions. First bite was amazing, and very filling. We shared our meals and seriously after about 8 bites of each we were stuffed. This place is really really good, however tooo heavy for everyday. I would reccomend to anyone to try it out and go and enjoy a great morning. I will go back once in a while and enjoy myself different types of food on the menu and feel the love in the food.

The guy next to us ordered the pancakes and my friend and I could not stop laughing when the 12-in wide, 5-in high stack arrived. He offered to share it with the entire restaurant - it was hilarious. The food was incredible, really hit the spot. The omlette pomodoro comes highly recommended. It was very crowded, we waited about 20 minutes to get a table, but well worth it.

We came on a weekday afternoon around 2:30pm and had no trouble finding a failed meter right in front of the restaurant on Sunset Blvd. ÊThere are meters with a 1 hour limit, but no parking during traffic hours (anti-gridlock zone..) We were seated quickly at a booth, and it was about half empty, but it filled up more later. ÊI guess we missed the lunch and breakfast crowd. ÊIt looks like an old school breakfast joint, and there are flats screen tvs on the wall. The menu has a pretty wide selection. ÊWe heard they have huge portions, but my boyfriend and I decided that between the 2 of us, we should get 4 things because there were so many things we wanted to try. We decided we had to go with the pancakes, since that's what they're known for. ÊThe banana one was humongous, and you can get 1, 2, or 3 pancakes. ÊThey're topped with powdered sugar and melted butter, and the table also has real maple syrup. ÊI'm not even a big pancake fan, but I really liked the banana. ÊIt was just the right amount of fluffiness. ÊBe warned - these things are huge. There are many scramble options, and we got the muscle man scramble, which had egg whites, tomatoes, spinach, and turkey sausage. ÊIt needed some salt, pepper, and hot sauce. ÊIt was a bit expensive for a scramble, and I think I liked the one at Toast better. ÊThe egg whites were super buttery tasting, and it was a little too much for me. ÊBe sure to ask for the mueslix bread that accompanies it because they won't bring it automatically. The giant salad was $6.95 and was packed. ÊIt's hard to find such a big salad - the romaine leaves are literally jammed into a bowl, and it's topped with chopped red onion, chopped tomatoes, mushrooms, and avacado. ÊI prefer my onions chopped, and there's a good proportion of ingredients in this salad. ÊI scooped half of it into a separate plate to make it easier to eat, but the bowl still looked completely full. ÊThe cornbread that comes with it is big, warm, and sweet - it's not so much like a cornbread, but it's really good (especially the crust), and it's topped with orange zest butter. I also got the chicken "my soul." ÊIt's a grilled chicken breast with chili and fruit on the side. ÊI thought the chicken breast would be topped with the chili, but they're all served separately, which is fine. ÊThe chicken itself was moist but not seasoned enough. ÊThere are 5 choices of chili daily, all of varied spice levels. ÊI wanted the mango habanero chicken chili, but after I tried it, I decided I couldn't handle the level 8 spiciness, so we went with the santa fe, which is a standard beef chili. ÊOthers included a vegetarian spicy chili, chili verde, and a poblano turkey. ÊYou can sample the chilis before you decide which one you want. ÊThe santa fe tasted like a standard chili and wasn't too exciting. ÊYou also get to choose 3 toppings for the chili, and we went with jack cheese, pico de gallo, and roasted red peppers, which they were generous with. ÊNext time I want to try topping it with chocolate chips, which is an option.. maybe it'd be like a mole. ÊThe fruit cup is pretty large and had fresh strawberries, ripe pineapple, and grapes - they were really nice about my melon allergy, so they made sure I didn't have any in there. The coffee looked good in a French press, and they have interesting sounding alcoholic and non alcoholic drink selections. ÊWater is refilled pretty quickly. Ê Service is as you'd expect for a breakfast pace - pleasant server, but she wasn't around much. ÊFood didn't take too long to come out. ÊOur total bill was $38 (without tax), which is not bad considering the amount of food we got and the area we were eating in. ÊIt's a true breakfast/brunch place (unlike a lot of the fancier brunch places in LA) with genuine food and innovative selections.

my FAVORITE breakfast place ever. although the wait can be a bit long some days, it's to be expected. and the guy who does the seating is so friendly, efficient and will always remember your name/face that you can't get upset at the wait. order the chocolate chip french toast and ask for strawberries on top. heaven. sheer heaven. if you like saltier breakfast items, try the tequila sunrise. it's nowhere as good as the french toast, but it'll do. poached y papas benedict is also tasty. what i dont like are the kickin' and screamin' breakfast tacos -- theyre a little bland for me. portions are massive, be hungry. and ask if you can sit in the back booths if you have a group of 4 or more.

WOOOOOOW! Where do I start? This place met all expectations, and then some! My over-sized, powder dusted, scotch on the rocks pancakes were THE BOMB.COM! FYI make sure you downsize your portion of pancakes unless you have a bottomless pit as a stomach. I went with two pancakes, and barely made it halfway through. Also, make sure you have something to chase the sweetness of the pancakes. My choice of chaser was bacon. F'n awesome also.

A quality cup of coffee is a requirement for me in the morning, or else the rest of the day just doesn't go quite right. ÊThe dark roast press pot coffee at the Griddle Cafe is truly awesome, and by the time I have attempted to finish my order of a single pancake (seriously, they are the size of a barstool) I'm in a state of bliss. ÊMy favorite is the raspberrry and lemon which comes sans the giant dollop of topping that dominate most of the other pancakes. ÊAs an added bonus there's parking available in back (shared with the Rite Aid lot), because the last thing I want to do before I've had my coffee is try to find street parking.

Great food! Sometimes stop here with a friend or two weekend mornings for breakfast. Always a nice crowd, though it can be long to be seated. The staff are nice and there's always the opportunity to see a celebrity. This is one of my favorite places.

the griddle is good. not mindblowing, but good. you've probably read by now about the gluttonous pancake portions. it's really excessive. i think the griddle (and the customers) would be better served by an "all-you-can-eat" style menu - bringing out one pancake at time. because no one finishes it all, and it's a very big waste. it's pretty gross actually, and i felt like an awful, wasteful, american at the end of my butter and syrup drenched meal. the service is ok at best... the hour long line outside was long (duh) and rather unorganized, they gave my friend a completely wrong order (eggs benedict when he ordered a chicken sandwich) and they forgot to bring me syrup (boo fucking hoo, i know, but it IS a pancake joint). the boys i was with loved their meals, loved the french press coffee (free refills!), and i liked the half of a banana pancake that i could finish. i think the griddle is pretty overrated, it's loud and kind of unpleasant, and you can get far better greasy goodness right down the road at roscoe's.

Look, if you're going to ruin yourself with good ol' fashioned American breakfast foods, Griddle is the place to do it. Their huge portions are delicious and terrible all at once, but this cafe on Sunset is a great little spot if you're craving eggs and pancakes...LOTS of eggs and pancakes, which I always am. ÊI also like that it's on the strip of Sunset where there are a number of little shops and restaurants to casually walk to and check out. We even saw Ian Ziering of 90210 fame chilling out here once. And if this place is good enough for Steve Sanders, it's good enough for you and I.

If there is one thing that would make me love LA, it would be the Griddle Cafe. Ê(Sorry LA...me loves to hate you...) While I feel the host had a bit of a complex (although I don't blame him with the massive amount of people waiting in line), the service was exceptional once we were seated. ÊThe best part about it...French Press Coffee...mmm...reminescent of Blue Bottle Coffee in SF. ÊYes. ÊThat good! ÊIt's definitely a good sign when a restaurant has great food and awesome coffee! So, upon venturing into the menu, you are hit with a wide selection that could only make your mind change about a thousand times! ÊEverything looked sooo good! ÊBut seeing how the pancakes are bigger than the serving plate and ridiculously sized (although the baily's and khalua pancakes looked like an eye opener!), I decided against them. ÊBTW, portions are HUGE, so don't go overboard. I opted for the Creme de la Creme French Toast. ÊImagine this: French Toast with a Graham Cracker Crust and CHEESECAKE Êfilling over the top...a CHEESECAKE lover's dream. The breakfast burrito was okay...it was...meh...it could've been more flavorful...Tapatio saved the day! ÊFinally, the Strawberries and Creme Belgian Waffles were...different, but a good different! ÊTake a guess at what the secret ingredients are...it's a pleasant surprise, indeed! All in all...it's my favorite spot in LA (that's saying a lot!). ÊCelebrity sightings, amazing food and don't forget the coffee! ÊThanks, Griddle Cafe!

The 880 amazing reviews already speak for them self!! ÊGriddle Cafe- has a large menu, with hundreds of options! Great for everyone's liking! Their coffee is the best I have ever had- really! The only reason I couldn't give them 5 stars is because the wait is always really long- not their fault though- because it is truly worth it!! But just a heads up.

ordered the red velvet and oreo pancake. first couple of bites were sheer heaven and then...........starchy and overwhelming. ladies and gents this is the mark of a bad pancake. as a pancake connoisseur with a degree in pancakes 101, #1 sometimes bigger is def not better and #2 a truly delicious pancake would not have been leftover on my plate! another caveat, everything here is ordered separately cause it's so 'holly-hood' so expect to pay more than you were hoping to for breakfast. the waitstaff will not accomodate to specialize your order or maybe it was just my dick of a waiter who actually reminded me of the soup nazi from Seinfeld (not lookswise but attitudewise of course). for example, if you request sans whipped cream guess what, you're still gonna get that whipped cream! needless to say I was not impressed. in the words of Bart Simpson, meeeeh.

The Griddle Cafe is downright awesome. ÊI've been here 3 times or so and have never been disappointed with the food.

We came here with some friends from Pasadena on a Sunday morning. We had about a 30 or 40 min. wait. The place was crazy busy!!!!! The street rapper outside who gets your name & makes you your own personalized song was quite entertaining & helped the time pass much quicker! Sorry that I can't remember his name right now. Once we were seated the service was quick & friendly at a hurried pace. My friends blueberry pancakes looked amazing. I ordered the Shrimp Blt with fruit. It was yummy.....but a little on the rich side. My husband had some sort of burger & he loved it. It was so big that he couldn't quite finish.......shocker!!!!! The portions are huge here.....you may want to split dishes.

ahh the griddle. good news first as always. by bf and i had heard about this place long ago from some friends and were told to try the pumpkin pancakes(his fav) so we went yesterday and heres how it went. on the initial drive by, there were tons of people hanging outside in 2 lines that kinda wrapped around the building.both a good sign and a bad sign. we decided to try our luck and we were told it would be a 25 min wait. with all the peeps outside, we werent sure if that was right, but BEHOLD!!!! it was right on the money! :) after we sat, we ordered the pumpkin pancakes and a few sides. i ordered oj to drink and baby ordered coffee. i usually dont order oj at a breakfast restaurant because i hate boxed oj, but each new spot i will give it a whirl. the griddle had VERY FRESH SQUEEZED OJ!!! mmmmm. winning!!!!!! i dont like coffee, but baby said his coffee was the best restaurant coffee he remembers having. so i took a sip. it was good. just black. now thats good coffee people, and i hate coffee. the food came fairly quickly, and it was awesome. best pumpkin pancakes ever in the world. they were topped with pumpkin pie filling and whipped cream. yumbo!!! we shared everything because the portions are insane, and 32$ later, we were very happy and full. bad news: this restaurant is waaaay to small for the business they do. its extremely loud and busy with very little room to maneuver. we were sitting at the counter right next to each other and had to lean in to hear what the other person was saying. also, the counter is a direct view into the kitchen that doesnt or didnt seem to have a door, which is bad. a restaurant that busy tends to have a kitchen floor covered in bits of this and that, which gives the illusion that the entire restaurant is dirty.

ok, i'm not a breakfast person admittedly but i tried this place with a friend. here's my honest review. Wait: went on a saturday aroudn 11am. there was a line out the door. the wait went fast actually. only about 20 minutes max. Service: while waiting, we were herded in line by an east coast host named Alex. he was loud, funny, and had good jokes. if you are easily offended, you may think him brash and rude, but he was part of that "east coast" experience in LA. i liked him a lot and he was really nice to us. our waiter was also very nice and helpful food: the portions are ridiculously huge. the pancakes are the size of a big dinner plate and you get 3 of them. honestly i only wanted one because i knew i wouldn't finish them all but they do not serve individual pancakes. they were ok, but it's just too much and you can totally forget your diet here because it's bad calorie city. the problem with the big portions is that they get cold because you can't eat them all. if they were smaller they would still be warm and you can finish them. but that's the draw of this place, the big portions. however, it's really sad to see all the food go to waste. most people's plates were only 25-50% eaten. so this means all this food is being thrown away and meanwhile you have homeless people on sunset blvd begging for money can food. makes no sense to me. anyway, it was good. would i come back: well i saw some of the non breakfast stuff and it looked good but this is really a breakfast place so i dont think i would come back unless someone really liked breakfast. suggestion: get one order of pancake if you're in a group and share.

i had to try this place. anything over 400 reviews is a must try. it taken a while since the line is always big and i rarely get out of the house before 10am on the weekend. finally i had an 8am morning and quickly sped over. even that early 3 of us couldn't get a table, so we sat at the bar. let me preface this by saying i'm not a fan of sweet breakfasts. i do enjoy them once in a while but it's not pushing the culinary boundries in my book. i could put syrup and whip cream on my shoe and it wouldn't taste half bad. BUT, if you are in the mood for a sweet meal breakfast this is the place for you. i got the banana pancakes which were good. bend your arm 90 degrees and that's the diameter of pancakes. the word "huge" doesn't do it justice. i had the poached y papas benedict which was so greasy and salty. the slice of ham was as big as my place and thick, but so salty i could only eat a small portion. the hollandaise sauce was good but they drenched the eggs with it. the potatoes tasted like they bought the TGIF potato skins from costco and reheated them. we also had the baked potato omelette which was gross. it should've been called fried potato omelette. if you come here, get something sweet and stay away from everything else.

The food was absolutely AMAZING! The waiters were totally cool and definitely CUTE! But for me the whole eating out experience is just as much the ambience as the food itself. This place was really loud, I could hardly hear my boyfriend sitting across the table from me. It was super crowded and the tables are practically on top of eachother. Plus, the crowd there was a little too trendy for me - Hollywood wannabees. Other than that, the food was really, really good. I'll probably go back, just make sure to go at a quieter time of the day.

Went back again and had the caramel butterscotch etc pancakes. Pretty damn tasty, but Christ they give you a lot of food. Going here is bad for my self-esteem. Also for African children, who could use the pounds of leftovers I always end up throwing away or picking at for weeks until I'm sick of them (I'm confident one pancake could feed most of Zimbabwe). Anyway, this place is still solid. Unfortunately, even their best pancakes haven't made me go "WOWOWOW" (in fact, I've never uttered that in my life--but I desperately want to), which annoys me for such a popular place. It's basically just a very good spot for pancakes or French toast.

The french toast is amazing as are the poached y papas (the Griddle version of eggs benedict over potatoes). ÊDrawbacks: Êseating can take a long time, the inside is very LOUD and the tables are quite small, but the food is great. ÊParking is usually okay in the Rite Aid behind the Griddle though I've had to circle the lot before to wait for someone to leave.

We went here before the restaurant opened on Sunday morning. After doing a lot of research on the menu and the restaurant we knew exactly what we wanted. 1. Nutella French Toast was A-MA-ZING! YUM YUM YUMMYY!! 2. Banana pancake was good but I was not too thrilled 3. French pressed coffee was good as well 4. Hash browns were unique but tasty! Service was GREAT! I had a flight in 2.5 hours and the airport was an hour away. As soon as we arrived to the restaurant, I notified the server of my tight schedule and they brought out the food ASAP! In addition, he was very friendly and accommodating even though the restaurant was packed! The restaurant is pretty small and the atmosphere is simple. This is something that is very normal in LA especially in a popular location such as Sunset blvd. I can't wait to go back and try new things! :)

Well worth the wait! Food portions are gargantuan if you get pancakes besides the red velvet, which is just one. But that one is made exceptionally well and goes great with the cream cheese frosting. Seating is pretty cramped inside so I hope you like your temporary neighbors as you'll be eating within a foot of them. Also had the French toast which was amazing even without syrup. The bread slices were the size of French bread and cooked perfectly. If you're in the mood for a great breakfast and don't mind a 30 min. wait on a weekend, then definitely head here.

I have to knock off 2 stars for inconsistency. ÊI decided to come back with 2 friends because I wanted to show them how awesome their pancakes are. ÊWe were all pretty disappointed. ÊThe pancakes were huge as usual but they didn't really have any flavor and lacked the "fillers" so to speak. ÊIt sounds like the cook got a bit lazy and decided not to put any bananas in the banana pancakes. Ê The staff were very friendly as usual. ÊHopefully, the next time I go back they'll win me over and I can give them back their 2 stars. ÊI'm no one without your delicious pancakes!!

We had such a good experience at this place. It was my brother's bday so we decided to go there for breakfast. We had six people in our party , got there at 9 am and they seated us in this cool vip room. We didn't have reservations or anything, they just put us there. We didn't wait either, I guess since we got there early. Their is alot of free parking in the back so that's not a prob either. Now to the food. The pancakes are the biggest pancakes I have ever seen! They come in a stack of three but you can order 1 or 2 only. We didn't know how big they were until we got our order. One pancake is like the size of a small pizza! Ê Ê Ê ÊSo anyways we each ordered an order of pancakes and only my brother ordered eggs. The pancakes are delicious but alas could only finish a tiny portion. Next time I go I know what to order now. Seriously me and my husband could share one pancake and just order eggs. They have a ton of different kinds of pancakes though so it's kind of hard to pick which one to get. Ê Ê Ê Ê ÊIt's a tad pricey but you get alot. The reason why I'm only giving this 4 stars though is only because when we left the other main room where they sit the majority of people was packed. If we sat in there my experience *might* have been different but maybe not. It just seemed too loud or something. Oh and customer service was pretty good too!

Blueberry pancakes were merely decent as were the egg dish (whichever Mexican-influenced one that's served with avocado, sour cream, etc.) but their Nutella-stuffed French toast was delicious! It's packed to GILLS with Nutella, they must put half a container in there. I'd probably go back for those again and maybe one of more creative pancakes. As noted by many, the portions are HUGE. I was impressed that four of us almost finished three dishes mentioned above! Good selection of coffee and tea. Service I'm sure can be spotty but we had a GREAT waiter who was spot-on with everything.

The word diet does NOT exist in this cafe. ÊThe portions are HUGE..i recommend sharing. ÊComing here with a group of friends is a good idea for variety. ÊMy friends and I shared -"The Golden Ticket" - brown sugar-baked bananas cooked inside buttermilk batter filled with caramel, walnuts and streusel. Êtopped with whip cream -"Addicted to Noisella" Stuffed French Toast - chocolat hazelnut spread stuffed between a stack of "Mom's French Toast" -"Peanut Bubba" Crunch French Toast - "Mom's French Toast" dipped in a peanut butter crunch, grilled to perfection topped with powdered sugar & whipped cream -side of Griddle Potatoes (yummy) All the above is delicious. ÊThe pankcakes are about 12" in diameter with 3 stacked on top of each other. TIP: order a side of bacon to help cut out the sweetness of the breakfast...it'll help you stuff your face even more =P

I read that the French Toast is out of this world here and though I am Êan eggs person for breakfast and my sister wanted her favorite (the raspberry lemon pancakes) we decided to go for it and ordered all three. First portion sizes are ridiculous. So much food - pancakes could have easily been shared between two people, maybe three. We were so glad we got the french toast. It's by far the best I've had. The bread they use seemed to be almost flaky, almost like a croissant inside - it was just really really good. The raspberry lemon pancakes were good but nothing that great. And we ordered the egg white scrambler with shrimp and basil pesto which I of course had to add mushrooms to. Also a winner. The coffee being french press and of three different strengths was a really nice touch. Would definitely want to go back despite our 40 minute wait at 1pm on a Saturday

So, I admit, I only came to the Griddle Cafe because my favorite band always raves about it and I was very glad I came. ÊService is good, the food is pretty good, and an order of pancakes can feed four,five, or maybe even six people. It is packed with hipsters (although I'm still not quite sure what a constitutes a hipster so that may be the wrong label) - make of that what you will.

i just wanted a little pick-me-up for breakfast this morning, but griddle cafe left me comatose. Êthe red velvet pancake (drizzled with sugary cocoa and swirled cream cheese frosting) and the french press coffee will set you up gourmet style. Ê of course, we went overboard for the review with the 'scotch on the rocks' pancakes (coconut, oats, pecan, and butterscotch chips) and the 'kicking and screaming' breakfast (egg) tacos which come with a side of (canned) refried beans. Êbig mistake. Êunlike the red velvet, the other pancakes come as three hub-cap sized discs. Ê Êwe got through half the plate before throwing in the towel and taking the leftovers home. Êthe savory stuff on the menu looked pretty boring in comparison, and the tacos ended up being very meh. our server was very patient with us as we took about fifteen minutes perusing the extensive sweets section. Êhe was also good at checking in on the progression of our seemingly impossible task. Êthe establishment itself is smaller-sized with three big screens for your viewing pleasure, and there's some free parking at a shared back lot with rite-aid (entrance on fairfax). Êso, the best time for a visit seems to be early weekday mornings. Êbut i definitely recommend this spot to get your sugar and caffeine fix. Êmake sure to show some restraint ordering though, or you'll be sorry....

I've been to Griddle Cafe a few times. ÊI felt compelled to write a review because I just wrote a review for the Blu Jam Cafe. ÊThe Griddle and Blu Jam have both been voted best breakfast in Los Angeles. ÊI was critical of Blu Jam because I didn't think there was any wow factor. ÊI mention this because the Griddle Cafe has the wow factor I was looking for when I dined at Blu Jam. ÊThe Griddle has a wide variety of pancakes and French toast variations.

The Griddle Cafe is a perfect example of why breakfast is my favorite meal of the day. Breakfast satisfies from salty to those sweet sweet cravings. The Griddle cafe has a great selections of meals. From yummy burgers , to over sided pancakes. Their specialty is breakfast, and they are pretty darn good at it. They have a really hip ambiance, kinda dinner meet back alley. The service nonetheless could use some help. The staff is not that friendly nor helpful. But they make up for it with their delicious plates .

This weekend was my 4th trip from "the OC" up to Hollywood to indulge in the Griddle Cafe. ÊMy first point is that the food here is always excellent, although the supposedly fresh squeezed orange juice tasted a bit unfresh. ÊThe coffee is great. ÊThe pancakes are superb. ÊBut the hour wait to be seated and the hour wait for the food once we were seated was unbearable. ÊAnd of course I forgot my leftovers on the table when we left which added insult to injury.

GRODY TO THE MAX!!! This was what I was thinking as I left the Griddle after my ill-conceived birthday breakfast there. I immediately wanted to take a shower to get rid of the filth and grime of this overrated shit-shack. The first two times I came here, I sat outside and didn't experience the horror that is the interior of this restaurant. Okay, I'm being dramatic. But ambiance is important to me, and this place has zero. It has the feel of a shitty midwest dive bar that hosts white blues bands and comedians that do "men and women are different" jokes. In addition, the waitstaff doesn't give a fuck. Okay, fine, neither would I. First couple times I went, the food was okay. But the portions are so big that you'd have to have a death wish to eat a whole one, so most of the food here must get thrown away. Both of these things really bother me. DO NOT order the Eggs Benedict. It's an abomination straight out of "Idiocracy": fried potato skins with some giant unholy slab of ham that looks like a Surgery Channel outtake drenched in runny Hollandaise. UGH. But the worst part was the bathroom. It looked and felt like it hadn't been cleaned in a week. I seriously could not believe such a popular joint had such a rank bathroom. It kind of says a lot. I couldn't imagine eating there again after being in that bathroom. Two stars because I guess they have good pancakes if you want to bring like 40 homeless people in to share one.

Good, solid food and I like the counter a lot. I didn't really care about the wait because I knew there was going to be one. I have only one complaint, and some may think I'm nuts, but they give you too much food. I ordered the pancakes and they were so big that they covered the entire plate. First of all, it was REALLY hard to cut the pancakes because there was no extra room on the plate to do so. Secondly, I could barely finish half of the stack. I'm a fairly big guy and can eat away, but it was too much for me. I don't know how anyone can finish those off and not be sick...

Firstly, make sure everyone arrives on time because you are not seated until your entire party is there. First time ever these particular friends were late - they are always about 30 minutes early) and they always come here. We nearly missed out on getting seated before it was full. Arrived just before it opened on a Saturday and everyone just pours in! Arrive much later and you are guaranteed a wait! Oh my god! The pancakes really are HUGE!!!!!!!!!! Bigger than the plate I tell no lie! Four people could eat one plateful! And if you don't make a dent in it the waiters tease you! The eggs benedict with the potato skins was not great. The white sauce wasn't good and the person who ordered it regretted it - a lot! They really wanted the pancakes but were swayed... ÊThe waffles were good as was the cheesecake french toast was great but a little too sweet... Still we wanted to go here after hearing so much and pretty much everyone was happy. There are too many pancakes to make an easy decision but Banana Mama and Recess Time were yummy! Free parking behind in the RiteAid lot.

I ate at The Griddle for the first time yesterday. ÊWe got there when it opened. ÊOne person took our drink order which was never delivered. ÊLater, our "waiter" came by to take our drink order. ÊThe drinks came a while later by someone else after the waiter reminded him to get them. Ê We finally ordered and waited nearly 30 minutes for our food to be delivered. ÊWhen it was delivered one of the meals was missing and other assorted items (toast, jam, etc). ÊWe waited until the 2 meals that were delivered were nearly cold and I complained. ÊThe remaining food arrived (cold like it had been sitting a while) and was reasonably good--not fantastic, but not bad. Ê A new person came by to give us our check without asking if we needed or wanted anything else. ÊOne of the meals was so cold by the time we got to eat that my friend didn't eat most of it and we decided to bring it home to the dog. ÊWhen we asked for it to be wrapped up the new person didn't respond, but--in his own special snarky way--dropped off a box and the credit card receipt for signature. Ê The "waiter" (Sergio?) came by, picked up the credit card receipt and said thanks and then walked away. HORRIBLE way to start a Sunday. ÊWon't make this mistake again.

Definitely makes sense for you to run about 20 miles or even better, perhaps break in a quick Iron Man session before heading to breakfast here. Did I mention the pancakes yet? Delicious. Went with a large group and everyone enjoyed their pancakes. French toast was good too. The lighter eaters could definitely split one plate of pancakes, but I doubt anyone does. French press coffee is great and the service was too.

This place is excellent. The pancakes are just plain enormous -- prepare for a portion worthy of two or three meals for a normal person. Oh, and they're absolutely delicious. We also had the Chicago Charlie's scramble which was delicious but a bit too heavy on onions and light on sausages. No worries, though, because it was pretty much amazing anyways. We were seated quickly as a party of two but the place is crowded and bustling. Expect to get bumped and maybe overwhelmed by the constant traffic around your table.

Came here with a friend one morning, I've driven by the line was out the door but this was a weekday morning and got seated right away. I got pancakes and was surprised when they arrived. They were literally the biggest things I've ever seen. They were very fluffy, flavorful and delicious. The majority of the staff is made up of male models which is nice view to look at while you plow through a giant stack of pancakes.

The Griddle is Great! The food is quality, the portions are HUGE, and the staff are extra friendly. The variety of food they offerr is fantastic.

"Good old fashioned American Courtesy" ÊI was really searching for some wonderful blueberry pancakes. Yes, blueberries inside the batter. I yelped near my new neighborhood and found this gem. I'm trying to find new fave restaurants to rely on. My taste expedition partner in crime and I arrived. -with about 5min to closing but after parking more like 2 minutes to spare. ÊThe door was cracked open and we slid in finding a bus boy inside stacking chairs. ÊWe asked if we could still eat and he told us to sit down hold on. We still weren't sure if we were going to eat but here comes our friendly, and chill waiter. ÊI cant remember his name, so sorry about that but you know who you are. ÊThanks for not kicking us out and accepting our business. We never even felt rushed and had time to look at a good variety of pancakes and other tasty looking menu items. ÊExtending that good ole fashioned American courtesy is what sets The Gridle above the rest and gives it a certain charm. We were hungry, parked, wanted your specialty and were just in before you closed. You still fed us!! -Like we deserved to eat! It was great! Ê Now about the food: The pancakes were the size of Êsmall pizza. ÊAbout 9inches around. There are 3 of them. They cover your entire plate. ÊSo hearty and fluffy at the same time. Loaded with blueberries. Not the bursting blueberries, but none the less enough adequate smaller ones, a blueberry lover is sure to appreciate. ÊI would prefer to take the creamy blueberry yogurt cream cheese like sauce on the side next time. ÊIt was still fantastic, I covered it with the generous helping of real whipped butter a pleasant waitress who was closing up gave to me when I asked for it. ÊAgain they were just cleaning and letting us mind our business while also being there if we needed anything. ÊI also added their pure maple syrup. ÊTwas a wonderful experience. ÊI feel that's the way more people should run a restaurant. ÊShall go again. ÊYou should go too. I still rave about it. Ê Being hospitable and extending a service to someone who wants/needs you (hunger is a need) Êmoments before you close, is priceless to me. ÊThese days it is hard to come by. Shows you care that I'm hungry and are glad I came to you with my money for your specialty. Many places would turn you away. I appreciate a place like The Griddle. Ê The only reason I had to give 4 stars is because the floor was rather dirty. ÊIn their defense, it was closing time and I can only imagine the traffic in there. ÊWe both agreed we could basically say "what floor?" as we were floating, lost in the amazing pancakes. ÊI did not mind and I'm even a bit of a clean freak. I was so happy to be there enjoying every bite. ÊIt took three days for me to finish all the pancakes. I hope you enjoy and that this helps those in the quest for great pancakes in the Hollywood area :) Ê All the best to you guys at The Griddle" You Rock! esp our waiter and hugs to the ones putting great things on the plates!

i luv breakfast, its probably the most versatile meal of all, can be sweet or savory, and eaten anytime of the day. we had the red velvet pancake, nutella french toast, and an omelette. Red velvet pancake--aweeeesomeeeeeeeee! fluffy and all that good stuff u need in a pancake. there was a bit too much cream cheese topping, but other than that it was great. Ê Nutella french toast--ahh crazy sweet cause they spread both sides of the toasts. you can tell they used a HUGE amt of butter for grilling the toast, but it was great. not too soft and eggy. Omelette--oh big disappointment, the omelette was over cooked, not as soft as i expected, but there were a lot of shrimp and they were big. indoor seats are a bit crowded, loud, and its dark. outdoor seats are ok but limited, ull be eating just next to those waiting in line which isnt something i would like. overall, a bit expensive but definitely a place i would come again.

It's my fourth time to visit Griddle Cafe. ÊActually I have to admit that the portions of their food are huge and most of the dishes are delicious. However, I don't think I would visit again.Today I ordered a Chili Omelet, which should be served with toasts. At first they forgot that and gave me two pieces of burned toasts after I reminded them. Strike one. Then when I asked for my bill, they put on a soft drink, which I didn't order, on it. And this time they didn't offer any apology for their mistakes as well. All that I got Êwas just "Oh~ ok..." Most servers just fooled around in the back of the restaurant and chatted. Well despite the previous few pleasant experience, I'm not going back to that place again.

Severely overated hash house. Kind of a "Swingers" for this decade, it's got mediocre food, served by wannaba-Silverlake-hipsters. The main claim to fame at this place is "cool"-looking people hanging out. The food is fair, the wait is ridiculous, but the amounts would make any Kansas coffee shop blush. Overconsumption is a keyword here. Bring your shades and iPod and you're halfway there. Cannot believe that people rave over it. It's so last year.

Great little place to do breakfast and brunch. ÊYou'll catch the bittersweet howls of blues legends Sonhouse, MS John Hurt and BB King to go along with your Peanut Bubba French Toast and french press coffee. ÊVery laid back and you might catch a star or two (usually secluded in the back rooms). Try the eggs benedict!!! If you're gettin' there after 9am, scope it out.

TDF french toast! At first I thought, well, what's so special about pancakes and french toast? After looking through the extensive menu (which includes colossal creations packed with ingredients such as oreos, pumpkin, kahlua, banana, streusel, coconut, etc), my friend and I ordered Mom's French Toast, 'Tis the Season (the pumpkin pancake), Banana Nana, and The Golden Ticket (amped up version of Banana Nana). The star of the meal was definitely the french toast, as I have to say that this is hands down, the best french toast I have ever had! I echo another reviewer's sentiments: whose mom makes french toast like this???!! I know my mom didn't. Not even close! The pumpkin pancake was good, but I'd skip the Banana Nana, since I could barely taste the banana. Nevertheless, it was a sinfully delicious meal. I'm definitely trying out the french toast options next time! I came in a little before 9AM on a weekday, and there was no wait to be seated. However, it was starting to fill up, and I had trouble flagging down my waiter for service at times. So service could be a bit spotty, but I would definitely come back for food. Maybe takeout next time?

This place simply confirms the fact that everything is better super-sized! That being said, don't bring your health conscious self here. The Griddle Cafe turned my least favorite meal (breakfast) into my most favorite meal (dessert!) and super-sized it better than McDonalds! I shared ONE frosted flakes + strawberries pancake (sorry, my lack of short-term memory doesn't help too much with remembering the actual names) and the nutella french toast--we finished less than half of each order. I personally preferred the pancakes over the nutella french toast simply because the nutella was too much of a good thing (tip: balance sweet with salty and order some regular breakfast items: eggs, sausage, fruit). However, the french toast made a MUCH better microwaved second wind at home :). My only complaint is that the bathroom was about as clean as one you would find in a Chinese-owned Chinese restaurant (i.e. wonderful food with a much-less-than-wonderful bathroom). Otherwise, if I intend on finishing my meal next time, I'll just share a single pancake with someone :)

No self-respecting breakfast fan can skip a trip to the Griddle Cafe. Do yourself a favor and split one order of pancakes between the entire table and then split an egg dish with someone you love. Note to Coast Guard: these pancakes are so huge they can also be used to absorb oil tanker spills, though they're so delicious you'd be remiss to try it. As for pancake varieties try Recess time (strudel filled) , black magic (oreo) or plain and beautiful buttermilk cakes. Great to see looking-for-work actors, beautiful and important people and those who look like they should be more important than they are. ÊCall ahead because it gets busy busy busy.

Orange juice was amazing, the Cobb omelette was huge, well put together. The choices of items is pretty amazing and complex and makes picking one thing hard. Location is great. We sat outside & the weather was perfect, felt like something out of The Hills sans pithy conversation. The inside feels like a sweatshop...people shouting, chaos. Waiters were friendly and awesome. I have the same complaint about this place as most american breakfast joints. Portion sizes too large. Ya I know I sound insane complaining about this but half a portion size for half the cost is ok too. Yes, I know we can share a dish, but I think as a culture we need to get "ok" with eating less, and yes, I felt a little defeated by the omlette.

Delicious!! yes there is a line on the weekend! So what!! I want to know what the rave is all about. So we waited... and waited... more than an hour. Finally we get called to go in. Wow, super crowded in the small funky cafe. They take us to the back, odd.... into a dark dimly lit room. The room was adjoined to another room. The room looked like it was from an old movie, where they would drug deal. I kid you not it looks like a strip club, and the room we were in give out special lad dances. ha ha!! Thank god while we were in line we were looking at the menu, so we know what we want. Our waiter was this beefy guy, with really nice eyebrows. I wonder where he gets them done at? Sorry for trailing off topic. Any who... we ordered Creme De La Creme French toast, black magic, poached y papas Benedict, Chicago Charlie's scramble, muscle bound scramble, and too hot to handle turkey burger. Okay where so I begin, the creme De Creme french toast, taste just like a cheesecake! The french toast are super sized, and they sprinkle graham crackers all over it. The cheesecake frosting was just delicious and fatt I love every bite of it. The black magic was a pancake that have Oreo cookie in it. I know, I know it sounds crazy, but you really must try it, if you're an Oreo lover. Seriously it taste like a big Oreo cookie rather than a pancake. ha ha I loved it!! I took one bite and I was done! The size of that thing was bigger than my head!! It was the size of an average medium pizza!!! Good LAWD!! they are tripping with that one. Does anyone finishes it??? Mmm... the Benedict was pretty good... if you like MAYO that is exactly what they slapped on this baby!! the hollandaise sauce was basically mayo!! ha ha I would do without the potato skin that the ham and poaches eggs was sitting on. It was a bit salty with the potato. The Chicago Charlie was pretty good, you get bell pepper, cheese, sausage, ham, and eggs. It was regular... I probably wouldn't do that one again. The muscle bound... I looked at it and I was like, hmm... no... I don't want to try it. I was with a party of four... so we can pig out as much as we can with each others plate. Yes, that's my master plan... invite as many people to eat with me... so I can eat all of their food!! hahaha (evil laugh) teehee so last but not least, the too hot to handle burger, One word to describe it DELICIOUS!!! actually more words... ha ha we felt healthy eating it, and that is dangerous!! It was spicy, but not tears rolling down my cheeks spicy. It was enjoyable. Ahhh... what a great BREAKFAST!! I would totally come again!! Each dishes were $9 and up. You can say $17 a person.

We got here at 930am Sunday morning and there was already a line, but luckily the wait for 2 people wasn't long (20min). ÊThe inside of the restaurant isn't very big, actually it's pretty cramped with the booths, tables in the middle and a bar, but that's what also made it cozy. ÊTons of people, families w their kids....and when I say kids I mean babies, strollers, the whole nine. ÊIt's a family joint as well as a let's eat cause im hungover and I need to feed myself before I can do anything else kind of place. ÊObviously they're well-known for their ginormous pancakes, but they also have a good omelette and sando menu. ÊFYI, if the whole order of the pancakes seems way too over the top for you, you can request a half order. ÊAlso, you can't order things to go, but you can have them put in the order late and just box it up. ÊThis place reminds me of Hash House in San Diego, but maybe not as big a serving, although quite filling. ÊAnd yes their red velvet pancakes are good for less than $9. ÊCan't beat that!

This is the one of the first places you should stop at when you have a craving for a great breakfast for an awesome price. Be warned you will be full at the end of the meal. It is amazing though. My friend got their signature red velvet pancake and told me that it was the best breakfast he ever had, just that it was super sweet. You do only get one pancake when ordering the red velvet. I got the 'sow your oats' pancakes and got 3 HUGE pancakes for just $10! And I could only eat half of it that day. BUT I ate every last bit of it later on it was just sooooo good! Its a place to visit on a vacation. Just make sure you can get there at a reasonable time because it was PACKED when we went! I hope you enjoy it there as much as I did.

This place is very well-know because of their amazing french toast varieties. I've been here a few times and each time I had to order the nutella-stuffed french toast; its absolutely amazing to the point where I crave it sometimes. Of their non- pankake and french toast foods, the food is relatively bland but still fills you up very well. All their meal portions are more thn you need so its a good idea to bring others with you. As its located in the hollywood area, they're staff is filled with actors and such, presumibly waiting for the break and doing this job in the meantime. The result, in terms of service is a mixed bag but almost always, they'll be rushing you to get in and out quickly because there is almost always a large wait to get in. On average, expect to wait about 30 mins and probably more if you have more than 2 people. Of the cons, they are over-priced but ridiculously so with the drinks. An average glass of OJ or crannberry juice for example is 5 bucks.

Lovely! My boyfriend and I discovered this place on yelp after reading all the negative reviews for The Waffle, and decided to try it out instead. It was a lovely experience; we went in the afternoon (today is Monday), so it wasn't very busy at all; a few people sitting outside and maybe four tables occupied inside. It was noisy, which made it hard to have any conversation without yelling at each other, but the decor, warm ambiance, and nice/efficient waitstaff made up for it. Our waiter was nice, and attentive; refilled our glasses without asking and promptly brought us anything extra we asked for. I ordered the "Wholey Moley" pancakes and a side of scrambled egg; my boyfriend ordered the "Yellow Brick Road" pancakes with a side of hash browns. Both were REALLY good, though my pancakes could've used brown sugar and butter between the layers instead of just on top. The hash browns were a little too oniony at times, but mostly quite tasty, and the egg was very plain, but given the richness of the rest of our food, the plainness was welcome. Overall we were extremely pleased; we'll no doubt be going there again, and I definitely recommend this place.

I gotta say, this restaurant was, in my opinion, one of the rarest restaurants where they sell such absolute splendid french toasts! Three years ago, my mother was trying to find a spot to open up a new restaurnt and we heard about this famous restaurant. When we came to try it out, the food was absolutely splendid, expecially the french toast. To tell you the truth, despite that my mother always had the dream to open up her own restaurant before i was even born, this restaurant is one of my mother's inspirations to open up her new restaurant, CiCi's Cafe. So I would like to say thank Griddle Cafe, for giving my mother the inspiration and motivation to open up a new restaurant and I hope that you continue living on in sucess. :)

ÊIf you can avoid outside on the weekend you should because all the people waiting, are waiting outside, surrounding your table! ÊWatching you eat. ÊThe staff at Griddle Cafe tried to prevent this by asking the people repeatedly to move away from the tables & form a line on the other side of the tree. ÊHowever, as more people would arrive they would unknowingly stand right in front of your table. Ê The food here is great. Ê We had: Coffee Fresh OJ Side of Bacon The Yellow Brick Road The Peanut Budda French Toast Our bill with tax and tip was about 50$. All were yummy. ÊBut next time we will order 1 sweet pancake or french toast item & an egg item, too avoid all that sugar. ÊWe only finished like 1/4 of each item and we were on sugar overload. Ê The food and staff were fab! We will eat here again and sit inside next time.

I've honesty never had a better breakfast anywhere in the world. The service has always been anywhere from decent to very good when I go. The portions are ridiculous. You probably can't eat one plate by yourself, trust me. My favorite is the black magic pancakes, pancakes cooked with oreo cookies and topped with whipped cream (I'm a sick man, I know. It's delicious). The orange juice is ridiculously over-priced ($5 for a tiny glass that i'm pretty sure isn't fresh-squeezed) But all-in-all everything I've eaten here is absolutely amazing. Very hard to disappoint with the food. My only major complaint is the bathrooms. Holy cow. The men's bathroom is something out of a hell's angel documentary. It reeked of (yeah) and it was disgusting, graffiti on the walls and no mirror. Nonetheless, i'm still a huge fan!

I had a picture in my head of what the Griddle Cafe would be like... Long wait, crowded tables, pancakes bigger than my head... ÊIn reality, it was pretty much what I expected. ÊAfter putting our name in with the somewhat grumpy host, we waited outside for about half an hour before getting our table inside. Ê(We specifically requested an inside table after watching a homeless man *heckle* some of the diners outside and descend upon their leftovers like a vulture immediately after they left...) ÊUnfortunately, inside it was so loud that I was only able to make out about half of my friend's conversation from across the table. ÊThat was probably the biggest downside of the Griddle Cafe. ÊCoffee is served to the table via a communal French press, which is a nice touch. ÊThe pancakes are as big as the pictures make them seem, and I was full after eating less than half of my stack. ÊAround $10 for a stack of 3 is pretty reasonable, considering you can probably get 3+ meals out of it. ÊI tried the raspberry and lemon stuffed buttermilk pancakes and sampled my friend's "golden ticket" pancakes, which were filled with bananas, caramel, walnuts, and cinnamon. ÊHonestly, her's were better. ÊMine were a little on the tart side and needed a good smothering of syrup to balance things out. ÊStill, everything was delicious and worth the wait. ÊWhile the Griddle Cafe didn't blow me away, it was still a solid experience. ÊI can see myself going back the next time I have a major craving for pancakes.

O...M...G... I have never seen such HUGE pancakes in my whole life. ÊYou think you have seen big pancakes and then they bring out these, pancakes so big the freaking overhang the edge of your full sized dinner plate. They come three deep and they mix the fruit INTO the batter not just piled on top in a heap of syrupy goo. They have like over a dozen types of pancakes in addition to their french toast, waffles and egg dishes. Their eggs benedict over potato skins is to die for and is such a generous portion you will most likely only get partially though them. I LOVE LOVE LOVE the Strawberries and cream waffle and the Golden Ticket Pancakes. Overall this place is one of my favorite breakfast spots in all of LA, but why not 5 stars you ask? Well, if there weren't a 45 minute wait at any given time during the weekend, I would be inclined to eat her more often. It's worth the wait, but to be honest most of the time I need the instant gratification I can get at some of the other delicious breakfast places in LA. One good thing to remember; you can order take out so if you don't want to wait, pick some pancakes up and share them with up to three people with one order. The prices are surprisingly fair.... about $11.00 or so for some of the "deluxe" pancakes.

I'm a fan... I love breakfast places especially when they have some unique stuff. I came here with a few friends and we all ordered something different. The place is quit small and very intimate and when I say intimate I mean most likely you'll be rubbing up against someone in order to get to your seat haha. ANyways the staff is very nice there. I had the Omelette "my soul" with steak and my friends got the "eyes wide open" pancakes, the waffle and the tequila sunrise. The coffee is really fresh there because they put a coffee press right on your table so you don't always have to ask for a refill which is bad for someone like me because I can down coffee just as fast as vodka. But anyways... the omelette was very flavorful and looking appetizing, the pancakes were very good and HUGE. I say if you want a unique eating experience in west LA, definitely check this place out. Although there will be a wait on a weekend so expect it.

oh...my...god....i just returned from this place and i feel this review will be one of the most genuine yet. i am stuffed to brim and i barely even made it a quarter of the way through my stack of 3 oreo filled pancakes. seriously this place is insane. the portions are HUGE and the price is just right. you get this big honkin stack of 3 pancakes for anywhere between $7 and $11 depending on the type you get. they have everything from regular buttermilk to oreo filled to fruit filled kind. and this is JUST the first page of the menu. they also have omlettes, sandwiches, and many other breakfast items. expect a long wait (45+ min) on a weekend during the peak brunch hours. but it's worth it. you won't be disappointed. but you will be filled to the max and aching at your side because you ate too much and are still carrying home a to go box.

The Red Velvet Pancakes were amazing. ÊAlthough most of the other pancakes come in stacks of three, you're good with just one red velvet pancake because that's good for two or maybe three. Ê Is it more like a cake or more like a pancake? ÊThat was the question and we settled for the latter because of its texture. ÊIt's topped with powdered sugar and powered cocoa with a swirl of cream cheese icing. ÊWe enjoyed the pancake as well as the Tequila Sunrise egg specialty--two corn tortillas topped with refried beans, two sunny side up eggs, cheese, and it's all covered in their gold tequila-spiked rancheros sauce along with chicken tequila sausage. ÊWell that was really tasty. ÊWe asked for lime, not as a chaser, because the dish was slightly too salty. ÊFor a popular establishment, I expect more from the service and thought it was alright since the server(s) didn't seem too attentive. ÊI know they get real busy and we were lucky to go on a Tuesday since we had the day off. ÊThat's great because we got to avoid the ridiculously long line. ÊStill, one can be busy and be attentive and available. ÊI like the atmosphere. ÊI like how it's packed and busy, but you can still converse with the people you're with. ÊPeople seemed so friendly I even chatted with the next table about their pancakes. ÊDefinitely come home here for a good breakfast at medium price and it is worth the wait. ÊThere are lots of things to try. ÊI recommend trying the Red Velvet Pancakes at least once. ÊDon't eat it all by yourself though. Ê4 out of 5 Stars.

This place always has a wait, but it's well worth it. This is my second time going and both times I got the Red Velvet Pancake. It's literally like eating dessert for breakfast. I shared with the other people I went with both times as well. The first time, we ordered the Golden Ticket which is so good that there aren't words. It's taking banana bread to a whole different level. This is saying a lot since I don't really like bananas and only somewhat can tolerate banana bread. The second time, my mom ordered the whole wheat pancakes, I'm not a fan of these. I generally do the healthy eating thing, but sometimes when you go someplace like this, it deserves going a little devilish. Be warned that the portions are HUGE here. When I took my mom she didn't listen to me when I suggested getting only one pancake. I seriously wish I had my phone out at that point, because her face was priceless when she first saw her food. They have a lot of other food in addition to their signature pancakes, but I've not tried them. Also, be prepared to sit very close to people you do not know, the tables are extremely close. So close you can hear other conversations, but sometimes that works out too. We wound up talking to the people at the next table for a good chunk of our meal. A definite recommendation.

Searching Yelp for a restaurant that offered tasty pancakes, my search results offered Griddle Cafe as a top destination. It was nearing my last few days on my visit to LA. My mom and I parked on a side street and walked to the restaurant since all the parking in front was full. Though there was no wait the restaurant was packed! Nearly every table was full. The host offered us bar stool seats but my mom preferred a table. Pumpkin pancakes are my favorite so I was surprised to see the restaurant offered them year round when most only offer pumpkin flavors in the fall. Tis' the Season was my order and my mom ordered eggs and sausage. The order arrived fast. My pancakes were plate sized which I expected reading the reviews and looking at the posted pictures on Yelp. They were steaming hot with whipped cream! I finished 1 pancake. The pancakes were good but I would have preferred a little more flavor, maybe cinnamon or allspice. I took the remainder back to the hotel to eat for breakfast the next morning. I would prefer if they served smaller pancakes at a lesser price with a stronger pumpkin flavor. The reason I rate Griddle Cafe three stars is because the waitress was very slow and did not return to check on us after she brought our dishes besides to bring the check and my takeaway container. I would return on a trip to LA and try another dish. Next time I would see at the counter. I would probably order French Toast or the popular celebrity favorite, Red Velvet Pancakes.

a bit of a fad, but for breakfast food, especially pancakes, it doesn't get better than this. the pancakes are HUGE! you won't be able to finish it in one sitting! the regular breakfast food is pretty darn good, too. the only problem is that it's wickedly popular and on the weekends the wait is ridiculous. but if you're in the right (waiting) mood it's totally worth it

OK. Portions are enormous, lines are always long, and I just don't get a very cleanly feel from this restaurant...there are definitely other places I would suggest before Griddle. If you're going to wait in a line, try BLD, Kings Road Cafe or venture over to Gjelina in Venice on the weekend for brunch.

My stars are only for these two particular dishes and my one sightseeing opportunity. Food first: the PUMPKIN PANCAKES BUT wait, ADD CHOCOLATE CHIPS. You have to tell them to add that, they don't the normal way. And ONE people, ONE pancake is sufficient. it's a star jones special if you have anything but a single. Second dish is the Shrimp pesto egg white scramble thing. Oh my god it's not right because it's so good. Kay for the sightseeing: Anyone been to those boardwalk arcades that Êhave that saloon shooting game where you stand in one place, tied down rifle in hand, waiting for your moving target to send you trigger tippen? That's TOTALLY what I think about the scene there. I hardly drink or talk smak about people, BUT when I do, my friends, I take my hungover posse, throw on our hoodies and hollywood incog sunglasses, get your name on that list and spend the next hour and 45 min wait standing against that wall hitten up every target possible with your friends. I know, so bad, but what a way to excercise that fried brain with bashing.

I found Griddle Cafe through a Yelp search and also received this recommendation from someone who has never even eaten there (she has heard about it from Kevin Smith on TV). I thought I'd give it a try, since I'm a big breakfast and pancake fan. We have a couple of great pancake places in Denver, so this place had to serve a really great pancake to get 5 stars. I arrived to find people waiting outside. I walked in and there were 5 seats open at a counter. The host was saying that no one wanted to sit at the counter. I piped up and said, "I will. It's just me - 1 person." So I sat down without a wait on a Saturday morning (3/13). My waiter was helpful in giving me recommendations on their most popular pancakes. I ended up getting the Banana Nana. When he brought out the pancakes, they were bigger than the plate! They come in a stack of three. They are fluffy, moist, and amazing. Griddle Cafe also has 100% real maple syrup. This is my kind of place. I could only eat half of my pancakes... and unfortunately didn't take them with me as I was traveling and I don't think they would have kept well. If you are going with your spouse or even a friend who likes to share food, I'd say split an order of pancakes. Next time I'm in the LA area, I will definitely be back to the Griddle Cafe. Great service, great food, and great location. Oh, there's on-street metered parking (1 hour limit) and some up the street that is free for 1-hour. But if there's a wait, you probably won't be in and out in under an hour. There is also a garage on Fairfax/Sunset for $2 for every 30 minutes. If you're familiar with the area, you may be able to find free, on-street parking that doesn't require a neighborhood permit.

Far drive from where I live, but I was feeling adventurous and decided to drive all the way out here to try this place out. First, parking is hard around here, but of course its LA. Second, the lines are long, so expect to wait at least 30-45mins. The place itself is small, so if you're uncomfortable with tight space; this place is not for you. The servers are nice and the food is pretty good. I only ordered the Charlie's Scramble, and opted not to get any of the pancakes or french toasts. I'd say this place is ok; not something I'd drive over 30mins just for breakfast.

i'd say this is a destination spot, only for the fact that they serve the biggest pancakes you'll ever see in your life lol. they are GIGANTIC. maybe i'll post a picture later. my favorite one is the eyes wide shut. i think that's what it was called. it was chocolate chips w/ a shot of espresso in the batter. although you can't taste a hint of the coffee.. it was yummy :) the couple of times i went, i noticed other people ordered real food.. and it looked pretty good too. maybe next time.

After 7 years of LA breakfast searching I finally found the place that I feel is worth it's syrup. There are many options for a breakfast in the vast city of angels, but not all live up to the hype. Unless you eat at Denny's, you are subject to the classic $40 breakfast for two bill, reality is in LA you have to take what you can get. Often after paying that amount you realize you could have toasted your own bread and burnt your own bacon at home 10 times over for the same experience. Until you enter the Griddle... (Caveat: I've heard stories of trying to eat hear on a Sat/Sun morning and they involve long lines and background actors, so good luck with that) 8 am on a Tuesday morning. Traffic was not terrible getting there, found a meter to park at with 7 minutes left on it within a block, and enjoyed the sights and sounds of the WeHo morning life. My boss and I were sat immediately at a booth, place was half full. Johnny Depp's stand-in brought us two waters off the bat within a minute and surprised me with the offer of three shades of french press coffee. Booyah. Plenty to choose from on the menu with catchy titles to make me believe there is creativity in pancakes and waffles. We went with the classics: the french toast and the Belgian waffle with strawberries and a rich cream, side of bacon. All the food came out hot, well-crafted and appealing to the eyes, like the original cast of Saved By the Bell, sans Spano. The quality of taste exceeded the looks, just like the acting prowess of Mario Lopez. Because of the midweek visit at am early hour at no point did we feel rushed, and the service though out meal was sufficient. Quick turnaround on paying the bill and within the hour we were off. A great visit that I would recommend to anyone for a fun, flavorful and fantastic M-F breakfast.

Ahhh good old LA.... home of good food and celebrities... both of which were promised to me by my aunt.... Every time she goes she sees some one famous.... Well I saw some THING famous! Their awesome french toast! Toast as big as your head and then some! I ate off my cousins peanut butter french toast ( which blew my mind) plate because well I LOVE my potatoes and really needed to get me an omelet - love protein. I had the three cheese omelet with an add of spinach. It was phenomenal. I have to add my friend ordered the LOX plate omg... so fresh and delish! It even kept over nite...LOX leftovers so good who knew? You'd be a glutton if you seriously cleaned your plate here. Great place great service but good looking people... but its LA city of the good-lookin. THe host was a treat to watch, such a sweetheart totally fit in our huge mexican family for Sunday brunch which I learned from waiting was always poppin! Order a mimosa - and highlight: they don't look at you crazy when you say hold the OJ... they HOLD the OJ! This place is a well oiled machine! no excuse for poor service and this place has the secret to a happy efficient staff that created a great welcoming and fun experience for my family! Wether you come with a large group or on a brunch date would definitely get up for morning breakfast here! But be kind don't come with more than 7...its just unkind :)

great food (chop salad & wholey moley pancakes, and too hot to handle burger are personal favs), good management, but horrible service below management level so i had to deduct 2 stars. today i didn't even end up finalizing my to go order because the gentleman who answered the phone was so unbelievably rude in a 2 minute conversation - blaming me that he couldn't hear me when it was clear that it was because the restaurant was busy, explaining to me like a 3 year old how salad dressing works when I complained that last time all I got was a cup of oil with a splash of other (read salad dressing-y) ingredients. Told me that I had to "shake it up" - yes I know how salad dressing works. Êthis was something different. ÊFinally I explained that I didn't really "need" to place my order if it was such trouble. ÊHe didn't seem to care either way. Ê After staring at my phone in shock, I decided that I should call back and let the manager know what happened. Êbut seriously, who wants to have to go to a manager just to have a pleasant experience dining or getting take out at a restaurant? ÊThe manager was apologetic and cordial but didn't even ask if i wanted to order after I talked to him...Giving 3 stars because, as i said above, the manager was nice & the food is craveworthy...but still 2 stars gone because I literally couldn't get food to go.

The only problem with this place is that there usually is a long wait time to get seated because everyone who comes here knows what's up. The Griddle is by far the best bang for the buck. Prices are reasonable if not on the cheap side for the sheer amount of food you get and the food is good yall. My favorite is their version of the eggs benedict (i think they call it the poached y papas).

4 stars with 1200+ reviews?? Êreally?? ÊYES. Êthis place is TOTALLY worth the hype, and easily one of my top favorite breakfast restaurants. before coming to this place, throw your diet out the window. ÊHUGE portions, and almost every dish here is either really decadent and/or heavy but SO WORTH the extra calories. food: "peanut bubba" crunchy french toast - i got this with whip cream on the side instead of on top. ÊHEAVEN. Êdefinite must for peanut butter lovers. Êbread was incredibly soft that it melts in your mouth..and the peanut butter flavor did not overpower the meal...it just left you wanting more and more after every bite. "chicago charlie's" scramble - italian sausage, potatoes, bacon, bell peppers, mozzarella cheese, garlic, basil, onions...what's not to love? Ê yummmmm tip: this place gets packed!!!! Êcame here on a friday morning at 11 AM, thinking that it shouldn't be packed on a weekday Êmorning because most people have work, right? ÊWRONG.

Well, what can I say about the Griddle Caf. My fianc and I went on Sunday. I was told to try and get there as early as possible. We got there about 5 minutes before they opened and there was already people waiting in line to get in. as soon as the doors opened we were seated and immediately ordered the French press coffee, $3.95 a cup but its sooooooo good. I ordered the peanut bubba French toast and he order the banana nana pancakes. We also had a side of bacon which was THICK and tasty. ÊMy eyes were bigger than my stomach because I couldn't finish it. The whipped cream they put on top was so fresh that it was like heaven. I kid you not this place is really good. A bit pricey but considering the amount of food you get it's worth it. Come early and order the French pressed coffee. The only thing I do not like is that it's small. If you get a booth or get to sit at the "bar" (I don't know what you would call it) then you will be forced to sit at the small tables. There is not a lot of room for all that food. I will be back.

I was recently at the Griddle Cafe me and some friends were coming back from the fashion district. We were driving down Sunset Blv that rainy cold morning and noticed at least 20 people waiting outside. We figured that if there were that many people waiting outside on a cold rainy day then it must be worth the wait. We went to go get our table and they told us that it would be at least an hr wait. There is barely enough room for the guest to eat so we waited outside with the rest of the people. It was finally our turn so we walked in barely squeaking by all the other guest. It is a real hole in the wall type place. I swear I could smell the cologne from every person sitting near me. The waiter was really nice she was on top of it. I started off with a fresh glass of orange juice, which was quite good just not worth the price for that small cup. I ordered the Barry Yellow pancakes. OMG THEY WERE HUGEEEEEEEEE I actually cut them up like pizza slices I couldn't even eat half of my portion. The pancakes weren't too sweet nor tart. The powdered sugar with the tartness of the raspberry and lemon made it a sweet combination. Overall between 3 people the check came out to be about 70 dollars. Just make sure you get there early to avoid the rush. Hopefully you guys aren't allergic to cheap perfume/cologne

go during the weekday so you wont have to wait in line. good food for breakfast AND lunch. its like one of those places you want to go back so that you could try everything on the menu at least once. the variety of pancakes and french toast with a french pressed coffee sounds so good right now. or for lunch you can get any of their salads or a baked potato over CHILI. dont you forget about the chili now. yummmmm i drool

Great food. ÊOkay staff though a little bit too actorry and not enough waiterry. ÊMusic is too goddamned loud. ÊThe problem with the Griddle is that they let anybody in. ÊToo many people come to be seen which crowds up the place making a deafening roar to an already too loud excruciating blues soundtrack. ÊThe best time to go is on the weekdays about half an hour after it opens, therefore, at 7:30 am. ÊIt's still too loud, but there are less distractions and more room for your elbows. ÊDid I mention that it's cramped in addition to crowded? Sitting at the counter reminds me of one of those parking lots that pack the cars in so tightly you can't open your door all the way. Ê Basically, I hate everything about this place except the food. ÊAnd that's why I hate this place even more, because the pancakes are so damned good. ÊThe best thing that could happen for me is to walk in with a rat, let it loose, have everybody scream and leave the restaurant (particularly the hipsters who take up table space and don't even order the damned pancakes), have all the wait staff quit on th spot leaving only one of the cooks, have him cook up what I want while I walk over to the stereo and turn the fucking thing off. ÊI have never really been satisfied with the service which I think is often incompetent, and forget accomodating you. ÊThis is the kind of place where some waiter might actually sit you at one table and halfway through ask you to move so another larger group could sit at your table. ÊI hate this place, but I love the food. ÊI wish it was bad so I wouldn't have to go through emotional frustration every single time I hit this joint. ÊFood-TEN STARS. ÊAtmosphere, service, comfortability-NEGATIVE TEN STARS.

BEST french toast- and I'm pretty picky about that. Pancakes- tried almost every one and they are all great. Even the omelets and french fries are great (and you can really screw up an omelet). Love the french press coffee (medium roast) and the tuna salad sandwich is great, though so large I can never finish it. It can get loud in there, though, so only go if you don't mind not saying much at the little two-tops or sitting on the same side of the booth to be heard. It's completely worth it anyway!

Although I have used yelp numerous times to read reviews, I have never felt compelled to write one until now. I've driven by Griddle Cafe almost every weekend on my way to hike Runyon and the place always had lines out the door. I finally decided to check it out this weekend and can understand why people would wait almost an hour just Êto get seated in this place! The food is absolutely delicious! We got there at close to noon on a Saturday and got seated in 30 minutes. It took another 30 minutes to get our food but trust me, it is worth it! Per yelp recommendations, my friend and I opted to share Mom's French Toast and ordered some turkey sausages just to have something salty to balance the sweetness. The french toast was nice and fluffy with mounds of butter and powdered sugar on top. Make sure to drench it with their Griddle Syrup to fully appreciate the magic. I'm not much of a coffee person but my friend praised the quality and taste of the french press coffee she ordered. I will definitely go back and try the other stuff on the menu (next up Banana Nana). Just make sure to go with someone who would want to share because the portions are huge!

I am absolutely obsessed with the Griddle. My girlfriends and I go here as often as we can. I've skipped class and work just to make it to the Griddle after a rough night. The Kicking and Screaming breakfast tacos are heaven on a plate. I've never been so obsessed with a restaurant. The prices are not only incredibly reasonable, the portions will last you with enough food for at least 2 days. GO TO THE GRIDDLE!

As breakfasty places go in LA.. I was a bit skeptical since its seems that for such a sleepy city (in that no one gets up before 10am in LA.).Plus, ÊI've had some very lackluster experiences at some of the so-called "great breakfast places" in Los Feliz and Silverlake and Sunset Junction. which basically consisted of me standing in a line for the privilege of getting my order taken- like I'm at McDonalds..and then having to self serve for condiments and to PAY the same price for mediocre food without service...just what I want on the weekend.) Êcompletely over rated..I just wanted to find a place (other than the Pantry) to have a good, cheap, breakfast as I am not one of those people who think Dennys or I Hop fit that bill.. Well, we knew to get there early and in early I mean..before 10am..:) we arrived at 915 on a Sunday morning and were seated promptly..they also had a couple tables left outside.. but we opted for inside since I wanted to have that experience..oh, they also have parking available behind the restaurant. A PLUS... The restaurant was about 3/4 full at this time. The have a cool diner type bar Êarea as well.. Although,no booths were available when we got there..which was fine, Êsince there was just 2 of us. It was a bit noisy, but we could still converse fine. Our server Êswung by upon our seating and even though she was clearly on her way to another table, she ACKNOWLEDGED us. As a former F & B person... even if you can not get to my table.. just say hello..this is the signature of ÊCUSTOMER SERVICE 101!!!! NO matter what business.. She came back got our beverage order .. and when we were not quite ready..was not annoyed with us (like so many others are) but POLITELY said she'd come back..she did, we ordered.. Eggs Benedict and Whole Wheat Pancakes.. I got my nice french pressed coffee within minutes.. and we waited about 10-15 minutes top for our food....Yes, the portions were ample!! But more importantly..tasty!! Êspot on! ÊOur server continued to come by check on us give us water re fills without asking. We could not ask for more. She anticipated my needing help with the Go box..and offered a tip in re heating..promptly brought our check..We will go back!! ÊNext time, we said we would sit outside. ÊI didn't ' get to try their signature potatoes that I saw on others' plates.. that looked YUMMMY!!! ÊBut the thick cut ham on the Eggs Benedict was quality and GOOD!!! I Êlooked around and saw nice thick quality bacon slices and beautiful FRESH fruit Êmeaning RIPE ( Ênot under ripe) on other diners' plates...My coffee was smooth and rich. again Quality all around.. I love it when restaurants get it right on all levels..because SO few do in Los Angeles especially... The menu items were not pricey for the food quality or the portions here. They are spot on. ÊWe essentially got 4 meals with an easy re heat for 15 min. in the oven..and tasted pretty good as well. Ê If you get there after 10am on the weekends.. expect a bit of a wait..but totally Worth it!!! Share, Share, Share order different items as all of the portions are perfect for that!

Very understated, but HUGE servings, excellent food, decent prices and you're actually allowed to park in the Rite Aid lot out back while you eat. They're famous for their large pancake menu and the ridiculous servings you get. I used to work near here, so if anyone came to lunch with me, we'd go here. You will request a doggy bag; I eat anything and I never finished here. I should also add that I've never waited more than say 10 minutes (I usually went around 1pm on a weekday), but I suppose it does get popular.

I was in town visiting a good friend and after a night of partying on Sunset we rolled out of bed and headed to the Griddle. ÊAfter circling around the parking lot for what seemed like an hour we finally found a spot. ÊWhen we got to the door, we were told that it was at least an hour wait. . .mind you I was really, really hung over and really needed something to eat. ÊSo I just gave my friend the evil eye and told her that it better be worth it. ÊShe promised that it would be. ÊFINALLY, after what seemed like an eternity we were seated; that place was packed! Ê I must say that the ambiance isn't that nice, but it does have that "cafe feel" and really cute waiters too! I ordered their Êinfamous french toast, which is huge and delicious!! The eggs and the bacon were great too! ÊI definitely recommend this place. . .just be prepared for a lot of people and a long wait. . .other than that it was great!!

Definitely choose the original french toast as your first choice. It was the best French Toast I've ever had! Worth coming back for! If you're going to tackle pancakes, you might need to bring a friend or two, because it's the size of a big cake. French Press coffee is great too. Bacon good and the hash browns is size of a brick (yet tasty enough). I haven't tried anything else yet, but the French toast and coffee is what brings me back!

This place is amazing! I come here as often as possible (not on weekends though cause the line is always ridiculously long). The pancakes are HUGE (like 5-6 meals if you take them home). The french toast is amazing, I like the chips ahoy one best, it seriously is so good. My mom was visiting town and I took her here and she always asks me about here. The servers are always friendly and apparently there's a secret french toast that isn't on the menu.

This place made me sign up to Yelp to leave a review. Hands down the best breakfast/lunch place I've been to in my life! I got the chocolate chip pancakes and they were awesome. Imagine three medium size pizzas stacked on top of one another. I'm not kidding, the portion size is ridiculous. There is no way one person could ever eat that monstrosity in one sitting. I read other reviews about the wait, but mine wasn't that long, about 25 mins. on a Saturday afternoon. The one negative is my girlfriend got the breakfast burrito and she said it sucked. On our next visit we're just going to split an order of the pancakes or the french toast which looked yummy. On a side note, I did see someone at the table next to me eating a chicken sandwich and fries that looked really good too. I'll try that on my 3rd visit...

This place is loud and crowded, but they serve some of the tastiest breakfast fare around. ÊAnd how many reasonably-priced breakfast spots serve their coffee in a french press with varying strengths, or have several different types of chili for your omelette, or have amazingly tasty creative french toast options to tickle your palate. ÊPersonally, we go for either a chili omelette and/or the peanut butter french toast, and of course the coffee. ÊThis is our favorite breakfast spot.

PANCAKES!!! ÊI've been here 3 times and I've always gotten pancakes. I've even developed a Griddle Cafe pancake-eating strategy (start from the center and create a set of Michelins.) ÊIf you're looking for the indie-film, subtle, gourmet version of pancakes, go elsewhere. These are over-the-top tent-pole, ginormously dulcet Broadway productions with whatever the pancake equivalent is of parading showgirls in feather boas! It's obscene. And awesome! Takeru "Tsunami" Kobayashi could not finish these. ÊThe waits are long but it's worth it just to see the bulging eyes of your virgin comrades when they viddy the stacks on adjoining tables. The private room in the back is excellent for a morning meeting and there's a DVD player/TV in there should you want to watch a documentary about famine or something. Come here for the ridiculously gargantuan cakes and leave with a myocardial infarction. ÊPlan nothing for the remainder of the day as you will have no choice but to sloth around like Jaba for several hours. ÊTheir pancakes make me proud to be an American.

Came back and tried the Oreo pancakes, some breakfast burrito plate, and gave Chicago Charlie's scramble another chance. ÊAs everyone says, the pancakes are ginormous and comes in a stack of 3. ÊI wanna say it has a diameter of 12 inches. ÊOne look at it made me feel like I was gonna have a heart attack and get diabetes. ÊHow and why on earth someone would want to eat this on his/her own is way beyond on me. ÊBetween the 3 of us, we managed to eat about a third of it. ÊSure, it was good, but you seriously need to share this with at least 5 people, and 5 people that love sugar. ÊMy original opinion on the Chicago Charlie's scramble still stands: kinda bland and nothing special. ÊI really can just make this at home.. cause I'm not that great of a cook. ÊThe breakfast burrito dish was mediocre. ÊPerhaps, the sandwiches are better? ÊProbably not and I'm not going to come back a third time to find out.

This is one of those places in LA that people say you HAVE to go to and when you get there it's like most other places that people say that about. It definitely was not the best breakfast food I have ever had but it was still good. When we got there about 20 people were standing outside waiting for a table and I thought to myself great!! I'm starving and this is going to take for ever. Surprisingly we only had to wait for about 12 minutes and we were seated. If you don't like eating almost on top of other people then this is not the place for you. The tables are so close together that the waiters can barely squeeze through. The service was really good and our food came out pretty quickly. We ordered the French toast and an omelet to split. The French toast is definitely over rated but still good. Everyone I talked to said that they were famous for their French toast but I failed to see why. The omelet was delicious and huge!! The French Toast and omelet split between two people is more than enough. Overall not a bad place but I am still on the hunt for the "best" French toast.

As if though this place needed another review, I'm here to commend The Griddle. The omlettes and pancakes we had were really unique....in Êa good way. The quantities are huge, and the prices were just about what you'd pay at the bland IHOP. So hop over the Denny's or Norm's, and get to the The Griddle. There is free parking behind the restaurant, but its limited. In addition, be prepared to wait a while for a table during the weekend morning.

Waited 45 minutes to eat breakfast this morning there, only to be shoved like sardines into this dumpy, seedy, dive-bar-looking breakfast place. ÊThe coffee was so disgusting and that's my first criteria in making a good breakfast place. ÊThe food was very average. ÊAfter breakfast, we stayed chatting in our booth (i figure we waited 45 minutes--we earned it!) and were asked to hurry it up since the line outside was at an hour and a half wait now.

I think that when a restaurant does something better than anyone around does it, people will come, and come they do, in droves. ÊWe arrived at the Griddle at 11:20am on Sunday and driving down Sunset, you could see the line from a block away. Ê I was so lucky to snag a parking space right in front, what a lucky guy I am. The host is a funny little short guy that obviously has the temperament to deal with the crowds. ÊHe is very funny and calls all the girls "Gorgeous". ÊHe took our name and told us it would be a 40 minute wait. ÊIt turned out to be about 55 minutes, but he stayed in touch with us the whole time and remembered my name! ÊI was impressed. ÊWe ended up sitting at a table outside on the sidewalk and I was thankful to get it. I swear, he must have the hardest job around, dealing with all the hung-over hipsters that think that they are entitled. ÊHe however tames the lion with his attention and humor. I ordered the Peanut Bubba, crunchy french toast dipped in peanut butter crunch and grilled topped with fresh whipped cream. ÊI also saw a person at the next table eating Griddle Potatoes and just had to order a side of them. Ê The coffee here is served freshly pressed with the pot delivered to your table, good move and a great cup of coffee especially if you let it steep for a while, each cup better than the last. The portions are ridiculously large but so,so,so good. my french toast was crunchy and sweet and thick. ÊYou don't even need to use the real maple syrup that is provided on the table. My friend had the "Eyes Wide Open" pancakes. They mix the buttermilk pancake mix Êwith espresso and semisweet chocolate chips....simply heaven and also did not need any syrup. ÊThe Griddle Potatoes with onions and a crispy top, oh man that was good. Thankfully they have to-go boxes, which you will need, trust me. ÊGriddle Cafe is absolutely worth the wait. ÊI can't wait to go back next time and try an egg dish, and after that, I can't wait to go back to try lunch. ÊI guess I'm going to have to do my homework and find out when the wait isn't so long, but I would wait just the same.

Very cool LA vibe and loved the food. I'm a huge fan of breakfast, even more for brunch so I can sleep in. This place is yummy, cozy and reasonably priced. I was torn between the stuffed Nutella french toast and red velvet pancakes. I think it already had me at Nutella, but I picked it thinking it would be smaller than the pancakes. I had eyeballed how big their pancakes are when someone else's order came out. The people next to me ordered some bacon and my mouth was already salivating with envy so I added that as well. Warning, the portions are huge! (even the french toast lol) My french toast was more dessert than breakfast. I barely ate half and felt like a happy lil pig. My bf ordered an omelet with potatoes and I couldn't get enough of his. I think I'm just more a savory girl than sweet, but do recommend someone at your table order pancakes or french toast to balance out all the other salty/savory breakfast foods. Only regret I have is attempting to hike Runyon Canyon after with all the beautiful people hopping along with their pups as I crawled up the steep mountain wanting to die. Exercise BEFORE you come here, cuz your mind will have less guilt and all your body will want to do after is take a nap.

Super keeler egg dishes with massive portions, so come hungry! The waffles and pancakes are more like deserts, so I would recommend sharing one with someone. I have tried the breakfast burrito (it has a name but can't rememeber) and i ordered it without the tortilla...super grub. yesterday I ordered the "some like it hot" scramble and it was unbelievable with the tequila chicken sausage! It comes with chips, but i substituted for hash browns (which are amazing as well) and a huge portion of taters! Another first for me was the raspberry mimosa...very tasty, and literally spoon fulls of raspberry in the glass! Charlies Scramble is another favorite, you can't go wrong with this one! Lastly, The Nutella French toast is epic as well, but more of a desert in my book. They also serve coffee in french presses for that extra flavor. Lastly, you have to be prepared to wait in line as this place is always packed. So, if you want to eat quickly, come as a party of 2 and it might only be 20mins. GO EAT HERE, IT IS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!

ONE piece! and it was still too much. it was so overwhelming. just looking at it makes me full. the pancakes had tons of oreos! it was almost like a pancake-battered oreo. with whipped cream and powdered sugar on top. so i totally don't understand why my husband even asked for syrup!got sausages to go with it. sausage was just ok. also bigger than the usual breakfast sausage. my friend got the french toast with the chocolate chip. it was good too. when she first saw it she said "that's not bad. at least it's only 2 pcs". so we all thought that she probably could eat the whole thing since it's not as much as the pancakes. but then she also ordered a "side" of steak fries. thinking it's probably just a small plate of fries. but since we're in the Griddle, we shouldn't expect that there's such thing as a "side" portion. at least we know now. so my friend didn't finish the french toast. and we all shared the fries (i personally don't like steak fries. but i did like their seasoning) but still didn't manage to eat it all. so we got 2 of the biggest to-go containers i've seen. went home and gave the 2 remaining pcs of pancakes to brother. he's a big eater!!! so we know he'll be able to finish it. BUT!!! he didn't!!! we couldn't believe it! he had like 3 or 5 slices of the pancakes and just stopped eating it! unbelievable! i think 5 or 6 people can share the pancakes! we'll be back to try other things. but would probably bring more people. and we'll probably wait 2-3 months before we go back. just thinking about how much the food was makes me want to go on food coma! and until now we're still trying to finish the damn pancakes. 1 1/2 more! the best part of my meal was that awesome french press coffee (dark)! it was really really good! too bad i wasn't able to drink as much as i wanted because i was so damn full! but it was good! i just hope that the servers were nicer and friendlier (they won't even smile or at least fake a smile). it would have been a more "fun" and pleasant breakfast.

I would never DARE go there on a Saturday or Sunday morning, if I did it probably wouldn't get 5 stars because I'd be pissy about the waiting around...I already don't like waiting in line to eat and on top of it, waiting in line for breakfast when your tired and/or hungover and/or drunk, forget about it....I go there on Monday or Tuesday mornings and the longest I've waited was 20 minutes AND I always wait for a booth to open, always. ÊSo with that being said, the wait ain't bad...It's crazy, I get an insatiable craving for the eggs Benedict (their version) and the old fashioned french toast/pancake type thing...I craveeee it for weeeeks and when I get there I eat and drink coffee and laugh and then out of no where I feel like crying...this is why I always wait for a booth- I have to lay down in the booth for about 15 minutes before we leave...My eyes are always hungrier than my stomach and therefore I end up eating myself into a true food coma-I actually just have my eyes closed, may be accompanied by moaning...PORTIONS ARE HUGE...FOOD IS DELICIOUS....COFFEE IS THE BOMB....KANYE WEST KNOCKED MY FORK OFF MY PLATE AS HE WAS QUICKLY SHUFFLING BY EYES GLUED TO HIS BLACKBERRY....DON"T GO ON A SUNDAY MORNING-BUT IF YOU MUST, THEN BRING ONE OF THOSE PORTABLE STADIUM SEATS...seriously, that would be halarious!

Delicious breakfast with huuuuuuge portions. I have never seen pancakes or french toast this big! The griddled potatoes and gourmet sausage were not that great. But the breakfasts that they are famous for are excellent. I ordered "A Time to Love" to share with a friend and we couldn't even finish 1/4 of the pancakes combined. The place is small but suuuper crowded. I arrived at noon and had to wait 20 minutes to be seated. Everything is so fast paced and they don't mess around so I suggest you know what you want to order before you are seated so that you don't waste time. Don't be intimidated by the atmosphere. It's a place that you get in and get out without lallygagging over the check or meal conversations. My friend and I were seated and we asked if we could have another place setting for our friend, They told us we were not allowed and they wouldn't budge. It is understandable though because of how packed the place always is. I loved it and am going back for round two this week!

my boyfriend and i came here on a whim. we were looking for a good place for brunch so i went on yelp and voila this placed popped up. we were surprised at how big the portions were. when we walked in we saw everyone with their pancakes. i was tempted to order one, but i was really in the mood for waffles with strawberry and that's exactly what i got. he ordered something completely diff. he got eggs. potatoes and ham. it was really yummy. there was this cream thing on my waffles that i wasn't too fond of. but the waffles itself were really light and fluffy and the strawberries were really fresh.

I'd eat here every day but my trainers would probably make my life hellish if I did. Wow, does that ever sound LA? ÊLove this place, crave this place. ÊThe food is outstanding and the portion sizes are so huge that you can take quite a lot of it home. ÊGranted I hit The Griddle when I am famished but everything I've tried has been incredible and I am enjoying working my way through the menu.

ÊI went back the next day because I forgot my credit card and both the host and the server remembered my nickname and were so courteous. ÊWe had to wait 30 min to sit but it was well worth it.

OMG, this is the best breakfast place in LA! Went there twice in a row. If you love seafood, I highly recommend the "Gone Shrimping" eggs dish. People dont know that you can actually order just one pancake ves having all three huge pieces. Just ask! You can also have half a toast. All dishes are so HUGE but the best part is that I did not eat for the rest of the day. Remained full seriously! I usually went around mid-day and that did it for me. Love love the place. The chocolate crusted toast are to die for!! The wait is also not bad, 30 mins max. I highly recommend that you visit here if you are in LA. Now, if you live in LA, perhaps you dont want to eat here every day to save your calories:) but the egg dishes are not greasy at all and very well made. LOVE IT!!! Did I mention that already?

The food here is really good but I would recommend taking out rather than eating in. ÊThe portions are huge. ÊI had a omlette but this place speciailzes in pancakes. ÊI couldn't eat a plate full of pancakes but other people seemed to really like them. ÊIt is overcrowded and dingy inside and I was seated at a counter where all the people waiting watched me.

I visit LA and Hollywood a couple times a year. When there I eat at the Griddle Cafe once or twice a week. It is the best breakfast I have found. The pancakes are huge. Order only one(they will do that). There are so many choices, it is tough to decide between the ones I already like and the ones I would like to try, but I have never been disappointed. The coffee is excellent, too. Weekends, get there by 8:30 if you don't want to wait, weekdays before 9:00. You can park behind Rite Aid (enter off Fairfax) and enter the back door.

i wonder why these places serve such huge portions? just genuine curiosity.... Very very crowded ...they do have a good system for sitting people but still. I feel slightly claustrophobic being this close to the plate of the people sitting next to us, the sitting is that tight. Fiance got the blueberry pancakes- ÊHUGE. Êboth of us were only able to finish about 20 % ( yes, we did a pie chart lol) I got the pomodoro omelet- now that was a bit odd...eggs were tough, tomatoes were super watery, garlic chunks were actually quite large ( came to discover that at home ) Still have the pancakes- its unrealistic for 2 ppl to finish them in 2-3 days. However- when we went to the BLD and got the ricotta blueberry pancakes- we finished the ENTIRE plate on the spot....i think we will be going back to BLD instead of the Griddle

Where to even start with The Griddle? This place is my favorite brunch stop in the entire state of California.... That being said, I can guarantee that if you went here every weekend, you would get fat. Not like Christina Hendricks "fat" but like Nikki Blonsky "omg it's coming right at me HIDE" fat. The portions here are huggggggggge plus there are hot waiters everywhere causing unexplainable lapses in judgment with things like: how much you're eating... leaving your number on the receipt.... running into said waiters in Vegas and sleeping with them??? I've only observed these severe lapses in judgment with my friends, honest truth haha. To ensure a hasty seating, for the love of God go at off hours to avoid the huge 1-2 hour line that can occur on the weekends... because (speaking from experience) waiting for a table for an hour outside in the sun while hungover and watching other people enjoy their giant buttermilk pancakes and huevos rancheros on the patio is the worst feeling ever.

I am a little put out that I did not try any of the sweet, sugary, divine looking breakfasts sweets, especially since we drove up there specifically for this place!! Anyhow, I ordered the Huevos Rancheros Plate....which was pretty good....but if you ask me it was lacking an authentic mexican flavor, but the ingredients were fresh and plentiful..just was lacking spice; which I love. I also got a side of chicken breast, and it was pressed chicken!!!! EEEEEEwwwwww!! I despise cheap meat; especially when you are paying more than the norm!! Anyhow, I want to try this place again, just have to get the sweet stuff to go for later in the day...like for a dessert instead of breakfast! Downside.....expensive, for two it will apprx $30, and the worst part about this place is the atmosphere; it is loud and even worse it was FREEZING, like 55 degrees freezing....so bring a sweater no matter how nice the day is!

portions are out of control ridonkulous. there are places where you pay $$$ and get what amounts to gourmet art that leaves you yearning for some in-n-out afterwards. then there are places like griddle cafe that have portions that are just plain silly. ann & i came here for brunch and split the golden ticket pancakes and the caballero. and by split i mean we ate 10% of those 2 dishes. seriously, at $12, the golden ticket is enough to feed a family of 6. i hate wasting food, so we took about 2 pounds of the leftovers home, but most people just make a tiny dent in the pancakes then just throw the rest away. i mean seriously, if the portions are this big, just freaking charge me $1.20 and i will gladly finish the 2000 calorie 1/10 slice of your mammoth pancakes. don't get me wrong, the food is awesome, but something about wasting that much just knocks a few stars off in my book.

I used to lhave a mad crush on you Griddle Cafe,....but as you probably have figured out by now, it seems the passion between us has cooled.. Êthat last meeting was mos def a lil awkward. ÊI know, I was really hungover, but there was something about you that just wasn't right. ÊYou had alwyas been there for me, and I had been a willing particiapnt in your flirations with me. ou fed me. you you made me feel like I was part of the LA tribe. im not sure if I changed or you did but... Êmaybe Im just growing up or your jsut growing stale. ÊI dont know. back in the day.. your mantra: Quantitiy over Quality was what I lived for...but now the idea of having 3 HUGE pancakces overflowing on my plate that are olny slightly above average--just deosent cut it.... Êthe aslt time we met was proabbly the last ... it was 3 weeks ago. ÊI had crashed at my friends house and I was trekking to my pad and thought why not ceck out the old dame...the place was packed on a weekday morning (does anyone in this town work or go to school??? dont answer) I ordered the that addicted to noiselal/nutella French Toast. ÊI LOVE frecnh toast and LOVE nutella. Êbut i guess when you combine the two its just TOO much..wtf. ÊI kind of like stting outside in a twon with such great wheter but ...they pack us in so close together...If I wwas a new yorker, I woudn't think twice, but here in cali we like to have a lil space. Ê another lame thing about you is you parked your butt next to that atrocious sunset/farifax rite-aid. fi you were the only game in town then id probably grin and bear it and pretend that nothing has changed between us, but...guess what ever heard of all my freinds on ÊBeverly, 3rd street, santa monica blvd, la brea, they all serve a way Êbetter breakfast. Êyeah there are a lot of pretentious hipster and overly done up weho clones there too, but the food is way better and the wait maybe slightly shorter--(although some of those can have an excrutiating waut. Êbut for some reason chillin for an hour on 3rd or beverly seems better than this slowly gentryfing location. even down the road on sunset (west) is Jinky's. while she technically was raised in the 818, ÊI would have no problem goin out on a date with her. Im sorry. maybe its being squeezed into a table surrounded by hipster wannabees in their skiiny jeans, LA attitidue, faux hawk & emo scarf --need I go on. I have to admit the prices are not the problem, its the average food , the 'trying too hard' clientele and hit-or miss service. Êyou can be a moody b**ch sometimes. other times your awesome. Êbut most people when they go out for breakfast they have a particular thing they have in mind ant they are looking for consistency...here you never know.I can understand waiting an hour for a table for something good but here. not worth it..probably one of the most overrated places in the greater hollywood/west hollywood/midtown area. I guess I would still go if some of my friends insisited on it...but most of them hate this place so...sorry griddle cafe...when I was young, naive, obnoxious and self-absorbed we seemed to be Êa perfect match but now that im in my 30's and maybe a tad wiser I finally see you for who you really are..skip this place.

I don't get it! I had a horrible meal here... Service was fine and it wasn't busy the Friday when we went but still... Neither of us got pancakes though, so perhaps that's why we missed the good dishes? I don't know, the egg dish I got was pretty foul and didn't sit well several hours later...

3.5 for the pancakes. ÊIf the line weren't so long on the weekends, I'd be 300 pounds by now. ÊThe pancakes are delicious and the size of miami (get the blueberry), the chilis are phenomenal (ask them to let you taste them), and the crowd's great for people watching. ÊPlus, if you're into that sort of thing (or have friends in town from the midwest), you can always come star-sighting here. ÊThe last couple of times I was here I saw ashlee simpson and one of the guys from 90210. ÊCome here when you have a weekday off and a gigantic appetite. The food isn't gourmet (you don't get ingredients that are quite as nice as, say, doughboys or toast), but for what it's worth, it's hot, huge, and hollywood. ÊDon't forget about the chili (and chili fries) and the blueberry with blueberry sour cream pancakes (split them). ÊYou haven't lived until you've eaten those pancakes. ÊWhile it's not the place I'd come every day (or every week, for that matter), it's a great hollywood breakfast diner.

Well, you know, I have heard great things about this place, not only from Yelpers, but from coworkers, since I work in the area..I went there one morning working, and maybe because I was working, but the quality of food just wasn't that impressive. ÊI was told to try the french toast and since I love french toast, I decided to order it. ÊThere was two thick slices of bread, and lightly coated with powdered sugar. ÊThe toast got soggy after I ate a bite or two. ÊAnd not from the syrup because I'm the one who puts just enough of syrup on the plate for one bite and adds some more for the next bite for fear of getting the toast soggy. ÊI liked the syrup, it tastes like the pure, thin consistency maple syrup. ÊI was disappointed. ÊThen I ordered a side of bacon which was really salty and well over done to the point that it was burnt on some parts. ÊMy partner's toast came and that was pretty much burnt too. ÊI'll probably go back just because I can't believe that I had such a subpar experience when everyone is raving about it...and because there's so much other things to order..and I'll probably go when I'm NOT working...

I visited your caf this afternoon to have lunch with 5 of my neighbors. ÊI was treated rudely, with no consideration for my happiness for your business and finally, I was physically intimidated and bumped by an individual who was introduced as your "manager". ÊThis despicable display of "customer service" was so appalling and was performed in front of so many of my friends, your employees and fellow customers, that one of the 14 people I have already mentioned this episode to today, thought I should mention it to whoever it is who represents the business interest of your company. ÊMy take on this was, there is no way this business, which has repeatedly displayed such a lack of concern for their customers would care. ÊAnd as further proof I pointed out to my neighbor that your manager told me so. ÊHis exact words were, "I don't care whether you are happy or not". ÊAny business that would allow themselves to be represented by the type of individual who was representing your establishment today, must clearly not care . Still, after telling her about my experience she was so shocked that she encouraged me to write to you. ÊSo, in the spirit of good sport, I made a bet with her: ÊIf I do not get a prompt and Êappropriate response to this letter, she would have to post my story on her Facebook page and tell 20 people personally about it. ÊIf, on the other hand, I received an adequate reply, I would let the matter drop and chalk it up to someone's inability to see the larger picture and while I will no longer patronize your restaurant, at least I will refrain from making this episode my current cause.

A group of 13 rolls in around 10:30am on a Saturday morning. We get seated in a private room in the back that looks like a lounge after approximately an hour. Though everyone told me that the portions were ridiculous, I couldn't believe that it was really that much so we decided to split 2 stacks of 3 pancakes between 3 girls. When the pancakes came out I was completely flabbergasted. These pancakes were larger than a steering wheel and the amount of whipped cream gave the pancakes another dimension of HUGE. We had"Hear Me Roar" with cornflakes and strawberries, and "The Golden Ticket" with banana, nuts, cinnamon streusel and caramel topping. The former was really good since I was craving strawberries or some sort of fruity pancake and the latter was really good because it was so sweet and moist. The 3 of us barely dented the pancakes finishing a total of 1/2 of one of the stacks we ordered but with the help of our friends, we were able to make it through one full stack. Other items that were ordered were a little less ridiculously huge but were just as filling to the people eating them. I'm just going to say you have to try it. Make use of multiple stomaches.

ÊI actually found a spot down the street in the residential neighborhood. ÊAs I walked up to the restaurant, I couldn't help but think how long we were going to have to wait. ÊTurns out that my girlfriend was already inside waiting for me and she even went ahead and ordered me a glass of orange juice. ÊShe told me that most of the folks outside waiting were in parties of 3 or more so getting a table for 2 was easy. ÊAs I made my way to our table I noticed all the absolutely gigantic pancakes on people's tables. ÊWhen I say gigantic, I mean like 12 to 14 inches of round syrupy buttery goodness. ÊI thought I died and went to hotcake heaven! ÊThose were a must to order. ÊI figured I was in town on vacation so screw it, I'll order something on the side to nibble on as well. ÊI got the Some Like It "HOT" Scramble and was pleasantly surprised with it's flavor. ÊIt did have a little too much tequila-spiked rancheros sauce for my liking, so I just scooped some of it off and put it to the side. ÊWith that dish and the two pancakes we ordered I was stuffed when we walked out. ÊI can say that I didn't eat again until we got to Dodger Stadium for the game. ÊOverall, not a bad place at all to go eat breakfast if you have an empty stomach and patience if there's a wait.

I'm not into sweets, but my friends are and this definitely hits the spot. The portions on the french toast and pancakes are huge! I personally like the tequila sunrise. Be ready for a line, but the wait is worth it =) Enjoy this awesome spot and bring quarters for parking.

This place is amazing... Ive been twice when we were going to a taping of the Ellen Show. ÊIts about 10 minutes away from the warner brothers studios. Anyways both times we ordered pancakes. The first time we got the "Tis The Season Pumpkin Pancakes" they were amazing of course, and this last time we decided to try a different kind and we went with the "Mounds of Pleasure Pancakes". If you like Mounds candy bars and can handle your sweets I would recommend both of these. ÊWe ordered the full stack of 3 massive pancakes that weighed more than my chihuahua and this last time we felt a bit funny sitting at the bar between 2 people one with fruit and egg whites and the other with oatmeal and egg whites. ÊWe came to the assumption that their eggwhites must be good. We also tried the Italian Veggi Sandwich and the Grilled Cheese Sandwich both were good but the pancakes are what you should go for. ÊFor the amount of food you get its definetly worth the money. ÊI would say go with a big group and SHARE everything! Both times we've been was a Thursday morning around 8:30 and we didnt have to wait and parking wasnt bad, but when we left there was a crowd. I heard about this place from Mark Hoppus from Blink 182 when he twittered he was here and Im so glad I tried it!

I consider myself very lucky to have had such a great first time experience here. ÊFirstly, my friends and I really had quite a bit of luck from beginning to end. ÊAmazingly we found parking on the street around the corner...at a broken meter - cha-ching! ÊThen as I mosey up to the restaurant past all the people waiting on a Saturday morning, and peek inside to put my name on what I'm expecting to be a very long list. ÊI tell the man with the clipboard that I needed a table for 4. ÊHe asked for my name and told me I was next....Next?!? ÊI wondered if I misheard him...so I hung out by the door just to make sure. ÊBut sure enough, not 2 minutes later, my party was seated. ÊMy friends are still wondering what I did to get us seated so quickly...but my lips are sealed.... After perusing the menu for a short while, we all decide on our orders and our very nice and easy on the eyes server came by to take them. ÊThe coffee comes in a nice french press and they recommend how long to let it steep before pushing the filter down. ÊFor food we had the breakfast burrito thing, the hunger pangs (which comes with a slice of ham that is bigger than the plate), the saturday morning fever pancakes and the nutella french toast. All was right with the world....the food came out in good order and was tasty. ÊThe breakfast burrito is filled with green chilies and a chicken chiorzo and is served with tortilla chips and a nice pico de gallo. ÊThere is a good selection of hot sauces to douse the burrito with. ÊThe real stand out (but I may be biased) is the breakfast meats. ÊWe had ordered sides of the sausage and bacon, so combined with the plate of ham we were pretty set. ÊThe sweets were a nice finish to the meal. ÊThe french toast was the real stand out for me, but the pancakes were delightfully fluffy even after the mound of butter seeped into the bailey's and kahlua soaked breakfast cakes. Overall, I had a great first-timer's experience....though I'm afraid to go back, because it would be impossible for a repeat performance, right?

yelp has failed me on this one, the griddle cafe all hype. the food here is not half as good as the long line suggests. we got seated in the "vip room," which is basically a dumpy back room that smelled like milk with a grubby sofa for seating. -1 for the ambiance. we had pancakes and french toasts. pancakes were good and very huge. but i guess if you're paying $10 for a pancake, they ought to be big. i heard the done up french toasts were just mediocre and were way too sweet. i had the "eggs benedict" and i put that in quotes because there are no real eggs benedict on the menu, only a variation of them with potato skins instead of english muffins. i had them swap out the skins for sourdough bread. so my pseudobenedict came as layers of bread with a big cancerous slab of ham on top, and two poached eggs i could not taste nor see under the overwhelming COLD to LUKE WARM hollandaise sauce poured on top. it was everywhere, and pretty gross. the waiter said, "it usually comes cold." ok. i just wasn't into it, and am sad los angeles sees this place as one of the best places to get breakfast.

The pancakes are very good at that this place the only problem is they give you to way to much. ÊI wish they had a smaller portion combined with a combo.

I'm from Chicago so I'm not used to lines. ÊApparently waiting in lines is a favorite past time for people in LA. ÊThe Griddle was no exception. There was a dude with a major Napolean complex working the line and pissing off customers while we waited. ÊWe were there an hour and twenty minutes just to get in. ÊThe food was just alright, even after letting my hunger build AND I saw a couple of things fall on the ground (plates, carry out boxes) and get served to customers. ÊAlso, I was seated next to the kitchen and noticed the cook sweating into the frying pan. ÊGROSS. ÊI would never go back. ÊThe abundance of hipsters pissed me off too. ÊI will say the server was good. ÊWe passed an IHOP on the way there and I wish that I had stopped (I don't like IHOP all that much but at least it's sanitary). ÊIn conclusion, this place is terrible.

I visited the Griddle while traveling to Los Angeles and was very impressed with this hole in the wall spot. ÊWe found it through a random Google breakfast search and happened upon this find nearby to where we were. ÊI ordered pancakes which were huge! ÊThey stacked high and overflowed the very large plate. ÊThey were filled with yummy berries and were delicious. ÊOur server was a cool young guy, happy to help but not overly attentive. ÊMy only complaint is that pancakes don't work all that well as left-overs and there's no way I could even eat just a portion of that meal. ÊSo a lot went to waste. ÊBut, when I'm back in LA, I'll be sure to visit again (and bring friends to help me finish the food on my plate!)

Every time I'm in LA, I try to make a stop at this place. Although the place doesn't look that appealing once you walk in, they have the best pancakes and french toast. The portions are immensely HUGE!! I can't stress it enough. One order of pancakes or french toast can feed a group of 3 and the prices are reasonable. The wait can be horrible during the weekends, but during the weekday you can get seated right away. On occasion, you'll see a celebrity eating right next you, if you're into that stuff. Haven't had any bad experiences so far.

I liked the ambiance here better than I liked the food. ÊI'd go back just to get a seat at the horse-shoe shaped counter right off the kitchen. ÊBut now that I've run the gauntlet, I'd order smart. ÊThe food is heavy and kind of gross. ÊWhat's the point of a stack of 3 pancakes when each one is falling over the sides of a 9 inch plate? ÊAnd their version of eggs benedict definitely sounded better on paper. ÊPotato skins are deep fried, which in itself is gross when you're topping them with hollandaise, right? ÊThe eggs are fine, OK, but then there's at least a full cup of thick artery-clogging sauce drenching the plate- oh, and did I mention that it's 3 hollowed out skins and 3 eggs?

Unless you're a complete glutton who likes to eat in a dark, dirty, dingy hole this place is not for you. The portions are disgustingly huge and sum up everything bad about the food culture of America. Anyone who eats here should be ashamed of the food that gets wasted.

I don't think breakfast for three people should ever cost almost $90 bucks unless I'm at the Four Seasons. ÊGranted we each got a "mimosa" which is cleverly devoid of a price on the menu and oddly the waiter didn't know how much it was either. ÊTurns out it was $7.50 which is just too much, especially for it's petite size. ÊWe were seated right away which for a Sunday was impressive, but then the real wait began. ÊWe got our drinks promptly, but then sat forever till the food came out. ÊMy fiesta scrambled eggs were way over cooked. ÊHard as rocks. ÊThe cousin was unimpressed with his Chicago eggs dish as well. ÊMy fiance's dish however was actually really good, some chilaquiles type thing. ÊOur waiter was very nice, as was all the staff, but it was impossible to get his, or anyone else's attention while we waited. ÊPerhaps it was because the place was so cacophonous they couldn't hear our pleads for help. ÊI finally had to ask a neighboring table for their Tapatio. ÊThen the bill made my eyeballs fall out. ÊThree breakfast dishes, three mimosas and two beers. ÊNo coffees, no sides, no frills. Ê$89 with tip. ÊI'm sorry, but that's just reee-friggin-diculous. ÊWon't be going back unless I win the lottery.

Love me some Griddle Cafe. We come here for breakfast and for the pancakes, which are always fabulous. Not to mention huge! We've tried a few other breakfast items (I had an Italian scramble last time), and I would recommend passing on those and just sticking with the pancakes. The only draw back for me is that it does get crowded and busy and the service does get slow. Last time we ate there we had to wait almost 30 minutes after we were done just to get our check and pay! But its a fun atmosphere and oh those pancakes are so good the other issues can kinda be overlooked.

BEST PANCAKES EVER! I've eaten here twice and I ordered the pancakes both times. They have about 20 different unique pancakes and all of them sound delicious. I'm a 21 year old male and eat more than anyone I know...I could only finish half a stack of the pancakes. My friend got through 1/4 of his. I also oredered a side of 4 strips of bacon to offset the sweetness of the pancakes. Most expensive bacon ever, $5! The pancakes were pretty reasonable at $11 and can be split between 2-3 people.

. I'm so confused on how I feel about the way I was treated today by your staff and manager.. I called in to try and make a reservation for four but that wasn't possible and that wasn't an issue but your host rushed me off the phone and says "I'm busy got to goooo" instead of is there anything else I can help you with . When I came in and asked who answered the phone ? Immediately he begins to get defensive about the question. We go outside to wait after 15 minutes of waiting I ask if a table was opening up and then he says "clearly there's only table for parties of two, when a table for four opens up I'll give it to you " with the biggest attitude for no reason what so ever. At this point I wanted to speak to a manager and the servers ask me "what" what's the problem when it's none of their concern I just need a manager I'm not wanting togive the serve issues that they can't take care of . Sergio comes out once again and now with a vengeance in his eyes and won't look me in the face and starts counting money as I'm talking then says take a table or leave .. He goes inside them I'm like what's the problem with you why are you being aggressive with me ... This is when I feel like I'm going to really get hit by your manager because in fist is balled up I'm told step outside don't fuck with me. I'm not the one by your manager. All this infront of other customers .. My friends no longer wanted to eat there and also it's my best friends birthday, all she Wanted was your amazing blueberry pancakes and it really sucks that it wasn't possible because of the service we got . Thank you for taking the time to read my bad experience .

This place is definitely not for the health conscious. The menu has a huge selection. My friend and I split their 'sow your oats' with a side of eggs and coffee. When it came our jaws dropped as their portions are behemothic! gargantuan! monstrous! It was more like a cake than a pancake with three heaping layers larger than the plate itself. We worked so hard, nomming and nomming but alas we could not work through more than 1/4 of it. The pancakes were delicious and fluhhfy and full of oaty, honey-y, and cinnamony goodness, the eggs were also yummy, and the french press coffee nice and strong. For something that sounds so healthy the pancakes were good! The place is a little tight, which can come across as cozy. I've never gone with a huge line like everyone before. Parking can be a bit annoying, but I usually just go to the Rite Aid parking lot there are few spaces. Yummy I want some now as I write this review!

AMAZING food. HORRIBLE service. That said, I think perhaps my experience comes down to that particular waitress, because the other server on staff seemed great (he was giving excellent service to the table next to us) while our waitress treated us like we were annoying her just by being put in her section, got huffy when we asked a question, left our food waiting sitting in the window for over 10 minutes, waiting to be served while we stared at it hungrily, threw the check at me--literally--and THEN had the nerve to chase me down outside the restaurant and start screaming at me because I left a 10% tip with a note that I loved the food but not the service. I called and asked for a manager and was told by who I suspect was the very same waitress, that Êthe manager was not there most days, only Mon-Wed, and only for a couple of hours. So I sent an email, and received no response. My fellow diners were stunned and insulted by this horrible waitress, and it really ruined what otherwise would have been a great experience. Again, food was A+, so maybe I'll give it another go, but if I see that waitress I'm walking out.

the rumors are true-the french toast is to die for and their portions are big enough to leave a team of linebackers full for the rest of the day. the bacon could have been crispier for my liking but everything else was worth the 25 minute wait, the servers crashing into my chair, the tight quarters, and yelling into my friend's face so she could hear me over the noise. but i was there for the food, not the customer service or ambiance.

It's as good as everyone says so I'll skip to my complaint (briefly recommending the tacos): I've come in many times and on occasion I've bumped into the owner...she is just the rudest person I've ever seen in a service profession ever: She belittles and screams at her staff in front of customers, occasionally at customers (one time yelling at me for parking in her space when I walked to the restaurant...) she throws temper tantrums stomping through the dining area like an angry toddler, and she's generally surly and unpleasant. ÊShe doesn't seem to know what she's angry about and I've never seen her not yelling (not like I caught her on a bad day, this lady sucks). ÊThe good news is you're not likely to see her, but if you do, it's not pleasant. ÊThe better news is that I must really like the food and wait staff because I'm still giving it a 4. ÊWith all these great reviews you'd think she'd lighten up a bit?

so a great friend of mine says hey lets go out tonight and live it up, so needless to say it took some convincing on his part to get me revved up...yea right! so we went out on the town and had a great time, we stumbled in some time the next morning and after a post-vodka cat nap we woke quite starved, and needing non-alchoholic fluids, what do we think of you ask? pancakes with syrup, food and a non alcoholic liquid...perfect, since he lives off of sunset we strolled over to the griddle, he had french toast, i had a pancake...first of all it was the biggest pancake i had ever seen, i couldnt even finish it! and i never let good pancake go to waste...it was jam packed, elbow to elbow with folks, but oddly i didnt feel claustophobic, a bit of a line but the wait time was super short, i thought that i was still in a martini haze, but a peek at the watch showed it was indeed fast, the server was nice especialy considering the other hangover folks that jammed the joint, food arrived quickly and steaming hot, like i said pancake was hanging over the plate, it was really good, i simply could not get passed half of it, my buddy and i talked, laughed, poked fun at each other for the crazy stuff we were forced to do the night before...hey...mr. martini is VERY convincing ok...fun place good food...youll likey
