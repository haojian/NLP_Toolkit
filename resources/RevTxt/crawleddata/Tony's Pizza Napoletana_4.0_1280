A friend and I get together now and then for something cheesy, no pun intended. After seeing the review written up about the 'Meatball Gigante' with sea salted Burrata, we knew our destination. We went on a sunny Saturday afternoon. Our lucky stars were lining up; first, parking right out front. Next, about 15-20 minutes wait for a table, with 2 seats at the bar for us to chill. My cocktail of choice, Milano. We called it an adult kool-aid with Italian cherries in it. (side note, I need to buy a jar of Italian cherries, sooner than later). 3 of these went down almost a little too easy, and I certainly could have gone for number 4. After that first round of cocktails, we were seated at 'the chef's table', as I call it, right in front of the guys slingin pizzas. Everyone we encountered were absolutely fun and playful, friendly, and helped us have an even better time. Started off with Little Italy salad, minus olives (per me), just because the rest of the meal was heavy, and it was a great choice. Could have had maybe a little more gorgonzola. Funny thing, we came for the Burrata topped meatball, but fell in love with the meatball with Wild mushroom, pancetta, and Robiola. The meatballs, besides being Gigantic, were incredible, and a meal within themselves. The flavor, the texture, the sauce..oh the sauce..everything about these were perfect. Although we had no room for the Margherita Pizza, I brought that home. It had a lot of flavor, good crust. Next time, I'll try something a little more adventurous.

FIRST IMPRESSION: My friends and I went to Tony's slice shop (next door to the restaurant) to satisfy our sudden urge for pizza. We were greeted with a small storefront churning out some absolutely delicious slices! THE EATS: The group ordered just about everything they had, and it was all good, but I have to highlight two pizzas specifically. 1) California -- This pizza had meatball, garlic, ricotta, and Parmesan (beyond the pizza pie staples). The cheese was hot and stringy, giving you that sought-after commercial-style bite that really takes two or three to get it all. Ricotta gives this pizza a surprisingly sweet side, balancing out the salt in the mozzarella and meats. 2) Romana -- I'd compare this pizza to a margherita pizza, as the main topping was tomato. But add some shredded basil and a sweet and tangy balsamic demi glacé drizzle, and you'll learn to love the spectacular balance of acid, sweet, and salty. So good! THE VERDICT: This was some of the best pizza I've had. I'm no connoisseur, but I do know good food when I come across it. This will most definitely be a repeat stop on all my future San Fran visits. Yum!

When you hear that this place has won a "worlds best pizza" award - you would think that this place would have some freaking good pizza, so we checked it out. when we got there at 10pm the wait was for a hour, so we decided to get a slice of pizza while waited. We ordered two pizzas - Pancetta porcini and i forgot the name of the other pizza, but if i had to describe - it looked like a pizza with a salad on top drizzled with sweet sauce. The Pancetta porcini was really tasty for a pizza that did not come with any sauce. The pizza were all averaged around $20 or more. I wanted to try their world famous margheritas but they all sell out by 7. They only make 72 of them a day - i cant believe they limit the only pizza they are known for. This place served great tasting pizzas, BUT i wouldn't drive across the city since i live on the other side. I personally think that no pizza should cost more than $20 unless they have a rare ingredients on it. Everyone should try this place once because of its wide range of different pizza styles. I would probably come back on a blue moon just try their margherita pizza.

Ok guys, I can understand the hype about the world champ Margherita, but seriously if you eat in any north beach restaurant a thin crust pizza... you will get the same quality. This place is obviously always packed, we had to wait over 90mins to be seated, which is definitely not worth waiting. For people who don't want to wait 90 mins: Tony's has a small branch just next to the restaurant, where they offer food to go (pizza slices or even a whole pizza). The only thing is that you have to sit outside (w/o a heater) to enjoy the pizza. So if you don't wanna wait, and you totally wanna give tony a try, take a pizza to go or wear something warm.

I finally went here. The atmosphere was fun and tons of people were taking photos of the sign. The margherita pizza was a bit overrated, in my opinion. Good...but the burnt bottom took away from the flavor. The fried string beans and caprese salad were beyond amazing...wow! I heard the mussels were amazing...I'll have to try them next time. The service was great and they are all so friendly here.

The best meal from my weekend in SF.  1000 degree coal fired oven, award winning pizza, the best meatball appetizer I've had to date, fresh ingredients and even helpful staff despite the hustle of people here.  Aside from the award winning margherita pizza, may I recommend the clam pizza as well.   I thought I had cornered the market on awesome clam pizza upon my many visits to Modern and Sally's in New Haven, CT.   I was wrong.   This place absolutely tops it, down to actually topping the pizza with half open clams (and clam juice, yumm!!) Tough to add to the many reviews here but trust me.  Tourists and pizza purists... please stop here on your next trip to SF.

Best Italian Restaurant in the entire San Francisco Bay Area!!!  Visited Tony's for the first time this past weekend, and I want to kick myself for not coming here sooner!  Everytime we took a bite of the food, we shook our heads in amazement because we couldn't believe how absolutly wonderful the food is!!  We had their award winning Pizza Margherita, the prosciutto/arugulla pizza, and the appetizer meatballs & sauce.  It was all amazing....but I have to say (mind you I have only been here once, and have yet to try everything) my favorite thing so far is the meatballs & sauce. Awesome restaurant, I cannot wait to go again!!

Came here a few months back for my bday dinner and the wait wasn't too long on a weeknight which was a plus since its almost always busy.  You can smell the wonderful aroma from at least a block away.  Since we were a party of 2 we got seated at the pizza bar so I was able to see pizza that was made during my visit and that did make my ordering a bit difficult but we did get some suggestions from our wonderful server. For starers we had the caesar salad...one can almost never go wrong with this salad.  For our entree we were recommended buccatini...just enough heat without being too spicy...great recommendation.  And for the pizza we had the pancetta porcini...my love of porcini and truffle oil...so delish! This place is a definite for me to come back....and highly recommended!

Gotta give it up for this place.  The concierge at the Sir Francis Drake said this would be the best slice of pizza we ever tried. So we tried it. First, there are 2 store fronts.  If you dont want a sit down dinner and want a grab and go (i.e. you want to get a slice or pie to go) skip the restaurant and order in the window just up the street.  We did not this but, what the heck there is nice park across the street so how can you go wrong. We at at the restaurant.  Sure there was a long wait, but I was content having just had a pork bun from Eastern bakrey in Chinatown so I could wait.   When we were seated the watier was friendly and brought some bread and a small plate of oil and tomatoe based dip.  then on to the menu and dinner.  They have pies all different ways.  They have a speciality pie that sounds like it is made by virgins with super special flour and opera seranaded tomoatoes.  So we ordered one.  You need a small mortgage to pay for it, but what the hype.  Anyway, the server says, the super special flour is out so we will use the other stuff and you wont know the difference. If so, why not offer a price discount of even a dollar or 50 cents.  If you arent serving what is advertised then offer the diner dont charge the same price.  By the way, the pie (a margherita) was tasty.   We also ordered meatball appetizers.  three large meatballs for a couple of bucks.  Definitely worth it.  Take the bread and make yourself a meat ball sandwich an you dont break the bank eating here. We also ordered the caesar salad.  You never know what you are goihng to get in Ceasar world, so I always ask for anchovies on the side becaues I like them.  Most places just give them to you.  We got hit for 3 bucks as a side order.  They weren't oil soaked canned chovies.  These were whole marinated fish that were tasty, but I would have preferred the server telling me that there were a couple of the fishies on the salad already as I could have done without the extras.   We also ordered a coal fired pizza with pepperoni. Now this was awesome.  It cost almost 30 bucks, but it was good. On the super plus side, my kids ordered soda and a shirley temple and it was unlimited refills. Nice touch. DO NOT ORDER 2 pies for four people and an appetizer and a salad. way to much food.  We ended up taking our left over pizza back to the hotel and gave it to street person.  C'est la vie.

I would reccomend this place  to alot of people,  but not to everyone.  They do good business.  They obviiously are very popular and know thier market.  For me, this place is just ok, overpriced, very touristy.  I probably would never come here again, unless I'm in a situation where I think its appropriate.  Total fail to my buddy who brought me here, he likes TONS of SAUCE.

When we saw that this place had 1000+ reviews on Yelp, we knew we had to pencil it in during our trip. And let me tell you, it was well worth the 1-2 hour wait. We started with the calamari fritto misto, calabrese style. It arrived perfectly crunchy and with a bit of a spicy kick, a great spin on boring ol' fried calamari apps. They were out of their award-winning margherita pizza on the crust made from san felice flour, but we ordered it on a regular crust and it was still pretty freakin' good. We love margherita pizzas, and this one certainly did not disappoint with its gooey cheese and fresh julienned basil. I wonder how much of an impact the elusive special crust would've made. The crust was thin, a bit chewy, and crispy in all the right places. We also shared the pancetta porcini pizza, drizzled with truffle oil. The menu description stated that this one has no sauce, which worried me at first, but with the gooey cheese, smoky pancetta, earthy mushrooms, and truffle oil, we didn't miss it at all! It was a wonderfully flavorful pizza with a great combination of toppings. I'm definitely planning to come back in the near future to try their other pizzas, and hopefully catch the award-winning margherita next time to see if it's all it's cracked up to be!

Ever since I had my first pizza napoletana in DC, I've been searching across the west coast for something comparable. My home region of SoCal did nothing to appease my appetite, so when I came up to SF for a weekend I decided to take the plunge with Tony's Pizza Napoletana, a place that seemed like it'd offer what I was looking for. Boy, am I glad I came here. As expected, I grabbed a Margherita, and it was absolutely amazing. The dough, cheese, and toppings were absolutely perfect and took me instantly back to my days of constant pizza napoletana in DC. My fiancee picked up another pizza (the Cal Italia) that was completely different and topped with meats and a balsamic sauce that was simply divine. And the meatball - our appetizer was their signature meatball with a spicy tomato sauce and a fried egg, absolutely amazing. Admittedly, I was a bit perturbed at having to wait as long as I did for a lunch table, but damn was it worth it. This is not cheap pizza, but I can spare some extra cash to take a bite of perfection. Simply put, if you're looking for the real deal in pizza and you happen to be in Little Italy in SF. Just go here.

On a return visit for lunch, we got to sit at the counter in front of the pizza oven and chat with the staff, including Tony. It was a great experience for two foodies. Tried the fries, which were life-changing. Seriously, they are so, so good. It seems weird to order fries at a pizza place, but just do it. We also tried the margherita pizza, and thought it was delish. Again, I found myself admiring pizzas at other tables, so obviously we need to go back again and try more.

Went here with a group of friends and WOW! Started things off with a meatball, fantastic. We then ordered two different kinds of pies and shared. The Detroit style pizza was unbelievable! It was a thick crust that was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The other pizza was a New York style and it was cooked to perfection. What an amazing combination of cheese, sauce and toppings on both! I recommend this place to anyone who wants a delicious pizza experience.

By far the BEST gluten free pizza we have ever had!  A simple pepperoni GF pizza was a home run.  The crust was crispy on the bottom and nice and light.  The toppings were good quality and very fresh.  I can be a bit lactose intolerant sometimes, so the true test is after I eat three pieces.  Absolutely no upset tummy.   I have yet to have pizza this good in Los Angeles or New York.  Now how can I get this pizza in South Pasadena???  Thank you Tony!

Move over Pizzeria Delfina. Your Pizza Margherita ain't got NUTHIN on Tony's! You want balls of mozzerella cheese? with lots of fragrant basil? How about fresh tangy tomato sauce? Do you need a dough that's thin, cooked at 900 degrees for 90 seconds and has that charred character to it? Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. And YES!   Then, you'll LOVE the Margherita pizza here. There were 5 of us when we sat down, which became 7 halfway through dinner....because the laggers couldn't say no to Tony's Pizza. Take note that Tony's will ABSOLUTELY refuse to seat you until everyone in your party is here. Since we all had the appetites of a warrior, we ordered a caprese salad, french fries drizzled with honey and Parmesan (skip! what a weird combo), a Detroit style pizza with sausage, 2 pizza margherita, 2 pancetta porcini and a California style Barcelona pizza. (should've known better than to order a pizza with scrambled egg in it!) everything was well made, especially the Detroit style with its thick, buttered crust! I prefer deep dish style than thin ones and this was my favorite. Alkies should be happy with their full bar and varied wine list. Since Glenn G was so generous in bringing 3 bottles of wine to enjoy (corkage fee is $20 each) everyone had a glass of red to complement our pizza party. I was abstaining from alcohol (oh let the comments begin!) but all I can say is, everyone walked out of here happy and ... happy! Tony's is great place for groups: casual ambiance, fast service and allows you to sample multiple pies without putting a dent in your wallet.

Love that cal italia and spicy calamari but branched out into spanish territory with the calabrese sausage and quince jam pizza. A great pizza with chunks of sausage atop the sweet quince. I have loved every new pizza  concoction they cook up and this was no exception.Tried the little bird at the bar before dinner and i suggest you do too. Creme de voilette, lillet blanc, lemon lime and vodka. A beautiful voilet hue and a tasty drink that gets the job done.

This is one of those places that if you did have to wait 2 hours... Every pain staking hungry second would be worth it. My boyfriend intuitively looked it up the second we passed it during our bus tour of North Beach. Yelp said it was a go & that was a wrap for us, we decided on ABSOLUTELY having to eat there on our last night in San Francisco. To be completely honest it completed our trip!!! My boyfriend had to roll me back to our hotel in union square :-P. My only critiques of this place would be that if you ask the servers for help that they're not really all that precise. Not that that is a bad thing, I'm sure its because they love everything on the menu which is fine. What really helped was our server (Rose)'s explanation of the different types of crust. They do classic Italian styles (which have kind of a soggier crust, merrp) lol, and the best which is the COAL FIRED crunchy crisp goodness! Yumyumyum delicioso! We ordered the New Yorker WHICH WAS FANTASTIC! The crust was superb, unlike any other pizza crust I've ever had. The combination of the cheeses were fantastic, ugh. nothing could have made this pizza better. IT WAS ABSOLUTELY HEAVENLY! We also ordered another pizza (Of course I insisted we should) lol... IT was one of the italian ish ones with wild mushrooms and truffle oil. It was okay... i didn't really like it until i got a side of marinara with it because it is a sauceless pizza. I wouldn't order it again. However just one bite of the NEW YORKER sold me :-) so thats that! Go here... you won't be disappointed. Best pizza I've ever had ever... don't think i can eat papa johns anymore!

Great place for pizza lovers, as you have 9 different styles of pizza to choose from --ranging from Napolean wood-fired pizza at 900 degrees to Classic American at 550 degree gas ovens to Coal Fired pizza at 1000 degrees. We were in SF over spring break.  My husband LOVES pizza.  He thinks pizza is a food group on it's own.  After reading all of the reviews on Yelp & Urbanspoon, Tony's was at the top of his list to try. We ended up getting a caesar salad and a coal fired pizza called the New Yorker with natural casing pepperoni, sliced Italian fennel sausage, ricotta and fresh garlic and oregano.  It was one of the BEST pizzas we've ever had.  Our teenagers loved the place! Tony's is always busy, but you leave your cell phone number, and they call when your table is ready.

sometimes you just crave a good pie and you gotta satisfy it. before coming here i was jumping back and forth between neapolitan style pizza and new york style. but who would have thought u could live in a pizzeria universe? Detroit style? st louis style? Cal style? american tradition? i love its simplicity of ingredients in the neap style: fresh mozzarella and tomato, but on the other hand i love the high gluten thin crust folding new yorker with some fresh parmesan & dried chillies. there is something about ricotta on pizza that makes it so effin amazing. that's a happy ending..   if you're a real pizza lover this is going to be your ultimate place to try in sf. if dinning is full try the take-out located next door they are usually fairly quick.

Great spot with an excellent crowd and great management.  I am a native Castro Valley resident where Tony go his start at Pyzano's (R.I.P. Pyzano's).  Tony's focus on making the perfect pizza does not go unnoticed.   I've been here a number of times and I don't think I can come up with a better spot for pizza in the city.  They use a wood burning Italian oven which apparently is incredibly hard to come by these days.  Whatever they do, it works.  The pizzas are all fantastic. We were here a few days ago and ordered a specialty pizza and asked for it without mushrooms.  When we got this pizza it had mushrooms on it.  We pointed this out to our waitress and she admitted her mistake (rather than arguing with a he/she said deal).  She came back a few minutes later and informed us that the pizza was on the house.  Fantastic way to make up for it so she got a solid tip. Definitely highly recommend this place.  There normally is a good long wait and it's not cheap, but it is super good and totally worth it.

Went up to San Francisco recently to visit my best friend and she recommended Tony's! We waited approximately an hour and half BUT it was worth the wait! Just plan ahead, place your name and do some near by shopping or sight seeing of Little Italy while you wait :) They will phone you when your table is ready :) We shared a Caesar salad, fried string beans (OMG!!!!), and a tomato, spinach, garlic, ricotta, basil, and mozzarella pizza! Everything was absolutely delectable! They're famous for their Margherita pizza, but we missed out because they only make 73 of those lovely pies per day :( Oh well, more reason to come back! :D

With over 1,200 reviews, I don't think that Tony's really needs my review, but darn it, I often feel the need for Tony's pizza so I may as well offer my praise. I'd eat here every day if bread and cheese didn't make me fat. My favorites are the New Yorker, New Jersey Tomato Pie (American style), Jimmy the Greek, Detroit Syle, St Louis style (though don't get extra ricotta, because then it's ridiculously cheesy) , and the RIP Vodka, but even an average pizza at Tony's is better than just about any other pizza... in the world! Crusts are crispy, and toppings are tasty. Some items on the menu change occasionally which can be exciting or sad-making, depending on what I've been craving. The salads are also always fresh and flavorful, as are the cocktails. Service is always friendly and as informative as you'd like. This is the only restaurant where I'll wait for up to 2 hours without widening or rolling an eye. But since I'm prepared for the wait, I also know which bars (Tony & Nik's, Tope, or Amante) I'll likely go to while I wait for their sweet, sweet phone call.

I don't know ... I wonder if I just hit Tony's on an off day or maybe my expectations were so great but I thought the pizza here was just average. I'd been wanting to check out this place for years, knowing the pedigree and awards that the chef has won over the years.  I have no doubt about his talents and skills (and I still don't) but for some reason, the pies didn't wow me here. We ordered the famed Margherita (although they ran out of the 73 pies they make with San Felice flour, so they used regular flour for ours).  I don't know how much of a difference that makes but my initial impression was that it the super thin crust was not crispy enough (it droops when held at the crust).  Also, the charred, blistery crust also gave too much of a burnt taste for my liking.  The toppings, however, were quite nice. For comparison sakes, we also tried a California style pizza - the Wild Robiola (a white pizza with mozzarella, stracciatella, & robiola cheese, wild mushrooms, truffle oil, speck (smoked cured pork), piave and arugula).  The crust is thicker but again, I felt like this pie lacked much flavor. Don't get me wrong ... none of these pies are bad.  I just think I've been spoiled lately with pizzerias where I am simply blown away by the pizzas (e.g. Ragazza, Piccino, Rosso Pizzeria (in Santa Rosa), Pizzeria Mozza (in LA)).

Came here on a Friday night (around 6:30pm) and was told the wait was going to be an hour and a half which ended up being 2 hours. We ordered the Margherita (of course) and it comes out pretty quickly. It was pretty decent sized (about 12 inches diameter) and thin crusted. The one thing I didn't like about it was that on the bottom of the pizza near the crust was burnt! It was a good pizza.. very simple. We also ordered the New Yorker which had more going on in terms of meats and cheeses. It was bigger (16 inches) and a little thicker crust. It was really good too. The New Yorker took pretty long to come out; I'd say it was at least a half hour wait. Overall, it was an experience to try the highly raved pizzas but it wasn't the best I've ever had to wait 2 hours again for. If I were to come back, I'd pick a time where I wouldn't wait more than half an hour.

We went here around 2:30pm and got seat within 10 to 15 minutes. We ordered two pies - 1) Margherita ($19), and 2) Uncle Vito ($18). The Margherita was cool since there were only 73 made per day. The pizza had a thin crust but was made with high quality cheese. It's a lighter tasting pizza but nothing really stood out. Since we sat next the oven that made the pizza, we got our pizza five minutes after ordering. The Uncle Vito was a classic pizza made with pesto, garlic, onions, pancetta, and sweet ricotta. This pizza was a lot heavier and saltier than the Margherita. I picked off the pancetta, but I liked the thicker crust. I didn't taste the pesto too much. The complimentary bread with the three dipping sauce - garlic, pesto, and olive oil was good. I liked the pesto and garlic sauce. The pizzas are good at Tony's, but think they are overhyped.

I ate here with friends while visiting SF in May 2011. It came highly recommended by a local North beach  bartender, so we decided to check it out. It was a busy night & the only available table was outside on the patio. Other than the fact that we were freezing during dinner, my experience was pretty sweet. The pizzas were delicious & the wine selection vast. We shared a few bottles of Nebbiolo & enjoyed the  meatballs, SF Italian pizza & the Burratina di Margherita pizza. We were not disappointed. Great recommendation! Can't wait to go back!

Good pizza. I tried the honey pie. Less honey, lots of pepper. A little more spicer than I expected. The wait for our table was an hour.  I typically do not like to wait more than 30 minutes for a table but friends were in town visiting so I put my name in and went to a bar to have a beer. Over all pizza is good. I like their Margarita  pizza

I really liked this place.  There was a long wait (1 hour 45min), but they told me it would be about that long.   Stef at the Bar is great, friendly and fast....   The Pizza is great.  I will be back for sure, many times.  I do wish the wait was less, but I would rather they keep the quality up and make me wait.   They are not open on Monday or Tuesday, so plan accordingly.... Its my new favorite....  The Fried Squid, has a little too much batter on it for my taste, but the Pizza overcame that without question. Try the take-out....

I don't understand why this place is always so packed. I went there for @ 12:30 for lunch on Wednesday  and could only get a seat at the bar. Maybe I made a mistake by not ordering the signature pizza (I'll save that for the more casual signature slice house next door) but, instead, I took the bartender's suggestion for a pasta entree.  I ordered the Pasta Buccatini which was essentially one long sausage slapped onto some spaghetti.  I wasn't expecting something innovating but I thought this would at least taste excellent.  It was okay. Strangely (I'm a big fan of details) no fresh parmesan cheese is available at this (Italian?!) restaurant, no crushed black pepper is offered, and- the marinara sauce (I asked for a side with my bread) is not great... a travesty! The complimentary garlic bread though, with the three types of dipping oils, I will say is excellent and may entice me to come back for the pizza..

What's with SF and the lines you have to wait in? Every restaurant has them! This was one place where it was definitely worth it. Showed up at noon (when they open) and there was a large crowd milling around, no rhyme or reason to the crowd, just everyone kind of jams in to the front when they open. Seated at 12:30. Right next to the pizza oven. Right next to Tony. Awesome. Ordered two of the daily 73 Margherita pizzas available, a Cal Italia, a side of green beans and plenty of bread and amazing olive oil.  Four large appetites were filled with a couple slices leftover. The Margherita pizza is so simple I hate ordering it, I prefer meat on my pizza. But, this slice seemed to have been dipped in awesome and then served hot out of a brick oven. Holy amazeballs. It's quite possibly my favorite pizza ever. I don't live in SF, so I have only had it once, but from the stomach-rumbling memories it stirs, I will definitely be back. The Cal Italia was also good, but next to the Marg, it didn't resonate as long. They have sweet ceiling fans also.

http://www.worldpizzacha… Best Pizza in town from a world champion pizza acrobat, maker, and more?   I guess there's room for more brag rights besides claiming to have the best pizza in SF.  But seriously, the wait is insane.  Yah sure you can grab a slice in the small kiosk like spot next door, but it doesn't seem to be the same especially when you can run down the menu and pick and choose which pizza you want in what way.  This is the cool thing about Tony's.  You've got your deep dishes, your flat, and the super thin Sicilian type pizzas too. But because of the wait, we had filled ourselves up elsewhere and ended up just ordering the Cal Italia, a sweeter pizza due to the figs that happened to be cast between a a savory entree and dessert.  And on top of that, their meatball was also deliciously humungous.   To go with the pizza, I had a beer which tasted like a double or triple IPA which is ridiculously strong, one of the strongest beers I've ever had.   Hopefully I can visit again to explore more of the menu when its not so crowded.

Showed up on a busy Saturday night around 645 with a group of 4.  The waiting list is extremely long, and the wait was about 1 hour 45minz to 2 hours.  Went straight to the bar, and got couple seats.  The good thing is that they serve you regular menu at the bar as well, and it's first come first serve.   The highlight of the night is the Giant Meat Ball, it made of Veal, Pork and Beef.  It's so tender and the tomato sauce has a hint of spicy which made it even better.   It's a must have from the meun.  Besides that, we had both the quail egg, white rose potato and guanciale and Garlic and clam pizza.  The second pizza is lacking of a pinch of salt and some extra garlic.  Other than that, everything else was pretty good.   Please allow yourself half an hour to find parking in that neighborhood, otherwise there is a parking lot on Vallejo Street between Powell and Stockton.

I'm a New York transplant who has lived in Italy. In other words, I take pizza very seriously. Life is too short to have bad pizza. I used to live in Italy a block from a place that made brick oven pizza and I've never found anything that could come close to the deliciousness that came out of their oven. Until I found this place. Simply amazing. Now the line on the other hand... well let's just be glad they have a bar to wait at :)

Friday night @ 9:30pm we came into the cramped entrance. 1 hour wait the hostess said and took our telephone #. In retrospect we should have walked around North Beach rather than wait at the restaurant since the hostess calls back the patrons when their table is ready. High expectations for the pizza and it did not disappoint. We ordered the spicy calamari (huge portions) and the New Yorker Pizza. Both were delicious! I loved the pizza! (it also tasted pretty darn good the next day too) Next time I'm going to try the award winning margherita to see if it's worth the fuss. Our server wasn't the most friendly, that was the only thing that made our dining experience less than perfect but it was worth the wait =)

The tale behind "world-champion pizza tosser" Tony Gemignani and Tony's Pizza Napoletana is one for the ages. The story goes that Tony wanted a brick oven for his pizza joint Pyzano's over in Castro Valley, but the city wouldn't let him. Determined, he packed his bags, traveled across the bay, and opened up shop here. The verdict? Well, his pies have certainly improved. This is the real deal, and despite some elitism on the menu ("only 70 margherita pizzas made a day!" the menu exclaims), this pizza is definitely worth all the hype. It might be a little bit thin for some, but it is made up of some of the freshest ingredients out there. It's just a shame that ol' Pyzano's was left to die on the vine. Still, it looks like Tony's got a brand new following at this new location. I should know - I was stuck in the crowd waiting outside for the place to open!

Tony's has the best pizza in the Bay, hands down! If you get there in time, get the Magherita Napoletana, they only make 73 a day and it's worth it. Don't miss the fried string beans (amazing, and not breaded and fried, very light, and delicious) and their housemade pasta. I had the seafood pasta last time I went (prepared by Tony himself!) and it was to die for. Always great with a Peroni on tap to wash it down. I'm already planning my next trip over the bridge.

The signature Margherita pizza is one of the best Ive ever had. The crust is a great combination of chewy, charred, and crispy. The tomatoes and sauce are very sweet and flavorful, and the cheese is applied in nice small slices. $19 is steep for a pizza this simple, but i think this one is worth it. I also really liked their wine list, which is quite brief. There is a frizzante red wine referred to as 'pizza cola'. It's served chilled and goes great with pizza!

This should be a 4 star review AT LEAST. This place was named the best pizza place in the US by some publication, and honestly that comes with a certain amount of expectations. Like for example an expectation that my pizza wont be greasy when i get it. Or margherita will have more than 3 leaves of basil. Having said all that - ill acknowledge that im being extra harsh due to the hype. Its a totally decent thin crust and possibly even one of the better ones, still - its no match for Pizetta, then again - something tells me, they're not aiming at the same demographic, nor do they eve have the same philosophy, still they both make margherita so both can be judged on the same scale.

Aye Tony!! Parking around the restaurant is horrible but it was worth it. We were seated right away but if you can't wait, their take out place is right next door. We ordered the mussels with chorizo and a margherita pizza. Keeping it simple. The atmosphere made for a perfect casual romantic dinner. The mussels came out on a plate as long as my forearm! We dug right in and oh my it was delicious. The sauce was the best, perfect for bread dipping. The chorizo had the right spice. The bottom of the plate had a surprise- crusty French bread which soaked up all the sauce. Mmmmmm! The margherita came out piping hot. Wish the crust had more of a crisp but the flavor was still good. I say this on almost all my reviews..please open one in the East Bay!!

Tony's Pizza was without doubt the best pizza I have ever had in my life and I have been to Italy! Unknown to me it has built up a big reputation so the only way we managed to get a table was to head outside on a chilly San Francisco evening. Our table tried the Margherita and the Detroit style pizzas, of the two the Margherita was better as it has the perfect mix of cheese tomato and a decent crust.

Perhaps it's just me.  But I don't get why only make 73 pizzas a day for the margherita.  I know it's to commemorate the award winning pizza, but there are other ways to commemorate- like displaying the trophy in a glass case, or putting the award on a wall.  It's not a new idea, but it works and it gets the points across.   Why 73 pizza limit?  Is it so hard to make the margherita sauce? After all that gimmick, I was expecting to have a pizza that's on a great-to-I'll have-wet-dreams-about-you-tonight-level.  But sadly, it's not.

Hey all, I went to Tony's today looking for that mysterious thin disc known in the midwest as St. Louis Style Pizza.  Needless to say, they didn't disappoint.  Now, before I get detailed, let me first explain St. Louis Style Pizza for those who are unaware of this variant style, let me also inform you that if you are ordering this expecting New York style, or Domino's, Pizza Hut and the like, then you may not know what to think of it.  To begin, this pizza has a cracker thin crust and a sweet sauce, but the thing that really sets it apart is the CHEESE!   Let me further explain, the cheese is called Provel.  It's a processed cheese prepared by combining swiss, white chedder, and provelone.  So please, have an open mind when ordering it if you've never experienced it.  Now, if you grew up in the midwest, St. Louis, to be sepecific, and are craving Imo's (the chain in the midwest), then this is the place for you and please continue to read.  I will say that I thought it was better than Imo's.  The crust is handmade and not one of those enlarged pressed communion wafer's prepackaged and thawed five minutes after you place you order.  And the Provel cheese is spot on, it's as if you were to order a pizza from one of the restaurants on The Hill.  Good stuff, will deffinently be back to satisfy my craving.

Do you remember the best thing you've ever eaten? It seems like a simple enough question, yet, for all their capacity to indulge and sate, food experiences can be remarkably forgettable. Sure, everyone's got a preconceived list of favorite dishes in their heads, but can they actually remember what it's like to eat them? Just for kicks, let's say you love clam chowder. It's your favorite dish. The tastiest thing you've ever had...Well, you're a damn fool because soup sucks (it's just salty water), but I digress. Now, can you close your eyes, toss your head back, and remember what the best bowl of New England's finest tastes like? Can you recall the rich heft of salty butterfat lapped up then bathed over your tastebuds? What about the mealy give of an overstewed potato as it thaws between your teeth? Or the slickness of mollusk-perfumed cream lingering on your balmy lips? I just went from five to midnight. So, then, can you? Do you? I can. And I do. I remember everything. I remember walking down Stockton Street on a slightly-too-cold afternoon. I remember my gut trying to claw its way out my midsection, us having waited forty minutes for a table. I remember the dank, over-lacquered burgundy furnishings. I remember the sunset glow of the sideroom stone oven. I remember the infernal smacking of the hipster girl across from us as she ate her lunch, and I remember my fists balled up ready to knock the ugly out of her thick framed glasses. I remember the congeniality of our waiter. I remember mountains of complimentary bread. I remember a lot of good but otherwise forgettable food. And then it came. Margherita. My queen. Hovering above us, it steadied itself on the server's fingers as he placed a tray stand in the middle of our table. A perfectly imperfect circle, it jutted out in weird places, as though it were, or had once been, alive. And, to a certain degree, it was. The cheese sizzled and seethed, the sweaty fists of steam roiled, and the sauce swam within itself, shimmering with promise. Now, I don't want to sound profane, but gastronomic desire is not so different from its sexual counterpart, and so, at that moment, I was one horny bastard. Thus, despite all my reservations about indulging in piping hot pizza, I dug in. And while the roof of my mouth was indeed ravaged, it was worth it. The toppings being distributed inequitably (as they should), one bite was creamy, another was sharp, and yet another, grassy. Each leaving just a hint of its character in the subsequent bite. Floppy by virtue of saturation (but not inundation), the paper-thin pie still managed to have a firm bite to it, like great pasta. The sauce itself was light and smooth, almost watery, with no acerbic edge, but robust with tomato flavor. Ideal for carrying the richness of melted mounds of snow white dairy. The crust, bready, airy, but with a tinge of crinkle, was all the best things about the ass of a pizza brought together. But there was something there more important than mouthfeel, or flavor, or delicacy. It's that thing you just can't put your finger on when something truly amazing happens. How do I say this--it was a belt or shock or tinge of enlightenment. Unfiltered happiness. And maybe it's because I am a lonely, lonely guy, but I feel a truly great meal is like a fine woman (or man--your mileage may vary). It fills your chest with satisfaction in a way that only the most primal of indulgences can. It is, too, philosophical, the memory giving you insight, perspective, and daydream fodder. Let me put it to you in fewer words. This was the single greatest thing I've ever eaten. And if that isn't worth five stars, I don't know what the hell is. God I need to meet new people.

I tried the Margherita pizza after hearing so much about it, and have to say that while it didn't change my life, it was very, very good. I went for lunch on a Wednesday and was able to sit at the bar with no wait, which was really nice. The pizza was crispy and warm, though not piping hot, and I think I would have liked it a little more had it been warmer. I got a Capone as well, and that drink has become one of the highlights of my as-of-now short and unstoried drinking career. But seriously, I would go back again, though I would probably split the pizza with someone because the tab was pretty expensive for lunch with both the pizza and a drink. I wish I could remember who the bartender was because he was great.

It definitely lived up to the hype as the best pizza around! You do have to wait awhile if you're going on a weekend night, but North Beach is filled with great bars to enjoy.  My wife and I went to a bar up the street, played dominoes for a little while, and enjoyed the entire night out.  Also, their meatballs were amazing too.

Tony's is the best overall pizza place in SF.  That said, there may be a few other pizzas in SF that can rival Tony's 'art', but the overall combination of ambience and offerings at Tony's are unparalleled. Their mix of multiple styles of pizza cooked in different ovens is unmatched in the city, and perhaps well beyond in the surrounding areas.  Not to distract you from the great pizzas, but the salads, appetizers, and desserts are all great as well- a Caesar to start and an Affogato to finish are always worth considering! The wood-burning oven pizzas are the 'creme de la creme' of Tony's- so don't get distracted by the other 6-7 styles offered!  Most of the other pizzas styles are great- but the wood-burning oven pizzas are the real deal.  My personal favorite is the 'New Yorker'- however I'm not sure if this is offered in the wood-burning oven any more?- on my last visit it was offered as one of his coal-fired pizzas, and it was delicious as well.  The wood-fired margherita pizza is Tony's 'legend'- he has won awards for this and I'd say I see him there making them himself 4 out of 5 times that I visit.  The slice house is excellent for what it is as well, but don't confuse the two- they are different creatures serving different purposes and NOT serving the same pizzas.   Be aware that Tony's Napoletana can be complicated to get into - almost always very busy - and closed on Mondays/Tuesdays.  *Hint- you can get pizza at the bar if you see an open spot.  Sometimes lunch is your best bet to avoid a wait- but sometimes there are lines of people waiting before their opening.  Be persistent and don't give up!  Many do- and go to the Slice house instead and are less impressed with their experience as they have not dined on the full pizza-power of Tony. Do yourself a favor and try Tony's- their pizzas are also available for take-out and I have heard they have a limited delivery radius as well.  But the pizza will not be the same unless presented straight out of the oven on to your table.  The only other pizzas in SF in the same conversation as Tony's Napoletana's wood-fired pizzas are those found at Una Pizza Napoletana, A16, and Flour+Water.  And thats it! I'm already looking forward to my next visit!

After enjoying a show down the street during our last night in San Francisco we decided to check out this place since the reviews were good and we love a Nepalitano slice. The first thing we noticed was the smell. Not really sure what it was but the bar (front room) had a distinct odor. We were seated very quickly by the hostess and our server came by pretty quickly. We ordered a salad and split it; it was excellent. There were a few pieces of funky lettuce that we picked off but the rest of it was great. Nce croutons, shaved Parmesan, grape tomato goodness. The pizza came out and while the flavor was good it was incredibly wet. The crust had the potential to be awesome, based on the outer edge but was kind of a sloppy mess. I'd definitely come back, maybe earlier in the day, and give it another shot. All in all, not bad for a late night when you're in the area and fiending some pizza.

Orgasmic pizza, no not Pizza Orgasmica,  it's Tony's Pizzeria! The flavors were not complex but every topping was full of punch and my internal senses wanted to shout Yippee! We arrived at 6:45 on a Tuesday evening and was told the wait would be 45 mins. The host took our number down and will call when a table is ready. The impatient large party ahead of us left and we ended up waiting ten minutes! The place was packed and the mood was hyped. We ordered the two famous, winning pizzas. Both had the same crust. The crust was not thin nor thick, just perfect amount of carb. One can tell the Ingredients were carefully thought out. They definitely got the craft of making pizza down to the dough. Oh I can have a whole pizza to myself at this moment! Service was great...attentive. Parking sucks in this area. I was lucky enough to score a space within minutes upon my arrival at North Beach.

Normally, when I see a restaurant that has over 1000 very positive reviews on Yelp it doesn't compel me as much to review my experience unless my story is noticeably different from others. Today, I had an amazing time taking my kids to "Tony's Pizza Making Party" before its lunch opening hours.  I was all the more thrilled to try the pizza here, having bookmarked this restaurant on my Yelp profile.  We arrived here at 10 AM.  We were welcomed by a very friendly AND kid-friendly staff, who had already set up the whole place ready for a group of 10 kids:  There was a buffet of berries on one side, organic juices, and two huge platters of dough balls.   CHILDREN'S EXPERIENCE: When all the kids arrived, a man came out to welcome them and right on asked them to wash their hands leading the group to the restrooms (Gotta give a (+) for that one!)  After giving each child their own dough, he showed them how to flatten it out, spin it and toss it.  He soon got into it and gave them a pizza dough-tossing show which the kids couldn't keep their eyes off from while attempting to imitate his moves!  "Dough disks" were flying left and right.  But, the staff was prepared in bringing another tray of fresh dough.  This time for the kids to make their pizza "for real."  The man patiently showed them how to spread the sauce, giving them an option of tomato sauce or pesto, followed of course with lots of cheese.  The attention to the thoughtful details really impressed me.  In order to keep track and distinguish the kids' pizza, he added to each specific ingredients, just a pinch of it, which he called "eyes = olives, hair = thin slices of onions, etc...) Once the kids' pizzas were in the oven, the staff started to serve them fruits while waiting for their artwork to be ready, which only took 5-7 minutes! ADULTS' EXPERIENCE: Right after the kids were diverted to the fruits, the man asked us if we wanted to make our own!  He took out another full tray of fresh dough, along with a choice of sauce and platters of refined ingredients beautifully displayed for our toppings of choice!  It was definitely a "Gourmet Pizza Making Party" for the adults: Pancetta, Ricotta cheese, Pesto, Goat Cheese, Minced garlic, Roasted Bell Peppers, ... After savoring our delicious pizzas, boxes for left-overs were already laid out on the counter with the kids' name written on it!  They were incredibly organized!  But the apex of this experience was the moment I found out that "the man" all along was Tony himself! (when my friend thanked him by name as the party was leaving)  I had no idea since this was my family's first time at Tony's.  By the time we gathered our belongings and stepped out of the restaurant, Tony was sweeping the outside patio helping his staff to get the place ready for the lunch crowd who was already starting the waiting line. AND that is one thing I LOVE to see in successful businesses, such as Tony's, a boss that has an accolade of success, of awards, and titles, yet does everything (from making pizzas with the kids to sweeping...) making no distinction of any "class" system.  This reason itself makes "Tony's Pizza Napoletana" a "5 STARS" rating on Yelp!

I went on a Thursday night with a group of 7 people, and we were able to get a table within 15 minutes, which was AMAZING!!! The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. The group shared some meatballs as an appetizer, and honestly, they were ok. Nothing out of this world. The pizza however, was so delicious. We all shared a Margherita Pizza, The Barcelona, the New Yorker, and another one that I forget what is called, but they were all so good. My favorite was the Barcelona, we all joked that it tasted like a breakfast burrito. The Margherita was also scrumptious. I would  recommend this place to others, but I am not sure if if would be worth a 2 hour wait.

Tony's has great pizza and great service, but is so pricey. Three kids and two adults, two pizzas, two salads, and two beers, 103.00$. Wow, I know SF is expensive, but... and that was before tip!  Needless to say hubby and I would go back with no kids!

Best pizza I've ever had, hands down! I love wood-fire oven pizzas and Tony's does it right. A nice crisp on the outside of the crust with a heavenly softness in the center--plus his sauce is amazing. I tried Tony's award winning "cookie sheet" pie with buratta, tomatoes, and balsamic. Plenty to go around the table and then some. I took the rest home and reheated for dinner last night; almost as good as getting it fresh out of Tony's oven ;) The only possible con could be the wait time, but I say the wait is worth it. We put our name in (for a table of 3) at 4:50 on a Saturday and did not get seated until about 6:15. Don't miss out on Tony's! Show up, put your name in, walk around North Beach, then come back and enjoy their delicious pies. I'll definitely be back.

I honestly don't understand the hype of this place.  The sauce is bland.  The crust is not well cooked.  And, as for the Pizza Cup trophy, I googled around a bit and found the web site for the contest doesn't exist so I'm gonna have to call phony on that. Honestly, the pizza isn't close to my 3 other favorites in SF, which out of fairness, I won't mention here, except to say, the name of one starts with a D, the name of the other is two words (F+W), and the other is a little bar joint in the same neighborhood as Tony's (as a local for the bar joint pizza place, everyone knows it). Meh on the pizza, double meh on the contest trophy claims...

Second time we've been and hype or no hype, their pizza is the reason to go and as much as I hate to wait, it's worth it (for the pizza). 4-5 stars for the pizza, 2 stars for the wait and 2-3 stars for food that is not pizza. 5 stars for the bar.  Barkeep recommended a delicious unoaked white that was excellent. It sucks that they don't take reservations, so no matter what, you're going to wait, oftentimes about an hour on average. But if a spot opens up at the bar, that's first come first served.  To the grandpa from the South Bay who cut in front of me at the hostess stand, I hope you choked on a meatball. You should know better.  But as my husband said, maybe this was your last pizza.   For the seagulls waiting for a seat at the bar, don't hover so effing close. It's annoying.  Also annoying, the line for the bathroom ends up forming right behind the bar seats and dummies that can't live without their dumb phones for five minutes will repeatedly bump into your seat.  A couple of hearty stretches seems to be an effective way to reclaim some personal space. On this trip I tried the pasta - the tagliatelle sounded good and it was, mostly.  It lacked a little seasoning and before too long the sauce was congealed.  I asked for easy on the sauce, so as to not have a bowl of pasta sauce soup, and I suspect that's a rare request.  It was still fairly soupy, but it was satisfying.  I'll turn the leftovers into a casserole of some sort.  Oh, yes, the portion sizes are enough for a family of four, or one lumberjack with a tapeworm. The cesar salad was meh.  Lettuce wasn't crisp and the dressing tasted like it was out of a jar and lacked zip, perhaps because instead of blending the anchovies into the dressing, they laid two of them on top of the salad, like a tiny fishy funeral pyre.  Cesar salad dressing isn't creamy, but the stuff from Safeway usually is.  I recommend the chef Google the recipe & get it right.  The guys next to us had the meatball - it is large enough to serve two strapping boys chatting about "closing the deal" with babes - and it looked/smelled good, so that might be a safe bet.  If you don't mind waiting for it. At any rate, we'll go back for the pizza, although Alameda now has a wood-fired oven pizza joint that's outstanding, without an hour's wait.  Not sure if I need to try pizza made in every possible type of oven but it's a clever marketing angle.

came here the other day to quench my pizza and pasta craving and boy, did it hit the spot! we walked in hoping that there wasnt much of a wait, but of course there was a 1.5 hr wait time...being that the game was on tv, we sat at the bar and ordered a bottle of wine to warm up... as we looked at the menu, we stared at the food to the left and to the right of us...we decided to go with BOTH. ordered up the Giant Meatball (mixture of veal, pork, and beef) and i can honestly say that it was the best meatball ive ever had. i mean, EVER.  they call it the Meatball Gigante because its freakin huge...i mean it looks like a small bowling ball of meat, smothered in marinara sauce...the amazing thing about this meatball is that whether it was the first bite on the outside or the 20th bite on the inside...every bite tasted consistently delicious... also ordered up the Margherita pizza....this was their award winning, limited to "x" amount of orders a day pizza... sorry to say, i didnt like it...it was regular to me...and although the flavor was there, the crust was too wet from maybe the water from the cheese? i dunno...but it was limp and i wasnt too fond of it...REGARDLESS of whether i loved it or not, i did finish 3/4 of the ENTIRE FREAKING PIZZA myself...so i guess it was good "enough" lastly we ordered the Jersey's Original Tomato Pie... this was the pizza i was longing for. super crusty. perfectly seasoned. perfectly minimal. just sauce, sausage, perfect crust, and never ending cheese.   the perfect pizza. big shout out to JP at the bar...great bartender and one of the friendliest mixologists that weve met in the City...thanks for all the extra marinara sauce and cheese!!!

Ms. Bean was craving Tony's so she, JT and I went for dinner. Got seated straight away (it was about 5:30 PM) and started with a martini (me, that is). Had the margherita and the mushroom truffle pizzas. I'm a little bit of a pizza snob. Italian pizza, that is, not New York or Chicago or anything else, so the litmus is margherita. It wasn't the best margherita I'd had in my life (of course the best I had was in Italy), but it was the best I've had Stateside. Definitely want to go back and try a few more. And a few more martinis. BTW, service was stellar.

Good pizza WAY overpriced. Coming from the east coast I was looking for a good slice of thin crust & stopped by tony's.  very good taste but for $5 a slice? Come on. With that price I'm thinking I would at least get a huge slice maybe 1/6 of the pizza but it wasn't very big at all. I think its become a tourist trap and its gone to their heads so they charge you whatever they want.

I had high expectations for this place based on reviews and word of mouth. I finally decided to give it a try and came for dinner on a weekday. With an anticipated wait time of 25 minutes, we patiently waited for our table as waiters walk by with hot crispy pizzas tempting our noses. However, it actually took about 40 minutes before we were seated. We ordered their famous Margherita & New Yorker. The Margherita was delicious; light yet flavorful, with a crispy & thin crust. The New Yorker was also great; I especially enjoyed the texture of the ricotta and the flavor of the sausage. Overall I was happy with our meal. Their pizzas are on the pricier side, but to me it is quality over quantity. The wait is a bit long, so next time if I return I would probably plan to come a little earlier before the dinner rush. Supposedly their meatballs are good (based on many orders we saw tables get), so that's something we may have to try next time. I probably won't be rushing over here anytime soon, but I may have cravings for it once in awhile.

I've come here twice, and both times, I left unimpressed by the pizza. Their famous margherita pizza was particularly disappointing. However, there big meatballs are delicious! I highly recommend those. Come early as the line gets long, and the wait is painful. No reservations.

OMG!!! I finally got to try this place and I love it! Came here during the week and I got to order the Margherita and New Yorker. The Margherita was a delish. I really like the sauce and everything on it. As for the New Yorker, it was good but it wasn't a wow wow. Also had some kind of spicy pasta spaghetti looking dish and it was good! Oh, this place is pretty much always packed so be ready to wait.

I truly do not understand the hype. We finally tried this place last weekend. We were hesitant to go to the restaurant, since we don't like to wait in line. So when a flyer arrived announcing a new delivery service, it sounded like the perfect solution. The menu for ordering was confusing, and unless I missed it somehow, pizza Napoletana was not an option.  Some reviews mentioned the coal-fired pizza, so we ordered that instead, along with a pastrami sandwich. The pizza arrived 20 minutes late, albeit on a cute delivery bicycle. The delivery person was apologetic and gracious, so I wasn't upset about the wait.  What I didn't care for was the fact that both items were delivered cold and had to be heated before we could try to enjoy them.  Hmm, maybe a motorized delivery vehicle would make it easier to deliver the food hot. As for the food, it was just OK. The pizza crust was very good but the sauce tasted like tomato paste.  The sandwich was just OK. Maybe we'll be willing to try again in the restaurant for one of the touted limited edition margarita pizzas, but based on this experience, it's unlikely.

This is easily the best pizza I've had thus far in SF. They have slices as well as whole pies. Tony's Pizza has definitely nailed the NY style crust and sauce. The toppings are on point, as are the variety of slices you can get at any given point. If yr from NY or the Midwest, its worth the hike up to North Beach for this 'za. I promise.

Meh....at best.    NOT particularly good pizza in my opinion.  I could have sworn I saw a "coal fired oven" sign.  I couldn't find a coal fired oven.....maybe I just missed it (or perhaps I imagined the sign)??   Thick"ish" crust.  Not cooked well enough for my taste.  Pretty doughy.   The cheese and sauce was tasty though.  I don't know....my girlfriend and I both agreed it was a notch (small notch) above mall pizza. Note-  I had 3 slices of CHEESE pizza only, at about 9:30PM.  Is it different at another time?  I wouldn't know.  Maybe.  I only report what I experienced.

This is one of my favorite places to eat in all of San Francisco.   My recommendation is to sit at the bar instead of wait for a table.  The bartenders are charming and make great hand crafted cocktails.  Don't forget to order meatballs to start.  There really sin't anything bad on the menu.   If you want good pizza it doesn't get better than this!

Had someone on Facebook recommend this so we tried it out.  Started with the meatball appetizer & it was outstanding!  Best meatballs I've ever had in a restaurant.  Then we had a salad which the waiter recommended was for sharing.  How often do you hear a waiter recommend you should share something?  Great salad.  We then shared a Margherita pizza which was very well done.  They have 7 different pizza ovens.  Wish I could go back 6 more times to try them all.  What would be really cool is if they could have a sampler slice from all 7 ovens!  Get there!

We passed by many times on the weekend when the line for a table spilled out into the streets. Reading up on Tony's we had heard his pizza was famous so of course we had to give it a try. Coming here on a Wednesday night was a blessing because we were able to order the two things that they have limits on. They only prepare 73 of the margherita pizza daily and 25 of the meatball gigante daily. We were able to get both! Water and bread were quickly served. One of the highlights of the night might have been the trio of olive oils accompanying the bread. Every piece of bread had the choice to be dipped in roasted red pepper olive oil, plain olive oil, and sweet roasted garlic olive oil. Of the three, I found myself hovering over the garlic one the most. So much that we had to ask for more. Moving on: *Meatball Gigante with wild mushroom, pancetta, robiola ($15) - was you guessed it, a large meatball with a three meat blend in a marinara sauce. But then they added the white mushroom sauce which blended so well with the marinara I can still taste it. I definitely recommend getting this if you can. Margherita Pizza - the dough is good and its baked for a perfect amount of time just allowing the cheese to slightly melt around. We finished the whole thing but afterwards couldn't help but realize I just got attacked by the SALT MONSTER. Hours later, I continued to crave cups of water to compensate fort he saltiness. ___ Jan '12 Health Score - 98! Good luck finding parking on the weekend nights! They also have a tendency to over-quote on wait times

I think this is currently my favorite pizza place in The City. The pizza margherita is excellent. The New York style pizza is also good. I prefer the pizzas with a higher cooking point, mostly. And, I get calabrese peppers on EVERYTHING. I highly recommend trying a pizza with calabrese peppers. You can actually sample them because they bring you a small dish of them with the bread! Oh, and do pay attention that they are closed on Mondays and Tuesdays.

Hands down the BEST pizza I've ever had in my life. I hate to say this but this place has officially dethroned my former favorite pizza place, The Cheeseboard in Berkeley. They have 4 different ovens just to be able to make the different varieties of pizzas. There's a reason why NYT rated this place the best pizza west of the Mississippi. Aside from their pizzas, the meatballs, their giant meatballs, their fried green beans, and their brussel sprouts were all delicious. I highly recommend this place. This will probably be the only place I go to in North Beach for awhile. It's that good! Service is great. Bathrooms are clean.

My girlfriend and I ordered take out from here as we were going to have a picnic at Washington Square Park just across the street from Tony's Pizza. We ordered the Cal Italia which consists of asiago, mozzarella, imported Italian gorgonzola, croatian  sweet fig preserve, prosciutto di parma, parmigiano, balsamic with no sauce.   My girlfriend decided on this pizza because it was a gold medal winner for the Food Networks pizza champions challenge. For a little over $20 you only get 6 slices. The pizza looked great and some bites tasted better than others. The gorgonzola overpowered  the other ingredients.  The sweet fig preserve was evident when taking the first bite. The prosciutto was great! We also really enjoyed the crust as it was masterfully done! Overall Thoughts: Would not order this award winning pizza again, but would return to try another!

Ah Tony's. I've been coming here since they opened and they have stayed busy ever since. This is for good reason because the pizza is awesome. Traditional coal and wood fired pizzas with fresh ingrediants make this place a must. Many styles of pizza to choose from, and the service is always attentive and friendly. It can get very busy in the front, as people wait to put their names in (they dont take reservations), so I always admire the hostess' patience with everyone. Far and away top 5 authentic pizza place in SF.

I met a friend here for dinner, and I was a bit early and checked in with the hostess.  They wouldn't seat me til we were both there, which I understood, so the only table ready when my friend arrived was outside on the sidewalk.  The overhead heater was no match for the cold wind, but some strong beer and good food made it worthwhile.   A friend who recommended the place insisted we order the Jersey Style de lorenzo style, which was a classic Margherita with italian sausage.  It was smothered in deliciously fresh tomato sauce, globs of chewy and milky mozzarella, and plenty of spicy sausage.  While it was a bit expensive, the pizza was great and the service was good too.  I wouldn't say it was the best pizza I've ever had, but it will definitely rank in the top 10. Lacking the 5th star because a street-side table busser was exceptionally rude to me when I commented about how chilly it was while I waited for a friend.  Then, when a tourist asked her for advice about the best place to find a cab, she said she couldn't help and they should try the street.  She literally rolled her eyes as hard as possible and they were clearly offended.  Then, when another waiter walked by, she turned on the charm and was an absolute angel glowing with personality, but only to him.   Also, the waiting area is smaller than a port-o-potty.

We had a great experience here this past weekend!  Lines can get long, so just prepare yourself but it's worth the wait.  We happened to come on a warm day so there was an hour and a half wait.  The receptionist took our phone number and said she'd call when our table was ready. We went across the street to have a drink while we waited.  It worked out great. We sat outside and the service was excellent.  I noticed they were very accommodating to every guest.  Our server explained the menu and after we told her what we liked for crust and toppings, made some recommendations.  She was awesome!!  The pizza was excellent too.  We had a 22' coal-fired meatball, with mushrooms and garlic.  The crust was thin and crispy, just like we like it.  Awesome!  We will be back!

(See pics) A recent visit had us tried some dishes that we had not had a chance before. White anchovies antipasti was very nice if you love anchovies. Quail Egg potato chorizo pizza was interesting and not traditional. It was experimental but not sure if I want to order it again. Caputo margherita pizza was very delicious, almost as great as the limited classic ones. The bucatini was rich in taste. Drinks wise, I usually prefer a draft Peroni but had paired the food with Gragnano and Tempranillo and they were all very good. Italian wines are very food friendly for its lighter taste and not overwhelm the dishes. Service was very very good even they seated us close to closing time and we stayed quite late while they were cleaning up without interrupting our meals. Right on for all your great food and service!

The hostess told us their famous margherita pizza was still available and then the waitress told us it was not. I bet they pull that trick a lot. We ended up ordering the Sicilian style pizza that has also won awards, and maybe it was awesome when they made it for the judges, but this was no award winning pizza. It was like summer-camp dining hall pizza--thick and doughy and not tasty at all. The atmosphere was pretty lame and North Beachy. I felt like I was in a sports bar. I can't really think of anything nice to say about the experience, but something keeps me from giving one stars unless there's some kind of apocalypse at the restaurant.

I was in San Francisco for business and was just walking around the North Beach area looking for a place to eat when I found Tony's...I'm glad I did.   I was there at lunchtime, sat at the bar, and had a wonderful meal.  The bartenders were very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  I had the meatball appetizer and a margherita pizza...Both dishes were fantastic.   The meatballs were huge, filled with flavor, and topped with a delicious red sauce.  I sopped up most of the sauce with Tony's complimentary bread basket (very good bread by the way)  And the pizza was some of the best (if not the best) Neapolitan pizza I've ever had.  Just incredibly fresh ingredients, with a wonderful crust.   Tony's also has a pretty good beer selection.  The bartender recommended some different craft beers based on my meal selection.  Both beers were fantastic and actually complimented my meal very well.     Overall, I couldn't be happier to have stumbled into Tony's.  I will, without question, return anytime I am back in San Francisco.

For our 7 year anniversary, the BF decided to take me to San Francisco and eat at all the places I've had bookmarked on Yelp for months! (I'm a lucky gal). Anywho, we arrived at Tony's at around 2pm on Saturday. We walked up to the hostess and asked how long the wait would be for 2. She said it would be around 20-25 minutes. Considering that we drove all the way from Santa Cruz, we decided to wait. A few minutes later she came back and said that she could seat us right away if we didn't mind sitting at one of the tables in the bar area. Woohoo! We sat down and were immediately given water and tasty crusty bread with various dipping sauces (olive oil, roasted red pepper and garlic/honey) which were all very tasty. A while later (15-20 mins, ish) our waiter takes our order: Margherita for me, and Tomato with red peppers for the BF. 15-20 mins after that our pizza arrives and oh my goodness, was it a sight to behold. Steamy, bubbly, cheesy, all around yumminess heading my way; then there was the BF's which wasn't quite as impressive, but tasty looking all the same. Let me tell you, the Margherita did not disappoint. I loved the sweetness of the tomato sauce mixed with the salty, creaminess of the globs of cheese. YUM. Overall, our experience at Tony's was worthy of 5 stars. The only downside was that our waiter wasn't spectacular; he took a REALLY long time to even acknowledge us, and didn't come back to our table until we were ready to pay. The rest of the staff, on the other hand, were fantastic. My water was never empty and I didn't even have to ask for a box. Oh, and it turns out that I'd been here before years ago and didn't even know it! My memory works in mysterious ways.... 4 stars.

Dropped in recently for lunch and noticed the menu had been updated. I didn't see my beloved Truffle Fries. Asked the waiter and he said they do change the menu and some things may not be listed, but if it's been on the menu in the past you can request it and they'll make it!!! Tried a different pizza as much as I love the Marguerite, Detroit Style and let me tell you the crispy square pizza is a cheese coma waiting to happen. Oh it's sooo cheesy and over the top and crunchy crust is shear heaven. I don't think there is a bad pizza on this menu. There may be a wait for this place but its well worth it. Stellar Pizza folks.

Let me just say: Sono nato e cresciuto in Italia... essendo italiano di origine e di stomaco di pizza napoletana me ne intendo! I came here last weekend with all my coworkers for a going away party. The pizza after all is indeed very good. I tried the Vito's pizza which seemed to be the most delicious one. Not Italian style but definitely perfectly baked crust: crispy on the outside and soft and warm on the inside. I also tried the calamari which were decent and pasta carbonara was alright. A little bit greasy and too heavy on the cream... DEFINITELY AMERICANIZED! Service I would say was also pretty decent, a tall skinny almost bold guy served us (we were the party of 10 sitting by the far right window. He seemed annoyed when we asked him too many questions about the menu... service was super quick but it would've been better to have a more experienced maybe Italian server knowing what he was talking about.. Overall good experience. Yay! I'm a fan :)

I need a five star review to start off the New Year right and live up to my new shiny 2012 Elite badge. I won't talk about the great signature award winning Margherita pizza, baked 90 seconds at 900 degrees. I won't talk about the genuine Negroni cocktail, complete with the orange twist (next time burn the twist to release the oil). I won't talk about the environment nor location, right on North Beach in the middle of the Italian district of San Francisco. What I will tell you is there was a hot bombshell sitting across from me that made me forget how great my dining experience was.

Absolutely fantastic pizza and perfect for sharing with a group.  If you have 3 hungry people, I definitely recommend trying one of the Pizza Romana combinations.  We went with the #2 and it was fantastic. Be advised that on a Friday night the wait will vary from 1-2 hours.  Normally I don't want to wait that long and will usually hit the neighborhood joint "Za" up the hill on Hyde street instead.  But when you have out of towners and want to impress, this is a great place to go.  Just hit any of the neighborhood bars and the Tony's staff will call your cell when the table is ready.

The best pizza menu I've ever seen. One of the only places I've ever been where you can get a pizza marinara, a vintage Neapolitan recipe of only tomato sauce, garlic, olive oil and basil, no cheese. I love how each style of pizza is cooked in a different type of oven! Wood fire, coal, gas, you name it.

If you're looking for some authentic (and good) New York style pizza, this place is one of the few in the Bay Area that is the real deal. They use a wood fired oven which makes a big difference in taste and the finished texture of the pizza crust. The crust itself is perfect - crispy yet chewy doughy in the right places. You can't go wrong with almost any of the pizzas here, but I love the Margherita and the New Yorker. Sometimes there can be a massive wait, so you should try to time your arrival here around peak hours to avoid seating time shock.

My favorite place for non-deep dish pizza in the city.  I know, New York pizzas are better, but we're in San Francisco and this is definitely one of the best in the city.  Prices are reasonable for what you get (compared to the upscale Italian places which do pizzas as well).   The Margherita is amazing - you can taste the quality in the cheese.  The balsamic vinagrette on the Sicilian complements the flavors very well.  Even the dips for the bread at your table showcase the flavors and texture combinations that they are thinking of when creating their food.   Yes, the wait is long.  Infrequently (it's happened to be once), the consistency is off and the pizza wasn't cooked long enough.  But I would definitely keep coming back even though it's not in the most convenient location for me.

I would give 5 stars to this place, because the Napoli style pizza is damn good; unfortunately it gets only  three for the following reasons: 1) It's overpriced ($19 for a pizza margherita, really?). 2) There's a constant line. 3) The ambiance is just okay. That being said, if you are really craving for a Napoli style pizza, that's the place where you wanna be.

Came here with three other fellow yelpers; we came early and got on line, which was building as it got closer to noon.  Got the bone marrow/fondue appetizer and the marrow was very bleh, not much flavor.  Have had much better.  The dish was okay, but did not live up to my expectations or offer any surprises.  We got the Cal Italia and it was DELICIOUS.  Really liked the contrast going on and just perfect.  Also got the gypsy, a vodka cocktail, that wasn't bad.  Service was good, but table was a little small and cramped.  Wish they allowed smoking outside.  I'd come back to try more of the pizzas for sure.  3.75 to 4.

So good, this place is epic and in my opinion, best pizza in SF! Last few times I have gone there is always a wait, BUT the awesome thing about Tony's is that you leave your name and number and the hostess calls you when the table is ready! In the meantime, we get some drinks at the bars in the area (Church Key) We always get a Coal-Fire and a margherita pizza. Those 2 pizza's have NEVER failed me. we also tell them to go buckwild on the calabrese peppers and throw that ish on every pizza we order! When i eat the pizzas I seriously believe it is the sauce that makes it so epic. When people used to tell me the sauce is diff here blah blah, I wrote them off thinking all sauce tastes the same. This place, its just different! There is something magical in that sauce, I hope its not animal semen (from harold and kumar)

Love the delicious gourmet pizza and you might catch a glimpse of Tony Gemignani. Tony is such a cutie. My officemate went to high school with him and claims all the girls had the biggest crush on him. We stopped by for dinner before a comedy show at Cobb's in January. We ordered an appetizer of PERFECT meatballs. So YUMMY, just the right density and texture. Our pizza was delicious too, cooked in the coal fired oven. Delicious flavorful crust, tomato-y sauce and high quality toppings. We sat out on the patio, thought it would be cold, but it was just the right temperature sitting beneath the outdoor heater. On a previous visit, I came with 10 friends around 4:30pm on a sunny Saturday in May 2010.  The restaurant and all of North Beach was pretty busy, but Tony and his staff were able to accommodate us quickly with a banquette plus some chairs so we could sit together and eat family style. We told them we had to be at an event at 5:45pm but were dying to try his new (at the time) restaurant. While we were waiting for our table, Tony joined us for a group photo. Okay, I have to admit, I think he's hot. xoxo. Our server brought us a bowl of green beans on the house. Tony must have expedited our pizza because they came out about 10 minutes after we put in our order. Maybe it was because I am such a big fan of his Castro Valley pizza restaurant (right off 580 at the Castro Valley exit), which is more neighborhood style pizzeria than gourmet, yet just as delicious. We ordered: *Cal-Italia Pizza with Asiago, Mozzarella, Gorgonzola, Sweet Fig Preserve, Parma di Proscuitto, Parmigiano and Balsamic *Margherita Pizza with fresh basil and mozzarella (yes, it's that pizza with a thin layer of sauce and blobs of cheese here and there, as someone at work would describe it) *Proscuitto di Parma Pizza with Arugula and Heirloom Cherry Tomatoes *Quail Egg and Smoked Italian Speck Pizza with Arugula and Fontina *Clam and Garlic Pizza with Parmigiano, Mozzarella and Oregano Add in sodas, two entrees, tax and tip...I think the check came out to $230. This is definitely one of my favorite places for Neapolitan pizza. If that's not your thing, they have many other types of pizza and baking styles-  wood-fired, coal oven, electric oven... You can't go wrong with a pizza from here. Give this place a try...and maybe you'll see Tony! ^_^

When an establishment has an award winning item on their menu that they are limited to making a certain amount of each day, you're practically obligated to order it.  When they have more than one award winning item you have a difficult choice to make unless you're really hungry. I suppose I have a decent appetite as I ordered both of their award winning pizzas -- the Margherita (2007 World Pizza Cup winner in Naples, Italy) and the Cal-Italia (gold medal winner Food Network's Pizza Champions Challenge). The pizza margherita was very good, living up to some lofty expectations that they set for themselves.  It was the best classic Neapolitan pizza that I've ever had (though, admittedly I haven't had too many) and I enjoyed it more than Delfina's.  The tomato sauce was light and surprisingly sweet but didn't cause the pizza to be too soggy, mozzarella was slightly gooey and very flavorful/savory, and the crust was chewy and doughy with minimal charred-blistering. The Cal-Italia resembles a pizza that could be served at CPK, but you can certainly taste the difference.  It has some tasty toppings and a mix of a variety of awesome different cheeses, each with distinct flavors such as asiago, mozzarella and gorgonzola.  I really enjoyed the crust on this pizza as well. If you don't feel like waiting for a table just call ahead and order for pick-up.  Pick-up orders can be picked up two doors south of the main restaurant entrance.

First off, I have to say that you have to be nuts not give this place at least 4 stars. My friends and I came here on a Friday night and it was 1.5 hours wait. Sounds long but the good thing is that after you put your name down, they take down your phone number as well so you can totally hit up a bar or something nearby and wait for the hostess to call you. Now that is customer service! We got three pizzas between us and a bottle of wine. First we got the Prosciutto Pomodorini. Usually, I don't like arugula but on this pizza it was really good w/ the cherry tomatoes and prosciutto. Then the New Yorker and it was freaking AMAZING. really good italian sausage and the ricotta.. holy cow it is to die for. Super creamy and rich, takes pizza to a new level. Lastly we had the award winning Cal Italia. A white pizza that was also seriously to die for. The wine our waiter paired with our meal was also quite delish and complimented everything. This is one of those places where you think to yourself 'Man I gotta try everything on the menu and just go down the list' and that is exactly what I am going to do. Every time I come back I'm gonna get something I've never gotten.

Oh perfect Christmas Eve! Who knew I would experience you before the end of the world. And I almost believed the Mayans too with the way SF was looking- deserted, slightly eerie and even more romantic. We even had awesome weather- cool, crisp, with just enough warmth radiating from the one sunny day in Norcal Winter. We walked hand in hand to Tony's, the one and only, hahah. Okay maybe there are a few places with the same name in Little Italy, but this is the only Tony's that matters. We walked through the door and stood at the desk where they greeted us and seated us within five minutes, not bad. Our server recommended a carafe of pinot. It was smooth, velvety, and opened up like a rose. Then our meatballs arrived. I cut into my steaming hot ball, so damn juicy. I moved each piece around in sauce for perfect flavor all the way to the very last bite. Finally our Margherita, "900 degrees wood fired to perfection pizza" was delivered and I sat mesmerized. I was taking a mental picture of little mozzarella pools slightly bubbled up on our thin fluffed up crust. Was this dough brought back in a time machine from 19th century Naples. Did they bring back Raffaele Esposito to make his pizza for our last meal? What a way to go!

I grew up with NYC and North Jersey pizza, so I have very high and specific standards. This is by far the closes pizza I've had to what I'm used to, well done! My only complaint is that the crust isn't quite crispy enough, and the dough is a little bit too chewy. If you let it sit for a while, the crust starts to get soggy. Not bad, just not PERFECT :) I had the margherita and the New Yorker. Both had fantastic, fresh toppings. Top notch for sure. However... $50 for TWO pies?? Sorry Tony, you lose a star.

This place is always busy...and with good reason. Apparently it won some World Pizza award, and I can see why. We ordered the Margherita and it was fantastic. They have a limited number made with the recipe that won the World Pizza award and we got the one they give you when that runs out and that was very good so curious as to how good the other one is. The Cal Italia pizza looks amazing. The couple next to us was having it and I will definitely get it next time. If you come during a peak time you could easily wait 45 minutes so keep that in mind. I look forward to going back.

USA Today claimed that this is the best pizza in the country (http://travel.usatoday.c…) and I thought I'd try. FI don't eat pizza that often and am far from being a connoisseur but I did find it very good. A shame they ran out of their award winning Margherita so I couldn't try that one, but what we had (New Yorker, Fear & Loathing and forgot the third one) was excellent. Service was nice even though they were super busy. The annoying part is that they are very popular so there was like an hour wait or something. We left our number and went for a drink and they called us, which is cool but I wish I had known in advance because I was super hungry and that hour wait was torture. Another issue is the freaking North Beach parking situation, but if you don't drive, it's all good I guess.

Had lunch here on a Sunday. Same day the San Francisco marathon was running, so the city & more particularly North Beach was very busy. We waited about 30-35 mins for our party to be seated. The wait wasn't too bad. Anything worth eating in the city had a little bit of a wait & we really wanted to try the famous margherita pizza. The hostess assured us they weren't running out anytime soon because the first lunch seating had just started... We just needed our table to be ready and we were golden. We started off with a calamari appetizer and went with half traditional style batter and the other half with some seasoning/spice or what they call calabrese style. Both were very tasty especially with a squeeze of lemon. The portion was enough for us 3 hungry folks.Good stuff. We, of course, ordered their famous margherita pizza.  It was good. The crust was pretty damn good. The basil & mozzarella flavors really shined through. I would order it again, for sure. These people are the pizza experts. On the menu, they list the temperature and type of oven each pizza is baked. Name it, they make it. Amazing... We also had the deep fried Manhattan calzone. It was filled with meatballs, mozzarella & ricotta cheeses and garlic. It was sooo good. Never had anything like that before. It was crunchy, cheesy... flavorful. I suggest you order the calzone deep fried. Delish. For dessert we went with the pistachio panna cotta. It was very good. Panna cotta is usually a winner. But this pistachio version Tony's serves is real good. I recommend it. Service was good. Our server was attentive but not smothering. I have no complaints.

So our trip to San Francisco could not be complete without trying out the greatest pizza in the world of 2007. We ordered the Margherita Pizza and I must say that it melted in my mouth. Other than having great texture, it didn't blow my mind in terms of taste. We also ordered a Proscuitto e Pomodirini. I must say that it was the leafiest pizza ever with tons of fresh arugula leaves on it. Very different from anything I've ever had and I enjoyed it slightly better than the Margherita. We waited about 45 minutes for a table on a Friday night. They do call backs so just check in and give them your phone number. Then you can go explore all of the area and not worry about losing your place in line. We ate outside and they have heaters to warm up. It gets packed and I think this place is slightly overrated.

I'm starting to see a pattern here... shopping at Union Square then heading to North Beach for some pizza and calamari! Since the holiday season has started, I've done this twice. Let's call it a tradition in the making! I don't have a favorite type of crust... thin crust, deep dish, pan crust, stuffed crust - I like em all. Like Tony's states, "Respect The Craft," and I do, especially at Tony's. They've definitely got the craft of pizza making down. From certain thickness of pizza doughs to the temp of the brick oven and wood fired ovens. Something as simple as the Margherita pizza has got me hooked. I never make it in time for the first 73 of the wood fired version, but they will still make it with the thicker crust. Creamy, fresh mozzarella and basil top the sweet and zesty sauce on this yummy pizza! ***Thank you, Mish L and your adorable profile pic next to this yummy Margherita pizza! *** I always have to order calamari as an app, even if it's just at Cheesecake Factory. I love that at Tony's you can get it regular or spicy and even 50/50! A very generous portion, nice to start off with especially if you opt for the outdoor seating next to the heated lamps - where if you're lucky there's zero wait time! Respect the Craft and come to Tony's, where some of the best pizza and calamari awaits you!

First a word of warning: Don't bring your first time date here, if you do, don't judge how the date is going by your dinner conversation! Your dinner at Tony's may be one of the quietest meals in your life. You are likely to experience extended periods of time in silent, incredulous taste bud ecstasy! Ok moving on... The first time we came here I was initially upset because we got a table outside where the sidewalk was tilted, it was windy, and I didn't like the idea of people walking by with dogs and whatnot watching us eat...Then the food arrived. I went from Mr. Grouch to LOVING LIFE! That time we had the Calamari to start followed by the Margherita and some dessert. The Margherita blew my mind. Blew it. As I walked away from the restaurant I had to look back so I could reassure myself "yes, that just happened". It seemed simple but sometimes simple IS perfection (I'm looking at you Da Vinci's perfect circle). The second time we came, we brought reinforcements, so we could try more stuff from the menu...I mean we brought friends so we could share the bounty that was Tony's. We tried the Mac and Cheese, Peperoncino, the Margherita, and the Cal Italia. They had run out of the special dough for the Margherita and after talking it over with our server we decided to go ahead and try it with a substitute dough. It's supposed to be like the difference between coke vs pepsi. The Margherita was still good but when you like coke you stick with coke because pepsi just ISN'T coke. The Cal Italia was really good, but I have my favorites and the Margherita is IT. The Mac and Cheese held it's own with fancy, no doubt fatty, and delightful cheese. We came back a third time for a random date night and spent about 40 minutes not speaking to one another and instead sending our best "oh...woah woah!" faces across the table. It was orgasmic. This time we went with the Calamari again as well as the Fire Roasted Bone Marrow Coppa Fondue followed by the Margherita of course (with the correct dough). The Fondue: Holy Cheese*!!! It was freakin' awesome. This place is ridiculous! I will come here if I am within driving distance (meaning I have enough gas in the tank to drive here one way). I love it! UPDATE: have been here a few more times. Our new favorite is the New Yorker (coal fired 1000 degree). It's hearty, and zesty. The ricota is smooth, and creamy. The tomato sauce is robust. It just hits you with the UMPH! They don't take reservations so you will have to be here with your entire party in order to get seated (they call you on your cell). The staff has been awesome and friendly everytime. Parking in the neighborhood is an issue but it's SF... what 'chu gonna do? *The phrase Holy Cheese is a trademark of my love J.L.R. Love you boo!

personally, this is, by far, my absolute FAVORITE pizza in SF.   The Margherita, whether you get one of the 73 specials, or one of the 'regular' ones, is probably the best pizza i've had on earth.  ON EARTH! Service is great, very attentive but not annoying. Parking can be a female dog, especially if you're there at night.  My advice: do what we did last week and go for lunch right at 12 when they open.  We got a table for like 12 easy. Don't sleep on the appetizers - The meatballs are so scrumptious and the mussels are divine!!

I am addicted to Tony's pizza - the simple yet perfect New York style. The sauce is flavorful and he doesn't skimp on it. Ditto for the cheese. The dough is that lovely combination of crisp and doughy. I've also tried some of the other pizzas and found them to be very good. Tony's meatballs are very tasty, just a bowl of them and you are in heaven. The spinach and brussel sprout sides are well done, as is the Ceasars salad. There is a reason there is always a wait here.

After trying to eat here for the 2nd time we finally succeeded.  The place isn't particularly small but it is usually packed.  There was a 30 minute wait for a table, so we took a seat at the bar for a couple drinks and an appetizer of Garlic String Beans.  The string beans were tasty and nicely cooked but I was expecting something more of the crunchy deep fried variety, still light and crunchy.   After being seated we tried to order the Bone Marrow Fondue but were dissuaded by our waitress after being told that this was a large order fit for at least 4 people & for this reason we are coming back with a larger group.  Instead we opted for the Calamari & ordered the Coal Oven baked New Yorker(sausage, pepperoni, ricotta, mozzarella, & garlic) Pizza.   The Calamari was fried to perfection and was served with marinara & a Thousand Island type of dressing.  I prefer tartar sauce but the Calamari was still good.  Finally our pizza comes & it looks amazing!  Pockets of bubbling, oozing mozzarella & crispy bordered crust singed brown and black by hot as hell coals!   The 1st bite was delicious with the ricotta being the biggest surprise.  The only things I found iffy with the pizza was the center which was a little too doughy for such a thing crust and could have used a couple more minutes in the oven & a little too much tomato(being picky) but the rest of the pizza was great.  This was the closest any SF pizzeria has come to my favorite pizzeria in Brooklyn(Grimaldi's). The service & staff was excellent.  We will definitely be coming back but with a larger arsenal of foodies!

My wife and I went here late one night, massively craving pizza.  When we arrived, we were told it would be a 90 minute wait for a table.  I expressed my disappointment with the hostess, and stood there a moment to decide if it was worth the wait.  The hostess was NOT accommodating, and seemed annoyed that I was even considering it. We went outside and then overheard someone saying they were going NEXT DOOR to Tony's by-the-slice take out restaurant. Wait, what?!? Why didn't the hostess tell us that?  Why was she so quick to usher us out, and not even have the courtesy to say "Oh hey, if you want pizza, there's an extension of the restaurant next door where you can get it IMMEDIATELY."   Quite lame.

We came in last week and were excited to try this place after hearing that it was "the best pizza in America." Overeager, we ordered the margherita pizza, the quail egg/potato/chorizo pizza, and the cal italia pizza. The margherita pizza was decent, but a little bland. It wasn't anything out of the ordinary. On the other hand, the quail egg/potato/chorizo pizza was really, really delicious. I wish that we'd ordered extra eggs on the pizza because the combination of all 3 ingredients tasted amazing. I loved how the unique flavors worked together. The cal italia pizza was also delicious. The slight sweetness from the fig preserve worked well with the different cheeses that were used. The ingredients were all very high-quality and the flavors worked well together; matched with a perfect-baked crust, these pizzas are definitely contenders for the being the best in America! Needless to say, we left with extremely full and satisfied stomachs.

yumm! Basically, I came here with my hubby. We ordered their Margherita Pizza which was deeeee-licioussss. Thin crust, thin everything.. (5/5) After you eat it, you don't feel yucky like other pizzas. This is perfect for 2 people. I usually like meatballs so we also ordered 3 meatballs from them. It was also really good (4.5/5) It wasn't salty like other places and it had a little spice to it. Not sure if it was from pepper or something inside but I loved it! Price was pretty reasonably.. Not too high, not too low.. I can say one negative thing about this place: I DON'T LIVE IN SAN FRANCISCO and I'm already craving their pizza!!!! sigh.. I must visit SF a little more often to visit wonderful restaurant like this one.. I will definitely be back soon.. :D

Came in on Sunday January 29th, 2012 around 8 PM - wait was about 1 hour long - however, they did take our number and call when a table was available. Server was busy but nice - and came buy after a few minutes of being seated to take a drink order; and a busser dropped off some bread with a variety of dipping sauces which were tasty. We ordered the spinach salad - quite tasty as well as the Wild Robiola with mozzarella, straciatella, & robiola cheese, wild mushrooms, truffle oil, speck (smoked cured pork), piave, arugula - without the speck as I am a vegeterian. The pizza while tasty - did not reach the expectations that I had for this place after all of the lengthy reviews. I will have to come earlier for the margherita pizza - as it sold out hours before I arrived.

Was the wait ridiculously long? Yes. BUT, the pizza was great. Some of the best I've had in SF for sure. Only downfall is the price-- a tad expensive. But I guess given their popularity they can easily charge whatever they want. The pizza is damn good. I will leave it at that.

Why don't they take reservations?!  Fortunately, our estimated 1 hour 45 min wait on a Sunday night ended up being only about an hour, and once you're seated, things get moving quickly. To start, the giant meatball was amazing - the house made san marzano marinara was addictive.  They were sold out of burrata topped meatballs, but they also had interesting options like one topped with an egg. Sadly, even at 6:30pm, they were sold out of their daily 73 signature margheritas.  They still made us a margherita but with a different dough - regardless, heated up at 900 degrees. The coal fired 1000 degree ones we got were a little more standard - white pizza with clam (lots of clam, lots of garlic, lots of cheese.. need I say more?)  And the New Yorker was your usual fennel sausage and small caliber pepperoni but with fresh sweet ricotta and chunky tomato sauce, which made the pie. Now onto my favorite - the Wild Ribiola - cheesy and mushroomy - with three kinds of cheese, various wild mushrooms, a good drizzle of truffle oil, speck, and just a bit of arugula.  I don't like the pizzas topped with an entire salad on top, and this one had just the right amount of greens to brighten up the woodsy mushrooms. I adore truffles.  We were definitely all fighting for the last slice of this one. The last pie was the Food Network winner, the Cal Italia.  It was almost like a sweet-savory dessert pizza, with four kinds of cheese, including imported gorgonzola, topped with sweet fig preserve, balsamic, and proscuitto.  I'm not a big sweets person, so for me, this was like the cheese plate of desserts but on pizza and so amazing. I like that despite the fame of their pizza, they're not so pretentious that they don't give you regular pizza toppings.  Each table has parmesean, red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper, so you can add whatever you want on top of their pizza.  We also got the perfect view of the pizza oven (though it was pretty warm in front of it). Five of us left stuffed and with plenty of leftovers, but it didn't break the bank - with drinks, it was about $32/person (including tax/tip).  Tony's was definitely worth the wait.  If I lived closer, I'd consider take out, but I don't think I could last an entire 45 minute car ride without devouring the irresistible pizza sitting in my car.

We got their signature Margarita pizza, and man - yum Yum YUM!  We also got Diavolo Con Ricola, which arrived after the Margarita - the Diavolo was perfectly good, but after the Margarita, it just wasn't anything too special.  If you go, get the Margarita - that is one spectacularly delicious pizza!  The sauce is is ... oh man, I'm getting all hungry for it now .... why did I have to start thinking about this at 11am on a Monday night? ... anyhow, as I was saying, the sauce is so so tasty, the crust is perfectly crispy yet kind of chewy too, the cheese was soft and tasty ... all around, the perfect pizza.  When I go back, I'll get this and head straight to the desserts.

It takes a lot to get a guy who used to work in front of a pizza oven 10 hours a day to rethink his perceptions of those circular devil plates.  Tony's has succeeded. Expect to wait.  I've visited twice and each time a line was formed or forming well before open.  Don't worry, this is just pizza foreplay; the pay off is well worth it.  I've tried the New Yorker, the Cal Italia, the Margherita and a pizza square with 3 different toppings.  The former is loaded with their proprietary ricotta that I'm fairly sure came from some animal god and is loaded with sausage/pepperoni.  Really though, the base makes the difference. Their tomato sauce is a symphony of flavors without any of those sharply acidic/bitter notes you get with shitty pizza.  The Margherita is literally world famous; apparently this little spot in North Beach has the biggest dick in the pizza world.  Apropos of SF, it's a pizza dick I definitely want in my mouf.  The Cal Italia is a cheesy, proscioutto, fig jam mess which has an expansive flavor that sort of makes you black out a little bit. tl,dr: I hated pizza and then ate here.  Now we're seeing each other again and our therapist says we're making real progress.

Yes. It's good. If the limited-production Margherita is no longer available, get the other Margherita with the less-acclaimed flour. It's still delicious. The other best find was the cheesy garlic bread. Someone said the cheese was light and fresh mozzarella, and they were so right. The marinara dipping sauce is savory beyond belief. Last, if you order takeout to subvert the line, note that you'll need to do pickup at the separate storefront a few doors south. This is genius. The food is same quality without the wait.

I love pizza. New York style, Chicago style, Boston (I still haven't figured out what it is even after going to BU), Hawaiian, meat lover's, vegetarian--you name it and I'll eat half the pie. The first meal I ever had in America was pizza. I spent five months searching for the best pizza in Italy last year. And I'm always looking for a better slice in San Francisco. DF brought me here and it lived up to his hype. We had half a margherita pizza, half a sausage and mushroom pizza and a burger. The pizza crust was thin, crisp and easily worthy of its title of Best Pizza Margherita at the World Pizza Cup in Naples. The pizza was expensive at $19 and even more so with toppings, but it was molto delizioso! I didn't care for the burger because it was served well done even though we requested medium rare. I enjoy a good burger as much as a good steak, and both should be mooing at me as I devour it like a neanderthal. I did, however, care for the house bread with its red pepper and garlic dips. I broke my one-piece-only rule because they were so deliciously addictive. I love free stuff--especially when it tastes amazing! The Cheese Board Collective in Berkeley still makes my favorite pizza, but for an authentic taste of Italia without having to fly across the world and potentially run into the Jersey Shore cast, this is it. And there's usually no wait at the bar. Winner winner.

I read the stellar reviews. I heard on the news it was rated by some reputable publication, "best pizza in the country." I went on a Saturday night at 5PM. It was a 2 hour wait. I went back on a Tuesday. It was closed. Needless to say, the hype was so built up about Tony's that I could barely contain my excitement about stuffing my face there. My friend and I decided the ONLY way this was going to happen is if we went really early...like 4PM early. The wait was 30 minutes this time, much more manageable. We ordered their famous pizza margarita, a cesar salad and some meatballs with burrata. The cesar salad was one of the best I've had; very fresh and perfectly dressed. The meatballs were good but the burrata made it, otherwise it would have been like any other meatball I've had. What should have been the crowning glory - the pizza - was sadly lackluster. The dough was chewy, not crispy, and while it tasted good, we both were scratching our heads wondering what the fuss was about. If you want an amazing pizza, Delarosa's burrata pizza is the best I've had in SF thus far.

Meatballs are so good I had to order them twice.  Can't remember the wine I had with them but that was good too.   The only bummer was sitting at the bar and having to hear the staff's asinine conversation.  It just kept getting worse and worse and borderline offensive...So we left instead of getting a third order of meatballs.  Which was probably for the best. Def check them out.

I was vacillating between 4 stars and 5, and decided to go with 5 because the pizza really was that good.  I'm a bit of a pizza snob, but this place was pretty perfect. We went for a late lunch, so we had no problem snagging a table.  Our waitress was very friendly and upbeat, and was happy to answer questions and make recommendations.  We decided on the margherita pizza and the mushroom/truffle pizza.  Both were excellent, but I'm a purist and the margherita was my favorite. :) The ingredients were top-notch, the dough was perfectly seasoned and chewy, and I loved it.  Nom nom. About $15-$20/pie, which probably serves 2.  Highly recommended.

Forgive me Tony's Pizza, I was wrong. I actually wrote a review for the Pizza place up the block saying that they were better than Tony's and that there was no reason to bother with the wait. WRONG What happened was I called and tried to order a mushroom and sausage pizza to go and that was a whole confusing ordeal because there are like 10 types of crust and 5 ways to cook it.  I ended up with an ordinary pizza that was no better than the place up the block, which I like anyway.   I have been here a few times now and had the full explanation of the menu and have tried a few different pizza types.   Wow, they make Pizza exciting again.  Pizza is delicious, we all know this, but these guys are the experts.  It's like they're putting on a pizza clinic.   Each time I go I love what I order and I see something else on the menu that get's me excited for the next visit.

You know how some people/websites have said Flour + Water is the best pizza joint in SF?  Well, two thoughts come to mind.  One - doubt, since I thought Flour + Water was really overrated.  And two - maybe they should try Tony's Pizza Napoletana! Since finding parking was such a beast (on a Thursday night!), I ended up getting there after everyone had already been seated.  Sadly, that meant not being able to check out the menu before our order went in.  No matter, as I was there with Vicky L. (and friends) who had been to Tony's before.  After starting off the meal with the Deep Fried String Beans and Fried Calamari, our table of six also split the Margherita, Colombo, and Diavola con Rucola pizzas. - Deep Fried String Beans - it seemed more like pan roasted (in garlic and olive oil) than "deep fried" (wasn't battered).  Even though it might be a simple dish, I thought it was done well and I really liked the flavor. - Fried Calamari - this one was definitely battered and fried, and it was oh so good.  Although the difference between the calabrese and regular was subtle (we had a half-half order), it was still enough to set it apart. - Margherita - it's too bad they only make 73 a day because it is pretty damn good!  The mozzarella was flavorful, and I liked how the crust was thin, but not crispy or cracker like either.  Bonus points for keeping the sauce light as well. - Diavola con Rucia (hot red pepper oil, sopresseta picante, arugula, mozzarella, and parmigiano) - from the description, I expected a little kick but didn't find any.  The combination of sopresseta and arugula was good, but I would have liked that bit of heat that was missing.  Didn't exactly miss, but didn't do much for me either. - Colombo (chopped garlic, pepperoni, italian sausage, and oregano) - my second favorite pizza and a little different than the other two.  Instead of getting a typical thin crust pizza, the Colombo had a thick, bready crust and was rectangular (think sheet cake).  Although it was a little more dough than I would have liked, the toppings were terrific (albeit basic). Even though I didn't get a chance to take a picture of anything, I don't need photos to remind me of how good the food looked...or tasted.  In fact, how good the food looked was part of the reason why I didn't get any pictures - hard to stop for pictures when everything looks so good!  Although parking is usually a pain out this way, the food makes it all worthwhile.  Still, come early just in case...no need to let both parking AND the wait for a table get in the way of you and Tony's amazing pizza.  Not when it's one of the best pizzas in SF!

Order the Margherita Pizza and get a side of meatballs.   To start, we ordered a ceasar salad and six meatballs which I thought was way too many meatballs.  Good thing we got six since we goobled everything up.  The sauce is amazing, perfect to dip the bread in. As for the Margherita, it was delicious.  One of the best pizzas I've had.  The crust is thin and chewy.  The cheese is soft and gooey.  What more can you ask for. As for service, I have to agree with other yelp reviews.  It's very mixed.  The hostess sucked.  When we arrived, the hostess was on a personal phone call.  The place was empty and she continued with her personal call and made us wait a few minutes.  After she was finally finished with her personal call, the phone rang, she took call and made us wait more.  Waiting 5-10 minutes to be seated at a completely empty place...zero stars for the hostess.  She should be fired. As for the wait staff, skys the limit.  We got our salad and meatballs at the same time but only had one small plate.  I was going to ask for another plate then instantly, another plate arrives without asking.  After we finished, we got fresh plates for our pizza.  I really appreciate this because a lot of places don't give you fresh plates from the appetizer to entree (I hate eating pizza off a dirty plate).  The wait staff was pretty offset the sucky hostess.

As many reviewers explain- the wait is long, especially on a weekend night. But- bar seating is ample, and if you are a small party [no more than two] you will likely get a spot pretty quickly [we waited 5 minutes], and offered the same delicious food you can get at a table. My boyfriend and I had the Margherita Pizza [napoletana style] and Little Italy Salad, both were delicious and the perfect serving size for two. Next time we are going try their pasta next which also looked AMAZING.

Tony must be a popular man! On a Thursday night it was packed! My friend and I got to Tony's around 5:30pm and it was only a 20 minute wait. The hostess even called when the table was open which allowed us to walk around in the meantime. We were seated in their second room which was drafty since the doors were wide open. Service was quick but not necessarily friendly. We ordered the signature Margherita pizza and a side of fries. The pizza was good, I'm always a fan of Margherita but the fries were bomb. They had cheese, North Beach honey, and pepper on top. I would love to eat these at least once a week. Even when the pizza arrived, I was still eating the fries.

Tony and I were meant to be. Arrived 6:30 on a Saturday night to hear there was a 1.75 hour wait. A minute later two bar stools opened up. 10 minutes later we had our draft beers and bread with olive oil and garlic to dip. 15 minutes later a sublime pizza with a chewy crust I also dipped into olive oil along with a caesar salad made with dark green Romaine leaves that perfectly balanced healthy with decadence. I'm not sure how I'd have felt if we'd waited for 2 hours for the same meal, but this first experience was pure magic. Can't wait to return.

If you have the desire and patience to wait for a table inside, choose to sit and cuddle close under the heat lamps outside, or elbow your way to the bar-first come first serve- (where they serve their full menu), you are in for an amazing, well worth the wait treat! I split a margarita pizza to die for, with what I believe was Mozzarella Fior di Latte, and while the crust was a little soft and doughier than I usually go for, it worked well, and tasted spectacularly close to something you would find straight out of a fantastic, not touristy, neighborhood ristorante in Italy.   I also split a mojito sans rum, with a lemony twist and a generous splash if lemonchello.  It turned out to be very light and delightful, and this coming from someone who does not think of either rum or regular mojitos in such an appealing light!  I do, however, wish, that our bartender put a lot more mint in the drink. I feel it would be very unfair to mention anything about slow service, given the restaurant was bustling the whole time, so mark my words Tony, I will be back!

I'm from NY.  I love pizza.   I finally got to try Tony's for the first time for last night with some friends for dinner yesterday.  The pizzas were sooo good...easily the best I've had on the West Coast. Here's what we ordered: Margherita:  Simple but so good!  The crust is amazing!  Slightly chewy but lightly crispy.  This pizza apparently won like a million awards.  I would definitely go back for this pizza.  I like this crust better than the other pizzas we ordered. The Barcelona:  The chorizo is the highlight of this pizza.  Spicy and flavorful but not overpowering.  This is a fun pizza and wakes up your tongue. Wild Robiola:  Delicious, full flavors.  I don't know what robiola cheese is but it was smoky and kinda like gorgonzola.  This tasted great but it's a bit too rich and heavy for me to eat that many slices. Four Barrel Dirty Steak:  Juicy bone-in steak, perfectly cooked.  Comes with bone marrow on the side and very tasty potatoes. It was fun to go with a bunch of friends.  I think that's the strategy so you can order different pizzas to try.  The table next to us even gave us a sample of their White Pie with Clam & Garlic which was surprisingly good (I just had a my first clam pizza the other day and it was only ok). I'm not an expert on pizza cooking temperatures and ovens (see their menu) but I'll have to go back to continue my 'education'. P.S.  The waitress named Rose is crazy pretty and super friendly.

This place is phenomenal! I forgot what it is called, but you need to try the pizza with the fig sauce and prosciutto. Sounds interesting, but it is SOOOOO good!!!

We had the Margherita pizza (not the "San Felice flour", the waiter said we won't be able to tell the difference anyway :D), Cal Italia pizza, and the Meatball Gigante here and the food is fantastic.  They serve a lot of different styles of pizzas and it's interesting to taste the different dough textures etc.  Personally we liked the Cal Italia better than the Margherita, but we should return to try the others as well. Giving them minus one stars for the extremely long waits.  Apparently this place is popular among out-of-town tourists.

Order the Chirizo Mussels! It's awsome! Ok now that I got that out of the way. Tony's is pretty awesome I give them much credit for being able to bring solid Italian style rustic yet modern pizza to the bay area. This is def my fav pizza in the bay so far. If you are just with a few people go for the Roman style pizza. Its pretty impressive and gives you 3 distinctly different flavors. The crust here is thin but not paper thin and the texture is just a tad chewy, just like how it should be. I must say tho, maybe its just me but I wish the crust just had a little more crunch to it but that's just me. See Christina L's review for a more detailed synopsis of our foodventure. Enjoy!

I have been here a few times already and the food they served were always top-notch.  According to my friend who's been to Italy quite a few times already (not to mention she's The Ultimate Pizza Snob), Tony's Pizza comes close to the food she ate in Italy. I've never been to Italy but I do trust her opinion. My favorite appetizer are the Meatballs and I also love the bread and garlic/olive oil dip they serve before the meal. The Truffle Pizza (if available) is a must have. The pizza with the arugula (I can't remember the name) tasted amazing and I love the fact that the arugula was not wilted like how some other restaurants serve them on a pizza.  You can tell that they use really fresh ingredients.  The cocktails at the bar are well made but pricey, which is standard for North Beach restaurants. The only thing I hate is that there is always a big wait to be seated and they do not take reservations, hence the minus point. I wish I could take my parents there but they're too impatient and are not willing to sit for 45 minutes in hopes of snagging a table.  I know some people might say that they are a bit over-priced.  I think you really get what you pay for with this establishment.  It is well worth the money and I would definitely come back for more (again I wish they took reservations!).

I was in town for the first time w my gf and being a pizza junkie and after reading all the glowing reviews of the margarita pizza on yelp, I had to come here.  Let me simply say, the best pizza I've ever had. The dough was perfect, the sauce just right, the cheese delicious, it was divine. I've never moaned while eating food before this. Our last night my girlfriend and I got in a little tiff because she was upset I insisted we come back so I can have that pizza one more time.  It was worth it.

By far the best pizza that I've had in the city.  Not only do they have the best pizza, but their salads are amazing as well.  There is quite a long wait, but its in a great part of North Beach so you can easily hang out at the bars next door while you wait to be called.

We were just hours away from our red eye flight out of San Fran and were in the mood for pizza for our final meal of our trip.  My husband used Yelp to find Tony's Pizza. Wow we all loved it!! I will admit I am not a big pizza fan but their famous contest winning margherita pizza was fantastic.  Don't miss out if you are in San Fran!

We were visiting SF last week from Detroit, and guess what we ordered? The Detroit-style redtop. It was...okay. It doesn't compare to anything you'd get from Buddy's or Shield's in metro Detroit, but it was alright.

NOTE:  We only purchased a slice to-go.  But, would definitely come back and sit down at the restaurant.  All the pizzas being served looked great.  Wished we lived closer! Awesome to-go operation... * Well organized (shorter wait than dining room) * Helpful staff * Several outside seating options * GREAT NY Slice:  - Crust had perfect balance of crisp & chewy  - Sauce was one of THE best we've ever tried  - Cheese was good, but a bit heavy for us (yes, I know tons of cheese is the American way and you see it on all the TV commercials.  But, more is not always better.) The only downside was that you could not get the Napoletana pizza by the slice   ;-(

Because pizza is one of my favorite foods, I have very high standards. Twice I've been here now. Both times I've waited over 30 minutes for a table. I never wait more than 10 minutes to get seated for a restaurant. So that should say something... I'm being patient here! :) There is seemingly, no "perfect" time to go to Tony's. I've been when they first opened in the afternoon and two hours after they've opened. I've watched the line form and disappear, people wait for 30-45 minutes -- people standing in line in front of me...and me getting seated first because I have a smaller group. FYI, this is a great place for two people to go. If you're a family or group, you'll wait some time and if you're really grubbing -- you should try next door for the to go pizza. In addition to the wait, don't let the hostess scare you away with her crabbiness either. She's the last down-side to this restaurant. Wait in line, put up with the crabby hostess and you'll be rewarded with the most amazing pizza and MEATBALLS evar. Amazing food makes you do the impossible, like putting up with the wait time and the crabby hostess. I'm breaking new barriers! :D Anyway, I like the 3 for 5 (smaller meatballs), although the gigante meatball isn't so bad either. They have different flavors. The smaller ones are traditional and the gigante one has spices. Oh, and can't forget about the complimentary bread. I think they have 2 or 3 kinds. One has olive oil and some herbs spread on top. The others are plain and are good for sopping up the sauce from the meatballs. Sop it up. I swear, you won't regret it. Pizza: Barcelona - think of breakfast. It's got scrambled eggs on top, among some other yummy, rustic flavors. New Yorker - I admit I'm not much of a meat eater -- in fact, I'm almost a vegetarian. Though I find that when I come here I eat meatballs, sausage, and pepperoni. This New Yorker makes me a lover of pepperoni. History in the making. This place is one of the reasons why I probably won't ever become a vegetarian. Beers and cocktails are good here. Overall, great place to eat if you're in North Beach and are patient enough to wait for a table.

Having a Shalamar moment (http://www.youtube.com/w…). Second time around! We were a bigger group (six in all) this time and more adventurous. A friend's coworker introduced him to their meatball, his personal favorite. Here's what we ordered: Appetizers (shared) a) Caesar's salad (2 orders) - Amply fed five adults and dressed just right. b) Meatball Gigante Calabrese (2 orders) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) - The friend exhorted that this is the BOMB, and I could not disagree. From the runny egg to the impressive size, this meatball dish fit the bill. $12.00 per order Pizza c) Pizza Romana II (http://www.yelp.com/biz_…) - The menu clearly describes this as consisting of three different pizza combinations, i. tomato sauce, pepperoni, sausage, ii. ricotta cheese, chopped garlic, basil, linguica, piquante peppers, and iii. pesto caramelized onions, chopped garlic, roasted tomatoes, and goat cheese. Definitely for those who love a variety of flavors. $35.00 Definitely, it pays to come in larger groups as we were seated at a larger window table in the upper dining room (a few steps up a slanted ramp from the main entrance). Coming for lunch on a Friday afternoon, the restaurant was full, but there were no lines outside. If you come evenings, I would probably try to get here a bit earlier as they don't take reservations. In this case, it was sure "better than the first time, baby".

Foccacia. With Olive Oil & Garlic, Olive Oil, Olive Oil & Pepper Dip. This was pretty bomb, nice soft bread with olive oil, my fave! I also loved the one with the garlic, made my bread extra delish 'cuz garlic makes everything taste better! Meatball Gigante. With Wild Mushroom, Pancetta, and Robiola Sauce. This was SO good! The best meatball I've ever eaten in my life! They also limit their offering to 25 of these per day, they're pretty damn special and pretty damn delicious! They actually have 3 other sauces to choose from but we ended up choosing this one based on our server's recommendation and it was nommy in my tummy! Margherita Pizza Napoletana. San Felice Flour, San Marzano Tomatoes, Sea Salt, Mozzarella Fior di Latte, Fresh Basil and Extra Virgin Olive Oil. This 900 degree wood fired pizza is hot stuff! Literally one of THE BEST PIZZAS I've ever tasted in my life, definitely rivaling those of the birthplace of pizza, Naples, Italy. There is a reason why it won the world pizza cup, it is THAT legit! The crust was just as crispy yet airy yet doughy just like the one I had in Naples. The ingredients were also super fresh and very delicious! This is my favorite pizza! I crave it all the time and I don't even like pizza that much, that is how good it is! You have to come here for authentic Neapolitan pizza! It's definitely the best you can get outside of Naples.

World Champion.  LEFT NYC for our humble little North Beach.  First he made a hell of a dough ball turned thin crust dagger of Italian tradition, then he made a hell of a slice next door, then he made a parklet out front so you can enjoy the scenery a little easier!   He's on a roll, and the only thing stopping him is the tourists lining up that keep us locals out of the place.  Wish I could pop in here at my leisure, but unfortunately you kinda have to plan ahead for this place.   I've split the salads and pizzas with a large group, and I have to warn those with big appetites, the thin crust pizza is thin, so make sure to order some extra.

We had to wait for 2 hours before we were seated at this restaurant and it was well worth it (I have never been before). Now would I wait 2 hours again? Probably not, I would just try to go on a weekday instead of braving the weekend crowd. Thankfully, there are plenty of bars around the corner from this restaurant where you can kill your time while waiting. The best thing about this restaurant is that they have 4-5(?) different ovens, so when you order the different pizzas, it feels like you have a collection of pizzas from 4-5 different pizza joints. They really know how to make their pizzas - from the perfect crusts, creative and fresh ingredients on top. Yum!!

LET ME TELL YOU LITTLE STORY: I came hungry with my boyfriend. The server was fantastic, funny, friendly, helpful. Wanna be her friend. We ordered the New Yorker. It came in all its glorious splendiferous steaminess. Our jaws dropped. Drool dripped. We bit in. Trumpets blared and angels sang in glory. I had an orgasm in my mouth. Then I had 20 more. I fought with my boyfriend over the last slice of a pizza that is meant for around 6 people. It was gone in 7 minutes flat. We are not fat people. Truly. Ask the waitress. We just were seduced by the absolute magnificence that was Tony's Pizza. If this doesn't make you want to go to the best Pizza place in SF, I seriously don't know what you want from life.

The best pizza in San Francisco. Four stars, because there is always a wait and they have usually been longer seating us than what they quoted. Service can be kinda slow, but they are just super busy. It's worth the wait for sure and you will love the food. Everything we've tried here we have loved. Their Margherita Pizza is amazing, but they sell out fast, so get there early for dinner!

I came here on a Wednesday night and since I know they're pretty popular, I called beforehand to see if they were super busy or not (it's a week night and I wasn't planning on waiting hours for dinner). My Fiance and I got there, put our names down and was told it'd be about 45 minutes. Okay. 30 minutes passes and I go back to the front to ask where we're at and she said - another 45 minutes. HUH? Okay. Everybody else is waiting and they seem to get pretty good business, so OK I will wait some more. They have a pretty cool waiting system going on though - people leave their number and they call them when their table is ready. The lady said sometimes on the wkends, it can be a 3 hour wait. So we probably waited for about 50 minutes. We would've waited longer, but the lady told us the chef's counter opened up and asked if we wanted it. After 50 minutes, OF COURSE we will take it!!! Chef's counter - very cool, but very hot. You're basically right in front of the oven. The story about the oven was that the head (American) Chef won a global prize from Italy from the best pizza contest in 2007 and the prize was this oven - so he shipped it back to his restaurant. He won the contest with his margherita pizza (on the menu!). Supposedly they only make 73 margherita pizza's a day. No joke - their margherita pizza was good! It looked so simple to make, but I guess its the oven that's what makes it so delicious. We also ordered the New Yorker, which was delicious too, but it was a bit too cheesy for me.

We had never been here or heard of this place till last night. Whoa. Amazing. Our group of six started with the deep fried string beans, calamari and meatballs. Also their trio of bread dipping sauces. Dang! We barely had room for pizza but once it came, we had no choice but to try all three. We ordered a Detroit Style Red Top (phenomenal), a Coal Fired New Yorker (unbelievable), and a Classic Italian Cal Italia (almost like dessert w/the croatian sweet fig preserve and balsamic reduction).  The service was sassy and fun. Also impeccable. No room for dessert, next time we will *try* to save room. Mmmmmm...I'm eating leftovers for lunch as we speak!

They raised their prices. This is the only reason it's not at 5 stars. For two slices of NY style, it ran me almost 8 bucks. The slices are definitely large, but they weren't heated to maximal potential, leaving the cheese a little rubbery. And, while the dough was consistently crunchy, yet chewy, the sauce could have used more tang.

This is a great place for pizza. Check this out!....they have different TYPES of ovens to make the different styles of pizza! I've never heard of such a thing, but they do that here! They make sure that the different styles of pizzas taste authentic, and they do! The types of pizza here is quality. We tried the New Yorker and the Margherita. The margherita was good. I wasn't really into the way the dough was...not that it was bad, but it's just a preference thing (I prefer my margherita pizzas with a more thinner crust) The New Yorker was great though! The toppings were plentiful, well proportioned....and suits the name. You really can't go wrong here. People have different preferences of the way they like their pizza, and this place has the best of all pizza worlds. You Cannot get disappointed here....Pizza wise. The service was good too, as busy as it was. Expect a wait (sometimes awful long). Street parking only, and it's in North Beach, so you're going to need alotta of patience looking for parking (major pain in the arse!!). Well worth it though if you love pizza as much as I do.

I love pizza almost as much as I love pho, so I was super excited when my friend suggested we grab a post-Turkey day lunch at Tony's. Our eyes, however, exceeded our stomach capacity, so we ordered way more than necessary.  To start, caesar salad, chorizo mussels, and giant meatball.  Plus, a margherita pizza and a pizza romana (option III) to finish. Caesar salad:  Good, but not remarkable. Chorizo Mussels:  The sauce was to die for, but the slices of crunchy bread soaked in the sauce were divine.  The mussels themselves, however, left little to be desired.  The mussels were tiny and the mussel taste was a little overpowering.  Either they weren't that fresh or they were washed adequately. Meatball Gigante:  Nearly 1 pound of meat.  With a daily limit of 25 according to the menu.  We got the sea salt berrata option.  It was alright.  The sauce was good.  The berrata was yummy.  But, the meatball itself was slightly overcooked. Margherita Pizza:  Limit of 73/day according to the menu.  The mozzarella was fresh and the sauce was tangy goodness.  Overall though, I have to admit I've had better. Pizza Romana (Option III):  With the pizza romana, you essentially get to try 3 different pizza combos.  For option III, the first section is arugula, proscuitto, and parmesan.  It was tasty, but I would have liked a bit more proscuitto, or a stronger tasting proscuitto.  The second section with a meatball, white cream sauce, and chopped garlic was yummy in my tummy.  I love garlic, so this isn't surprising, but it may be too much garlic for someone that isn't a garlic lover.  The last section with gorgonzola, dates & pecans, apples, and honey & nutella was a little too sweet for me.  After a few bites, I had to stop. Overall, it was a pleasant dining experience, topped off with an impromptu (or at least it seemed so) pizza spinning demonstration.  Our waitress and the busboys were fabulous:  attentive, knowledgeable, and genuinely friendly.   Apparently, there is usually a 1-2 (or even 3) hour wait for dinner.  I'm not sure it's worth the wait, but if you're trying to avoid the crowds, I suggest getting there about 15-30 minutes before they open to snag one of the first tables for the day.  It's worth that 30-45 minute wait!

Tony has quickly become my go-to pizza place in SF. The take out counter is great for  picking up a quick slice (or whole pizza) without the fanfare of other popular pizza places. I've never had to wait more than 10 minutes to order. I highly recommend trying the New Yorker.

My expectations were so high that I was actually very disappointed when I ordered their top 2 pizzas, the Margherita & New York pizza. Both pizzas were very soft and soggy. There was no bite to the crust, every ingredient just melted into one another and felt apart as you lift it from the plate. Don't get me wrong, I really wanted to love this restaurant and fully support local businesses, but for over $50.00 for 2 pizzas, it's not to my liking nor for my guests. What was outstanding was their bread & 3 dips served as an appetizer. Because we went there before they opened on a Saturday, we didn't have to wait. The service was very good and we were served within 5 minutes of ordering the Margherita. I will not be returning but at least I gave it a shot at Tony's Pizza.

Went to this place for dinner based on other Yelpers' reviews.  Seemed like a good menu, but felt like it was a bit overpriced for what it was.  I like that they offered different styles of pizza, but since I went to dinner by myself, I didn't want to dish out $20 for a basic pizza.  I went with the marinara and added roasted red peppers.  It was good, but not memorable.  Also, I was sitting at the bar and felt like I was being rushed by the crowds of people behind me waiting for a seat.  Maybe I'll try their take-out next time I'm in town, but I probably wouldn't put my name on the waiting list for a seat at Tony's.

Meh. Hey waitress, stop telling me your pizza is cooked at 900 degrees. I don't care. I just want to eat good pizza. Soggy crust is soggy crust. I eat pizza all the time and, especially in NY, I don't get an earful of crap about the temperature of ovens, they just serve a good slice and they serve it fast and inexpensive. My mouth likes it. Tony, you charge me an arm and a leg, your pizza takes forever, and then your waitstaff insult me with their "You don't understand. We are told the oven is 900 degrees" nonsense. I'm listening and I don't care about your super fancy expensive oven alloy stone whatever. I'm not chewing on your oven. I'm chewing on soggy crust, bland and cold sauce. End of story. update: some wise guy emailed me to say he's been here 50 times and never had soggy pizza. well, good for you mr salad lover. try a pizza sometime and you won't be back. the guy also says he grew up in NY. la-de-da. if i have questions about overcooked chicken wings drenched in vinegar i'll be sure to let you know. let me put it this way. if my hand is wet from the slimy bottom of a crust, and i tell the waitron, i see at least two options. they can touch/look at the problem and fix my experience *or* they can get on a high horse and lecture me about their consultants, stones and thermometers. the latter doesn't fix the problem. the earth is not flat no matter what you say. you can keep your false pride and customer-is-wrong attitude. i won't be back. another update: some lady emails me that i'm too negative. ok, let me be positive. if i were a fish, i would love this place because the pizza is so wet it's like it was made under water. she also says she wants to die for the balls here. go ahead. die for balls. why are you telling me this? and she offers me a hug. i don't care about your kinky pleasures. i said the pizza is bad. you like balls? good for you. but if you think you can bribe me with hugs to change how i feel about soggy pizza and bad service, think again. i don't need no lectures, i don't need no bribes. make better pizza. kthxbye

Italian food while in my top 5 types of food I enjoy, is not my absolute favorite, only because, it is so widely done and so often half-assed, it just isn't worth getting my hopes up. I mean, come on, how many times are you going to put your hand in the fire and get burned before it just ain't fun anymore. Just because you have something resembling pasta, bread dough and tomatoes, doesn't mean you can pull off good Italian. You have to put your heart in it. When I want pizza, I'm not looking to play games, or order from a guy who wants me to call him "papa". While visiting San Francisco, a friend and I were strolling around tourist style, and looking for a place to get a tasty birthday dinner. I was willing to try Tony's mainly because of the crowd, some appeared to be locals. Good sign. And the fragrance wafting out of the place. It didn't smell like burnt oil and a barrel of rancid garlic. This establishment had a scent of fresh fired pizza dough, a hint of fresh garlic, herbs. A great sign. Charming Italian ceramics and sconces around the walls, wood everywhere. I like woody decor. Actually, the more a place looks like the inside of the hull of a tall ship, the better. We were seated pretty promptly, and in a central table. This place was packed!  Eying the tables around I knew from what we saw, we would order a pizza, and salad. Ordered: Wild Robiola Pizza - mozzarella, straciatella, & robiola cheese, wild mushrooms, truffle oil, speck (smoked cured pork), piave, arugula. But ordered  without speck. I am a fan of truffle oil, if used sparingly. Ugh, you do not want to overdo that pungent flavor. Tony's had it under control, and there was nothing to worry about there. The combination in this selection was perfect. Just so damn good. This is a true Italian pizza crust. Crisp, thin, but a tiny bit chewy, just enough topping  to cover the crust, without making it soggy in the middle. It was had to remember that I had a salad sitting there too. I don't want to forget that this was very fresh, nicely dressed. Very cool spot with better than I could have hoped for pizza. Thank you for not breaking my heart ,Tony. You treat your diners with repect, and showed me I can love Italian, again. Bravo!

Finding a restaurant with mind-blowing pizza has been quite a challenge for me... Succeeding in the perfect crust, sauce, ingredient combos, and baking them to perfection... It's a tough gig! But someone's gotta do it... and I think that someone is this Tony guy! Pizzas cooked to perfection in variously controlled temperatures?!?! This was one of the many stop during my family's SF food tour... Still stuffed from our previous spots, I feared that I wouldn't be able to eat any pizza because I was seconds away from a food coma. We ordered 2 different pizzas... I wish I could remember what the other one was called... All I know is... As soon as I took one bite of the Cal Italia... Everything I'd ever tasted before that moment was just dust in the wind. [cue music here] I can't even begin to describe the array of perfectly complementary flavors in this one slice of pizza... Despite how stretched out my stomach felt... I had to convince everyone that another order of the Cal Italia was in order. Best thing I ever ate? Hmm... I think that the Cal Italia from Tony's does win my award for best Pizza I've ever had. I wish you were closer...

In looking through the other reviews here, I'm astonished that no one has mentioned Chris C. - one of the best servers we were fortunate enough to come across. We've been to Tony's many times for the amazing pizza, ambiance, and overall service, but Chris is the reason we decided to write a review. During our most recent visit to Tony's, Chris C. immediately greeted us with a huge smile and the most positive presence! Chris C.'s knowledge of the menu was impressive! We had an idea of what we were looking for and what we wanted, but we also were interested in trying something new. He was great about offering his opinion and his own personal preferences but also ensuring we were ordering something that worked with our most-loved tastes! He offered some great humor during the meal and never once made us feel rushed. Chris C. was so diligent and attentive to our needs. He literally knew we needed more drinks before we did! I made a modification to the cocktail that I ordered, and when Chris brought it over & set it down he noted the modification and stayed and waited until I tried it to make sure it was to my liking. That was very impressive! My boyfriend and I really appreciate good conversation, and Chris C. was so pleasant to talk to - it felt like he was sitting right there with us! He told us about his family, their traditions and we shared some of ours, as well. It's such a 'breath of fresh air' to have a server who really takes the time to talk to you! All in all, our pizza (St. Louis style with meatballs, sausage, basil and spinach - so good!), the service, and the entire atmosphere was amazing, as always! But it's people like Chris C. who make restaurants as successful as they are!

I found myself craving some pizza after getting a few shots of Jameson at Savoy Tivoli, and that's when Tony's Pizza came to the rescue. It was almost closing time for them so they let us have two slices for the price of one. Under 5 bucks? Sweeeet! There weren't many choices left at that point, to which I got a slice of the Cheese and my friend got the Pepperoni. I thought we were going to get the pizza served as is but they even popped that stuff back in the oven for us. We sat outside at one of the tables they had and started to scarf down our food. The pizza looked simple enough, but it tasted like magic at the moment. It wasn't overly greasy, cheesy enough without being overwhelming, and the crust was crispy yet soft. I think I may have found my go-to stop before I head out for round two at the bars.

World winning pizza from SF's Tony's Pizza Napolenta... I had to try it. I love thin crust pizza and especially love Margherita pizzas. I read online that only 73 margherita pizzas are made daily. Since I had to have one, I called that afternoon to place my order, ready for pick up at 6:30 pm. I ordered the Margherita ($19), Quail Egg, White Rose Potato, & Chorizo ($21) and the Cal Italia ($18). All three pizzas were to serve four guys. My first mistake. These pizzas are tiny and without the thick dough to fill you up I was left hungry and disappointed. The margherita was nothing special and the quail egg was too salty, but the Cal Italia was delicious. The sweet fig preserve, prosciutto, cheeses, and balsamic were so good. I wish I had ordered three Cal Italia instead. I will hold off driving to North Beach and battling for parking just to eat a Cal Italia again, especially since I can walk from my house to get a copy-cat prosciutto pizza. What I recommend: -- Cal Italia

One of the best meals of my life. Got the limited run Margarita pizza with my girl and we were blown away (she is from NY and admitted it was the best pizza she's ever had.) The homemade penne was equally delicious - we live in DC and were seriously contemplating getting a plane ticket back next weekend to get some more of this amazing food. You won't be disappointed!!

I am a fan. My husband raved about Tony's so we got takeout one night.  The "New Yorker" was great, but the "Detroit Style: Red Top" was not good at all.  The crust was really weird. I decided to give Tony's another chance so my husband and I went there with our dog.  I loved it!  The wait was long (90 Minutes), but the service and the outdoor seating were great.  We got the "Margarita" and the "Prosciutto Pomodorini." Both were amazing.  I loved the Prosciutto Pomodorini- definitely one of my favorite pizzas I have ever had.

I have been frequenting Tony's for almost 2 years since joining the neighborhood and have FINALLY decided to write a yelp review. There have been ups and downs (mostly related to the looong wait), but ultimately it's a favorite, so I come in at least once every week or two.  Tony's has a comfortable vibe and really friendly service, but what stands out the most is the great food you can count on. My favorites over the years... Margherita Pizza - simple delightful flavors that really make this an authentic winner Meatballs - soo juicy and flavorful, a must for 1st timers Cal Italia - really flavorful if you don't mind sweeter pizzas Best Value (for larger groups) - Pizza Romana (serves closer to 4-6) Only Item I'd Recommend Against - St. Louis Style (tastes like velveeta cheese pizza) I could go on and on, but just check this place out!!!

Welcome to Pizza Heaven. Try to get here early so you can get one of the famous pizzas where they only make about 63 crusts a day. I would also recommend to experiment a little bit and try one of the pizzas from a different kind of oven. Great price as well, but if you dont get here early you have to wait to get a table for a long time.....

Tony's Pizza Napoletana is one of the very best things about living in North Beach. The pizza, the staff, the bar, and Tony himself are all 5 stars! The Margherita pizza is a must have, but since they're limited to only 73 a day, you need get in early to make sure you can still order one. Tony's Margherita is so good that he even won the pizza world cup in Naples! A must have appetizer is the Meatball Gigante! It's a giant meatball as big as a softball, covered in marinara sause. The Meatball Gigante is so awesome, that I dream about it.  Sometimes when I close my eyes, I can still see, and even smell a Gigante Meatball right in front of me. Other fantastic choices are the New Yorker (classic sausage, peperoni, and garlic) and the very special Pizza Romana, which is 3 pizzas in one! The Sicilian Style pizzas are also magnificent. I know I'm going to go to hell for saying this, but Tony's Sicilian is even better than Golden Boy. I feel terrible for saying that, but it's true. I'm so happy that I live within walking distance of Tony's. I go there every week!

I regretfully have to knock them down to two stars because of the poor service.  Our server was not  very friendly,  helpful or attentive. I'd been to Tony's 4 times and had great service and great food.  I was eager to take huzby there. We very politely asked our server if we could get a vegan pizza and he tapped the menu and said, "NO!" He gave NO suggestions for getting veggie side dishes (which we noticed later). He also never checked back with us to see how we were doing. We noticed the other servers being helpful and attentive.  The server at our neighboring table went through the menu explaining the differences in pizza, what appetizers are good, etc.  He also added that they could make it any way they wanted.  He also checked back with them several times during their meal. Thank goodness for the OTHER servers and "bus boys" who served us refills of water and bread and checked back with us.  We never got a salad we had ordered and after a reminder to another server he apologized and went to check on it. Although the food was good our experience was RUINED by the bad service from our primary server.  When he wiped off the table next to us he just brushed the crumbs and food on the floor instead of his hand or a napkin.  I've NEVER  seen a server do this! I know Tony's is so popular that they may not mind losing repeat customers since the tourists alone comprise a major part of their customer base. Had this been my first visit I would have given them one star and not returned.  I will not be in a rush to return here.  I'll definitely check out another pizza place next time I'm in the area. If I do return I'll be sure to NOT get the rude dude who waited on us.

What's there to say about Tony's that hasn't been written already? I'll try this: they have a garden (and actually harvest their own honey for some of their new pies) on the roof of the building. Other than that - yes, it's amazing. Yes, there will probably be a long wait if you're coming here any time after 7:30, regardless of the day of the week. Put your name in and head to Dell'uva or Mario's for a glass of wine or a beer before the hostess calls you. And yes, you will likely have Tony himself coming around and checking on you to be sure it lives up to the hype. It will, esp. if you get the Pizza Campari or NY.

I'm going to get some hateful looks, but .... I really much prefer Pizzeria Delfina for thin crust pizza (and especially for their margherita). Anyway, here is what we ordered: [[ STG Pizza Napoletana Margherita pizza ]] --- The "2007 world pizza cup winner in Naples, Italy ... limited to 73 per day."  It's words like that that catch my attention.  The mozzarella was good, and the ingredients very fresh overall, but just a tad bit too oily.  I had a mini pool of oil on the slice that I picked up.  I wasn't impressed enough given all of the hype. [[ Cal Italia ]] --- Also another award winner.   Comes with 3 types of cheese, croatian sweet fig preserve, prosciutto, no tomato sauce.  This was too sweet for my tastes.  My least favorite out of the ones ordered. [[ Coal Fired New Yorker ]] --- My favorite out of the 3 that were ordered.  Very fresh sausage and pepperoni.  (I normally don't like pepperoni that much.)

2.5 hour wait on a Friday night? This place was definitely WORTH EVERY MINUTE. PARKING: Definitely difficult to find parking in Little Italy! I taxied over here, and I suggest you do the same. Or, get here early and spend the day walking the charming neighborhood :) FOOD: Group of four girls dominated this menu. We ordered the famous huge meatball. Split among four people, the meatball was a perfect size so that each of us could get a taste. The meatball was moist and had the perfect amount of "give" to the texture. The sauce with the meatball was a simple marinara, but it was so delicious! Pizza: We ordered the Wild Ribiola and Margherita pizzas. The Wild Ribiola was one of the best pizzas ever - it must have been the truffle oil! The speck was a nice contrast to the normal toppings of a pizza. We didn't come in time for the special dough for the Margherita pizza, but our waitress let us order it with a regular crust. DELICIOUS! I definitely must come back for the special crust! SERVICE: Our waitress was incredibly knowledgable about the menu and eased us into a nice meal even after our 1.5+ wait. She was super friendly and continually came to check up on us. Must figure out a way to compare New York and Tony's pizza without criss crossing the country in a day :(

I loved Tony's! Best neapolitan pizza I have had so far! We ordered the Jersey pie, which I can only describe as an inside out pizza (sauce outside the cheese), the meatball appetizer, and several glasses of Cabernet Sauvignon. It was perfect. The sauce was sweet and tangy and it was fantastic. I'm from Jersey and we certainly don't have pizza like that here and I so wish we did. The meatballs were very good as well. Keep in mind you have to get there BEFORE they open if you want a table inside and even then there is the possibility that you will have to wait. We got there later so we either had to wait an hour for indoor seats or sit outside. We sat outside under the heaters and enjoyed it very much. If your in San Francisco, make it your goal to go here at least once.

A friend of mine thought we should try this place for dinner one night.  After reading a few Yelp reviews praising this place, I figured it had to be some pretty damn good pizza.   The menu itself is not user friendly at all and if you've never been here before, you'll have no idea how to decipher it.  I don't particularly care what temperature a pizza is cooked at, I just want to know how many people it serves, what are my choice of toppings, if it has thick or thin crust and if it is square or pie cut.  Is that too much to ask for?   After a brief and I mean brief explanation from the server, my friends and I still totally confused decided to share the Sicilian style Colombo pizza.  It had a thicker crust, like foccacia bread, was square cut and enough to serve 2-4 people.  It was pretty good, but not spectacular as some of the other Yelp reviews are suggesting.  The flavor and texture of the pizza reminded me of Golden Boy Pizza, which is great, but just proves that Tony's didn't taste and isn't unique at all.   This place didn't wow me by any means and at the end of the day, pizza should just be pizza.  I wish people would stop trying to make it gourmet.  It's comfort food no matter what temperature you cook it at.

I went to Italy in October 2003. Two of the best pizzas I ever had were in Pisa, a few blocks away from the Leaning Tower, and Antica Pizzeria da Michele in Naples, home of the Margherita pizza. The U.S. has their own spin on pizzas from New York's thin crust to Chicago's deep dish pizza. Though intimidated in the U.S. it's really hard to find authentic pizzas like the ones made in Italy, until now. In the heart of North Beach is Tony's Pizza. I heard about this place last year in October after http://insidescoopsf.sfg…. After reading the article I wanted to try it out, but never had the time. However last Friday my boss and me walked to Tony's Pizza for lunch. We were aghast to find the long line before Noon but I found out later they open at Noon. Before we left Tony's Pizza we agreed to order their signature pizza - the Margherita - which according to their menu they only make 73 times a day. It reminded me of Anthony Bourdain's "No Reservation" episode when he went to a pizza place where they open around 5PM and close when they run out of dough. It's all about quality versus quantity. How fast was this service? We got seated just past Noon. We probably ordered the Margherita between 12:05PM to 12:10PM. Just before 12:15PM our pizza arrived. That's blazing fast. (From my observation in Italy pizzas cooked in the wood burning over takes about 1 1/2 minute to cook). But the real test came is off course is the taste. After taking the bite it reminded me when I was in Naples. And studying the structure of this pizza it is exactly how it is made in Naples. Instead of grated mozzarella it's pieces of whole mozzarella. Instead of being oily its runny and that's not a bad thing it's because of the fresh mozzarella. Last is their thin, light crust which has that crispy bottom yet elastic. Now I see what's all the hype regarding the Margherita. The only thing that isn't Italian on this pizza is there are six slices whereas in Italy you get the whole pie, but that's just being picky. All I can say about the Margherita is after us they would only make 72 more that day. The waitress then confirmed to my boss that they use seven different types of ovens. When I heard that I couldn't comprehend that many ovens. Then when I looked at their menu I realized different pizzas for different ovens. Where we sat was close to the oven that was used to cook our Margherita. This is a man that really cares about his pizza that he would go to the extent of using different ovens for different types of pizzas. That concept is similar to another Anthony Bourdain "No Reservation" episode when he went to the Basque region in Spain where eat at a restaurant where the chef uses different charcoal for different dishes he cooks. Before that I thought Tony Gemignani was only good at hand-tossing the pizza. I didn't realize that he was great at making pizzas. Now when people look at the price they might say its way to overpriced for pizza. My response is if you want to save money then go ahead to buy the cheap quality pizzas at Domino's, Round Table, Little Caesars, and etc. However if you want to have the authentic pizza Napoletana like in Naples and don't want to pay all that airfare going to Naples then come to eat at Tony's Pizza to experience what it's like "to take a bite out of Naples".

Oh man...are you kidding me! What the... If you do not give this place at least 4 stars, you are not of my Tribe. What more do you need to taste? I go to SF a few times a year. Found this place last year and holy mother of whatever Deity you subscribe to, I'm hooked. This place kicks some serious Pizza A--. It offers a few too many choices, but I will forgive them that. Just cut to the chase and get a thin crust anything and you will be in Pizza Heaven...Momma F------ Mia! Man, that wood burning oven (ovens) really makes a difference. That is not the only thing. You need to know how to make the right crust and the right sauce (cheese is easy, good quality whole fat low moisture Mozzarella...your good to go). They have the magic recipe for quality crust and sauce here, my carb loving friends. Best Pizza outside of Italy I have ever had...Hands down, all around, do not frown. Tony's is the real deal. Go ASAP!!!

Absolutely amazing.  Such a variety of pizza, and each one is cooked to it's own style whether it be with coal, wood, or gas... First of all, the place is always busy and the wait can be long.  On this trip, a party of 4 at 9pm was about an hour long wait.  Sounds long huh?  Well it was worth it.  The hostess was very kind and she got my name down right away with my phone number.  She also suggested that if we were in a hurry, we can walk next door to their to-go area and get the same pizza for less time.  Since we didn't mind waiting, we walked about 2 doors down to a little bar and had a few drinks. When we finally got our call, we were seated right away and the waitress helped us with the menu.  It can be quite overwhelming because there were so many styles of pizza and each variation was also cooked differently. My friends and I started with the meatball appetizer.  Although we wanted the gigantic meatball (made with veal, pork, and beef), someone had ordered the last one, we settled for the 3 mini meatballs (made with pork and beef only).  It was delicious and enough to make the mouth crave more. Next, we ordered the famous margherita pizza (cooked in a 900 degree wood oven), and the Americano (cooked in a 550 degree gas oven).  The margherita was so simple, and so delicious.  It had a lightly crispy crust with nice charred bubbles from the wood oven, lumps of fresh mozzarella, torn basil, and a nice slightly sweet tomato sauce.  Nothing was overpowering, and each distinctive taste came all together after each bite.  The Americano was the opposite.  It had an array of various toppings and was cooked in a gas oven.  It didn't produce the charred bubbles, and the crust was crunchier than the margherita's crust, but overall it produced the same "OMG" taste in our mouths when we ate it. Overall, this is hands down my favorite pizza joint EVER.  So if you are ever in SF, head over to little italy and grab a pizza at Tony's.  You can thank me later.

This would have been a five star if we hadn't had to wait 2 hours to get a table. We saw regulars come in and be seated right away. The place was packed and obviously has no problem making money so I doubt they cared. As soon as we were seated we had great service. Delicious pies, we tried three different pies for four of us. Each came out separately and not all at the same time, I liked that. Great pizza and I would recommend you check this place out, but don't be suprised to wait a while, if you aren't a regular.

I had pretty high expectations of this place based on all the reviews here on Yelp. We were all pretty disappointed with the pizzas we ate here however.   My party ordered two pizzas. We ordered the famous Margherita pizza. It was below average compared to other Margherita pizza's I have had at other notable pizzerias-the texture of the crust was way off-it seemed almost spongy.  At $19.00 for a 12 inch pizza, it was totally overpriced as well. We also ordered the Jersey style tomato pie de Lorenzo style.  I have to take issue with what some other reviewer wrote about this pizza - this pizza is not remotely like a Margherita.  It is not cooked in the same type of oven, it has a different type of crust, and the tomato sauce is very sweet. Also, the cheese is layered on first and the sauce is on the top.  So no, this pizza is not in the least bit like a Margherita. I am not an expert on this type of pizza but I found the sauce too sweet for my taste.  The crust was excellent however. If I am back in San Francisco, I might come back to try one of the other styles of pizzas but this place is not on the top of my list.  I've travelled all around and this pizza does not come close to Pizzeria Bianco or even Pizzeria Pomo, Humble Pie or Grimaldi's- all in the Phoenix area.  And its not even close to Sally's in New Haven.

EXCELLENT fresh tomato sauce on their margherita pizza hands down! Uber tender and flavorful meatballs. And huge, fresh, delicious salads *nom nom* Though a bit turned off by all the burnt blisters on the pizza crust yet a crust a bit too chewy (which keeps Zero Zero's margherita pizza still #1 in my book), Tony's is still a quaint lil' lunch getaway in northbeach worth venturing to. And across the street is gelato. Yum :) And, one more for the record: GET THE MEATBALLS.

This place lives up to its great reviews. We ordered the cal italia pizza and the spicy calamari, everything was delicious. I can honestly say that was the best meal we had in San Francisco during our stay. When we first got there they were super packed, but the girl taking our names offered to give us a call while we walked around the area and had a drink somewhere. She called us about half our later, but we were in the middle of a drink but she mentioned she would bump us up to the top of the list whenever we showed up. When we finished our drinks we went back to Tony's and true to her word she sat us down immediately. They sat us in the back room where the guys were making the pizzas. At first i thought this might be a little weird, but we went ahead and had a seat. Quite the opposite, we were entertained watching the guys make pizza and non-stop, along with Tony showing up helping out for a bit and asking us about where we were from and if we were enjoying the food. It was pretty awesome. So no complaints at all, the place is super busy and packed, but only because they have great food and great service.

Best pizza in SF hands down. Don't let anyone tell you differently. Second place is a tie between Tomassos and Una Pizza Napoletana but they are a far cry behind.  Let's not even discuss Zero Zero. Seriously I think the only place that compares to Tony's is Grimaldi's in Brooklyn. They have 900 degree wood fired pizza, 1000 degree coal oven pizza, 550 gas Sicilian pizza, and classic American pizzas. I recommend the Marghertia wood fired pizza which they only make 73 per day. Also, the New Yorker coal oven pizza with mozarella, pepperoni, italian sausage, ricotta is a must try!! The place gets crowded so snag seats at the bar. Or, if you are lucky, the best seats in the house are actually at the marble counter in front of the ovens where the pizza making takes place. One of my favorite restaurants in the city.

When I have friends or family in town, this is my go to place to take them. Everything here is  yummy. They don't take reservations, so the wait sucks sometimes. They have their award winning margherita pizza which I had once because they only make a certain amount a day. I suggest getting their fries with honey and some bacon. Haven't tried their pasta, but I'm sure its good. Oh and order their meatballs!!

This is for their by-the-slice pizza, maybe their made to order pizzas are better. The slice didn't taste bad but it was pretty burnt on the bottom.  The top was drenched with oil and he cheese was sliding off the bread.  And at $4 for a slice, it's pretty disappointing.

Tried their margherita pizza, meatballs and calamari.. the pizza was great, but I wouldn't say it was the best I had..the meatballs I loved and the calamari was good.. the service was great..very attentive and fast.. we got lucky and got seats at the bar.. otherwise the wait for the table would have been 1 to 1 1/2 hrs! only thing I can complain about was that not all our appetizers came out before the pizza.. the meatballs came first, then the pizza and then the calamari.. because of that we wanted to finish eating the pizza while it's still hot, but also wanted to do the same with the calamari.. overall, I love the place! I would definitely be back to try their other pizzas!

If it wasn't for the fact that SF is completely deficient in decent pizzerias, this place would not shine as bright amongst the locals as it currently does.  Sorry, but Grimaldi's in Brooklyn and the Phoenix area is far better and comes closer to the style of Naples than Tony's.  It's good, but the dough is far off from the texture and taste of Italy.  But like most eateries in SF, if you price it high enough, people will fight to eat it.

Best pizza in SF (Delfina is overrated). Disclaimer:  I've come to realize that I'm not a thick crust pizza person. Simple pizzas, high-quality ingredients. Classic Italian-style pizza. Parking's difficult (it's in North Beach). Tip: Get there right when they open (11 or 11:30am) to avoid the horrendous wait and to have a chance at trying the Margherita Pizza (they only make 73 a day)!

As an amateur pizzaiolo this was one of my must do's in SF; I was pleased to see Tony at the helm in front of the wood burning oven personally cooking  most of the pizzas. Ordered a Marguerite and a few other styles; all were great and baked perfectly. As Tony wandered about the restaurant I mentioned that I was a fan and he was very charming and gracious. Even offered me a tour of his shop and the different ovens. All and all- wonderful pizza,great location and wonderful efficient staff. WILL GO THERE  AGAIN ON MY NEXT TRIP TO THE CITY BY THE BAY!

The pizza itself was very good.  If you like to explore different types of pizza you will enjoy their menu which has a huge variety of different crust styles and ovens temperatures for cooking. However, the wait for this place is unbelievable (at least 2 hours).  I would not say it is worth the wait given all the other pizza choices just 1 block away in North Beach.

Yummy Pizza. Many kinds of pizza's to choose from; they have 5 different pizza ovens. Cooked in a coal oven, 24 inches long, 3 different kinds of toppings, your choice. $25.00 not cheap but made in a special way. We ordered the 3 topping pizza. And the Little Italy salad , $11.00 Thin crust, like it was meant to be. The salad was fresh and lightly dressed with an incredibly light olive oil, in the middle , on the plate was a pool of mahvelous balsamic vinegar.

Probably one of my favorite places in San Francisco to get pizza - and I love pizza!  I'd recommend trying a couple different styles of pizza so you can taste the difference between wood-fired, gas-oven, electric-oven pizzas.  Definitely get the meatballs - they're like the gourmet, actually-tasty version of sbarro's giant meatballs (I actually feel that it's a little sacrilegious to even mention that name, but figured it would help you visualize the size).  Wait times can be pretty ridiculous, but you can put your name down and wander around north beach or go have a drink nearby while you wait.

Came here to visit from SoCal and 2-3 hour wait for a table of 4? We almost walked out and chose another place. I don't know how but lucky for us, 4 people stood up from the bar and we grabbed the seats! World's Pizza Cup Winner in Italy? Best pizza in the world?! Not sure about that since I haven't really traveled and tried authentic pizza but it was SURE FREAKING GOOD! I was so sad when I they ran out of the Margherita pizza.. they are limited to make only 70 a day.. SO BUMMED. Looking at other peoples' pizzas around you makes you drool and even more hungry! It tastes as good as it looks! They ran out of all the thin crust pizzas that night too :( so we ordered two deep dish pizzas. I'm not a fan of deep dish so I was pretty sad about not being able to try their thin crust. Yes, the pizza was good. I'm not sure if it's worth the wait though, maybe because I'm just a visitor, I don't like wasting my vacation nights waiting for pizza. They do call you when your table is ready though! Parking is gross of course, its San Fran..

let's just say the garlic and honey dip for the bread could cause many a girl to sin, repeatedly, what her hypothalamus galloping as she savages one piece of refined  crusty white bread after the next in her desire to lick every last drop of sweet garlicky goodness off the plate. my dining companions consumed a some pizza (no idea what it was, but they gobbled it all up happily), a meatball sub with some peppery fries, and i shared the frisee salad and a spicy linguine. the salad was lovely, light and bright, and the frisee was chopped into totally manageable bites. the linguine was swimming in a glistening oily bath and had adorable ridges that made the red pepper flakes cling to them most fetchingly. service was so so, as everything came out save for our pasta. after 5 minutes i went in to investigate only to be informed that the pasta came from a different station and would be ready shortly, which of course was fine, but it would have been nice had we been told that when the rest of our food arrived.

The day after and I'm still thinking about the pizza and craving some as I write this. No wonder these are award winning pizzas! Party of 5 around dinner time took some time to get a table...about 45 minutes.  It wasn't so bad. We ended up walking around checking out the shops and the candy store a couple blocks away. The menu is huge, we didn't know where to start. But here is what we got: Caesar salad - I'd say enough for a few bites for the 5 of us. I might ask them to not put as much dressing next time. And I wish there were more anchovies. There were only 2 pieces on there. The Barcelona - $22 - I thought this might be interesting with the scrambled eggs on top because I've had a fried egg on top of a margherita pizza at Beretta's before and it was delish.  This pizza...dont' think I'd have again. It didn't wow me. Burratina di Margherita - $29 - It's more expensive than the other ones I think because of it's size, but I'm not really sure...maybe it's because of the burrata cheese on top. The crust on this one is kinda like a pan pizza...kinda thick, but crispy.  I wish I could taste more of the burrata, but i loved the crunchiness of the crust! Prociutto E Pomodorini - $17 - My FAV of the 3 we had.  Simple, yet oh so good!  The crust was yum! The service was good, waitress was friendly. I can't wait to go back!

The Meatballs (Gigantic) and the sauce are out of this world. Now you can eat outside as well as the bar area inside. Great bartenders that make a STIFF DRINK !

After months of anticipation, we finally came here to celebrate a friend's birthday with a large party of 8.  We ordered the following: Calimari Fritti (3/5): pretty standard fried calimari, which remained relatively crispy throughout the course of the meal.  Good but not amazing. Meatballs (4/5): Deliciously moist, large meatballs with a savory, chunky tomato sauce.  The tomato sauce was garlicky and so tasty that we spooned it over our pizzas and focaccia.  Definitely order this! Coal Fired New Yorker (3/5) ( mozzarella, hand crushed tomato sauce, natural casing pepperoni, sliced italian fennel sausage, ricotta, chopped garlic & oregano): Tasty but not outstanding.  It was flavorful, but the ricotta would probably have tasted better had it been on the sicilian style gigante we ordered, as it was a little bland on the thinner crust. Coal Fired White Pie with Clam and Garlic (2/5): We were most disappointed with this pizza.  It wasn't briny/clammy enough, and the white pizza had a generous amount of some kind of mild cheese.  We unanimously favored Amici's clam pizza over Tony's. Classic Italian Panchetta Porcini (4/5) (mozzarella, wild mushrooms, porcini, imported pancetta, truffle oil, smoked scamorza, fresh thyme):  How can you possibly go wrong with truffle oil, wild mushrooms and pancetta??  Delicious, and I'd order it again if we were going with a large enough party. Classic Margherita (4.5/5): This is one of the pizzas Tony's is famous for, and it's no wonder.  The thin crust is chewy and pliable with a crisp, charred crust.  The tomato sauce was nicely balanced and the flavors meshed really well.  Winner! Sicilian Style Gigante (4/5) (garlic, molinari salami, mushroom, bell peppers, red onion, pepperoni, linguica, sausage, green onion, black olives, cherry tomato): Some people didn't like this as much as some of the other pizzas, only because they like thin crust, but I really liked this one!  It was incredibly flavorful and I loved the airy, soft yet crispy focaccia.  With all the other slices though, I wasn't able to finish an entire slice, but I'd definitely have this one again, too. Excellent service and great pizza is a fabulous location on Washington Square!

since i've moved back to the bay area almost three years ago, i've been searching for good pizza. sure, there's lots of cali style pizza places- you know the type.  add every veggie under the sun to a corn based dough made from organic hippie grown pizza trees. i will eat that stuff when it's all there is.  sometimes i even enjoy it.  but i hadn't found the kind of pizza i love.  i mean, with all the foodies in sf, i thought for sure there'd be a lot of pizza joints with delicious pizza.  wrong.   i don't think i'd ever move back to nyc, but my pizza tastebuds have been in hibernation since devouring the deliciousness that is grimaldi's under the brooklyn bridge. then came tony's. i took one bite into that pizza and angels were singing.  the sun came out of the fog.  children laughed giddily as children do.  lovers embraced and confessed their undying love to each other. and i, finally, had awoken my pizza tastebuds. i don't think i can eat any other pizza in sf anymore.  and why would i want to? an added bonus:  those garlic string beans.  hot damn.  that's a food party in your mouth.

Had heard so much about their famed margherita pizza and I simply had to try it, today was my lucky day. The crust is super thin yet firm, the sauce is sweet and tangy and accompanied with that aromatic basil and salty cheese....they come together beautifully. Delectable. The brussel sprouts antipasti was pretty tasty as well.

Good service, nice locations, good pizza....but good does not mean amazing. I have been hearing this and that about Tony's pizza for 2+ years and I have to say, to each there own but it is overhyped and in my opinion not worthy of any world titles, which I hear they are famous for. Had the margherita....was pretty average and run of the mill...NOT bad, but not worthy of a world title in my humble opinion. Una Pizzeria Napoletano's is better without question.  Also I have eaten at Pizzeria San Michel in Napoli, IT a 5 time world champion margherita pizza and it was much better. Then we had the Roman II which also was good, better than what Tony is famous for, but again, although it was tasty it I give the place 7.5 out of 10.  Good pie, but not out of this world. Don't believe the hype. Sorry Tony I respect what you do, but I have to say it does not even make my top 5 in San Francisco. Maybe bottom rung of the top 10, but I was hearing top 1 or 2 which was not even close in my opinion. I do like the menu and it is a good place to learn about pizza and to try a plethora of different styles, but I am giving it a 3 star due to the amount of hype it gets that I think is unwarranted. If it was not so over hyped I may have been a fan and given it 4 stars, but when your expectations are through the roof and you get solid but not amazing results it is a let down. Eye Candy was 4 stars. Dip shit frat boys who tried cutting in line and sat at the bar get 1 star.   Sorry Tony, not Pizza Heaven. Pizzetta 211 still owns that one in my book, to be fair next time I may have a california pizza to make an apple to apples comparison, but for the most part it was a let down for me. Sicilian also looked good, but did not get a chance to try that one.

An old man riding on the bus with us told us we had to find Tony's and get some pizza while we were in San Fran. I owe this man everything. Honestly the best pizza I have ever had. We popped in for lunch and the two of us devoured two whole pizzas! We left and explored for several hours and when dinner time came we couldn't get Tony's out of our minds! We got seated at one of the bars in front of an oven and ordered two more pizzas we were interested in. The guy running the oven gave us his recommendations, we took them, they were even better than the first two pizzas! I went to the ladies room and stopped to look at all the pictures in the hall...thought the guy in all of them looked familiar.. turns out Tony had been serving and chatting with us! This was my favorite eating experience in San Fran. To top it all off, Tony insisted he send us home with some *free* Tiramisu! We missed the ferry back to Vallejo but  neither of us minded. I look forward to eventually trying every single pizza on the menu. This will be a must see every time I visit San Francisco.

Really good pizza. My wife was a fan of the fresh anchovies on the salad - a nice touch. Thin and crispy two times pizza was delicious. We had a forty five minute wait but spent the time trying wine at the bar. Good food, very hot inside with the ovens but a great evening of good food. Service was okay, there were some regulars that were given more attention.

As a North Beach local, I'm sorry to say that Tony's somewhat disappoints. Their menu is varied and interesting and the pizzas are usually ok (except for today's cremated margherita), but they never dazzle. if you're looking for the best pizza in town, there are many better options.  I'd recommend Delfina, regazza and de la rosa for wow pizzas.

Pizza used to be a quick fix-it dinner - cheap, affordable, able to feed lots of mouths. I don't think that's what the customers at Tony's Pizza have in mind when they're willing to wait 1.5 hours for some pizza. Even at 10PM on a Sunday, my boyfriend and I had to wait a while to get a table. Crazy! Since this was our first time, we decided to stick to a fairly familiar pizza - The New Yorker. Its toppings include sausage, garlic, mozzarella, tomatoes, and ricotta cheese. If you like ricotta cheese, I would suggest this pizza. Personally, I'm not too crazy about it because it's very rich and creamy. Overall, a pretty good pizza though! Very flavorful and the crust was thin, just how I like it. However, the service was a bit of a turn-off. Our waiter was very awkward and was very honest about how he couldn't wait to get off work. Thanks for making me feel like I'm keeping you, pal! I'd come back to try a different pizza but might want to do to-go instead of waiting around for 1.5 hours.

I am always on hunt for good pizza, especially on the West Coast.  I am a major fan of thin crust NY style pizza.  I saw on Food Network's Crave that they ate pizza from Tony's, so I looked it up.  Any place that offers different styles of pizza based on the temperature of the oven has to be legit. Took the family on a Saturday at 1pm, the place was soooo crowded, but we did get a table after the 20 minute wait.  We ordered the NY Pizza and Margherita.  It was NYC amazing!  The crust of the Margherita was texturally very different, thin and delish.  The best part was that it takes them like 90 seconds to cook the pizza, so the pizza hit the table immediately.  Oh, we had the Caesar salad.  You could tell that was fresh  as well.   If I lived within walking distance, I would eat at Tony's 5 days out of 7!  The next real challenge is figuring out which pie I like best.

I have to give it up to Tony's Pizza Napoletana for making the best Pizza in SF that I have tried thus far. I've heard good things from friends, and finally had the opportunity to make my own judgement. I came here on a Saturday night around 9:30pm...which is probably one of the worst times to come, as it was PACKED like CRAZY! Despite the place being packed and on the louder side, my mom, girlfriend, and myself were all determined to try their pizza. I did not mind waiting 45 minutes, because I was enjoying a nice cold Duvel Green beer and watching the football game that was going on. When we finally seated, we already knew what we wanted and ordered quick (as we were STARVING!). We ordered their New Yorker (Coal Fire) Pizza as well as their Cal Italia (Classic Italian) Pizza. We also decided to go with their Stromboli. All of which was delicious, with some better than others. The New Yorker was "WOW, THIS IS GOOD!!!" type of pizza. The sauce they used had a nice sweet tomato flavor that tasted good with every bite. The sausage they used was not overpowering but had a good flavor that made the pizza even better. Out of all the ingredients they used, the ricotta cheese was THE BEST. Their ricotta cheese is out of this world yummy. It is SUPER CREAMY, and melts in your mouth...I could eat a bowl full of this and be happy. Way better than any store bought brand. The Cal Italia won a bunch of awards on food network, and looked interesting to try, so we order it. It had an interesting flavor that is not your typical pizza, which was awesome! Sometimes it's good to step outside your comfort zone. The only criticism I have about this pizza is the crust...not that it's bad or has no taste, but it was not as good as the Coal Fire crust...maybe it's a personal preference kind of thing. The Stromboli was something that caught my mom's and my eye. The reason being, my mom has been making delicious stromboli for years, and this is the first time we saw this on a menu. So we decided to order it and compare. After tasting it, I realized right away that this was not as good as my mom's version, but it was still good. As a matter of fact, the bread, and the sweet red peppers they used is really good. My mom will be adding this to her own stromboli recipe (Thank's Tony's!) Finally, we ordered their Gelati (which is Gelato...but maybe they are trying to be fancy and call it Gelati...lol who knows?). We tried their Chocolate Hazelnut, which was good, but I've had better. The amount they give is good size, and they have a nice touch with the 2 pieces of biscotti. ***Review based on Gaspare's, Giorgio's, Pizza Delfina, Tommaso's, Gialina Pizzeria, Golden Boy Pizza, Pizza Inferno, Little Star Pizza, Patxi's Pizza, Pizza Place on Noriega, Mescolanza, Bruno's Pizza, Victor's Pizza IMPROVEMENT: 1) Might be more efficient and make things run a little easier if they just had a wait list where you can sign your name and number. Instead of having to wait to put your name on a wait list...especially if you have an influx of people. I understand you are busy, but having to wait while you seat others and handle phone calls all just to sign your name on a wait list is a bit much.

Wow this place is great. I found this place last weekend with my family. We were down for the North Beach festival and were looking for a place to sit down and enjoy some lunch. While the wait for a table was about 60 minutes they did have 4 seats at the bar available that we took right away. We were not disappointed! We shared antipasto, salad, pizza and the sausage and peppers. Everything was just great and we very much appreciated the service provided by our bartender. We all are planning to go back on a regular basis.

This isn't the place to go to for a casual slice of pepperoni--you come here for fancier pizza. I would stay away from the American style here. It's not bad but I don't think it represents their best. The California style are great. My favorite is the quail egg, white rose potato, and chorizo. My bf's parents were probably concerned about it being too weird but completely changed their minds when they tasted it. The wild robiola is also really good. I love their non-traditional pizzas. They've had a pizza called the Fear and Loathing in the past and hope they still have it. Comes with: slow cooked pulled pork with tamarind, serranos, habaneros, mozzarella, fresh cactus and agave nectar salsa, and queso fresco. This is a little less fine dining and a little more mad genius. It's good. I haven't been to Tony's Slice House next door, but that would be the spot if you can't or don't want to split a whole pizza.

I'm pretty confident that everything here is absolutely delicious based off of ONE visit. Friend and I came here after wondering where the HELL to eat in North Beach because it's like a limitless pit of choices. I had heard that this place was good, so we roughed the "45" minute wait (was actually 30 minutes -- and they call your cell phone when they are ready!) and was seated in a timely fashion. Waiter was super nice and attentive too. FOOD: We ordered the tagliatalle pasta and the margarita pizza which they only make like 75 of per day. BOTH WERE SO DELICIOUS I couldn't get enough. Even the bread and the garlic and olive oil concoction was great. The crust of the pizza has some crack on it I think because it is soo addicting. The pasta was rich but also delicious. Hard to finish between two people but hey. even leftovers the next day did the trick. COMING HERE AGAIN!

This place is pretty damn good.  Strangely enough, I lived in SF for a while now and never been here till a month ago.  The owner of my company decided he felt like he was missing some knowledge when it comes to pizza and decided to fly here from Miami and take a week long pizza making course at Tony's Pizza.  This meant my coworker and I got to join him there for dinner one night.    Not surprisingly, it is pretty packed on a Friday night, but the service was friendly and helpful.  My favorite pizza I tried was the qual eggs, white rose potato and chorizo.  It definitely is not something I would have originally picked out, but I'm glad I was asked to try it.

The pizza was good, but I wouldn't wait in line for hours on end for this. Came here twice in the past 2 weeks to try a variety of the pizza's, instead of basing my judgment on a single pizza. Tried the award winning margherita pizza -- love it, but I wouldn't wait in line for it. Tried the Americano pizza... it was good. And tried one more, from the sicilian style pizza's (i forgot the name) and it was good. The products used on the pizza are top notch, tastes are all so fresh. All the pizza's area smothered in cheese (which I loved, but the BF did not love). Prices are decent, if not a bit pricey for the size of the pizzas. The staff are great, very attentive.

OK, so we were meeting my husband's cousins for dinner, and they were coming all the way from Novato. We decided to meet up in North Beach, but weren't sure where for dinner yet. We went to Washington Park to meet them, and while they were looking for parking, they texted for us to meet them at Tony's. What's funny is this was exactly about 24 hours after we went to Zachary's Pizza for my birthday. I didn't enjoy Zachary's as much as I thought I would though, so I didn't actually mind having pizza again since the boy cousin is a chef and I knew he wouldn't steer us wrong. And he absolutely steered us right. We walked in and were met by them in a few, but put our names on the waiting list in the meantime. There were to be five adults and a baby, and at a 25-minute wait on a seemingly crowded Thursday night, we were pretty happy. We went ahead and had a drink while we waited. I had an Absolut Appletini, and it was delicious. I can many times tell the quality of a place's bartender by ordering one of these. If you can't make a decent appletini, then what can you, you know? Other than the drinks I had (including a couple Shiners later. I know a Texas beer, wha? They had Lone Star too, but I guess I'm not *that* homesick yet.), I can't tell you much about what we ordered, other than that we shared a couple huge pizzas and two different salads. What I can tell you though was both the food and the service were phenomenal. I've never had anything like it. I was just geeking out telling a friend of mine about this place yesterday. See, the way it works is they have several different pizza ovens and stuff so they make all kinds of pizzas. You base your order on what type of crust you like the best -- and if you don't know, listen to your server. Ours was extremely knowledgeable and she seemed to take a real sense of pride in the menu and the quality of the food there, not to mention her work as our guide through it all. I can tell you that one of the pizzas we had was like three pizzas in one. It literally had three different types of toppings and cheeses, and you were supposed to work your way from one end of it to the other, as if starting with an appetizer pizza, then a main course pizza, and ending with a dessert pizza -- Nom Nom! The Verdict: What a meal! I have absolutely zero complaints, and I can be a tough cookie sometimes as you know!

Went here on a Friday evening so we expected a long wait. We were told 1.5 hours but they are nice enough to take down your number so you can get a drink around the corner and not miss your name being called. The wait turned out to be less than an hour almost so that was a pleasant surprise. The menu is a bit daunting with all the styles of pizza but we had to try the classic Margherita and luckily they had 3 left! This cooks the fastest so it was brought out in minutes and was oozy goodness. it was perfect timing, we had just finished our meatball appetizer which was good but not memorable. The margherita is a must and I can't wait to compare it to the ones in Italy when I go in September. The best part of the meal however was Cal Italia pizza which is award winning . We wanted a pizza with prosciutto but with a different taste than the margherita and this was perfect. I only have 1 word for the first bite (and second and third...) : Orgasmic! This is by far the best pizza I have had besides a margherita and I would drive an hour, spend 30 mins finding parking, wait another 1.5 hours in the freezing cold just to taste this again. I am a Pizzerie Delfina lover but this place really makes you rethink your priorities. I am slightly torn but next time I am craving authentic italian style pizza, I just might choose Tony's over Delfina! 4 stars only because the meatballs were not memorable. Would give 4.5/5 if I could!

My friends and I decided on Tony's to carbo load for the SF Marathon. Pizza and pasta, could anything be better for us? We started off with the stromboli, filled with proscuitto, sausage, pepperoni, peppers and cheese. It was okay. The crust-to-filling ratio was good and it arrived piping hot. Given the wide options for pizza styles, we chose the Margherita and the Cal Italia to sample the standard (Margherita) and his award winning entry in a Food Networks challenge (Cal Italia). The Margherita was fresh and very tasty. The crust was thin and slightly chewy. However, I found the pie to contain a lot of moisture on the surface. Although it didn't make the slices soggy, this pizza needs to be eaten immediately or it will become soggy. This is my standard order when I'm trying out a new pizza restaurant. The Cal Italia was absolutely delicious! The mixture of salty asiago, parmigiano and gorgonzola cheeses and prosciutto balanced well with the sweet figs and balsamic vinegar. The crust? It was good. I don't always eat them but in this case, I gobbled them up. Next came the pasta. Spaghetti and meatballs and the tagliatelle. The spaghetti dish was on the saucy side and came with 3 or 4 meatballs, which where tender and moist. The tagliatelle dish contained mushrooms, pancetta, truffle oil and a white cream sauce. That was one rich and heavy dish. However, we couldn't stop eating it as it was so tasty. This dish is best shared. We didn't have to wait for a table as we arrived around 5 pm and a table for our party had just become available. Woo hoo! The staff was super helpful with the menu and very efficient. They know how to keep things moving along with out making it seem like they are rushing you. That takes skill. There was quite a line forming outside soon after we were seated so I can appreciate their need to do this. Portions are generous and ingredients are high quality. Check it out!

I had high expectations walking in, but I was disappointed. First off, SO EXPENSIVE!  I went for lunch.  Two 12-inch pizzas, 1 meatball, and a side salad = $75 for 2 people for lunch.  No drinks, just water.  Add tip and easily $90. Second, LONG WAIT.  When a line is over an hour long, you expect it to be heart swooning.  I think the line is all hype.....people see people streaming out the door....people see amazing yelp reviews, so they go.  Based on my experience, I would not go again. Third, Tony's is famous for the Margherita pizza.  He's a World Pizza Champion and the backside of the menu has a little paragraph about the contest he won.  I was impressed.  But, by the time the pizza had arrived, the suuuuuper thin crust was soggy with oil and cheese grease.  It had only three globs of cheese per slice of pizza and a tiny amount of sauce on each slice.  I ate the whole 12-inch pizza by myself and was still hungry :(  Granted, the non-soggy part (the crust) was good. I will admit the salad was good.  Fresh lettuce, tomato, good balsamic dressing.  And, our waitress was very nice and friendly.

This is my spot for pizza in the Sucka Free. The thing I like about Tonys is the diverse style of pizza they have.  They have thin crust, american, detroit (sqaure deep dish) and many different flavors.\ Last time we ordered the special margherita, its really really good, the dough melts in your mouth, its so thin, but it isnt raw.  Theres just enough sauce, and with each bite you get some cheese and basil, really everything a pizza should be.  They only make 73 a day so make it happen! We also had a spicy sopressata pizza, that had a spicy oil on it, it was damn good!!!!!!   To top it all off a side of meatballs, that came it a bowl of gravy (red sauce) which I used to dip my crust. Damn, writing this makes me want to go to Tonys get some pizza, you should too, now!!!!!

After having tried true Neopolitan pizza in Naples, and after doing some research on restaurants in town (I was visiting from out of town) this place seemed to catch my eye. I went here for lunch and had to things off the menu...the only two things that are made in limited quantity. I had the giant meatball (with burrata) and the Margherita pizza. The meatball, with the burrata, and the tomato sauce was amazing. The pizza was also good. The first difference I noticed between Tony's and the Naples-version was that Tony's pizza had a thicker (puffed) outside crust. In Naples, it's pretty flat. Another difference I noticed was the melted mozzarella didn't have that rubbery look that I saw a lot of in Naples. Could be that they're using a different type of mozzarella. Flavor-wise, Tony's was pretty spot on. I like the fact that this place has many different styles of pizza to choose from since all of the pizzas in Italy are created equally. Kudos to the people complaining about the hostess. She didn't seem too attentive when I asked for a table, but the wait staff was great.

The Romana is the one of the best pizza's I've had. Ever had that problem when you could never decide what pizza toppings to get? The Romana has you covered. It's an enormous pizza split into 4 flavors with 6 slices of each flavor. I had Romana #2 (you can choose from 4 flavors) with 5 people, and we struggled to finish it. At $35 and feeding 5 comfortably, it's a good deal in my book. We also tried the award-winning margherita as an appetizer because we just had to try it. It was excellent. Must-try if you are a "no-bullshit" pizza type of person. I don't have much to comment on service as I went for lunch (right at noon when they opened). I'll probably continue to do so because when we left the lunch line was huge.

So thankful for the recommendation I received for this place. I was told, "Best Pizza in the US". And that is most certainly confirmed! We sat at the bar because the place was packed. The bartender was fantastic and very hospitable. Bread and sauces were served and it was so delicious!  I ordered a Vodka Ginger Ale and the Ginger ale was the best I had ever tasted. The drink was perfect. I then ordered the Margharita pizza, I believe they only make 75? per day. It was so AMAZING! I cannot wait to go back to San Fran and eat at Tony's again! Love the area it was in as well, very nice restaurants and shops.

Went here on a Sunday night date and it did not disappoint.  It is slightly pricey, but well worth it.  Really some of the best pizza in North Beach. We were lucky enough to be seated at the chef's pizza oven, a spot reserved for two at a bar like situation.  Instead of a bartender, you watch the chef's make the pizza from start to finish!  This would be great in case conversation isn't your strong point - dinner and a show if you will. My date and I split a salad and snacked on the bread.  Salad was good, and the bread was great.  There is garlic and oil for dipping - to die for. We ordered a caraf of red wine, not sure which but it was an excellent pairing for the Cal Napolitana pizza.  Get that one, its a thin lil' goodie - exceptional cheese flavors and cooked perfectly.  The waiter recommended two pizzas, but one sufficed.  Highly recommend.

Very underwhelmed by this place. I am getting nauseous just thinking about it. The first thing we ordered was garlic bread. In hindsight, it would have been nice if the waitress told us up front that we were going to be served complimentary bread and a garlic dipping sauce, but oh well, we should have asked, I guess. The garlic bread was sub-par. The bottom was burnt and the seasoning/toppings  were really nothing special, I've had much, much better. I would have expected some kind of red sauce with it as well, but nope. So then we ordered the caprese salad. Tiny portion size, and the dressing was pretty bland. Definitely was not worth the premium. Onto the main course.  My partner thought it would be nice to try something interesting and unique from a place with so many choices (even though I would have gone for something more traditional). We got the "honey pie," which was absolutely horrid. I'm always petrified when I see a menu with so many options - when I see this I think of the Cheescake factory: lots of options but no one thing is good. When this pizza actually came, the crust tasted like cardboard, and on top of it was mainly greasy deep fried onion bits covered in honey. Maybe this combination works for some people, but I couldn't even finish a slice. On the plus side, their staff seemed generally friendly and attentive. Based on the other reviews, it seems as though this place has some good pies on the menu. Our experience was so bad, though, that I doubt we'll go back.

I'm always skeptical of a place that calls itself Generic Name People Associate With Generic Food Type. So a place called Tony's, in North Beach, doing pizza - well, the line outside looked way too long to be worth it. To my pleasant surprise we were actually seated and able to order after only the briefest of waits. When ordering family-style I generally leave the menu closed and let other folks do the choosing. I'm not picky, especially when I'm not paying, and it's decently hard to screw up pizza. The 'rents chose to start with some brussels sprouts & spinach, followed by the Romana II pizza and the Margherita (only 73 (why 73 instead of, say, 75 is a mystery) made per day, according to the menu). The veggies were eminently Italian (surprise! Italian food at a place called Tony's!) in their preparation - simple and garlicky, nothing fancy but naturally delicious. The Romana was pretty damn good, and it was interesting to get a tri-flavor rectangular pizza, but the Margherita was the star. Unfussy, uncomplicated, and incredibly complex. Their tomato sauce is fantastic and their mozzarella is the real deal. I wanted to eat the whole pizza, but that is not appropriate when you're dining with three other people. Unfortunately. The service was also top-notch, our waitress was friendly and extremely capable, juggling all her tables with good-natured aplomb. The only reason I have to give this place four stars - though my review reads like a straight five - is the price. Holy wow is this expensive - you'd think the pizzas were gold-plated, but nope, they're just (admittedly excellent) pizza. I didn't even pay and I was uncomfortable. But for the discriminating pizza eater with too much cash and plenty of time to wait in line, Tony's is a sure bet.

I went on a Wednesday night, around 9:30pm, and had a 20 minute wait. It was probably the perfect time to go, as we were able to get a seat at the bar and try some of the drink specials (good, but a little sweet for my tastes). The food lived up to the hype for me--we ordered the chorizo mussels *YUM*,  spinach salad, large meatball (can't remember which one, but could you really go wrong?), and the New Yorker pizza. Everything was hot, flavorful and not overly salty.  If you can, I recommend going late on a weekday. It was wonderful to take our time for a long, relaxing dinner--I don't think it would be as enjoyable to sit on the patio on a Saturday when you have a line of people staring hungrily at your plates. We're new the neighborhood and are excited to take many people here in the future!

If Tony's delivered, I'd weigh 350 lbs.  I could eat that pizza like it's my job!   If you're ok eating meat, don't miss out on the coal fired New Yorker.  Our food server described it "a little bit of fantastic".  She got it wrong.   It's a whole lot of fantastic.  Ricotta, sausage, peperoni and other yummy ingredients. Tip: if you're on a first-ish date, don't  eat the garlic spread on the bread.  It's potent. Tony's is by far the best pizza I've had.  Ever.

Tough crust, oily pizza.  Their so-called pizza sauce is crushed tomato straight from the can.  They scatter dried herbs on after the fact, which means the herb flavor doesn't bake into the sauce. California, please stop saying you make east coast pizza.  You cannot do it. Just try to get the attention of the hostess.  When my 15-year-old daughter dared say, "Excuse me," to her, the hostess stared at her and did not respond.  Yes, the doodles that you're making are so important, sweetheart. So we went up the street for a take-out.  Where the cashier tried to upsell me.  When we got our boxed pizza, there was cheese smeared on the bottom of the box.  Did I mention that for this attitude and cruddy pizza we paid $20?  And that we were still hungry?

Margherita Pizza was good, meatball was out of this freakin world!  There is a wait, but they are good about calling you and you can go get a drink at one of the surrounding restaurants.  If you don't want to wait they serve pizza by the slice next door which is a nice add on.

Food: i tried the Margherita, you know the traditional stuff from Italy. I never tried a Margherita pizza in the US, thus this is my first in the US. The crust was cooked in a stone oven, but it was maybe a tad too thin towards the center of the pizza. My understanding was that crust is suppose to be slightly crispy due to the fact that its cooked above 800 degrees F. The crust was crispy towards the edge, but since it was too thin near the center, the cheese and oil soften the center. The crust was still good tho, you just have to becareful when you eat. You could taste all the ingredients and nothing was too overwhelming or masked any of the other toppings. But this is a margherita after all.  This is the type of pizza was more of a snack for us fat Americans, but its one of those specialties of Tony's. Atmosphere/Service the wait was ok for this place, about 20mins on a thursday around 6pm. service was speedy. we asked the waitress for recommendations, she explained the differences on the menu but didnt really give us recommendations. Conclusion Cute place. Food was pretty good. I will come back again to try different pizzas. They use different crusts for different pizzas, I will have to try another one next time.

As someone that lives in the area, I've eaten here several times but have gotten tired of their attitude and ambiance, which is the reason I won't be coming back. First the positives: the pizza, especially margherita, is pretty good although not the best and it is a bit on the pricier side. For appetizer, the stir-fried string beans with garlic are great and worth it. The negatives: as others have mentioned, the service can be pretty rude--especially the maitre d' on multiple occasions. Last time when my wife and I went, we asked how long would be and the maitre d' said "Wait" and disappeared for about 15 minutes. During that time, I went to the restroom, at which point the maitre d' returned and told my wife our table was ready. When my wife told him that I was in the restroom, the maitre d' immediately gave our spot to the next people in line. In general, they have an unfriendly condescending attitude perhaps because they are popular and get a lot of business. At one point they were giving out pizza boxes with an Ed Hardy design. We told the waiter we didn't have any left overs and didn't need a box, at which point he insisted that we could still take it since it is free (never minding the wasted garbage). Although the food is decent, the service and ambiance has convinced me to not come back.

GREAT PIZZA. This is a spot not to be missed if you live in San Francisco, great view of the square when you walk out, great neighborhood for a stroll if you have visitors in town. margarita pizza is truly as good as they say - it won the pizza contest in Naples people!  Only 73 served a day so put your order in when you get there, unlikely you will get one on a Saturday night.  We also ordered the brussel sprouts last night that were great, simple balsamic and lemon, don't try to do too much which is good.  And my other favorite pizza, the cal italia - fig oil, prosciutto, caramelized onions...melt in your mouth. Been here a couple times and never let down, friendly service, cute pizza joint atmosphere.

Picked up a large pan of the New Yorker.  Had really high expectations due to the amazing yelp reviews, but alas disappointment.  The pizza dough was burnt and left a bitter after taste in the mouth.  The pizza sauce and cheese was not spread out evenly so you end up getting dollops of sauce in a bite.  Ughhh!  Maybe it was made in a hurry???

3 for 3! Waited to try three different pizze before reviewing.  Easy as pie! Great, great, and ... great!  Makes reviewing so easy.  Just choose the type of crust and then find one with appealing toppings, order, and Manga Bene!  We tried the New Yorker (mouth-filling flavors and superb ricotta cheese really tops this one off!), the Romana II (rectangular, three pizzas in one... we picked II because one of the three sports that incredible ricotta), and the signature Margherita.  The Margherita - you should close your eyes and savor the wonderful interplay of flavors - simple and complicated at the same time. Also enjoyed sides of spinach and brussels - Tony's honors the vegetables, not just the pizza.  Traditional, deft preparation.  And unexpected bonus is how comfortable Tony's service makes you feel, especially considering how insanely busy they can be.  Really top-notch service.   How can it be better?  Bravo!  High Five!

Love this place!!! I've been here twice, and I wish I could eat here every night. Alas, I live in the East Bay, so it's just a weekend destination. Easy to walk to from BART, though. So far I've had the Cal Italia twice and the (limited edition?) margherita once. Both are  definitely recommended. The prices are arguably steep, but I think well worth it for the amazing uniqueness and quality. There was a short wait the first time I went on a weekend for lunch. Very cool that they took our phone number and called us when a seat was ready. Second time there was no wait, though it filled up while we were there. Seating is a bit crowded, but it just adds to the pizza joint atmosphere. Service was impressive -- definitely a step above your average pizza joint. Will definitely be back. The tough part will be deciding whether to try something new or to have the same pizzas again.

I was already planning my next trip back to Tony's as soon as I bit into the Porcini pizza. It was absolute pizza heaven! Practically everything my party of 5 ordered was good to great! We ordered Porcini, Margherita, New Yorker pizzas, lasagna, and a side of  meatballs. My faves were the meatballs, Porcini pizza, the sausage on the NY pizza, Moscow Mule cocktail, and their capuccino (strong!). The ambiance was great and so was our service!

Wow! I would consider Tony's as a factor in moving to San Francisco. I am a lifetime Brooklynite who has had Celiac disease for a few years and thus, has had a lot less pizza recently than I'd like.  Most places that serve Gluten Free pizza do a miserable job of it and act like they're doing you a favor. Not so here!  Tony's pizza was amazing.  My wife found it on-line when she was looking for Gluten Free restaurants in preparation for a recent trip to SF.  We both fell in love with Tony's so much that we went back the next day for our last meal in SF before we flew back. What makes a good meal?  Let's break it down. Taste: the crust was great - it was firm and unlike many non-wheat doughs, it did not fall apart or stay "wet." Tony's obviously put a lot more care into their GF crust than others do and the quality was the equal of their regular pizza.  The cheese was good, the mozzarella was fresh and the ricotta was just slightly sweet.  All of the sauce and herbs were fresh. A special shout out for the appetizer: deep fried String Beans - it's hard to believe that String Beans could be comfort food but they were. Unique and delicious. Looks: The pizza is - well - beautiful. My wife's pizza looked like a Van Gogh.  There is something to be said for a meal's appearance; while it *has* to taste good, when you pay a bit for a meal, it does help that it looks good as well. And the last important factor: the service was exemplary:  Here's an example:  One of the menu items had 2 ingredients that my wife is allergic to.  We only noticed one of them and asked our waitress; Rose, who we had already decided was fantastic; if we could have it substituted.  Rose spoke to the chef and found a good alternative which we ordered.  Only when it arrived, we noticed the second allergen and asked if we could have one without that, and told her [Rose] that we'd of course, pay for both as it was clearly our fault.  She went and ordered the new dish and then took it to her manager and arranged that we only pay for one. So... one a scale of 10, this one goes to 11! The only caveat I will offer is: get there when they open or be prepared to wait for a table.  They don't take reservations but they're worth the wait!

The pizza here is so good I was dreaming about it the night I came home from the restaurant. You have not tried pizza until you've tried Tony's. We got here at 10:30 right before closing on a Saturday night and were seated within 5 minutes (guess I got lucky!). Sitting at the bar in front of the 900 degree wood burning oven (which cooks a pizza in 90 seconds flat!!) I could not help but be excited. We ordered the New Yorker, which is cooked in a 1000 degree coal oven. Snacking on fresh bread and delicious olive oils, taking in the atmosphere, watching pizza dough being pulled by hand, it was all a great experience....but the pizza was to die for!   Everything was so fresh and delicious and the flavors were perfect. The service was fast, our waitress and the host were nice, the atmosphere is not pretentious, + for the custom drinks and house beer. Most definitely 5 stars and a must try!

Definitely just as awesome as I remember! We tried the coal fired pizza and the crust seemed a little crispier, but other than that, there wasn't an obvious difference between the coal and the wood fired pizza. I wish I would have ordered one of each to compare. The Caesar salad was pretty large; easily big enough for two to split. Three of us shared and it was enough. Wine list is pricey - plan on spending $40 for the least expensive bottle. We had an hour wait both nights but walked a few doors down to a bar and had some wine while we waited and the hostess called us when our table became available. The outdoor seating is heated, but it was still chilly. Tony, please open a location in Vegas!!!! Pretty please!!

I am pleased to write a great review for this place. After living in Naples for 3 years, I've become very snobbish about "neapolitan" pizza. The pizza Margherita is authentic and yummy.  The place is beautifully decorated with Italian ceramics.mthe hottest and waitstaff are pleasant. My only reason for not giving a five star is the wine list. I think that a place that has Napolitana in its name should feature the great wines of Campania. You might say that folks don't know these wines....but I'd say that your average Joe only knows Chianti, Brunello and maybe super Tuscans...so why not introduce them to wines around Naples...maybe even have a "wines of Campania" wine tasting. I would have like to have seen on the wine list: Reds: a taurazi, maybe a Ischia Rossi.... Whites: falanghina, lacrima christi del vesuvius, Greco di tufo, fiano di avellino Worth a visit :)

I am not a huge pizza person nor do I eagerly search out italian dinners. However, this may have been the best pizza I have ever had.  A perfect place for friends or family to get together over a great slice or two, or in my case a bunch. Great service, friendly staff, and just unbelievable food. We had the half-half Calamari and the New Yorker. The food was so good it prompted me to write my first Yelp review. Easy 5 stars.

Really wanted to eat here but wait on a Friday night was 2 hrs and 15 min so grabbed a slice at their place next door.  They don't take reservations.  :(  Suggest you get there early, put your name down, then go for cocktails somewhere nearby while you wait.

Roaming around Northbeach, you will notice that there are quite a lot of pizza places.. That's because you're in little Italy, Duhh! But Tony's is different... It's like when you were a kid, and action figures were cool and all.. But nothing compared to your Ninja turtles! That is what Tony's Pizza Napoletana is, Tony's is that judo chopping Michaelangelo that always beat up all your other action figures! This place is just awesome, it's real laid back, the food is amazing and the people are super chill! I came here the other day and had their New Yorker, which is a rustic style pizza (coal fired oven cooked, i believe). I would say go here and come back often!

Yummy Yummy Yummy! I've ordered take out as well as dined here for dinner Pros: - Great pizza! The burata is absolutely delicious. Be warned! This serves 3-4 people and you will have A LOT of leftovers if you come here with just one other person! - The thin crust was good - unfortunately adding toppings you like makes this pizza really expensive. Their pre-made (veggie) ones look kinda boring, so you gotta pay if you want your pizza to taste great! - Nice ambiance for dinner Cons: - Maitre d' was kinda rude when we first went. It was a 2 hour wait for a table. We got lucky and got a table in 10 minutes, dont know how! - Dinner (esp if you order drinks too) ends up being a little pricey! But food quality was worth it I guess?

Went on a mission to try Tony's much lauded margherita pie.  Though the service was fantastic and the pizza came out quickly (even sooner than the complimentary bread), the pizza was lackluster.  Yes, you could taste the freshness of the ingredients, but the crust was so soggy from the moisture of the toppings, it just couldn't hold up, not even long enough to be lifted off the pan.  After having had a stellar margherita from Apizza Scholls in Portland, the only part of the experience Tony's helped to replicate was the wait.  Sad panda.

Words do not do Tony's justice (well, at least not my words).  We got there right as they opened, at noon.  So, seating wasn't a problem, but the place filled up quick!  I love how they have the menu divided by temperature at which the pies are cooked and the type of oven used.  Awesome!  We went straight for the 1,000 degree coal-fire option and, thanks to the other great Yelp reviews, the New Yorker.  It really is that good.  And, then some.  I spied on other pies and salads around us; all looked great.  But, I'm sorry, why would you come to a classic pizza place like this and get some frou-frou pizza that you squeeze a fresh orange on??  Huh.  Well, to each their own.  But if you are serious about pie, just get the Margerita or the New Yorker and bliss out on the best darn pizza you will probably ever eat.  What makes it so good?  The ingredients are all excellent, but I have to go with the crust.  It has the perfect amount of give and crunch.  The pie all together - bubbling brown mozz, luscious dollops of ricotta, savory meats and a slightly spicy sauce of crushed tomatoes, all hanging out on the most beautiful crust I have ever seen or tasted - it's truly "whohoo! as good as it gets".  Oh, and they serve really great bread in these cute little old-school tomato cans with garlic in honey, olive oil and some minced sweet peppers.  But don't fill up on it 'cause you have to leave room for the pie!

Some of the best pizza in SF? Some of the best pizza in the world, including Naples. I'm a thin-crust kind of gal, so I was predisposed to like this place. Both times (both for dinner), we had the New Yorker, with pepperoni, ricotta, fennel sausage and garlic. Not-bad wine list, but anything would be overshadowed with pizza this good. Second place goes to that delicious not-so vanilla vanilla gelato, with an honorable mention for the meatball appetizer. I work really near here and would love to come back for lunch (and dinner) again and again. Fiver all the way.

I found this place with my family when we were walking around the city and decided around 2 or 3pm that we were hungry. This place was open and we just happened to pick it. The pizza was incredible. They had so many styles of pizza (and a variety of ovens to get them right) and did them well with fresh ingredients. We've been back several times and while the wait can be up to 1hr 45minutes, it's worth it to do so. We recently even ventured out beyond their pizza menu to their other dishes. Usually a restaurant can do one thing really well and not so well other things. This is yet another area where Tony's shines. Their burrata burger and their penne vodka are fantastic and I'm so glad we tried them.

This is the best pizza in San Francisco and most everywhere. Expert flavor combos, ever changing menu with the old standbys listed, I have run through all the different ovens, dough and most combos that didn't have meat. Although Tony's makes me wish I did eat the stuff. My favorites are anything truffle, the classic tomato with cheese and WAIT!!!! Detroit has a pizza style?!? Yup the Redtop, and holy hell, that pizza will end your day. You have to have one once and share it with plenty of people. I have had several. I am lucky enough to work down the street and it's a payday go to. I wish I had more stars to give but I am sure all my food money will suffice.

I didn't know pizza could taste and feel so light. Well, not untill I set foot into Tony's at least. The award wining Margarita pizza with it's super thin crust absolutely fits for any meal of the day. Yes, even for breakfast. The crust and dough were so thin, you could almost see through it from the bottom. The (can not be any fresher) mozzarella cheese, tomato, basil and not to forget the light and aromatic red sauce all added up to to a truly unforgettable experience. I finally realized what it really meant when people say, "Real Italian is far from being heavy, but it is simple and delicious." The meat ball (limited amount is served each day) was super big and that itself could be a meal. It was amazing. So, go people because it will change your (American) idea of Italian just like it did mine.

This review is for take-out specifically. With all the descriptions of the ethereal just-out-of-the-blistering-hot-oven margherita I was surprised they even offer take-out but they do, from a storefront next door to the main restaurant. You can avoid the long wait for seating, get a slice to go (they have several pies cut-up for immediate gratification though not the margherita) and go eat it on the grass in front of the cathedral. In my case, I was staying nearby and ordered 2 margheritas and a New Yorker and an order of meatballs for 7 pm pickup, walked in the door at the stroke of 7, had it on the table 10 minutes later... and it was cold. The margheritas I would judge had been sitting out for at least half an hour; the New Yorker was hotter and overall I liked it a lot better with a nice char to the crust. Meatballs were lukewarm but good with intense marinara sauce. Maybe the temperature affected my perspective but I didn't find the margheritas special at all... decent small pizzas with a good chew to the crust but hardly worth the excitement or the $19 price tag. I'd go back for the New Yorker or a slice, but wouldn't wait or go out of my way to do so.

Since my boyfriend gave up wheat flour and meat for lent, he really wanted to try the gluten-free pizza from Tony's.  Wow.  His pizza did not taste "gluten free" and it was absolutely delicious.  Everyone around us was ogling his pizza too, even though they had the mussels with chorizo (which we really want to try next time) and other yummy looking things.  My pizza was plain-ole thin crust pepperoni and cheese and it was incredible too.  I would go back there just for that.   Tony's fills up really fast after it opens at 12pm (this was a Saturday) so I would recommend getting there asap.  Just after we sat down at the bar the hostess was telling people it would be a 40 minute wait.

Great Pizza! I came here with my brother for his birthday. We had the Margarita Pizza. The size was pretty good because we had left overs when we were finished. From where we sat, we saw pizza coming out of the brick fire oven. The crust was thin and flavorful. We also ordered the Romano's Original Stomboli, it was recommended by our waitress. It was a good recommendation. It was cheesy and full of flavor. If you are in the area of North Beach and craving some good pizza, give this place a try!

I personally thought this place lived up to the hype. The margarita pizza was really good. A regular recommended getting the pizza crispy. I think it would have made the pizza even better.  The bar staff was really friendly and knowledgeable. I got there right when it opened as I was leaving there was about a 45 min wait. So go early.

The first time I came here was amazing - pizza was perfect, service was really friendly, and the whole experience was great.   The second time was less enchanting but still solid.  The pizza was still great and we got in there early enough to get one of the limited-number/prize-winning margherita, which was delicious.  My personal favorite was the sicilian with lil cherry tomatoes, and a drizzle of balsamic - so so so good.  Less impressive was a primavera option - the piave seemed out of place and the tomatoes were sort of hard and chewy. The biggest concern I had, on the second visit, was with the hostess.  She was just really hostile and cranky.  We were waiting on the 4th member of our party - and we weren't demanding to be seated or anything (we understood the policy of needing to have everyone there to be seated), so I don't know what the attitude was all about.  But she was straight rude, totally unnecessarily.  I understand it's hard to deal with lots of waiting parties at a popular restaurant, but plenty of hosts/hostesses handle it with grace.  The crowds aren't getting any smaller, homegirl, so you might need to check the crankiness.

Hands down one of the best pizzas I've ever had. Their wood fire oven provides a taste that simply can't be duplicated at your normal pizza joint. Their signature is the Margarita.  The dough is always cooked perfectly with just a little bit of chewiness.  All the ingredients taste very fresh.  A simple dish, but the perfect balance of flavors. The Cal Italia is our next favorite.  It's topped with fig jam, prosciutto, mozzarella, parmesan, and drizzled with balsamic.

We came here on a double date. Started out at the bar with a bottle of fantastic sauvignon blanc and the burrata boat (warm pesto, topped with a sweet sun dried tomato relish, fresh basil, procuitto wrapped baguettes). I didn't try the appetizer, but from the sounds that my dinner companions made, it was safe to say that they found it delicious. After a 15, 20 minute wait, the waitress showed us to our table. The table decided on the Margherita and Cal Italia pizzas (both award winners, whatever that means) and the Swiss chard to start. The Swiss chard was a warm salad (sauteed dirty girl farms swiss chard, Iacopi farm white gigante beans, pork chorizo) and packed quite the punch from the chorizo. Our table loved it, even the ones that aren't fans of the green stuff. Definitely something that I want to recreate at home. I highly recommend it. The Margherita (dough mixed by hand using san felice flour then proofed in neapolitan wood boxes, san marzano tomatoes dop, sea salt, mozzarella fior di latte, fresh basil, extra virgin olive oil ) is what Tony's is known for. They only make 73 per day. Thankfully, we didn't have to push any old ladies down the stairs to get our mitts on one. Maybe it was the high expectations, but it was rather anticlimatic. The crust was a bit soggy from the sauce and droopy. The ingredients all tasted fresh but I just didn't get all the fuss was about. The Cal Italia (asiago,  mozzarella, imported italian gorgonzola, sweet fig preserve from Croatia, prosciutto di parma, parmigiano, balsamic), now that was up there with the best pizza that I've ever had (Cheeseboard at Berkeley is still #1 though). The dough was crispy on the bottom and chewy on the sides. The proscuitto wasn't dry or burnt and simply melted in my mouth. The kicker though, was the fig preserve and balsamic drizzle (my nizzle). That sweet and savory punch was so creative and totally did it for me. Everyone at the table were blown away. Tony's definitely take pizza making seriously. The pies are categorized by the type of ovens they're baked in and one can tell the attention to detail in the food. I will definitely be back to try the others on the menu.

This was some of the BEST pizza I have ever had!!!  I was a little skeptical since it kinda sounded like a tourist place, but the pizza was truly top notch.  Real thin crust, great sauce and toppings.  It is also reasonably priced for SF.  Coming from Dallas, this pizza was truly awesome.   They had a bunch of different options and ways to cook the pizza.  A little overwhelming, but the waiter was very helpful.   I loved the location as well.  Nob Hill was our favorite area in SF.  We sat outside and just people watched while we ate.  Great time.  Go if you are in the area.

This review is for TONY'S A GO GO, a couple of doors down.... Walking into North Beach, we are at Stockton and Union, AKA Gemignani Corner. Tony Gemignani is a LEGEND in the pizza world. A former competitor and Team Captain for Team USA at the World Pizza Championships in Italy, Tony is a 9-time World Champion, and is soooo badass, that the Italians had asked him to stop competing. They were tired of getting their asses whooped in their own home turf! He still goes to the World Pizza Championships, but this time as a judge. Its cool to see that he set up shop in North Beach, not only to share his award winning pizzas, but also to share his knowledge at his pizza school. Tony's restaurant had a pretty long wait, so we got a couple of slices to go. We even caught a glimpse of Tony himself giving a tour of his operation . The crust was a perfect combination of crunchy and chewy, just the right amounts of tomato sauce and cheese You can taste and see the quality of ingredients used in making all of his pizzas. I so wish he would set up shop in Las Vegas......ALOHA!!!

There is nothing I can say that others haven't already said. I live in the neighborhood and so I get Tony's a lot. I've also had real Napolese pizza in the old country, and Tony's is definitely up to par. He went over there and beat them on their own turf. 'Nuff said? Still, and I'm grovelling on my knees here il mio amico Antonio, either bring the takeout slice house up to snuff or close it down. You are taking your well-deserved reputation and pissing on it. The pizza from the slice house is old, usually lukewarm, and often outright disgusting. Totally another world from what you get in the restaurant next door. Why are you doing this. Are you nuts? Do you hate yourself because mommy didn't nurse you long enough and you secretly desire to be punished? You know how bad it's gotten? Last week me and my better half skipped the line at Tony's and went to Bao Necci. That's right, paisan: we stepped out on you. Their pizza is almost as good, we had left overs, and my better half got to ogle a hot Italian man roughly comparable to your cook with the pompadour. We might take you back, we might not. You gotta earn our hearts back. And either get a new mait're d or get the one you have some medication. Life is not a sitcom, I am not a neurotic Jew who eats cereal, and his rudeness shtick is really kinda getting old. Sorry to sound critical. It's always about love.

Presidents Day 2011 Review Marathon:  Memories on this nervous, cold and rainy night in North Beach; I'm chasing ghosts.  While my current sojourns into the city have been limited to the J-Town, Sunset, Golden Gate Park and the SoMa areas, this was my first trip into the North Beach area proper, an area I spent many a day and night walking your streets.  Some things stay the same, but most things change, and North Beach is no exception.  I hardly recognize this city from fading memories. The church under construction, and DiMaggio's gone, it's a bit less the North Beach I walked so many times.  Came with some colleagues, this place was highly recommended, and had a wait to go along with it, although I'm no stranger to dining in the city, a wait is expected, even factored in.  After the wait, we finally had a table and it took a bit of time to work through the menu, prolific I must say all of the appetizers, the meatballs and the calamari were on point, absolute bulls-eyes. The beer they had on tap, although I can't recall its name, was actually pretty good, a must try.  The pizza however, the coal-fired "New Yorker", was somewhat of a miss for me, I thought it a tad bit too garlic-laden, although I did try a slice of one of the oven-fired pizzas we also ordered, and that was a winner.  I'm certain I will be back again, must remember to try the wood-fired pizzas.  "There's an empty space inside my heart, and now it won't take root, and now I set you free, I set you free."

When Tony opened up the walk-in place next door - we gave it a try.  We had the wet beef sandwich w/ pepper, the calzone, the Itaian ice and the chocolate egg drink - all were blah and extremely disappointing.   Why the 4 stars then you wonder?  Well, I wanted to give them one more shot and they totally redeemed themselves.   We got a slice of the cheese pizza ($3.75) - thin crust, crispy and cheese pulling - delicious.  We also picked up a bunch of deli meat - all sliced to order so please be patient!  When I asked about the price, I was told it depends on how much we order.  What we ended up with half pound each: prosciutto parma - $9 sopressata - $4.50 mortadella - $3.50 toscano salami - $4.50 aged provolone - $3.75 We will definitely return for the meat and likely the pizza too.

I really enjoyed my ultra thin crust pizza. Had to muddle through the menu but with the assistance of our server (at the bar) selected a pizza that was perfection. The tomato pie with cheese baked over coals at 1000degrees. Really! Started with the green bean appetizers (yum-mo) and a cocktail with agave nectar instead of simple sugar. Perfection! Then, a cracker thin, crunchy crust with savory tomato sauce and fresh buffalo cheese. Just the right amount of herbs with a few drops of rich olive oil. Awwwwww delicious! Lucky me---- a salad of my dreams. Chicory with anchovy- lemon dressing topped with white anchovies. Large servings, enough to bring home for another meal. Unless my sons devour it first. Next time - same salad, try a different cocktail and sample the 900 degree wood fire Napoletana cheese pizza. Hub had to have his deep dish pizza (his addiction) which per his review "missed the mark" . He is loyal to Chicago style deep dish. Almost forgot to mention the service. We sat at the bar and were professionally attended by the bar team. They were attentive, able to multitask. Our primary server, a lovely young blond woman seemed to be able to move at lightening speed while maintaining a calm friendly composed appearance. How did she do that?

Lunched here on Saturday 3/12. The food we ordered: * Margherita ($19) 4.5 stars. Pretty much perfect. Needs to be eaten immediately after it's brought to the table, don't let it cool down. * Cal Italia: ($18) No rating. This was a mis-order from my part. We were here for brunch and I wasn't in the mood for a pizza with strong cheeses such as gorgonzola and parmigiano. So I am not rating it. I'll just say that I didn't really enjoy it but I thought it was well executed. Washed down with: * A Duvel belgium ale ($8). Nice but not worth the 8 bucks. * A mexican coke ($3 for a 1/2 liter, a bargain). Tastes much better than the american version.

If your in SF, stop by and get the meatballs as an app.  Follow it up with any pie but get there early because they only make a certain amount per day.

After taking Barbie to the Giants game for Mother's Day to see the black and orange beat Colorado one more time we ventured over to North Beach for pizza. We had two salads, their famous award winning Margarita Pizza, and deep friend string beans. As good as ever. Disappointed they were out of mussels this day.

I thought I wasn't a fan of pizza, NOT ANYMORE! One summer, my dad took my brother and I to Costco multiple times a week, this meant Costco pizza = all I ate. I felt like I had eaten enough pizza to last me the rest of my life. When my friends go eat pizza, I just sit and drink soda. BUT NOT ANYMORE! I was pretty hungry when we were walking by, so we decided to stop by for a snack! The sit down restaurant was crazy packed, so we went next-door to the to-go place where we could buy by the slice. I honestly thought they were two different restaurants at first! I ordered a slice of pepperoni to share, as well as their special chocolate egg drink (forgot the name!). They had excellent service, I was a tad confused when I didn't get my slice right away (like most places), but then I realized they were actually re-heating the slices in their oven! The pieces came out hot and DELICIOUS! As for the drink, I'm pretty sure it's an acquired taste. Not as sweet as I expected, I'd definitely want to try to Italian Ice on my next visit. I was kind of sad when I finished my half, definitely getting my own slice next time! :)

Holy Moly. I went here about 6 months ago and told Stacey T we had to go when we both were in town. It was better than I remembered!! Sure its super crowded and they do not take reservations. -But they take your cell # and will call you when your table is just about ready. I love meatballs, just like anyone else, but I had NO IDEA meatballs could taste so good! They are easily overlooked on the menu, but soooo worth getting. Their signature margherita is the best pizza I have ever had. ...and I have had alot of good pizzas.

The pizza may be good but the staff and manager are rude, crude and do not belong in the restaurant business in San Francisco.  Would never recommend anyone to stand in line for hours to eat at this joint.  Too many other places in the city that treat customers with respect that I prefer to spend my money at.  Staff can't handle business volume.  Too stressed which results in rude treatment to customers.

For the record, I'm not really big on that movie, "Eat Pray Love." However, there's a scene where they take the train to Naples to have the BEST pizza in Italy. It's a simple margherita pizza. For some reason, I always remember that scene. Well, on my mad hunt to find something comparable to that pizza, I stumbled upon this place. OMG. THANK YOU fellow yelpers! The margherita pizza is EXACTLY what I imagine the pizza in the film to be like. Mind you, I'm not that big on pizza at all. However, if I had to splurge, this would be the place to go to. The flavors were simple: an incredible tomato sauce, fresh toppings, and a melt-in-your-mouth crust. Even my partner fell in love. That's HUGE considering he's all about his meaty Chicago-style pizza. Since I've been there, I've been raving about this place to all my friends. I'm sure we'll make a big group visit soon! Speaking of which... be prepared to wait a bit. I went there for an early dinner on a Saturday and had to wait about 40 minutes. I'm assuming the wait is worse if the party is larger. Yes. It's definitely worth the wait!

Among the best pizza in San Francisco. Long waits and no reservations, but plenty of places to get a drink in the neighborhood while you wait. It was so good, I don't know what else to say. I call it top 5 in my life, with two of the other top 5's being pizzas I had in Naples, Italy.

I've been here twice. The first time was with less than bearable company (I'll spare the story), the second was when my friend wanted me to share my experience of San Franciscan pizza. First time I came, 90 minute wait (~8pm on a Saturday). Second time, immediate seating (2:30pm on a Sunday). The bread comes with olive oil dip, something they also do in France! There are three little squares to pick from: plain olive oil, red pepper, and garlic. I really like the red pepper.. Mmm.. No focaccia the first time, but yay on the second. The table next to us was never ever served bread.. Lawl. I was rather surprised by the number of kids that asked, "Do you card?" and the others, who ordered alcoholic beverages on a whim only to get carded.. That could have been why they didn't get the complimentary bread, hehe. Onto the pizza. First time, we got the Truffle pizza and saved $13 by opting for the truffle oil instead. We also got another pizza, but I can't seem to remember what it was called. The Truffle pizza was good, but I didn't like the other. The person I was with didn't like the other pizza either, so we ended up throwing the whole thing out. My heart broke when the waitress came to ask if we wanted to box it (only 1.5 slices were eaten), as it was she who recommended the pizza to us. She ended up taking the uneaten pizza off the tab, cool beans. The second time, we got the Truffle pizza, Margherita, and the Calamari Fritti (half traditional, half calabrese). The wait was forever this time, but we had the outdoor heater to keep us warm. The Truffle pizza tasted much better with the truffles. Without them, it was like eating greasy Goldfish-flavored pizza (which is good, but doesn't compare). The Margherita was good until it got cold. The sauce tasted a bit like mangoes, so yummy (: My friend loved the Truffle, hated the Margherita. I enjoyed both. Calamari Fritti=$11 Margherita=$19 Truffle pizza=$39 O_O!!! Pizza crust is a bit on the burnt side, which I love but is not good for my health. The calamari was soooooooo delicious. It's a huge portion for an appetizer, and the sauce was wayyy too amazing! I'm not usually a big fan of sauce/condiments that aren't ketchup, so you must try this! Though Tony's Pizza Napoletana has a more extensive menu, my heart is with Pizzeria Delfina (at least, for the Margherita). Sowwie.

The pizza here is good as Italian pizza gets here in America. By Italian, I mean very thin crust pizza with tomato sauce made from fresh tomatoes like the ones in Italy - not NY style, and not Chicago style either. This is the way pizza was created by the Italians and the way they meant for it to be. You wouldn't want a burger Chinese style would you? Maybe you do, but for those of us seeking the real thing, better look to its origins for a more authentic experience. But of course, freedom of choice is what makes for any delightful experience and should you want pizza in NY or Chicago style, they do those supremely well, as well.

The restaurant pizza is phenomenal. The by-the-slice place is 100% legit NY slice pizza. But $3.75 a slice? C'mon. That's NY prices in 2017. Whatever - it's great but I'll probably still opt for Golden Boy as far as deliciousness per penny is concerned.

Amazing! We sat at the pizza bar where you can watch them make the pizzas in the wood fire oven. Our server was great and the service in general was great, they filled our waters promptly and delivered food quickly, its worth the hour wait for dinner. We had the meatballs, which were amazing, we also had the deep fried string beans, which I couldn't get enough of. The burrata appetizer was a little hard to eat but it was tasty. We also ordered a wood fire Margherita pizza with the award winning crust and it was one of the best pizza's I've ever eaten. They also had the best focaccia bread I've ever had to dip in olive oil and we also used it for our burrata. We ordered too much food for the two of us, I would order everything again but maybe skip the burrata appetizer, it was good but too heavy to go along with everything else. I left stuffed and happy!

I learned of Tony's over a year ago, but was not able to get over to North Beach on my recent trips to SF. So on my most recent trip, it became a priority. Wow, were we disappointed. First, the service was terrible. We sat outside, and were clearly forgotten about. There were others outside and their servers seemed attentive, but ours was terrible. For starters, our pizza came BEFORE our wine! WTF? The servers for the other tables were not terribly interested in helping us out. Secondly, the food was a bit disappointing. The pizza margherita (the standard by which all authentic pizzerias should be judged) was good, but it came cut!!! Nothing ruins a perfect pizza crust faster than cutting it so that the tomato sauce can quickly make it soggy. Like I said, the pizza was good, probably on par with Settobello a very good, authentic VPN pizza place in Henderson, NV, where a pizza margherita comes uncut and sells for $10. Is the SF premium really 90% these days? But, it was not as good as Pizzeria Locale, a newer establishment in Boulder, CO, started by two James Beard Award winners (where a margherita costs $13, and OF COURSE is also served uncut.) After someone helping the server delivered our food, they promptly disappeared and our server was nowhere to be found for some time. Unfortunately, we needed some salt (personal taste issue; I'm not blaming the restaurant). In summary, the pizza margherita was good, but not the best, and is overpriced at $19, and should NEVER be served cut. The service was deplorable, and we feel no need to return.

In my food travels I often ask myself: When's the last time I ordered pizza that came on a baking sheet?  Using rough math, I can safely say that 60% of the time I do this 100% of the time at Tony's.  This is THE place for pie in San Francisco, their pizza finding a happy medium between crispy and fluffy while continuing to be ever artery expanding.

Terrific pizza and the meatballs were so tasty! The food was 5 stars, our server was very good, but the host was terrible. He told us it would be a 45minute wait. He never called so we came back after 50minutes. He said it would be one moment and that we were the next table. We waited for 40minutes while WALKS-INS took tables. He said it was because he was giving us the best table in the house. Maybe that was true, but we indicated (after we were asked) that we wanted the FIRST TABLE AVAILABLE. He should have AT LEAST asked if we wanted the 2-3 tables that were given away before us. After we were seated and had liquid in our hands, well, alcohol, we were much happier. Once the food came, we were thrilled!

To sum it up, this is the best Italian pizza I've had in the US.   I spent years living, traveling, and eating my way through Italy.  The best pizza I've ever had was actually in Naples, home of the Margherita.  So, 5 stars to Tony for winning the championship in Naples, and for bringing a taste of Italy to SF. I had dinner here with a good friend of mine from Italy.  He had the Margherita and I had the Diavola (sopressata, buffalo mozzarella, and arugula).  Both were amazing and the best we've had outside of Italy.

First time here and went to the to go part of the restaurant and sat outside to have the Margerhita pizza - my gosh...how oily! there were puddles of olive oil on top of the pizza, and the crust is thin so imagine picking that up and let the oil drip down then take a bite. The tomato sauce was jus okay - honestly the best margherhita pizza i've had was from SOURCE - the sauce from source is sooooooo much better... Tony's margherita pizza was jus like all the other pizza places, I dont understand the big hype. I had 3 -4 pieces because I was hungry with 2 pieces left and i left it on top of the garbage can for the homeless. It wasnt good enough or worth the trouble to carry it home.. cant decide on 1 star or 2... but since i wont be coming bk... i concluded on a 1 star..

A colleague brought me here and I'm so thankful for that.  I come back here about every other week and crave it much more often than that.  First thing to know: they don't take reservations and the wait is incredibly long.  Plan to put your name on the list and then go find a bar in North Beach for 1-2 hours (2+ if it's Friday or Saturday).  The hostesses do usually overestimate the time though, so if they say 2 hours, expect 90 minutes in my experience. For appetizers, the calamari is a solid option.  It's definitely good and I haven't known anybody to dislike it.  The lilet fries were a treat too.  My favorite is the meatballs, which is saying something because normally I'm only a fan of homemade recipes.  Don't be surprised if any one of these is sold out.  That's pretty common so don't get your heart set on one.  Be open to the options because nothing's bad. The pizza is amazing.  The New Yorker is my favorite although I'll admit I've only tried three options.  I keep going back to the New Yorker because it's just bomb.  In my opinion, this is the best pizza in the city.  Forget Jay ' Bee's, forget Za.  Go to Tony's.  It's just awesome. As to the service, it's always good.  Some servers are of course better than others but I've never had a negative experience.  It doesn't matter though because you should be going for the food.  And besides, with 1-2 hours of drinking beer or wine beforehand, you're probably going to be in a great mood before you even get to your table. Also: the pizza reheats well.  I've only gotten this delicacy once because every other time it's been devoured in the restaurant, but definitely don't think about throwing this stuff away if you've got leftovers.

Walking in at 1:00 on Easter Sunday, there was about a 15 minute wait to be seated. But when it was our turn, we were given a choice. Small table against the wall for two or sit at the pizza bar and watch the pizza man work his magic. We took the bar seats and enjoyed conversing with the pizza man as he made margherita after margherita pizza in the 900-degree wood burning oven. It was like watching an artist create a masterpiece time and time again. We had asked him how long it took to cook a pie and he replied 90 seconds....so we timed him...it was exactly 92 seconds from pie in to pie out. We started with an order of nice plump mussels in white wine. Then it was pizza time. We were in New York last October and had cheese and tomato sauce pie out of a coal fired oven from Patsy's. While Tony's had a similarly described pie on the menu, we decided to try the New Yorker instead, (rustic medium crust), mozzarella, hand crushed tomato sauce, natural casing pepperoni, sliced italian fennel sausage, ricotta, chopped, garlic & oregano. Service was very good and we will definitely have to go back at least twice. Once for their famous Margherita Pizza and then again for a Tomato Sauce and Cheese Pizza. Or maybe we can just bring some friends???

In a neighborhood full of pizza and pasta options, Tony's is one of the few that we frequent again and again. The casual atmosphere and good food make it a perfect spot for meeting up with friends. One of my favorite things about this restaurant is that though they don't take reservations, you can leave your cell number and they will call when a table is open. Since we live so close, this means I can put my name on the list then either have a glass of wine at home or head to Tony Nick's for a cocktail or two. Beats awkwardly standing outside the bathrooms waiting for a table. I think this place is best for a group of 4-6. Any fewer and it is hard to justify getting more than one pizza and it is much more fun to sample and share. Any more and it is hard to get a table in this cozy space. Our faves are: - The Margherita (only 73 made per day) - The meatballs - The Salsiccia pizza And while the prices may be a bit high for medium sized pizzas, you have to appreciate that the reason they don't taste the same as the pizza around the corner is because all those quality ingredients are flown in straight from Italy. Yumm!

I've rediscovered pizza and its name is Tony. Nestled on a corner across from Washington Park and the St Peter and Paul Church, Tony's is situated on a somewhat more residential corner of North Beach. The large bar greets you as you enter. For my first visit, I had to go with the award winners: the Margherita (2007 World Pizza Cup Winner) and the Cal Italia (Food Network Pizza Challenge Winner). Margherita: Cooked at 900 degrees for 90 seconds. The crust is still slightly doughy but there was a bit too much burnt crust for my taste. The pizza itself had a very thin crust. The flavor was light and simple, not overly complex. The creaminess of the mozzarella slices complemented the fresh basil leaves nicely. It was a good starter. Cal-Italia: So much dimension! Sweet, salty, savory, cheesy. The Cal Italia is a playground for the taste buds: paper thin proscuitto slices atop a cheesy bed of mozzarella, gorgonzola, asiago and parmesan cheeses and, of course, tomato sauce. Balsamic adds a bit of tanginess and the sweet fig preserve drizzled on top is literally (to use a cliche) the "icing on the cake". MY GOODNESS. I had to control my desire to devour each slice so that I could enjoy and appreciate all the flavorful layers. It must be tasted to be fully understood and appreciated. I will return solely for Cal Italia, for I am convinced that eating at Tony's and not ordering it should be a crime. Next time, I'll try the meatballs and the gorgonzola fries. My dining neighbors ordered them and I had food envy :)

Wow this place rocks. Great food. Class A service. You can't go wrong here.  Probably the best pizza in town. Bar none!  We started with a salad, which was more than enough for four of us to share.  Then we ordered two pizzas... one traditional cheese and one Marghuerite, which is their specialty.  More than enough food for two adults and three teenagers.  We took home the leftovers, which should make for a great breakfast! We really enjoyed our time here and definitely plan to come back again.

This will probably get me in trouble with the pizza purists, but I ordered the specialty margherita pizza with pepperoni... and it was DELICIOUS! The sauce had just enough saltiness to make me want to stuff the whole pizza in my mouth, and the thin crust had an amazing chewiness to it with just the right amount of crispiness. We also ordered the pulled pork pizza, which was good, but not my favorite. It was a bit heavy for me. As for the New Yorker pizza, I would not recommend that to anyone. It was too cheesy (I can't believe there is such a thing, but it just didn't work with the ricotta), and too bland for me. Definitely order the fried green beans with garlic. I even went so far as to dip my bread in the leftover grease and garlic because it was that good. I would have licked the bowl clean if I weren't with 4 other people.

I stepped on the scale this morning and immediately starting cursing Tony's name. Those bastards over there are churning out good pizza. No wait, not good pizza but rather some of the best pizza pies I have ever tasted. The problem is that I love you too much and Tony's is now the major contributor to my ever expanding ASS. I have had the pleasure of trying four different pizzas here and they have all been winners. The MARGHERITA is a classic, they limit these to just 73 per day, so if you are a fan get there early. The NEW YORKER is my personal favorite, but saying this is literally like choosing who my favorite nonexistent child is. ROSEMARY, WHITE ROSE POTATO, & CHORIZO spicy and super flavorful, do not be afraid to order this weird pie. And last but not least, the TRUFFLE pizza. Now this one is a doozy and if you elect to get this one, it is priced at market and as of last night is $88 for the shaved white truffle option. YIKES! but not to worry, they also offer this pizza with truffle oil and is priced at $23. And there are so many more that are on my pizza radar and will soon be entering my belly. The starters are delicious and can also take some of the blame for adding ASS fat. The meatballs are amazing and if you are smart like me, save one and add slices to the MARGHERITA or the NEW YORKER as it makes for a nice compliment. There is a great wine list and a full bar. Yes, a full bar! which after a long day is always welcome. Last night thanks to my good friends who brought a super delicious bottle of wine our choice was easy. Thank you Gill and Markus! Our server last night was Erin and she was outstanding. She checked in on us often and made sure that we were well taken care of. Tony's at this writing is my favorite pizza in San Francisco. But seriously, my ASS hates you.

I was sent to the right place for my first taste of North Beach. I sat at the bar and found it funny that everyone knew the bartender and they were all having a good time. Even someone brought a gift for the bartender. I end up joining too. It was a great dining experience. There was so many different pizzas that I wanted to try but I finally made my selection. I wish I had a friend with me because the small was enough food for 3 meals. It tasted great. Very fresh toppings is what stood out must. I thought the price was a little high.Great place for a date or dinner with friends. Pizza was so good that I enjoyed another slice the next day at the North Beach Festival.

I ordered the peperoni pizza and the vegetarian pizza I think they were like 3.75 a slice which is like really expensive IMO for pizza. The pizza itself was OK, I mean it wasn't the best pizza I've ever had, but the ingredients did taste fresh and they made it for me right away. I liked the peperoni way more than the vegetarian, not sure what type of cheese they added to it was a little strong.

It took 3 of my carpooling buddies to convince me that Tony's Pizza was amazing and I finally got to try it for myself. We ordered 3 flavors: 1000 degree Coal Fired Original Tomato with Cheese ($19), the Classic Cal Italia ($18, the Famous Food Network Gold Medal Winner), and the 900 degree Wood Fired Napoleonata Truffle ($20 ish, minus the market price truffle). Each had its own unique flavor but surprisingly my favorite was the Truffle. Truffle was made on a medium crust, with burrata mozzarella, triple cream cheese, wild mushrooms, argula for bite, parmiagano, and truffle oil instead of shaved truffles. This pizza was wonderfully flavorful. I don't even like mushrooms, but the use of the non-garden variety made it much more palatable, as well as the creamy cheeses. My second fave was the Cal Italia more for it's unique combination of flavors - the savory of the prosciutto, the strong melding of asiago, mozzarella, and gorgonzola cheeses, sweetness from the fig preserve drizzled all around, and some balsamic for tangy-ness. Ahh the marriage of the best flavors. My only complaint is that the crust is overly thick. I would have preferred a thinner crust to fully appreciate all the flavors going on. And finally but not least, the original tomato and cheese. Seemingly simple, the tomato sauce here is what makes this pizza. It is full of oregano and basil and other spices that makes it a little sweet and full of Italian goodness. And the crust is nice and thin, great texture from the coal fired oven. We ordered the pizzas as take out so it had sat about 10 minutes before we got to it. I can only imagine how delicious it would have been had we consumed it straight from the oven. Next time. I will be back for you Tony's Pizza!

Tony, marry me please. [Note: I have no idea what he looks like, no idea how old he is, and no idea what his marital status is...but there's one thing I do know: he makes one hell of a pie.] In the couple times I've been there, I've had the famous Margherita, the Classic American Primavera and the Detroit Style Red Top . Anything I've ever had there was excellent. The margherita tastes like you just stepped into an authentic cafe in real Italia. The Primavera was a New York style pizza, that definitely made me reminisce the satisfaction of a true east coast slice, and although ive never been to Detroit, the Red Top tempts me to explore the city's pizza someday. Thank you for bringing so many different shades of pizza together, so magically in one place, Tony. It really makes the hour long wait to sit in a Tony's booth well worth it!

One of my coworkers has been talking about this place for forever, so I finally tried it.   Their pizza margherita is good, but a bit wet for my taste.  (I know, that's the Naples way, but next time I go, I'll probably try a drier pizza.)  The waiter warned us, but I tried it since that's what they're known for. My favorite part of the meal was actually the garlic bread that we ordered.  It was more like a loaf of garlic bread (like 13 slices).  It was really delicious (real garlic cloves on top) and the leftover pieces tasted great the next morning after 5 minutes in the oven.  Seriously awesome garlic bread.

Incredible, what an amazing restaurant in the heart of North Beach. Took my family here yesterday and there isn't one bad thing on the menu! This round we enjoyed: - Ceaser Salad - Little Italy Salad - Margarita Pizza - Penne with Pesto - Colombo Pizza (my fav! the dough is to die for) - Tiramisu All of which was great portions and everyone in our party of 7 was full and content. I can't wait for my next visit to try something new!!

Went on a Saturday night at about 6:30 pm and was told the wait for the first available table (inside or out) for 2 was about 45 minutes.  Not bad! we thought.  After about an hour with no phone call we stopped back in to find out they had already passed us on the waiting list, apparently they "tried" to call but nothing had come through on my phone so who knows what happened there.  The hostess was pleasantly apologetic  and offered to seat us at the "chef's bar" which isn't an ideal dinning spot so I'm guessing they save it for emergencies??   Anyways, we ordered the Barcelona and Pancetta Porcini.  We both left stuffed and with two slices of pizza each for leftovers so it was just the right amount of food. Both were very tasty but we definitely preferred the Pancetta Porcini.  The Barcelona reminded me more of a pasta dish than pizza and I really wanted some rigatoni instead of the pie crust.  And I must say there was quite a bit of oil sitting on top of the pizzas - I was tempted to ask for some paper towels to blot off the excess grease but refrained for fear of embarrassing my dining partner!   All in all really good pizza but I like Pizzaria Delfina (everything I've had there has been delicious) and A16 (love, love the Bianca and chili oil) better for a "clean" feeling pie.

SUNDAY, 11/21/10: NATIONAL PHUCK LO-CARB DIETS DAY! A day to pay tribute to carb gluttony and another excuse to derail from my diet...  *raise the roof* I first heard about Tony Gemignani several years ago while watching the Food Network. Now I can see why he is a 9 time World Pizza Champion! I'm no pizza aficionado, but Tony certainly knows how to make a damn good pizza w/ pairing of ingredients that will tantalize your taste buds. Yesterday, my friends and I met up at Tony's at 7 PM. Since reservations are NOT accepted, the wait was about 1 hour for a party of 6. While patiently waiting, we grabbed a few cocktails at the bar. The entire time my eyes couldn't stop feasting on the piping hot pizzas w/ bubbling ooeeey goeeey cheese being brought to other patrons. *drool* 64 torturous mins later, WE GORGED: APPS: *FRIES w/ GORGONZOLA SAUCE ($8): BOMB!!!! The skinny fries were light and crisp. What made these fries off the effen charts was the gorgonzola sauce which was thick, ultra creamy, savory, salty and tangy. The gorgonzola had a delicate pungency just enough to waken up my taste buds w/o feeling I got dropped kicked off the bed. *CALAMARI FRITTI ($11): YUMMY! The calamari was perfectly fried to a light golden brown; it was crisp and the calamari was tender. The chili powder in the breading gave it a nice kick and the creamy aioli sauce added an add'l layer of spiciness. *MEATBALLS ($7 for 6): MmMm, the golf-sized meatballs were soft, moist and exploding w/ flavor. I'm not sure the combo of meat that was used, but there was a hint of gaminess (from veal?) which gave the meatballs a nice earthy flavor. The tangy and sweet marinara sauce gave the meatballs a nice tangy and sweet bite. PIZZAS: There are 6 slices per a pizza. Since the crust is so thin, it's not very filling. So if you have a huge appetite, you "may" be able to consume an entire pizza. But I would say 3-4 slices/person (w/o apps) is sufficient. All of the pizzas had a crunchy crust w/ a pillowy soft center and a slight smoky taste from the charred edges. The pizzas w/ the marinara sauce got soggy quick, so snatch up a slice ASAP if you want to devour the pizza w/ a crisp crust throughout. TIP: Make sure your plate is free of any sauces (if you get an app), otherwise it will make the pizza soggy when it hits your plate. *MARGHERITA - 2007 World Pizza Cup Winner ($19): MmmMm, so simple, yet so good! The hand crushed tomato sauce was vibrant and had the perfect balance of tang and sweetness which complemented the savory and creamy mozzarella cheese. The basil was like icing as it added a touch of earthiness. *SALSICCIA CON TREVISO ($17): OMFG! A pie topped w/ house made honey sausage, roasted garlic, caramelized onions and crema de parmigiano = an EXPLOSION in my mouth! Savory, salty, garlicky, sweet, smoky and creamy flavor profiles that would satisfy all your cravings. *CAL ITALIA ($18): OMFG x 2! The Food Network judges knew their sh*t when awarding Tony a Gold Metal for this masterpiece during the Pizza Champion Challenge. A trio of asiago, mozzarella, and gorgonzola cheese w/ prosciutto layered on top and fig preserve and balsamic vinegar drizzled on top (no marinara sauce). The Cal Italia is a MUST, MUST, MUST order for those who enjoy sweet and savory foods! The sweetness of the figs was counterbalanced by the salty prosciutto and the medley of savory and tangy cheeses. The balsamic vinegar added just the right of tang to offset the richness of the pie.   *SOPRANO ($16): YUMMY! The Soprano is definitely a man's man pizza. It was like eating a meatball sandwich except you get a nice crunch from the crust before biting into the succulent and flavorful meatball that's been marinating in a the tangy and sweet tomato sauce. DESSERT: *STRACCIATELLA ($3): Rich and creamy vanilla gelato intertwined w/crisp chocolate shavings for a nice texture contrast. It satisfied my sweet tooth craving w/o feeling I committed sugar suicide. SERVICE: LIGHTENING FAST! Once we ordered, the food came shooting out w/in mins. We got our first dish (meatballs) w/in 2-3 mins of ordering and we were never left waiting for more than 2-3 mins for the next dish. Our waitress was friendly, quick, and attentive. When your water glasses are always filled, that's always a good sign right? AMBIANCE/DÉCOR: Casual, low-key and lively. The front dining area has 5 booths and bar seating, while the back room has 5 booths. PARKING: A NIGHTMARE but I got lucky and w/in 5 mins, I found parking a block away. There's a parking lot 2 blks away on Filbert/Columbus w/ a $12 flat rate. As I sit here writing this review w/ a muffin top in full force (*sigh*), I can say Tony's was worth every 3000+ calories I devoured in one sitting. I guess we all know who's bringing an Aero Bed to the gym tonight! Next up, Tony's $38 Truffle Pizza...who's down? Hollar at your girl! ;)

Great for kids, from mini pizzas to french fries you should be good to go.   The New Yorker is my favorite, a close second is the Margarita. Parking stinks be prepared to hoof it a couple if blocks. I recommend going for lunch or right when they open.  Less crowded.

Went there last Friday at 5:45pm and the restaurant was almost FULL (unbelievable). We were so lucky to take their last table. I love the atmosphere here. Everyone in the restaurant was very friendly and warm. We had the Gorgonzola fries and meatballs as our appetizer. Wow, the fries were so good. So crispy. Remember to eat the fries as soon as possible, because the sauce would make the fries soft. The sauce was a little bit salty at the end. For pizza, we ordered a "Classic Pepperoni" with medium crust. The pizza was pretty good. The sauce was flavorful and it was not salty at all. Our server was very attentive. He always comes over to see us. Overall, I had a great time there and I definitely go back there to try their thin crust pizza!

OMG! Best pizza i tried so far in the US! Reminds me of Italy, just delicious. I had the Margherita and Brittney had the same Margherita with the addition of Prosciutto, Rucola and Pomodorini, cooked in the wood burning oven. just phenomenal! Waiting time was an hour and a half, but we were lucky to find 2 seats at the bar!! Good selection of italian spirits and bitters as well, i finally found Amaro Montenegro!! great place, i'm italian from italy so you can trust me! P.S. their meatballs are amazing!

Good pizza? Absolutely. Worth the price? Highly debatable. They make simple pizza's like Margherita's and some more complex ones and broils them mainly in a wood-over pizza. Crust comes outs with nice specks of char but the taste of the toppings did not sing out like I would expect from a high quality pizza. Supposedly pastas are the hit here but I would rather get some Delfina pizzas for this price. Salads are good as well.

Great pizzas, but to be honest, the pasta was even better. They are hand made and it was cooked to perfect al dente. The calamari wasn't that great, so I don't recommend them. Other than the Margherita pizza that you have to try, I recommend the truffle pizza as well. It was a bit disappointing that the food came out inconsistently. We had to wait 10-15 min in between each item we ordered. The wait can be long, so be warned.

Came here on a Friday night once & had to wait for about 45 minutes for a table before finding two seats at the bar. The food is great! We had the cesear salad & an order of the meatballs to start- love me some meat & these meatballs were delicious! We kept it simple & ordered a plain pepperoni pizza- also tasty. They have outdoor, sidewalk seating- which is nice, especially in a neighborhood like North Beach. The wait can be long, but there's full service at the bar. Also, next door they have a to-go area where you can order pizzas, pizza by the slice, calzones, etc. I'd gotten a slice to go a few times before I tried the restaurant next door & think the slices to go are almost better than the pizza we had at the sit-down restaurant. Definitely worth going back to.

The best pizza in the bay area. Although the award winning Tony started Pyzanos out in Castro Valley, the pizza at these two places could not be more different. It gets packed and does not take reservations. If you are going to North Beach, put your name down as soon as you get there, walk around, and your name will be called soon. They'll even call you up on your cell phone.  If you want to splurge I highly recommend the market price pizza.

We tried this because it was near Cobb's.  It was crowded on a Sat night, as expected in North Beach.  We asked the bartender (great service BTW) if we should have the margherita or the truffle pizza and he suggested the former.  We started with the fried green beans which were very good. However, the pizza was just fine.  Our crust was soggy and not that appealing.  I'd go as far as to say Amici's is better by a longshot.

Visited San Francisco on vacation and had promised the boy some Pizza, since we made him eat Chinese food the day before.  Found this place, at the recommendation of my fellow Yelpers.  I have to say the Yelpers (as usual) did not steer me wrong.  The abundance of pizza options was awesome.  Me and two others split a large thin crust pizza.  The sauce, meat and crust were all great.  The boy had a personal pizza (cheese only) with regular crust.  He had a slice left over ,so in order to give a more thorough review, I tried it too.  I prefer regular crust pizza and this was right up there with the best crusts I have had.  They have different methods of cooking the pizza (gas, wood, electric..) so for the pizza snobs out there, this may make you more intrigued to try out this place.  We also had some sort of salad with blue cheese crumbles, bacon etc.  It tasted fresh and was big enough for three of us to share.  The atmosphere had a tavern feel to it, but it was clean and service was great.  They do have a full bar and quite a few beers available.  I was driving in an unfamiliar town so I did not try any, but there were quite a few I wish I could have.  Only flaw is that, like most of San Fran, parking sucks.  You have to park in the street, and use a meter.

I really wanted to love this place, seeing as how it's in the sights of so many local pizza connoisseurs, but it fell short of my expectations. I ordered the award-winning margherita pizza both times I visited. The sauce is tasty, with a pure San Marzano flavor, and the crust is simultaneously crisp and chewy, but the char really gets in the way of the flavor. I felt like I couldn't taste the base flavors of the pizza over the burnt dough, even if it's more authentic that way. The pizza is also pretty small, enough to feed one hungry person. $19 + tax and tip is quite a lot of money, and I'd rather spend it elsewhere. The margherita pizza at Emilia's Pizzeria in Berkeley is cheaper, larger, and in my opinion, tastier. (That's not to say I don't admire the incredible craftsmanship that goes into making these pizzas. Imported ingredients! Four ovens! I hope this place continues to thrive.)

Visited here because I read so many great reviews. Ordered the margherita pizza and one of the pasta dishes. You can really see & taste that their food is made from scratch and with love. No wonder their pizza was voted best in the US a few years ago. The server was attentive and helpful. The patrons at the bar looked like they were having a great time, so that's what I'll probably end up doing next time. Definitely will grab a pizza next time I head out there.

So good - definitely worth the wait and lived up to expectations. My husband and I went around 4pm on a Saturday hoping that we wouldn't have to wait long. We actually we're hoping to sit at the bar so we could watch the baseball game and luckily there were spots. We ordered the fried green beans (very good, although ordering once is probably enough), the giant meatball with mushroom sauce (so delicious, highly recommended!) and of course the margherita pizza. This was divine. I figured it would be more thin crust, but while it was thin, it was perfectly chewy - so it wasn't like crispy flatbread. it was really perfect, flavors are so fresh, good quality ingredients. Service was good at the bar, the woman was attentive and kept our drinks filled. I was surprised to see such a lengthy menu - they have St Louis-style, Chicago-style, etc pizza, but simple is better. We may try some additional ingredients on there next time, but the margherita was so delicious, and with the giant meatball on the side, it fed our meat craving.  note, I did try to go here last week after work, around 6:30pm and after waiting for 30 minutes, left as no seats had opened up at the bar. Originally they told me it would be about 40 mins for a table, but since I was by myself, I really just wanted to sit at the bar. I think it's one of those places that if you hit at the right (or slightly 'off') time, then you can get in in under 30-mins, but if you're going during peak times, plan to leave your name and walk around for a while.

Wow! I'm sold on Tony's.  We ordered the "Detroit Style" pie and it was fantastic!  I'd been to Tony's once before for the famed Pizza Margherita, which was good, but there are so many great thin crust pizza restaurants in the city that it didn't stand out to me.  The Detroit Style pizza was another matter!  It's a garlic butter bottomed thick crust pizza cooked in a metal tray in low heat.  The bottom of the pizza is crunchy, but the soft dough puffs up in between the crust and the cheese.  Tomato sauce on top.  Perfect!  I haven't found pizza like this elsewhere in the Bay Area.  I really applaud Tony's menu for having so many different styles of pizza each with unique dough and even cooked in one of several different ovens!  Yum.

This is a pretty damn good pizza place in North Beach. I would advise getting there before lunch/dinner to guarantee yourself a table; if you wait for the rush to go, good luck getting seated. People go nuts over pizza. When we went, we ordered 3 pizzas (the first 2 from 900 degree wood-fired ovens and the 3rd from 1000 degree coal-fired ovens): * Margherita (dough mixed using san felice flour, proofed in neapolitan wood boxes, san marzano tomatoes dop, sea salt, mozzarella fior di latte, fresh basil, extra virgin olive oil) * New Yorker (mozzarella, hand crushed tomato sauce, natural casing pepperoni, sliced italian fennel sausage, ricotta, chopped garlic & oregano) * Original Tomato Pie While I really enjoyed all 3, I highly recommend the Original Tomato Pie. Baked in a coal-fired oven gives it a perfect crisp texture, not to mention how delicious it is. We also ordered the deep fried string beans, but frankly they weren't that good. The only thing in my mind preventing a 5-star rating are the prices. Expect to pay around $19 per pie before taxes, which is kinda high. The service is good, and it's kid-friendly.

Yes, this place is as good as everyone says it is. I am so skeptical of pizza places, but this place delivers! We stuck with the tried and true Margherita pizza, and it was beyond delicious. It was cooked to perfection and the ingredients were just as fresh as can be. Add to the excellent food our fun and attentive waitress and this place just can't be beat. It seriously puts all other pizza places to shame. My new mission is to find a place like this in Chicago!

Arrived at noon on a Saturday just as a line was forming. Seated in the back room in front of the 900 degree wood oven where all the action happens. Started with the Meatballs which were moist and light. Not at all heavy and the sauce was fantastic. I slopped up the leftovers with our bread. Glad we didn't order a salad because it looked like it could feed 4. We had the famous margherita pizza. The crust was delish - really soft and airy. I was worried it would come out thin and burnt. Nothing fancy just simply delicious.The 50's music and the cute guy working the oven didn't hurt either.

I don't get the hype.   We started with the calamari, which was nothing special.  The truffle fries were good.  The margherita pizza was very disappointing.  The crust was too thin so the pizza was wet, maybe undercooked?  And I usually love thin crust pizzas.  The pancetta con rucola tasted ok.  We added quail eggs, which were unique and yummy.  However, the pizza itself was a little bit too sweet.  We wanted the truffle pizza but they were out. I was expecting to be blown away.  I was not.  However, a guy came out and put on a dough tossing show for some kids.  That was entertaining.

The Good: Pizza dough tossing demonstration at 8:45p on Sat night- guy was as skilled as a hooper - doing behind the back, under the leg - impressive. Margherita pizza, Marinara pizza (no cheese - vegan), sausage pizza. I rarely eat more than one slice of pizza (being lactose intolerant) and yet managed to devour 4.5 slices of the very thin pizza topped by juicy, fresh tomato sauce. Italian salad also fresh and quickly devoured by all in our group of 12. Italian fries with truffle oil - addictive. Food arrives quickly. Marnie - the manager - who so kindly offered to seat our additional unexpected guests in a table for 3 behind us. The other guests wandered away and Marnie even offered to hold the table for a few minutes while someone called him. Our server was a very pleasant woman who had a warm smile and positive attitude. Clean bathrooms - though they need to have bigger trash cans - and there are two - one isn't marked, but door painted black and sign indicating vacancy status above door knob (bathrooms separated by wine room). The wait is long but the hostess will take your mobile # and call you when your table is ready. After ordering 6 pizzas, 1 salad, 2 fries, the bill including tip came to $18 per person (we were a party of 12). Very reasonable. The Bad: The more complicated pizzas per J were not as a tasty as the simple pizzas. The wait for a table for 12 people was 120 minutes starting at 6p. They DO NOT take reservations whatsoever for any size party. I checked on the status of our table (though I wasn't the one who made the reservation) and the hostess told me "A Younger Woman already inquired."  Landmark comment for me - no one has ever said anything like this to me---maybe I should dye the gray hairs at my temples. I'm only 41! (The person who made the reservation is in her early 30s.) Still, her comment didn't dissuade me from checking in again 30 minutes later.  "Older" women like myself can be so annoying, right? Don't go in large groups on a Saturday night unless you are prepared to wait two hours and be crammed into a booth.

I'm falling out of love with this place: Minus one star for the wait--the wait is almost always horrendous.  Every time I'm here, my waiting time is around 45 mins to an hour prior to being seated. Minus another star for burning my $19 Margherita pizza.  I don't enjoy eating a pizza that is burnt underneath and have that charred toast taste to every bite I take. Will I stop going?  Probably not.  But I'm definitely putting our relationship on ice.  Only time will tell if I'll forgive her ...

There are a lot of pizzerias in SF but if you want a pizza that's "solid"  then there's Tony's on Stockton. This is great pizza. Especially, the margherita pizza-what Tony specializes in. They only make 73 a day and if you go there, there's a story behind that. Great location, good ambience, quick service and great pizza. The beau and I went here and tried 2 pizzas; the margherita and the cal italia and they were both delish. The pizza dough is thin, chewy and not super doughy or rubbery. It had the right bite to it-just the way I like it and it was cooked to perfection. The pizzas tasted really good when eaten right away and still hot. It was a Saturday around 1:30 PM and the place was full but we didn't wait too long for our seats. I would definitely come back here because the pizzas were that awesome and left a lasting impression on me.

I was in the neighborhood yesterday so dropped by the slice shop hoping to try the Detroit pie, no such luck, so we went next door and ordered a Romana. The pie is huge, rectangular, and comes out on a board. There are three variations, each divided into three sections with different toppings ("no substitutions"), so it's sort of like getting three small pizzas. Two of the triple combos had one dessertish section (Gorgonzola with sweet figs and balsamic reduction or with dates, pecans, apples, and honey), which didn't sound appealing, so we got the third, which had all savory combos. Pepperoni a bit greasy a la New York "Ray's" style with oil dripping down my wrist, pesto with goat cheese was rich and creamy, ricotta with big slices of fleshy sweet-hot red peppers and linguisa was something new to me. All were pretty good, albeit a bit greasy or juicy, so messy to eat. The crust was very thin but didn't get soggy. Presumably it was inspired by the famous focaccia / pizza bianca at Forno Campi de' Fiori, and the toppings were loosely inspired by Rome's pizza a taglio aka pizza rustica shops. I doubt there's anything like this in Rome. The menu says a Piccola ($32) "serves 2-3," but I estimate it was roughly 12" x 27" (about as much pizza as a 20" round pie), so two people would have to have huge appetites to polish one off. Maybe two teenage boys. I think each section was cut into nine rectangular slices. Coal-oven pizzas including white pie with clam and garlic are now on the menu in the restaurant. That's definitely next on my list.

I think about pizza.  I contemplate crust, dream of cheese, suckle at the teet of the goddess of pizza sauce.  It is the four basic food groups, salty and sweet, crisp and chewy, it is seemingly simple yet oh so complex. It's art.  Tasty, tasty, art. To that, this was some good 'za.  We had spent the night celebrating up in the city and woke with what some may call a hangover.  I started the afternoon prior with martinis, proceeded straight to inebriation, back to sober, met a cute girl, who I thought was dope, but lesbian, who turned out wasn't, but I still got shot down (but that's another story) and awoke to the feeling of my brain being replaced by the sphincter of a pygmy elephant with the runs. Love might be the answer, but the food is the cure, and following the recommendation of a friend, I shuffled over to bask in the regenerative glow of a couple of pies. We ended being seated outside, the streets were an odd lumping of people thronging around the televisions as the World Cup was going on (yes this review is a bit overdue), the sun was out and no one was soap boxing in the park yet. Between walking back to feed the meter every 20-30min, we ordered two pies, the special margherita and a.... it was uh.... Brooklyn? Bronx?  Eh, something referring to NY, laden with meat and ricotta, etc.... So one very traditional pie and another a bit of gourmet thing. Both pies were great, good crisp crust with a bit of chew, great cheese, and sauce, the add ons on the fancy pie were great and didn't really weigh it down too much. My one beef, was with the margherita.  I think they only make 75 a day or something like that, and I definitely felt that sense of urgency to make sure we got one.  But, I think with it being a pre-destined, going going gone type of deal, they didn't spend the level of attention to it as they should have.... the center was soggy.  That is, it was spun out so that the crust was too thin in the middle to support the cheese and sauce. The problem with thin centers are that, by nature of a slice, that is, unless you are marketing for Pizza Hut or whoever does those cheese filled crust pizzas, the center is the first point of contact.  The first bite. Firsts are important, first base, first kisses, first times...firsts.  First... they set the tone, they can overwhelm you, excite you, bring that sense of wonder and joy that only they can do. A soggy first bite... it's like getting to second base only to find out that Wonder bras really do work. Just to round out the story of the day, as we drove out, I had the windows down, and I heard someone preaching about being saved and how he used to be a Jew.  To which, I exclaimed, Jesus F'ing Christ!  Probably loud enough to hear, certainly loud enough for my two friends.  They may have started crying from laughing so hard at me. So you know how I can write this review months afterwards with this amount of recall.   Definitely try the pizza here.  Outside of Slice of New York, the only other slice I'd consider.

Great service at the bar from Robwell. However, the wait for seating was quite long. The margherita pizza was good - nice slightly sweat sauce. You could also taste the sea salt. I did not give this a 5 because of the long wait, the difficulty in reaching someone at the restaurant by phone, and because the pizza was not up to the level of quality and freshness of Una Pizza Napoletana in SF. However, a good overall experience. They have many other pizza styles on the menu as well.

Best pie this side of the Mississippi. You cannot find pizza this good anywhere else that I've tried. Admittedly, I still need to get to A16 and Flour + Water, but have been to Picco. This place is amazing. I've had the Grimaldi's and Lombardi's of New York and I've had Due's deep dish in Chicago, and now I've had Tony's. It ranks up there. You've all heard by now that they won a pie making contest in Naples and now only make 70-some-odd pies per day of the winning margherita pizza. And they have marvelous beers on tap. If you miss good pizza and are tired of Pizza Hut (which is admittedly a junky joy on the right day and with the right craving), get thee to Tony's.

I love the vibe of North Beach, so much! Thankfully we didn't have to wait too long for a table...I was a little nervous about that because when we drove by I noticed how small it was and how crowded it looked. We had a party of 6 ...here is what we stuffed our pretty little faces with: St.Germain Wings- 5 Stars OMG, I REALLY liked these haha...they're not spicy (which works for me!) and they have a great flavor. They reminded me more of honey buffalo wings. I'm definitely ordering those again! Little Italy Salad-4 stars (well I'm guessing because I didn't try it,but everyone seemed to really enjoy it) Side of spinach-5 stars ...I'm not a veggie eatin' type of chick but this was super yummy! Margherita Pizza-3 stars I was expecting better..it wasn't bad but definitely not the best I've ever had. Kind of felt the sauce was a little too watery and not enough of cheese or basil. New Yorker Pizza-2 or 3 stars(per my 11 yr. old son) ..sooo I dunno how you wanna take that!   =p Spaghetti & Meatballs-4 stars the meatballs were really tasty and the pasta was al dente just the way I like it! You can tell the pasta sauce is fresh too..I'd eat this again! Obviously we did NOT have room for dessert!=) ...there's always next time though! Service: hmmmmm 2.5 he seemed all over the place and he forgot a couple of things. It felt like he had a little too much caffeine( or ADD) and he had a lot on his mind..that was the vibe he was giving off.   The hostess was great though-5 for her!

I'm in denial about a couple things in life.  One of them is the fact that I'm now lactose-intolerant.  As a result, I never bring (or have never bought) any Lactaid pills.  Instead, I just pray very hard for the absence of a tummyache every time I eat pizza. Friday night, my aunt managed to get a table of 3 for herself, Boyfriend and me right after work.  We were led inside right away (amazing!) and given menus.  We were pretty overwhelmed by all the delicious-sounding choices, and after much deliberation and advice from our waiter (he was kind of weird because he'd kind of stand there awkwardly and stare at us after we were done talking), we decided on the Margherita, the Ed Hardy vegetarian special, and the Prosciutto-Pomodorini. As much as Ed Hardy clothing turns my stomach, I found the pizza to be my favorite, even though it came with an Ed Hardy commemorative box.  There were veggies piled onto a thin crust, and everything tasted light and very fresh.  The Margherita was a very simple pizza, and I normally love it, but sadly I've had much better (from Downtown Disney, of all places).  Finally, the prosciutto pizza was much too bitter and strong for me, as it was layered with prosciutto, cherry tomato halves, arugula, and tons of grated parmesan cheese.  While the Ed Hardy tasted fresh with its arugula and tomatoes, the prosciutto pizza had an odd mixture of flavors and textures and was just too much for me.  Ironically, it was Boyfriend's favorite. 3 pizzas for the three of us was actually way too much, even if I'd gotten my game on.  The pizza was definitely delicious (especially the crust), and I want to come back to try the other ones.  If you like this style of pizza, I would recommend Pizzetta 211 over Tony's though. Oh, and P.S., my praying worked.

Still the best pizza I've ever eaten, although I was slightly (only slightly) disappointed by the truffle pizza.  This time around, they actually shaved the winter blacks instead of using oil.  I realize that truffles are expensive, but I kept wanting to add something to the pizza for some reason.  It just wasn't...bust-a-n*t-in-your-mouth satisfying.   Maybe I should have just learned a thing or two from the Polamalo hit earlier in the day, taken out my dining companions, and eaten the whole damn thing myself.

Finally pizza that holds up to a north beach reputation. Yes I am Italian and this is real Italian food.    New York thin crust was  the best. Real ricotta, sausage, pepperoni, tomato sauce, and garlic. On the verge of too many ingredients but no this was perfect. Meatballs were great too. The Italian salad was unusual with blue cheese, walnuts, fresh parmesan over really fresh mixed greens not boring romaine. Yes there was a wait but plan for it ...worth the wait.    Staff was great too. Oh and the staff was knowledgable about domestic and Italian wines, a rarity these days.

Loved it! So the crust I wasn't that much of a fan of, had a whole slew of pizza from NY to woodfire to coalfire, and while each one was scrumptious, the crust just doesn't do it. I've said it once, and I'll say it again, it's something about west coast pizza where the crust ends up soggy in the middle, I don't know why. Like the pizza is GREAT, but when I pick up a slice, the tip always falls forward then the toppings slides off. Regardless I still give 4 stars. Wait is long, yes get over it, but pizza comes out fast and fresh. My favorite of the night is between this spicy chorizo and potato pizza and the thin crust, mozarella and sausage pizza. The first one because there was this amazing creamy cheese that they dolloped randomly, and as you bit into the spicy chorizo and peppers, the cheese would cool your mouth off. Loved it! The thin crust because of the sauce, the sweet tomato sauce which was the best sauce ever! I didn't even care for the sausage, I just picked it off. Loved the tomato sauce! Drooling over it!

We ate here last Saturday based on a co-worker's recommendation.   Naturally, the wait was almost an hour.  We had theatre tickets for that night, so we told the hostess we probably wouldn't be able to wait and she managed to find us an outside table in about half the time.  The staff was so nice and the service quick and efficient.  We sat under the heating lamps and were perfectly comfortable. We only tried the Margharita pizza and based on the reviews, I was just a little disappointed.  My crust was a little burned in places, so to me it only tasted ok.  But I'm willing to give this place another try because the staff was so friendly.

They say that zen is achieved when one lives in the moment. That when you expect nothing, you receive everything. I was told that the wait would be an hour. No problem - I actually didn't care. A man asked me to watch his standard poodle while he went in to make a reservation. A homeless guy petted the dog a patted me on the shoulder - no problem. A woman went into the crowded restaurant with a stroller - I didn't care to the point of holding the door for her. I really was in no hurry. The hostess said to me: "We have a seat open at the chef's station - are you okay with that?" That is one question that does not have to be asked twice. What an unbelievable turn of good luck. I sat just a few feet away from the 900F oven and watched choreography. Three chefs - one main and two support, churning out pizza after pizza with care. The staff work hard and take pride in their craft - just like the shirt says. They were having fun and so did I. Pizza is spectacular. The high points are the crust and the sauce - both over the top. I think I learned - or continued to learn - something very basic tonight. Thank you Tony's Pizza. Montana - you're the man - thanks.

Got the award winning Margherita pizza and it was delicious! Need to get there early since they only make a limited number of them per day. Fresh mozzarella and basil! Sauce was perfectly seasoned. Definitely need a fork and knife to eat this pizza as it is soft in the center, but the edge is golden brown crispy. It is a taste from the brick oven! Yum! Great with a glass of wine but I had it with a nice cold glass of root beer. I think it is one of the best combos! Tip: Seating can get difficult. You can be waiting for about 1 hour. However, if it is a cooler day or night, outdoor seating is just as good and half the wait. They have great heat lamps. Also, sitting at the bar can get your food quicker.

I admit that I'm one of those people who found out about Tony's from watching the Food Network.  But better late to the party than never showing up.  It seems like I was not alone in my idea to eat there on Saturday night.  I anticipated that there would be a wait, but 90 minutes at 5:45 was a bit shocking.  At least we did not have to wait three hours as some other yelpers have attested.  The wait was tolerable.  They took our cell phone number and called us when the table was ready. We were a bit crestfallen when told that the Margherita pizza that won awards in Naples was not available... they only make 73 a day with the special San Felipe flour.  Our waitress was no stranger to our disappointment and told us that she can't tell the difference between the Margherita made with Caputo flour and the one that won.   Let's get to the food.  The Margherita came out first.  The pie had a smoky char.  Some folks like the burnt spots; It was a bit too charred for my taste.  Mozzarella was on the tough and stringy side.  But, the crust.  I'm still dreaming about the chew.  It was an incredible consistency and texture.  The gluten was worked perfectly to achieve a crispy exterior and chewy interior.   We also ordered a Honey Pie - fried onions and scallions on top of a pie with two kinds of cheese.  It was slightly sweet and the deep fried onions provided a crispy texture that was surprising on top of pizza.   Still hungry, well, not really, but craving more, we ordered the Jersey Original.  The crushed tomato sauce was spectacular.  The parmesan added a great salty dimension.  The crust was less charred and just as chewy as the other pies.  In other words, worth the 90 minute wait. The upside: the crust. The downside: get there early if you want to avoid the wait or eat the award winner.

Came here on a Sunday night, super busy! ordered the little italy salad-kind of disappointed with that because it had 2 pieces of gorgonzola cheese on it. For the price, it was ordinary. The meatballs were delic! I don't even like meatballs but these were good. We also got the margherita pizza which was amazing. Loved the crust, mmm mmm! Only reason they got 4 stars was cuz I thought the bartender was not friendly-and the salad was blah.

This was our last dinner before we left to go back home. It was a Friday night and we only waited about 30 minutes. Not bad. We had the calamari and caesar salad to start. I like anchovies and they offered them on the side. I was surprised to see they were fresh. Very different. I was actually jealous because I can not get fresh anchovies in Dallas. They give you these neat pieces of fresh bread in a can, with three different dipping sauces. One of them tasted like honey of some kind, with garlic in it. It was a neat little surprise. I wish I knew the ingredients to make it at home. I really wanted the Margherita pizza, and it looked fabulous on the table next to us. My husband likes meat, so we ordered the Tony Two Times. Pretty funny. It was very good, especially of you like a lot of meat! The crust was great! The wine was reasonable. The bartender is a character. The service was okay. A little slow. The only bad thing I can say, is about where we were seated. They have two sides to the restaurant. One side houses the bar, the other side a large pizza oven. We sat right across from the oven. I'm sorry but it was like 90 degrees in there! It was extremely uncomfortable. Another restaurant where we will know next time and wait for a table either on the bar side or at least the front/street side of the oven room. The owner was busy with an obvious VIP table, but seemed nice. We enjoyed it here. It would have been really great if we sat elsewhere. Definitely try it!

HOLE-E-CRAP. I'm racking my brain trying to think if I've had better pizza in my life... aaaaand: nothing. So many different varieties of pizzas owing to their different ovens (gas, wood-fired, coal-fired), crust styles, and flavors. Very reasonable prices for the quality of food (fresh ingredients apparent) and the fact that they also have a huge cocktail menu, wine menu, and several beers on tap. Casual atmosphere, great service, win win win! Gets packed later in the night, even on weekdays, so it's better to either come early, make reservations, or come as one or two people and sit outside/at the bar. Great for large groups, kids, adults, anyone who can chew and smile. Not a place where you can expect to sit and chat for a drawn out, three-hour meal-- they've got tables to turn!

Tonight was one of the most special restaurant experiences ever.  Okay to start off with they don't take reservations, but me and my friend waited 40 minutes to get in.  No problem with that. Now comes the experience.  This place is the Disneyland of pizza places. Got in and had a super nice, cheery and attentive waitress. My friend came here once before, but I told her I was a rookie. We asked whether Tony Geminiani (9 time world champion and restaurant owner) was working tonight, but he was out of town.  She said the he's here most of the time though. We ordered a salad of mixed greens with breaded chicken breast.  It was light, and full of flavor.  Really delicious.  Then she mentioned that the special Ed Hardy (famous tattoo artist) veggie based pizza was on the menu tonight.  Since I'm a big fan of his art and clothing we decided to order it with sausage added.  The pizza was perfectly cooked, light, full of flavor. It had a great tomato sauce, arugula and forgot what type of cheese and sausage, but it was definitely enough for two. The crust was fluffy and tender.  We also got the complimentary Ed Hardy designed pizza box that I brought home for my collection.  For dessert we had a baked apple empanada with vanilla ice cream. It was great, but we should have gotten gelato since the dough from the empanada weighed us down with all the dough we already had. Now for the bonus and excitement.  Our waitress knowing that we missed seeing Tony mentioned that the world champion pizza spinner of 2010, Eric Corbin was in the back and he would come out. We thought hey, maybe we can shake his hand or something.  But he came out with a dough ball and put on a 40 second pizza spinning performance that blew me out of the water.  I rooted him on and we cheered when he finished.  That was the capper. We gave a big thanks to our waitress, plus a nice 20% gratuity since she was so great. I will definitely come back again one of my favorite restaurants of all time.

Yeeowza! Their meatball sandwich started a party in my mouth! This place is more than pizza. Their sandwiches are love-inducing, bundles of joy! The friend that gave us the rec on this place is going to be on the top of Santa's list this year.  He really raved about their Turkey sandwich with cranberry sauce on cranberry bread.  I really wanted to try that, but as I was sharing with the old man, we settled on the Meatball Sub. I just wanted to hug myself when that sandwich came out all glistening with olive oil or butter.  Other people actually ooh'd and ahh'd as they jealously watched me stake claim on that sandwich. One woman decided that's what she was going to order just by the looks of that Dagwood delight. Sharing that meatball sandwich with the old man, made me fall in love with him again for selecting such a winner. But, next time he's got to get his own, because I'm going to need quality time with my own sandwich before I run off and marry it.

Very good pizza, great service.Great pasta and sides as well. The only pizza I did not care for was the pulled pork pizza. I have noticed a slight downhill slide in quality. But OK Tony's is still better than good pizza other places. Very dog friendly as well. Liver snaps and water bowls!

RESTAURANT REVIEW PIZZA-- SELECTED, TRADITIONAL, GUARATEED-- HITS NORTH BEACH By Carol Peterson Tony's Pizza Napoletana, 1570 Stockton St., San Francisco, 94133 415.835.9888 In the age of YELP, how does a food critic write about a restaurant that, although only a scant year old, has 553 mostly rave reviews on that participatory website? Tony's busy Pizza Napoletana has become a vibrant part of our neighborhood and deserves attention from The Semaphore, but instead of echoing what is good at Tony's, I decided to focus on why it is so good. I wanted to tell the story that Tony's technology and ingredients play in the establishment's remarkable success. My guide in this quest was Nancy Puglisi, Tony Gemignani's partner, who took me on a tour of the inner workings of the business. When the pair decided to open in San Francisco, they found the space on Union Street empty.  Says Nancy, "I looked in the windows and saw the bar, floors and ceilings and it was love at first sight." With the help of their other partner, Bruno DiFabio, who owns five restaurants in New York, the project moved through the often torturous San Francisco permitting process.  Renovations were necessary. For instance, the stage erected by a previous owner in hopes of acquiring an entertainment license needed to be demolished. They began work in February, 2009 but didn't open until July of that year because, according to Nancy, "It's important to do things right the first time. If you don't, it's hard to catch up."   And then Tony's was ready to show the world their first oven, the Cirglaino from Naples, capable of reaching temperatures of 900 degrees. It was in Naples that Tony achieved fame for his award winning Pizza Margherita, the traditional dish of the region. Their second oven was one of two Marshall Ovens. The first was the Classic Italian Dome, where they cook classic Italian pizzas. Then they installed their Stack Oven, to bake the traditional New York style pizza. Their plan was to have a "one stop shop for pizza". Are there really that many different kinds of pizzas, with different flours, sauces and ingredients? "Yes," answered Nancy, "as well as different laws per state as to the type of ovens you can have." The next oven to be installed was the Cuppone, a Sicilian electric oven, for Pizza Romana, a long thin pizza. Although these four ovens were adequate the owners felt they weren't finished with their goal of offering all STG pizzas ((those initials stand for "selected, traditional, guaranteed,") offered around the world. STG is kind of a Naples version of the French wine appellation system. To achieve this STG designation your pizza must be 100% authentic in its use of ingredients from the region. Tony's is committed to achieving STG When the deli space next door became available the partners grabbed it and began remodeling. They had a vision of a classic New York take out deli, where one can get all styles of pizza and calzone as well as sandwiches every bit as good as those offered at Katz's in New York.   For the deli, they make their own corned beef and pastrami, and they've installed a Coal Fire oven where Eric Corbin, who worked at the famous Grimaldi's in New York, is in charge. Sitting in the corner is the last oven they installed. This huge Rotoflex oven has three shelves that turn and cook up to 25 pizzas at a time. Entering this deli you feel like you are in a famous venue in New York or Chicago. The space gives the impression that it has been there for years, right down to the 1956 coke machine that actually works. Our last stop was to Tony's basement, where they have covered the dirt floors with tile, built a pleasant wine storage room and a place for staff meetings. Then we went to the big Dough Room, where stacks and stacks of all different flours from all over the world are divided for different types of pizzas. Some were domestic and some were imported but each was designated for a certain pizza. Also there are large stacks of hard wood in plastic bags that are hauled up for the ovens. I asked how often these stacks of wood are replenished. "Every week," Nancy said smiling, "we make a lot of pizzas here." Their large refrigerator holds dough that has an 18 hour rising, which is called "refrigerator proofing." The dough is taken out 3 hours before it's  used This slow rise ensures the perfect crust and aids diner's digestion of the yeast . Tony, Nancy and Bruno had a vision for their corner in North Beach. When I asked Nancy why she picked North Beach over all the other neighborhoods in the City, she said, "There was nowhere else we wanted to be. It is the best neighborhood in San Francisco." We are so lucky she peeked into that window on Stockton and Union and chose us. We got the best pizzeria and deli in the City.

I'm almost afraid to reveal my favorite seats in the house - the counter in front of the Neapolitan Pizza oven.  You get front row seats to watch them make your pizza and you get to eat it while it is center of the sun hot. Burnt tongue aside, this is the only way to enjoy a magherita pizza. The Cal-italia was too sweet and rich for me but don't listen to me. I'm a pizza purist.

The only thing better than actually watching Tony make your wood fired pizza is eating it.  The ricotta on the New Yorker is something special. There is a place by my house in Marina Del Rey that makes a better Margharita, but the differences are subtle and this is on par with the best. Thanks Tony.

If there was a negative star for their events planning it would have to be that...  Their restaurant itself is amazing and I love their food but if you're thinking of planning an event - think twice. I have been trying to help plan a friend's event and was searching all over for their idea of pizza making / mixed drinks concept and low and behold I found a place! Tony's Pizza Napoletana!  What a great idea and gave myself a couple months to get ahead of the game to make sure I can 1.plan accordingly 2. it was cost efficient for our group and if I needed to open this up to others to lower the costs.  So a girlfriend and I left several messages for the events coordinator - Kelly.  My girlfriend got one message and I got one as well asking for my email address and if she wasn't available to just leave it on her voicemail with my phone number.  I did as she asked but did not receive any email or call back.  TWO weeks went by and I finally called to complain and stated "If it wasn't for the idea and the concept of the event  I would not think twice about giving my business because the Events Coordinator was unresponsive" And of course I get a call back later in the afternoon and she was not helpful at all saying she did receive my message and sent the email but it got kicked back. One would think - hmm maybe since this customer left me a couple messages I should call her back and let her know the email got kicked back - BUT NO. I did not receive a call back and the fact she admitted she got the kicked back email but didn't bother to follow up - a bit unprofessional. So between two people coordinating the same events (with the emails to time stamp and track) we received one phone call each but no follow up in a span of 2 months. So much for giving us enough time to plan and gather a large group!  In the midst of our conversation,  the call dropped because I was on my cell and she did not bother to call me back SO I called her back (literally a minute later) and the one of the employees said "Sure one second" and conveniently she left for the day - however the AM crew said she closes... When I asked to speak to the GM they weren't sure where he or she was or even what their name was.  How sad! Now that we are two weeks away from the event, I am coordinating with another venue in San Francisco that is very easy to work with. Again, I'm not knocking the food because I believe their pizza is great but the events side of it - think twice because I'm happy to give my business elsewhere.

Sunday evening arrived with a group of 5 & were entered onto the wait list @ 6:30pm...seated @ 8:05pm!  So plan an alternative activity while you wait.  They have a take out window next door & lots of outside seating.  However, it was cool & foggy so sitting outdoors was daunting.  Normally a wait this long would have sent us to another restaurant, but we wanted to try their award winning pizzas. Luckily we found a parking space across the street.  The staff was friendly & attentive throughout the evening.  Once seated our order was taken promptly & the food arrived quickly. We had: Deep Fried String Beans, good flavor, but a little too oily; Italian Style Meatballs, I did not try them, but the others loved them; Spinach Salad, fresh spinach with delicious pecans & good dressing, but could have included more goat cheese & red onion; Marinara Pizza, good crust & marinara sauce, could have included a few more whole garlic cloves; & New Yorker Pizza, I did not try it, but the others loved it.   While we enjoyed everything, the deep dish Vegetarian from Little Star Pizza remains my personal favorite. The total of $77 including tip for 5 was more than reasonable given the quality of the food & service. Normally I would be super excited about a place with delicious food & reasonable prices...but the wait was too draining.  Would return only if...we did not have to wait 1.5 hours for a table!!!

Where to begin...I love Tonys so much!  By far, hands down...the best pizza in North Beach.  Everyone that I have taken to Tony's walks away EXTREMELY happy.  I have had many of their pizzas and my favorites includes the infamous Margarita pizza, and four cheese but one of my go to choices is the Sicilian!  So damn good.  The meatballs remind me of my Nonnas, who was straight off the boat from Italy, not that I would have ever told her that!  Everything that I have tried there has been a good choice, you just can't go wrong.   There is usually a wait but I almost prefer waiting for some bar seats to open up and enjoy my meal there.  Not bad for groups, just expect to wait since they do not take reservations.   Do yourself a favor and if you are ever looking for a great pizza in North Beach GO TO TONY'S, you will not regret it!!

This place was an awesome find, I'm glad I used Yelp to help me find this pizza gem.  I wish I could give the place 6 stars. It was a short walk from Fisherman's Wharf and it looks like one of those neighborhood places that attracts lots of locals.  I didn't have a single slice of pizza in San Fran other than here at Tony's and I can tell you it is probably the best tasting pizza you will find in San Fran.  The GF and I split an original tomato pie w/cheese ($19) cooked in the 1000 deg coal fired oven.  It came out perfect, the crust was cooked but still soft.  Its almost hard to describe how good it really was.  Check it out for yourself. Oh and I think you can come in and make a reservation and they will call your cell when your table is ready so you can hang outside in the adjacent Washington Square park.  Not 100% sure though so check into it.

Was walking around Washington Square after visiting Coit Tower and me and my girlfriend walked into this place, since we were super hungry. I really just wanted some pizza! Saw their special on their board and ordered 2 slices to go so we could eat outside since it was nice. When I got the pizza, the 2 slices of pizza took up the WHOLE BOX, it was pretty big for $5 each slice. Not bad since you are in North Beach area! (Where all the Italian Food was good!) It was great! Loved it, tasted nice and good. Will definitely go back when we are in the area! =)

Best pizza! Hands down! Well, this place definitely got a lot more recognition after that USA Today article, but you'd understand if you saw the menu. It is truly extensive.... they have like 5+ ovens making HELLA different kinds of pizza! I've had their Margherita, which is limited to 73 a day (weird number but ok) and their Pancetta Porcini. The Margherita was pretty good, but honestly, I don't think I know how to appreciate Margherita pizzas. I liked how there were a lot of tomatoes on it, which made the pizza moist and flavorful. I would have preferred more basil on it though. The Pancetta Porcini was just delectable and amazing! Lots of porcini mushrooms and the smell of the truffle oil was unforgettable! The pancetta was a nice touch too but the mushrooms and the truffle oil were the best thing about this pizza. My friends and I were literally fighting for the slice with the most mushrooms. My party and I also had the fried calamari which was worth it for its price. It was fresh and served in a deep bowl. We couldn't even finish it. For drinks, we got the sangria which was strong and good. We couldn't figure out what fruits were in it, definitely apples and maybe a plum... By the way, they also serve breadsticks which are accompanied by garlic in olive oil, plain olive oil, and roasted red peppers. Such an amazing way to start off an amazing meal :).

If you don't mind waiting up for 45 minutes for a table then check out Tony's pizza. They have so many but whatever you do order the Margarita right when you sit down. It's awesome and comes out in 2-3 minutes so it's a nice treat while you're browsing the more intricate pizzas. I went with my mom and younger siblings around 10 pm on a Saturday night. We waited about 20 minutes, ordered a reasonably priced Carafe of red wine and the meatballs to start. My sister ordered the margarita and the rest of us feasted on a pizza that was split into 3 parts. The first was cheesy and simple, the second was full of arugula and tomatoes, and the best was saved for last: fig and balsamic. Savory and sweet night with great company. I'm from NY where the pizza is fantastic and this is the best that SF has to offer. For pizza lovers this place is a must. Make sure to walk around North beach after. ** parking on street isn't the best.

Good pizza and good service no Dout, but an hour and half wait? Makes it not worth the wait. $9 for a bloody Mary? Heck I can buy a 750ml of vodka for $9 bucks. Prices are high for a pizza joint which as a previous pizza restaurant owner has the cheapest cost. At best a thick pizza with everything is costing the owner maybe $4, but he's selling it for $30!!!

On a hot day you might think you're on the sidewalks of NY when you walk out of this place.  But its SF's fine ingredients that make tonys top notch and as good as its sister next door. The sandwiches are spensive, but you could probably make 3 meals out of 1.  We went to the park and ate them while watching some of the local crazies party down.   I've been twice now, the first time I had the Cheef, so good and huge.  The second I had the 1/4 milano I think its called, its a white pizza that you can choose the toppings.  Very good too! And THEY HAVE FRESCA.  any place that has this is immediately my new favorite place.  Thank you.

I was excited to try this place since everyone raves about it and I know Tony from my previous job. My friend and I waited for an hour (my only gripe) to get seated. We walked around North Beach to burn off some calories so we won't feel bad eating it. After our rigourous power walk, we walked back to Tony's and our table was ready! We ordered the Margherita Pizza ($19) which won an award in Naples, Italy. It was delicious! I also took home a Primavera pizza($18) for me and my BF and he was hooked, too!  Just and FYI, the sizes of the pizza are pretty small. We devoured the Margherita Pizza and we were still semi-hungry. Or maybe we're just fatties... I can't wait to go back and try their other delicious dishes!

Thank the Roman gods that Castro Valley has reasonable fire laws because otherwise, owner Tony Gemignani would have never opened his newest pizza place on the best corner in North Beach. Y'see, they wouldn't let him build the wood-burning oven necessary to make the amazing pizza we in SF get to have all to ourselves. This guy went to Naples and freakin' beat all the locals in a pizza-making contest that probably had the Cosa Nostras up in arms. So I came here for a birthday celebration on Saturday. Yes, it was mine, and it was a big one ...a BIG one. So there were eight of us, and my friend Maggie managed to engineer the big booth in the front window. Now the deal is you can't make reservations, so we sat across the street in the big, old Rat Pack-style bar at Joe DiMaggio's keeping an eagle eye for our table to open. My motor was already running a bit with a couple of Bellinis and a few mouthfuls of antipasto in me. It only took an hour, and we were as excited as a bunch of bulimics at an all-you-can-eat buffet when we got seated. We had an amazing waitress who explained all the differences between the thirty pizzas on the menu. We settled on four different pies, five in total - the $17 Margherita Extra with cherry tomatoes, the $10 Classic Pepperoni (a steal), the Truffle Pizza Napoletana (two of those $38 puppies - ah, the price of real truffles!), and the $18 Cal Italia. It's all in the thin, flash-fired crust just burnt enough to give the pizza a smoky flavor and yet chewy enough to carry all the superb ingredients on top. All were extremely tasty, but the absolute standout for me is the Cal Italia (see photo), as perfect a blend of sweet and savory as I've ever tasted on a pizza. This is no pineapple and ham combo. It combines four cheeses - asiago, mozzarella, gorgonzola and shaved Parmesan - with a prosciutto di Parma that's drizzled with sweet, aged balsamic. There is a Croatian fig preserve right in the center. How perfect to get to eat this pizza just before a trip I'm taking to Venice, Bologna and Dubrovnik. I'll be back...again...and again...and again. Oh and the green beans bathing in garlic are great, too. FOOD - 5 stars...best thin-crust in town and the Cal Italia is now officially essential San Francisco dining, says me AMBIANCE - 4.5 stars...fun, loud place with the ovens a-blazing for your culinary pleasure...it's katty-korner from Washington Square Park SERVICE - 5 stars...really enthusiastic and knowledgeable...we were never steered wrong TOTAL - 5 stars...glad you came across the bay, Tony, my goombah!

They don't need another raving review but I'm gonna give it to them anyway. Went on an unassuming Sunday night and there was still an hour wait for the two of us - always a good sign. We opted to grab a drink at the nearby bar and they were nice enough to call us when our table. Great cocktail selection, with interesting little blurbs on their talented bartenders. We ordered the Margherita (though they had already sold the limited amount with the specific flour that supposedly make it tha bomb) and it was extremely tasty. Also ordered the lamb pizza, which was succulent, rich but delicious. Next time, because there definitely needs to be a next time, I will order a Sicilian style since I can totally get down on some thick crust. The only minor disappointment was the salad with walnuts, olives, and gorgonzola. Dressing was too heavy and the greens seemed on the wilted side. I also wasn't super woo-ed over by their dessert selections so I skipped, which is rare.  But hey, I wasn't coming here for the salad or the desserts....

Let's be honest here.  I wasn't jumping out of my seat with anticipation when I heard a new pizza place was opening up in my neighborhood last year.  This is North Beach, also known as Little Italy.  Ho hum. I couldn't have been more wrong. My curiosity piqued upon hearing they offered a pizza making class.  That would make a great experience with a group of friends.  Unfortunately, it costs a few hundred dollars for the evening class.  Weekend classes cost a few thousand.  Clearly this was something for those with large disposable incomes, food adorers, and professional chefs. What I didn't realize at the time was that Tony is a world class pizza chef.  He won the World Pizza Cup in Nepal, Italy a few years ago - the first American to ever do so.  What's more interesting is that he brought over the same make and model of pizza oven he used in Italy!  And he imports the ingredients.  The result is delicious pizza with tastes that are truly unique to this part of the world. One word of warning: The Neapolitan Pizza says it feeds 2-3 people.  That really means 2-3 professional rugby players.  That pie will easily feed 4 normal humans or 12 super models.

As Rinky said in her review, Anna C. introduced us and Marian G. to Tony's.  The restaurant itself has been open since the end of June, while the pizza school in the back has been here much longer.  Despite being so new, it feels well established, thanks in part to the fact that the building looks and feels like old-time North Beach, but also because service is seamless and attentive.  It's nicely situated on the corner of Stockton and Union and is divided into two rooms.  You enter the room containing a long bar and several booths.  Up a couple of steps to the right is another room that contains the pizza oven and several tables.  Behind the pizza oven in a separate room is the pizza school. Rinky has already given an excellent description of our meal and of the margherita pizza.  They make Italian-style, American-style and Sicilian-style pizzas.  I loved the Sicilian-style Fratellanza crust, which was thick, almost focaccia-like, w/ a seductive crispness to the bottom w/o a hint of black.  The tomato sauce was piquant, the cheese made strings like the mozzarella of my childhood and the pepperoni, salami and sausage were abundant.  The mushrooms were wonderful.   The round pizzas are served on beautiful Italian ceramic pedestal dishes that could be used as cake stands. The Sicilian pizzas are oblong and served in the pans they're baked in.  I ordered iced tea and had a choice of sweetened raspberry or bottled and very slightly sweetened Tazo black tea.  I chose the latter and it was perfect, what I would expect from Tazo.   Anna ordered meatballs to take home to her husband and I followed suit.  A container of 6+ good size meatballs w/ sauce cost only $5!   Portions are generous and dishes are well prepared.  Sometimes when I go out w/ these ladies the company outshines the food.  In this case, they enhanced and complimented each other.  We had a great time together as always and ate exceedingly well.  If I lived in San Francisco I'd be over here all the time. Tonight for dinner Alan and I shared the three pieces of pizza and the meatballs, a little pasta and the brussels sprouts I cooked yesterday.  It was a sumptuous repast.  Even reheated, the pizza was excellent, although not as revelatory as it was straight from the pizza oven.  The meatballs were delicious and their texture was exquisite.  The sauce was flavorful.  It's been many years since we spent much time in North Beach, but this was so delicious, I don't think it will be that long before I find a way to come back.

I've heard of this place for a while from my GF who loves East Coast- style Pizza. She thinks Chicago kind is "cake", should not be called as Pizza. " Or you can call it Jiveass Pizza." Well, I don't want to put my self into between Chicago and East Coast. But there are people who thinks Chicago pizza is jiveass. Fine. I know the feeling. I have been out spoken of Jiveass rolls are such a pseudo sushi. And keep sayin' that Jiveass rolls are disgusting crap. But, situation of Chicago Pizza is totally different. How different? It's a big difference because Jiveass rolls are basically using cheap part of old raw Tuna, Salmon and Hamachi camouflaged by stinky hot red sauce and Japanese Tonkatsu sauce mix with Mayo. The mix hot sauce is the key of Jiveass rolls. It needs the hot sauce to eat the old fish. I'll say it again. So, What's on Jiveass rolls? CHEAP PART OF OLD RAW FISH. Ugh. If you like those pseudo sushi places on the list,  you should be glad that you are still alive. http://www.yelp.com/list… Sorry, I was talking about Pizza. We went to Tonny's Pizza week ago at night about 7. That was a mistake because it was 1 hour waiting list. So we went back there on Saturday afternoon, about 2:30, we got seats right then. My GF was here before had the signature Pizza Margherita so she wanted something else. So we had: NY Sausage and Pepper, $15 3 meat balls, $5 Italian Fries, $7 Caesar salad, $10 I am a sucker for meatballs, so I had to have it. 3 for $5, 6 for $7. The meat balls were big, good and soft with the juicy killer tomato sauce on it but we were glad we ordered 3. Fresh cooked hot Italian Fries. The pizza was ... I loved that making a sound when I bite, and the juicy tomato sauce came out with fresh pepper and smoky sausage. Perfect! This place has 4 different ovens. This place is really serious for Pizza. Classic Italian, Classic American, Sicilian Style and Limit 73 per day Margherita Pizza. I don't know how many times I have to come back here again to get all Pizza at Tony's but I want to try them all.

Service on the other hand is mixed, some waiters are very good, and some are just average or worse. We got the latter kind. Our server's name was Moon. He seemed more interested on the tip that he was going to get for our large food order. - didn't ask if this was our first time at this restaurant - didn't explain the different types of pizza - didn't explain that the Calamari Calabrese style was a spicy option We overheard the waitress for the table behind us providing all that information to her customers without being asked to. I'd call that good service, unlike our waiter. He just repeated to us "Do you want to order more?" a couple of times, even though we had ordered plenty. I thought that was pushy. He took a very long time to get our drinks (our table was next to the bar), but when we got them one of them was incorrect. We didn't complain because we just wanted to have a good time. Later I found that I got charged an extra drink (both the wrong drink and correct drink we never got had been billed). The most outrageous part was when I got my statement, the total for this meal included a few extra cents more than what I had approved (I usually round up totals, no cents). I guess he wanted to roundup his tip to the nearest dollar. Not worth my time to complain to them, other than writing about it here.

What's the most frightening thing ever? It's the moment before you faint because of low blood sugar. I know this as fact as I once spent a night in the hospital because I "forgot to eat". You will experience some major hunger pangs here as you wait for a table. But do yourself a favor and eat something before coming here or otherwise you will end up doing a face plant on the pavement.

Tony's only makes 73 of their World Pizza Cup winning Pizza Margheritas a day so you know when you're there for the first time and it's in stock, you gotta get it. This winning pie uses San Felice Flour (apparently that's special) and cooks for only 90 seconds in a 900 degree oven. 90 seconds! So while waiting 90 seconds for our pie, they served us complimentary house bread with 3 dipping sauces. The first was olive oil with chopped raw garlic, the second was plain olive oil, and the third was olive oil with some pesto. The garlic one was the big winner. The house bread was fantastic and consisted of two types - a focaccia which had a nice flavor and big slices of something like pugliese. I have to say the pizza looked beautiful with lots of bright red tomatoes, big splotches of fresh mozz, and basil leaves. The crust texture was perfect but was a little on the bitter side. (That crust bitterness reminded me of Lombardi's in New York.) Overall the pie was actually a little bland. I prefer shredded basil to get better basil coverage and thus more basil per bite. Oddly enough even though it was a little bland, there were some bites that were overly salty. These are minor criticisms because I thought the pie was very good on the whole. I just see ways for improvement. FYI: The Marg is $18 and on the small side for feeding two people. It only comes in one size. The server was really friendly and knowledge about their pizzas. I didn't like that the busser refilled our glasses by lifting them up by the top where we put our mouths. They obviously put a lot of care and respect into the pizzas and ingredients and I really would like to come back. There are THREE award winning pizzas on Tony's menu (the Marg, the Sicilian, and their Cal Italia), but next time I would definitely want to try their (non-award winning) New York or New Jersey style pizzas. My Top 6 Pizzerias in the Bay Area: 1) Little Star, San Francisco 2) Pie in the Sky, Berkeley 3) Zachary's, Berkeley/Oakland/San Ramon 4) Patxi's, Palo Alto/San Francisco 5) Speederia, San Carlos 6) TONY'S PIZZERIA NAPOLETANA, SAN FRANCISCO 6th best! Pretty good!

4.5 Stars Hey, TO-nay! *cocks collar* We finally made it over here on a warm Friday afternoon.  I was really looking forward to it.  Having eaten at Tony's Castro Valley Pyzanno's all the time, I was ready to taste something more traditional.   We walked in just after 1pm and were seated quickly, baby in tow, on the dining side of the restaurant, instead of the bar side.  While the bar side may have a game on to watch, and you might get your drinks quicker, it just wasn't that appealing due to the low light atmosphere; ask to be seated on the other side...much brighter and you get to see the pizzaiolo at work. We started off with a Caesar salad, to get a little greens in our meal.  It was one of the best Caesar salads that I've eaten. Not too heavy on the dressing, and the greens were bite size.  The shaved parmagiano reggiano topped it all off. We came for the authentic Margherita and it did not disappoint.  The authentic Italian imported ingredients really sets it apart from all other pizzas in the area.  Not too mention that a 900 degree wood-fired oven also helps out in charring the crust just right.  The crust was thin, with a little crispness, and some good chew consistency.  The sauce was perfect.  The mozzarella, basil, sea salt, and olive oil all added to the perfection beautifully.  The middle does tend to sag due to the sauce, but to me, that's normal. We had also ordered a Prosciutto e Pomodorini pizza, which is cooked in an Italian domed brick oven with similarly fresh ingredients of Prosciutto di Parma, arugula, and heirloom cherry tomatoes.  I was a little put off at first when it came to our table. The crust's edge looked like it had been formed, almost mimicking a Pizza Hut-style pizza.  I thought it should've looked like the Napoletana-style, a little flatter, but it reminded me of his pizzas at Pyzanno's.  Taste wise, the toppings selection were great on this. The crust is a little thicker than the Napoletana, but it was good.  We didn't really get to finish this, but upon taking it home and re-heating it on the grill, it was excellent.  I preferred the wood-fired Napoletana-style better though. We didn't experience any of the bad service from staff that some cried about.  Everyone seem to be friendly and helpful, especially since we had our little one with us.  I thought for a moment that Tony was goin' to serve up #32 (or whatever # it was) of 73 to us, but alas, he skipped our table.  I'm sure this  place gets busy later in the evening, so you do risk waiting (especially if you plan to have a large party, but don't intend to make reservations ahead of time).  I definitely want to come back to try the other pies (New Haven being one of them) and the pasta.

What's this? ANOTHER pizza review? Yeah yeah, I know...but hey, I like me some pie. Tony's has been on my 'must try' list since opening. Do you want to know how serious Tony is about his pizza? He has FOUR different pizza ovens...you want Sicilian? It's going in a different oven than the Neapolitan. And coming out on a different (square) pan. So here we are, trying to decide which to try and how many. We are told two should be fine for our table of four so of course we go ahead and order three with the intention of taking home leftovers. There were no leftovers. We went with the famous Margherita (my favorite), the Diavola con Rucola (Hot Red Pepper Oil, Salami Picante, Arugula) and the Salsiccia (Mozzarella, Garlic, Fresh Italian Sausage, Oregano) I would order any of these pies again. A couple of things: Tony's can get packed but don't let that scare you off. Go during off hours (4pm on a Saturday maybe) or give the cute hostess your phone number and head over to Tony Nik's for a cocktail while you wait. Hell, if you can find a seat at the bar you might want to belly up and order a pie for yourself. You never know, I just might be sitting next to you digging into a Margherita.

Tony's is definitely up there in my book along with Tomasso (thought I actually think the pizza at Tomasso's is better, and it's also not as touristy...).  It's a lovely place to take out of town guests for awesome, delicious, pizza, right in the heart of North Beach.   Our party of 8 arrived right around 645 pm and was told the wait would be an hour to an hour and 1/2.  The friendly and cute hostess took down my number, stated she would call when it's ready and off to Rogue we went for some brews. Just about 35 minutes and one beer later, the hostess calls us to tell us our table is ready and that we lucked out with a corner table right by the window!  We arrive and she profusely apologizes that there was a table of 10 that she needed to seat in the first table that was reserved for us. No big deal, but it was nice that she was so apologetic.  So we immediately get seated at a table right next to the original one. Sadly, they were out of the world famous margherita pizza, but not a problem as that's never my pizza of choice--bring on the meat!  We split a lot of different items: -Quattro Formaggio -- delicious pizza loaded with multiples types of cheese (probably my least fav pizza) -Rotelli pasta -- which comes with Pesto Sauce, Sun Dried Tomatoes, Marinated Artichoke Hearts, Mozz, Parmigiano.  This was awesome, but definitely a heavier pasta dish. -Penne -- Arrabiata  with a very Spicy Bolognese Sauce, Calabrese Peppers, Sliced Fennel Sausage.  Loved this pasta dish, but be careful if you're not into spicy food. Scarola con Pancetta -- my favorite pizza that came served with crushed red pepper, mozz, pancetta, goat cheese, escarole, and sweet picante peppers. Sooooo SPICY! Be careful! :) -Romano's original 1950s Stromboli -- this was also pretty awesome.  Super filling, it was filled with Ham, Sliced Italian Sausage, Pepperoni, Sweet Peppers, Mozzarella, American Cheese. Serivce was great, prices are a bit steep, but the pizza is awesome and the atmosphere is great.  Good spot for large parties and the bar would be perfect for 2 ppl.

In a great foodie city like San Francisco. Whenever you park your car in the heart of North Beach. You place yourself in a location that has probably some of the best dining options in the city. If you like great food (most likely Italian), photo worthy upbeat ambiance, with outstanding service. You will find all these things. On this particular occasion I came in to Tony's pizza restaurant. A pizza school on Mondays and Tuesdays, a really cool restaurant Wednesdays thru Sundays. My waitress Amy was really down to earth. My kinda peoples. The hostess Nadia was super cool and cute. The hip and popular pizza these days is the gourmet style pizza, thin crust, quality toppings, and impeccable sauce. Tony's pizza is all of the above. Calamari is a must. I know a restaurant is good when every dish that passes by me, I think to myself, I want to be those people over there or next time I'm ordering that! Is this thin crust, hip, gourmet pizza phenomenon the future of pizza? Well the Old classic Mr. Pizza man or Bravo's pizza will always have a place in my heart.  But Tony's is a welcomed addition to my list of restaurants for my ever expanding stomach and ever expanding places to have an enjoyable evening.

Came to Tony's yet again. This time brought Mom who said "she didn't want pizza" however one bite convinced her otherwise. We started with their mixed salad ($10) a large rectangular plate full of mixed greens, arugula, gorgonzola cheese, dried cranberries and apples. I had my favorite: the Cal Italia ($18). On the menu it is listed as an Italian-style crust pizza with asiago, mozzarella, gorgonzola, parmigiano, prosciutto and fig preserve swirled beautifully on top. Delightful combination of salty and sweet. I also got my favorite Sierra Nevada Pale Ale ($5). It was one of those days where I deserved it. What blew me away this time was the service. We were seated at the booth in the very back. You know the one, right next to the unmarked restroom. My mom, being my mom, complained about the restroom odor emanating every few minutes when someone would come or go. So one of the waitpeople (not our waiter) moved us to the Chef's counter in the next room. It was a treat watching how the pizzas are made! They even had one guy tossing the pizza dough in the air - I only saw this stuff in movies. One of the co-owners came over to check up on us to make sure we were happy and apologized for what happened. She even bought us drinks on the house. Well, I have convinced my mom that, yes, pizza is a well-respected and delicious meal. Especially when you come to Tony's. ---------- PS. Fellow Yelper Manabu and his friends took the booth that my mom and I vacated! Didn't realize it until after the fact, however my mom saw them...small world!

Caution: tourist trap. Fourty-four minute wait on a weekday night after 7:30pm. How good can pizza be? And I love pizza. They do take your cellular number down and call you when a table is ready. They did make it convenient to wander and there is a lot to do in walking distance. In the end, we were too hungry to wait fourty five minutes for dinner and our hunger won.

It'd almost be a NYC slice if this joint was open until 3AM or 4AM, but 11PM is kind of a lame closing time.  Timing aside, it's still pretty tasty.  I really like how they have  a limited selection of a basic slice or two and then some special with exotic ingredients.  Dare I even say this is better than a full pie from the sit down restaurant next door... Pepperoni: I was actually looking for a plain cheese so I could have a neutral specimen to compare against my 6.5 years in NYC.  They didn't have any so I settled for the pepperoni.  I must say, this is the closest I've had to a NYC slice in San Francisco, even better than Arinell.  They reheat the slices to order which creates that nice crispy bottom of the slice texture.  The thin dough, very thin sauce layer and generous cheese seemed in the right NYC ratios.  The coal added some personality, similar to the soot of a popular gas oven in a NYC pizzeria.  The pepperoni itself was a little disappointing, tiny and folding upwards like something on a frozen pizza.  Why can't they use the bigger rounds?   Purple Potato, Pancetta, Feta: It's nice that they felt confident to own a San Francisco-style slice with ingredients you'd never find in Manhattan.  The heirloom purple potato with fancy-smancy pancetta melded very well together.  I can easily see myself getting fat because each time I come here I'd want a traditional flavor and their innovative special.

best pizza in the city, easily.  I've been waiting a while to write this review to get multiple samplings of the margherita here.  and a good amount of the other pizzas on the menu. had margheritas at both delfina and tony's in the same week.  delfina's pizza lacked a good distribution of basil, and the sauce soaked through the crust in the middle.  tony's sauce tasted better, had just enough sea salt, did not soak through the crust, had good basil distribution, and just enough fior de latte.  easily the winner.  and consistent over the 4 times I've had it. Their truffle pizza (when they have truffles) is amazing.  the actual shaved truffle amount varied between the two times I've had it, but it was still awesome.  they have different types of truffles depending on the season.    note:  they have wild mushrooms on the pizza.  I hate mushrooms, but the truffles completely overpowered the mushrooms so I didn't have to taste any of them hahaha. Other pizzas I've had here: margherita extra:  similar to the margherita, but with the addition of cherry tomatoes, that add a beautiful caramel note, a buffalo mozzarella, and a different flour for the crust. prosciutto e pomodorini:  prosciutto and cherry tomatoes.  tomato sauce is standard with all classic italian pizzas.  quite tasty.  probably my favorite non-margherita. quail egg and speck:  good, but needed something juicy to balance.  (speck is cured beef).   puttanesca:  ANCHOVIES!! ;D  olives, capers, etc, with tomato sauce.  a little salty (anchovies, garlic, capers...hm), but since I love anchovies, it's all good. Cal Italia:  gorgonzola, fig preserve, prosciutto.  This was way too sweet I think.  made for almost a dessert pizza. Quattro Formaggio (four cheese):  asiago, ricotta, mozzarella, parmigiano, with tomato sauce.  so much cheese on this pizza that the crust couldn't hold it up.  great combination of fresh cheeses--simply classic. Diavola con Rucolo:  red peppers, spicy salami.  A little too spicy without anything to balance.  but still good. cholula (american style):  chicken, pork chorizo (mexican), jalapeno's, and tomato sauce.  spicy, flavorful, tasty. still a thin crust, but not like the classic margherita. romana:  this was basically 3 pizzas in one.  the cal italia, spicy salami with parmigiano, and olive and cherry tomatoes.  The salami part needed something juicy to offset things--we thought the cherry tomatoes from the other section worked great.  the olive side needed some tomato sauce.  the cal italia was actually not as sweet as the full pizza so was good.

There's probably a little more hype behind this pizzeria than necessary, but they do live up to it.  If you like pizza in the "Nabolidan" style, give this one a try.  The trick is to get there before there's any sort of a crowd.  We noticed on our visit at 3:00 on a Saturday afternoon that the hostesses were having a helluva time getting organized. Service from our primary server started off well, she seemed very hospitable, and engaging, but after that we never saw her again until check-time.  Subsequent food and drink orders were handled by any other server passing by. Props for the cool Peroni glasses served from the bar. And the meatball appetizer was almost a meal in itself.  Nice zesty sauce, and deliciously spiced meatballs. The Gorgonzola fries were interesting, but they ought to work on a way to deliver them hot, not tepid as we got them.  Perhaps the cheese drizzle cools them off, not sure.  But we did devour them, so not going to ding them for that. And then of course, the pizza.  Brick oven is certainly the way to go.  The crust was very thin and light.  The toppings simple and delicious.  I'm sure we could have easily put another one away, but maybe next time.

Yummers to the max.  Ordered a pizza to go and despite being super busy, the host was patient and even separated our pizza into 2 smaller boxes to fix on our motorcyle. After reheating it at home I nearly fainted from the cheese, crust, sauce, and basil.  If it's this good reheated, I can only imagine how tasty it is straight from the oven at the resto.  Margherita was magnificent.  Definitely want to return and try the other dishes.   Believe the hype, it's that good.

Tony's is San Francisco's latest pizza darling.  It's undoubtedly the best pizza in North Beach, but I don't think it's the city's best.  They serve a thin, but chewy crust with several different flavorful topping combinations.  Personally, I prefer a more blistery crust, which is actually how the pizza looks on their website. We had three different pizzas among the five of us, and we each had our favorites.  Mine was the Cal Italia (a salty blend of sharp cheeses paired with a super sweet fig spread).  I would have much preferred fresh figs (obviously not now in season), but it was still a nice combination.  Others preferred the simplicity of the Margherita.  The worst of the lot was the Salsiccia. Good pizza and a good environment, but not quite the award winner I was expecting.

There's a fine line a Yelper walks, between wanting to hoot and holler in support of their new-found favorite eatery, and the temptation to keep one of the award-winning Margherita pizzas to themselves. After all with only so many made per day, it's only natural for one to want to be play the selfish card here... But, alas. When a gem is sooo amazing, it isn't meant to be treasured for only one....it really should be shared with all. Tony's Pizza is among one of those rare SF gems, and aside from being closed on Monday's and Tuesday's... I can't find much fault at all. PIZZA: * Margherita- God bless me, I must be back in Rome. Tony's simple, yet absolutely perfected and deserved award-winner. * Cal Italia- Unique, mouth watering flavor comes on this award-winner, with Sweet Fig preserve, Prosciutto, Asiago & Gorgonzola goodness. * Salsiccia- Sausage, Garlic, Oregano, Oh my! SIDES: *Deep Fried String Beans are the best tasting veggies...don't carry the weight of being "deep fried"...but are crispy deliciousness. *Sauteed Spinach- Popeye taught me well, and Tony does a body good. Tony's brilliance and pizza art is simple, classic and straightforward.... So what's with the 73/day Margherita limit? Is that just part of his Italian mystery? That fine line has been crossed, and clearly this secret is no secret at all... so now it's up to me to make sure that one of those 73 have my name on it. Tips- Tony won't take your reservation, but will call you when your table is ready. Sitting outdoors is nice, but you compromise service. While you wait, Joe Dimaggio's has a great happy hour- $5 drinks & apps (just don't ruin your appetite!) ...or bring a bottle of vino, chill in Washington Square and be entertained by the lovely NB vagrants :)

Finally, my kid and I ate at Tony's. Jonny didn't want to go to The City for a pizza. "Can't we just go the Cheese Board (Berkeley) and do carryout from the Communists?" Uh, he must have gotten that from his Mother. So, I talked him into taking BART, buying him a hat at Lids (we had to go to the San Francisco Shopping Centre and Powell Street stores), and make it an adventure via Cable Car. Jonny immediately sits down with his new green SF Giants' hat to the side, snags at table, and from there, commands, "Hey Dad, get a Pepperoni!" After my home-girl, Courtney B., Yelped "hoot and holler" about the pizza here, trekking all the way to North Beach, and bought a $35 baseball hat (it's pretty dope), I will be damned if I get a Pepperoni. While my kid sat at at table fussing with the roll-ups, the Cali Italia was in the oven. The smell of the store was wonderful. I kept glancing up to see if the next pie coming out was ours. Cali Italia landed. Jonny just dug in and catered the pizza. Despite the piping hot melting Parmesan and Mozzarella and carmelized figs, he downed two slices in about a minute. It was so savory with the Prosciutto, with a hint of Balsamic. The crust was just as Yelped by many, thin, crisp, and tasty. Quietly, I gave a "hoot and holler." It was really great! "So, how do you like it?" I asked my son, thinking I knew the answer. Jonny declared, "It was sooooo good! And I just loved the ham! Was that pineapple on it?" WTF?

If there is one thing I'm rapidly coming to terms with, it's my aging keester on a bar stool at dinner. Oh hey, it's not what you think. The Birthday Boy wanted to stop by and check out the Margherita pizza, and I'm not one to stand in the way of a birthday wish, even with plenty of people lined up for tables in the middle of a Saturday afternoon. We were offered bar seating and without hesitation, St. Hubbins headed to the end of the bar to maximize his view of the room, among other things. But wait. Maybe your assumptions were correct. From the moment we sat down, it was clear the bartenders knew what they were doing. So while the Birthday Boy wanted a draft Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, I just had to sample some of the offerings on the cocktail menu. First up, the Aviator. Before the pizza had even arrived, I was already planning our next visit on the merit of this drink alone. Fortunately, the pizza arrived before I could finish and order another. With palate cleansed, it was time to order another round. This time I tried the House Negroni. I truly appreciated the bartender's fair warning regarding one of the ingredients, Campari, as he considered it an acquired taste and offered to prepare another drink if I didn't like this one. Well, all I can say is: what's not to like?! But this was supposed to be a review about the award-winning pizza. So ok, we really did like the pizza, the service was great and we expect to return from time to time to work our way through the restaurant offerings we didn't select today. And who knows, we might even sit at a table. I think the Birthday Boy might be having afterthoughts about my increasing acceptance of the bar as dinner table. Because right now, he's online shopping for creme de violette, maraschino liqueur, and Campari. Hee, Happy Birthday to ME!

Tony is a maximalist. Sicilian pizzas at Tony's (nor any pizza here) do not serve two people, despite what the menu says. One will serve a rhino, a goat, a Central American militia, and the entire Carmorra mafia. We ordered the Cal Italia, and it was served on a gigantic cookie sheet that would make Mrs. Fields herself blush.  Forgetting size for a moment, it was delicious.  The crust was a perfect crunchiness.  A side of spinach was unnecessary in terms of having extra food, but yummy and a good break from gorging on the pizza.  Slugging back one of my favorite italian wines, Nero d'Avola, made this pizzaphile very happy. Service was great! The hostess gave a call a few minutes before the table was ready, the waitress was helpful (except for not mentioning the SIZE of the pizza :), and it was great to see a packed pizzeria of pleased as punch people, pigging on pizza (and beer).

For the past eight or so years I've lived in California, I've been searching for good, New York-worthy pizza. Or even good, New Jersey-worthy pizza. But pizzeria after pizzeria yielded disappointment--biscuit crusts, soggy crusts, disgustingly dense Chicago-style pizza . . . Pizza Orgasmica, Patxi's, all those places that San Franciscans rave about were, in my opinion, just a step above Celeste frozen pizza. (Don't even mention Roundtable to me). Even after pizza became the latest food trend in San Francisco, I couldn't find that elusive pizza. Hey, I figured, there had to be one downside (besides sky-high sales tax, income tax, and property prices) to living in California. And then I found Tony's Pizza Napoletana. Well, "found" it after about a million other people and the World Pizza Championship in Naples declared Tony's the best pizza in the world. That's right: THE WORLD. And I'm never going back to those other almost-good-enough places. Between five of us, we had two pizzas--the Margherita (but we weren't early enough to get one of the 73 World Pizza Championship-winning pizza margheritas made daily) and the Americana. That was enough for everyone else, but I could have eaten my own whole pizza. Next time, I probably will.

My favorite restaurant in my neighborhood! Some of the best pizza i have had on the west coast, which is saying a lot since i'm originally from the east coast. Be sure to get their famous and award winning margherita pizza and truffle fries. Everything on the menu is great and the service is quick and friendly. Tough place to get into any night they're open but they are quick to accommodate you and call you as soon as they have something available. Even if you have to wait an hour it is well worth it!

errrrrrrrr I blindly picked a dinner place before we headed off to our concert so we were hopeful. The conditions seemed perfect. We found street parking close by, it was right on the corner of an active nighttime neighborhood, we were hungry, we were in good spirits. So we had someone put us on the waitlist before we even arrived and we were told 45 minutes. We get there to check and we were told 45 minutes, still. We walk around for a while and checked back to be told 20 minutes. We check once more and we were told 5 minutes. We did not get a table until 15 minutes after that and the best we got was a table outside in the freezing cold because their heat lamps are not coming in until next week. I will add that we had several servers and each one seemed very courteous and apologetic about the temperature and wait. Sure, the pizza here is pretty damn good and reasonably priced for it being gourmet and all, but it was not worth the wait. I would come back to try the stromboli and scicilian styled pizza.

We stopped by this place because we had read that Tony won some kind of "World Pizza Contest".  The first thing we notice is that it's very busy, the second is that the Margarettas are great.  We love the food and can't wait to come back. Peace

The pizza here is excellent. Don't come in expecting a typical boxed pizza with typical boxed pizza pricing... this is the real stuff! If you time it right and go and somewhat of an odd hour for a meal, you can avoid a long wait. We came in around 3pm and only waited 10 minutes. Unfortunately, the hostess we had was actually quite horrible, to be honest, and was not the best person to start off our visit.  She made us and other customers wait as we watched he slip her tips/money into her purse and kept calling people on the phone before helping us customers standing right in front of her.  Thankfully, we didn't have to deal with her once we got seated. Tony, the owner and head chef, is awesome! We sat near the oven and he was nice enough to ask us how our meal was. Overall, it was great!

Yanny and I tried Tony's Pizza Napoletana.  It's in North Beach across from Washington Park on Stockton & Union. I took Bart after work, got off Montgomery Bart, walked up Montgomery to Columbus, turned on Green to Union/Stockton.  About 20 min walk each way. FREE tap water.  FREE sliced foccacia bread & other bread w/ 3 dipping sauce.  Foccacia was a bit greasy, olive oil w/ garlic fine. We got 2 pizzas.  Each pizza we got had 6 slices, enough for 2 hungry people. Appetizer we got: 3 meatballs for $5.  I thought the 1.5 I tried were fine.  Red sauce is a bit salty, meat tender, but bland. Margherita pizza - $18.  Menu says 73 made a day.  It came out pretty fast.  It's thin slices, but very limp when I picked it up and the olive oil dripped onto the plate.  Cheese & basil was just ok.  Award winner? - well, not for me. Cal Italia pizza $18 - this pizza was a bit better.  Thicker, sweeter.  Asago cheese w/ some prosciutto.  Just ok.  Award winner - meh. Two unisex bathrooms in the back past the bar. We had leftovers:  I had 2 slices of Cal Italia & 1 slice Margherita plus some crust.  We asked for boxes and boxed ourselves.  Always do that!! Just ok, nothing special here.

Nothing like going out to North Beach for pizza after watching a Giants game on a warm sunny day. My friend and me had a recommendation to go to Tony's Pizza Napoletana for a early dinner. It must have been the right choice because Joe and Jennifer Montana were just leaving as we arrived. The bad thing is there was an 1 hr wait but fortunately they had seating at the bar which was less crowded. I wanted to order the award winning Margherita pizza but they only had so much of the dough so I was out of luck. I order the Americano pizza which was a meat and veggie combination while my friend order the spaghetti and meatballs. The tomato sauce was very good, the toppings very fresh and I especially liked the thin crust. I can't wait for breakfast because I am having the leftovers...yumms. An added treat was the starter basket of bread, garlic bread plus a tray of garlic, pesto and olive oil to spread. Thanks to Steph the bartender who also did a great job on breaking down the menu and providing very good service. Defintely worth coming back to.

I live around the corner from here, and literally watched the place get built.  Back then all i could think was "here we go... another business ready to fail at this same cursed location".  plus it's pizza in NB, so the competition is fierce... kind of like fighting a raptor with a toothbrush; you're not supposed to win ya know? After reading some yelp reviews, I gathered the courage, grabbed the GF and made it here.  Decently long wait, but they'll take your cell phone and call you when the tables ready.  AWESOMe! The ambiance here is nice.  Slightly dim lighting in the front room (with a bar) and in the back you're immediately drawn to the two tall cooks (Tony and friend) in front of a large dome wood fire.   I'll get the negative stuff out first.  I wasn't a big fan of the service.  A bit slow, never really there at the right moments, and eh.. i was just displeased.  we had the seat RIGHT next to the kitchen though, so it might have been due to that.  I'll be back and hopefuly re-review wiht 5 stars.... one plus was that the cooks run your food so you can ask them anything you want! AH the food.  After some thought, we decided to get an appetizer and 2 pizzas.  Screw the salad!! The fried green beans were awesome.  Don't be surprised when they aren't deep fried (cause I was)... these bad boys are pan sauteed with garlic and butter.  YUM Naturally we went with the raved about Margherita pizza and then also the Cal Italia pizza.  When Tony comes by to check how everything is (I assure you he will) ask him WHY they only serve 74 of the margherita a day.  Wierd number isn't it? The pizza was amazing. incredible. Lifechanging. Orgasmic.  The margherita was good, though in my opinion a bit plain.  I think the authenticity of it and the challenge of improving the taste with so few ingredients is what makes the award it received so special...  don't go for the gimmick, get the pizza you think you'll love.  Delicious cheese, the sauce was perfect and though I could have used a bit more basil, the slices that had it were awesome. The Cal Italia was just OUT of this world.  There's some fig on it which adds a really nice sweet flavor.  I added some chili pepper flakes to get that sweet spicy feel (personal favorite) and dear lord I couldnt believe the torrents of pleasure racking my body (seriosly! my GF got jealous i liked this pizza so much).   The menu was stacked with different types of pizzas baked in different types of ovens so I know there's plenty more for me to try.  I was eying the sausage one (italian style of course) so just get out of my way if you see me! I'll be back without a doubt and TRULY hope that the service is just a bit better so I can give 5 stars guilt free.

First, let's get this out of the way. I grew up in Brooklyn. Not only have I had all the well-known slices in NYC, I am also one of those obnoxious New Yorkers who believes that the corner joint in my neighborhood "has the best pizza out of any of those fancy places." I love pizza. When I go back to Brooklyn, the first thing I do is order a fresh pie from Vesuvio's (the aforementioned corner joint) before I even say hello to my family. So when I moved out to San Francisco, a lot of friends offered to take me to pizza places that would remind me "of New York pizza." I HATE having to be the pizza snob, but it's unavoidable with my upbringing and Italian heritage: Most of the pizza places they took me to were between terrible and meh. And then there is Tony's. I had the pleasure of eating here last weekend and I will definitely be coming back soon. The ambience: You walk into the place and you immediately know that you have entered 'a scene.' The patrons all have a look of excitement on their faces because of the fabulous things they have heard and there are more than a few people on their own at the bar, huddled over a personal pie because, as I have been guilty of in the past, they had the need for good pizza and couldn't find anyone else to come with. The hostess told my date and I to expect a 20-25 minute wait but we weren't halfway through our (quality) glasses of dolcetto when she brought us to our table. Now, the menu. Four ovens and four different pizza styles. But let's be honest (die-hards, please skip over the next few sentences): who the heck really knows the difference between classic Italian and classic American style pizza? You just want a good pizza. Your attention is immediately drawn to the famous margherita pizza because, like any good infomercial, Tony's informs you to ACT NOW before the only 73 pies they make for the day are long gone. Gotta say, it works like a charm, we had to have the margherita. We started with the bruschetta. It wasn't anything that I would say you need to try before dying, but it was tasty. because, well, it was bruschetta. The presentation with thick dots of balsamic vinegar and olive oil on the border of the plate was a nice touch. The margherita...ah the margherita. So much better than I expected. The cheese was so perfectly melted and soft that it absorbed the sauce like a velvety sponge. It was the kind of cheese-sauce combo that just slides off the slice, letting you know you are in for a gooey, messy treat. The basil was also an amazing complement. The oiliness of the pizza sauteed the basil, preventing that overpowering taste that can sometimes suffocate the cheese and the sauce. The crust was soft but we ate it (rather, inhaled it) before it could get soggy. Overall, the pizza was just too freaking good. We had one of those meals where there is minimal talking and a whole lot of chewing. I'd definitely put this pizza up against most NYC places. It's that good. I still need to try the rest of the menu, but this place has easily become my new tentative 'corner joint.' Each of the four ovens looks worthy of a sample. I can't wait to go back!

Busy busy busy - all the bar seats were filled and soon the booths. My sis and I were seated and ordered cheese pizza with pepperoni (her) and white wine mussels, with deep-fried string beans for me. The beans were delicious and covered with diced garlic but crunchy and good, enough for three hungry people. The mussels had the best taste I've tasted ever though the quantity was less (about 13 pieces), with two toasted bread slices but as they were placed IN the bowl and not on the plate below, it was very soaked BUT tasty!!! VERY busy to the last minute there!!!

This place ruined my boyfriend's birthday celebration. =( (Bad service, extra charges, not taking care of the cake, forgetting my friend's pizza) If customers really want to eat Tony's pizza, I'd suggest ordering it to go and enjoying it at the park across the street!  I don't think large groups should dine here. Details below... I came here to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday on a Saturday night.  I arrived around 5:50pm hoping to get a table for a party of 12 people.  I noticed this place is kind of small.  There is a bar on one side, and a pizza joint on the other side.   When the hostess saw that I was holding a cake, she graciously offered to put it in the fridge.  Since Tony's Pizza only seat complete parties, I had to put my name down and wait for a table. I didn't mind waiting for a table, since a lot of my friends did not arrive yet.  Finally at 7pm, we were seated at a booth and most of my friends arrived! We were all given menus immediately.  After a few minutes, the waitress stopped by to explain the different style of pizzas.  A few minutes later, she stopped by to asked if we had any questions.  It felt like we had to wait a long time  before she came back to our table.  When she stopped by the 3rd time, we were all ready to order.  My boyfriend and I decided to share the Truffle pizza ($38), which includes mozzarella, burrata, cowgirl creamery Mt. Tam triple cream cheese, wild mushrooms, arugula, parmigiano, and shaved truffle from Italy. While I was looking around, I noticed other tables had complimentary bread with olive oil.  I was disappointed that we did not get any. =(  My boyfriend mentioned the bread and oil was good the last time he was here.  ( Minus 1 star for not giving my table complimentary bread) We only had to wait about 15 minutes before most of our pizzas came out.  The truffle pizza was tasty.  I could barely taste the cream cheese, which is a good thing for me. =)  There were a few pieces of arugula on top of the pizza.  The shaved parmigiano slices on each slices was good, too. The crust on the bottom was a bit soggy and oily.  I could see olive oil on the plate when I picked up the slices. (See Picture)   One of my friends never got his pizza, so I had to ask our waitress about it.  She came back and told us that she forgot to put in his order!  I felt bad that my friend had to watch all of us eat our pizza.  He really had to wait about 20 minutes before his pizza came out.  It was nice that the female manager stopped by to apologize and offered us complimentary meatballs.  The meatballs were very juicy and flavorful.  When all of us were done with our pizzas, my friend's pizza finally came out.  We all had to watch him eat now..lol. After my friend finished, I told the waitress that I brought a cake.  She brought us plates and forks to our table.  A few minutes later, a female host brought over the birthday cake with candles on top.  Even though I taped a box of 20 candles on top, they only placed 10..lol. The female host offered to cut the cake, which I thought was really nice.  I'm used to cutting cakes at other restaurants for birthday parties, so I didn't mind cutting it for my boyfriend. =)  I noticed the icing was very soft and a bit gooey.  Based on the cake's texture, I think the host left our cake out of the fridge for about 3 hours while we were there.  Leaving the cake out when it is supposed to be in the fridge can really ruin the cake!  I was a bit sad about this when I was cutting the cake. =( (Minus one star for not putting the cake in the fridge after saying they would...it was an expensive cake, too) After we finished the cake, our bill came.  I noticed an 18% gratuity charge, which is common for huge groups.  Ok, no big deal.  After looking at the bill, I noticed a cake cutting fee ($2/person).  I thought this was a bit outrageous considering we did the cutting ourselves.  A few people shared a slice, so everyone should not get charged an additional $2.  I brought the cake and candles.  We only used their plates and fork.  I didn't feel this charge was justified.  After asking the waitress about this, I was glad they took it off our bill. (Minus one star for having the cake fee in the first place) I was suprised to see my friend's pizza still on the bill.  I assumed it would be complimentary considering he had to wait 20 minutes after all of us had our food.  Other restaurants would have totally made it complimentary. (Minus one star for bad service) Overall, the 1 star is for the very good pizza.  Customers should be aware of additional charges on the bill.  The pizzas are definitely expensive here.  I don't think its worth it to drive back to SF to get it though.  I can get the same quality pizza from La Pizzeria or Pizza Antica in the south bay.

In my humble opinion Tony's Neapolitan style pizzas enter into the upper echelon of the class of pizza makers such as Chris Bianco. Does it top Bianco? No.   However, just entering this class is an honor enough and, quite frankly, those that know their pizzas, this is all I have to say. This city needed this...big time. Nuts and Bolts: Staff-beyond excellent, ambiance-busy and inviting, ...overall experience: a must go...and become a regular. One bit of advice-the Sicilian style pizzas serve 4-5 and not 2 as listed...trust me.

What is the hype all about?!!! I'm confused. Ordered the margarita napoletana.... Ummm- typically if pizza is good, you can't pry the pie from my kung foo grip. I actually ate two slices and threw the rest away. Would have ate one, but wanted to make sure I wasn't missing something. Sauce was lacking big time!! Also, bottom of pizza was a little too charred and it overpowered the taste. Disappointed!

Just as good as Tony Neapalitan next door. During my visit I saw the owner Tony going back and forth the 2 restaurants. Good to see the chef of restaurant actually overseeing the place. Sadly some other restaurant do not. Wide range different pizza...           not the same dough and different toppings           not just classic and sicillian           just check out their website for details Small place with 1 table inside and 2 outside. It was perfect during the heat wave...Mid Oct 2010...the pizza didn't get cold outside!          I had the Original cheese slice and 1 meter ********(I will get the name and edit it in)

Tony's is good, but not five star good. The string bean appetizer was a nice dish to start off with, as were the small pieces of complimentary bread (just enough to not be too filling).  There's definitely some flavor to the pies, but between his award winning margherita and the plain ol' thin crust pesto, I'd have to go with the pesto.  Their carafe of red wine was also a slight disappointment.  We agreed that we should've stuck with doing glasses, which there were several choices of.  Better yet, share a bottle. I have mixed feelings about the service.  Our server was a bit too intrusive, coming up to the table a lil too frequently and doing unnecessary rambling on about the menu.  It's obvious that Tony's staff are there to make sure you are taken care of.  He himself was tending to the wood fired oven, and came over to ask if we needed anything when he noticed us waiting around for an awfully long time (scooping the ice cream for our dessert took an eternity; I doubt they were churning it by hand). It's worth a visit at least once for the pizza and the eye candy.  (Go for an early dinner, and you don't have to endure a wait.)  Although I don't consider it the best, it does make my Top Ten.  I'd dine there again if someone suggested it, but I'd rather stick to take-out.

I came here unwittingly to meet up with some friends, and was totally stunned. Now, I realize that no expectations are sometimes even easier to meet than low expectations, but this place is just great! Sat at the bar.  Bartender was super friendly, not just to me, but to everyone that came in-- a smile on her face and engaging in conversation, even when she was obviously busy.  Prompt service.  Perhaps the staff was so happy because the owner is also here a warm and friendly person!  Though I stuck to wine, I sampled my friends' drinks, and I must say this place has some tasty cocktails! Shared the Quail Egg pizza and the Cal Italia.  Adored the fig and the cheeses on the Cal Italia & the texture of the quail egg pizza was oddly tantalizing. ...wait--I wasn't even hungry when I got here! ...I don't even remember how many slices I downed--it was that gooooooood.  Thank god this place is a brisk walk away from where I live.  Cal Italia might be my new fave!

I look forward to working Friday nights now, because I know we're going to order the pizza from Tony's (which is around the corner from my work) I am in love with the Cholula pizza... Hot sauce in the pizza sauce, chicken, chorizo jalapenos onions and cheese, The crust is perfect and it is even good cold....if there is any left over...which is rare. I also love the margerita pizza wiith the gooey mozzerella...

It's finally happened! I've found the most authentic pizza in the city of San Francisco and it only took me 3 years to find it. Or 2.5 months since I've moved to North Beach. Tony, a young, talented, and friendly guy makes one of the best Margarita pizzas you'll ever have. Turns out, he's won numerous awards for his pie, sauce, and dough tossing skills...who knew? Well, now I do and I'll be coming here on the regular from now on. Ahhhh, a New Yorker CAN find heaven on the west coast. Mangia!!

No matter what variety of the nine kinds of pizza you can order here, you can be sure that it will be simple and delicious. They use good ingredients, don't overwhelm the sauce with cheap spices, and balance the toppings appropriately. I've been here three times and have loved it every single time. The service is really excellent and friendly, and the vibe is casual and relaxed. They have a full bar, a good wine list, and they also serve dangerously delicious bread with dipping sauces while you wait...

Awe, Tony, we had such high hopes.  Really, we did!  We were so looking forward to trying this much raved about Pizza. We drove around for nearly hour trying to find parking.  North Beach is crazy on a Saturday night.  Just as we were about to leave and come another time, we found Rock Star parking right in the front. It was about 7ish and there was a 45 minute wait, which wasn't too bad because we got to enjoy a nice glass of wine prior to sitting. We were sat in the side room where the woodfire oven is.  It was great being able to watch Tony in action.  The server was extremely knowledgable, pleasant and very attentive. We ordered their infamaous Margherita.  They only serve 73 of these a day.  So if you get there late, then they may run out.  We also ordered the Salsiccia. Let's start with the Margherita.  :/  This pie, was the 2007 World Pizza Cup winner in Naples, Italy.  :(  I guess a lot can happen in two years, either that or they were having an off night maybe?  The sauce was ok, but the crust was really thick and doughy and the flavor was lacking.  Overall, average to me.  I prefer lighter texture, light and crisp dough. The Salsiccia's crust was even thicker and doughier!  Not light and crisp, but thick and heavy.  :/  Not my style of pizza.  The flavor of the sausage was good though. :(  I wish I could give them more for the food, but, I'd be lying.  So, honestly, I think my overall experience is a 3.   Won't be rushing back.

I was looking forward to going to this place, but every link I found led me to Tony's Pizza Cooking School. We got an early table and were ready to order almost immediately, but could not decide what to do about wine, as we didn't really want to share a whole bottle. The selection of carafe's was not impressive, and would have done better by sucking it up and ordering a full bottle. We took the server's suggestion, who seemed to know everything about the wine, and was not afraid to show it. We had to try the String Bean appetizer and it is a good choice. Full of flavor, and a good garlic kick. Since we were early enough and he only makes 74 of his award winning Margherita pizza, we had to get it. I wasn't really impressed with that, and have had better Margherita pizza's. I don't know why he makes only 74 of them, but maybe you will like it more than we did. We also wanted to try something more traditional to get a feel for the rest of his pizza. The Pesto pizza was better than the Margherita, but we felt we should at least try it. It's a small restaurant with a cozy, read, cramped feel to it. All in all, it was a good meal and I want to go back.

There is so much variety of pizza at this place. I have been here 4 times and been satisfied each time. I also brought my parents here who loved it as well. I recommend trying the meatballs as an appetizer or the green beans! The wait is usually about an hour so I recommend getting there early or putting your name in and going up the street to grab a drink while you wait!

Probably my favorite pizza place in SF.  The New Yorker is to die for!  Their famous margarita isn't  bad either.  jk. It's probably the best in SF.  The only con is its pretty tiny for the price.  That "serves 2-4" description is a lie! :p  Tips: If the restaurant is too full, go next door and order take out.  They are starting a delivery service in a few weeks too!

I was so excited to finally get to try Tony's. I'm terribly disappointed to say that it was a mixed bag. The gigante burrata meatball was outstanding. But I went for the pizza and the famous margherita pizza was actually the worst pizza I have ever had. It was dripping with water, soggy and tasteless. I've had better frozen pizza! I would definitely not recommend getting that pizza to anyone!!

Best pizza ever! I was invited to eat here with a couple of friends a few days ago. I was not expecting much from a mere little pizza place in San Francisco. To me, pizza is pizza. Any pizza is good to me. As soon as they brought out first  famous Margherita pizza, I was in awe. An explosion of taste and delicacy took place in my mouth. I could not believe this little pizza, simple yet quite fascinating, was being made in this  little pizza place. My group of fellow eaters kept ordering different pizzas. Slice after Slice, I kept eating. Each pizza pie brought different taste and textures. All I can say was my dining experience was awesome. I am a huge advocate of fresh food. And let me tell you, everything here is super fresh. From the fresh tomato sauce to fresh mozzarella cheese, freshness just brings out the unique individuality of food. It makes the experience so much better. They use wood burning ovens which gives the pizza an extra special pizazz.  I believe Tony was after quality. Now for my rating. The quality of the pizza alone deserves 4 stars. I would give it 5 but the place is not perfect. The size of the pizzas really got me. It could have been a bit bigger. I was basically paying for a medium thin crust pizza the same price as a large pizza from any where else. Also, parking is like finding gold. Tony's is right in the heart of North Beach. So if you come, please come early before prime time dinner, or you will be looking for parking for a while and then you have to wait to get seated at Tonys. Other than those rants, This place is the best pizza place I been. You guys should definitely try this place out. Awesome pizza. Also, I believe Tony kicked ass in the World Pizza Cup. Shame on you Italy! SHAME ON YOU!!!

Wow, yes please...again and again. This pizza really is delicious. Not only delicious, but creative and overly filling- something I can't say about some of the other amazing pizza places in SF. Today while trying their pizzas and salads, I luckily got many options. They were all really tasty, but I'll have to say that their Prosciutto pizza was....wow. AND their Ricotta and Tomato pizza was super good too. I also tried a slice of their deep dish, and found the crust to be tasty and the toppings even better. However, definitely not a dietary option in Skinny Bitch, but hey once in awhile it's fine right? Their salads are also nice and delicious. But what's up with trying to trick us into pouring a container of straight olive oil on the salad instead of an actual dressing? I don't know about anyone else, but I personally don't love the taste of olive oil enough to savor it straight...mixed with balsamic? Perfect. All in all, yes I'm going to order it again, and I'm going to love it.

bottom line: I'd choose even pizza orgasmica over Tony's. I live 2 blocks away so I ordered take out. I'm on a quest for the best pizza in North Beach and based on yelp reviews.. i figured this must be it! boy that was a waste of $50. Pizza Margherita-- horrible. Watery and bland. Soggy.. and this is the pizza they are known for. Cal Italia-- (food network pizza challenge winner) fig preserve was overwhelming.. didnt even taste the balsamic. Only one little piece of prosciutto per slice.  Nothing special.. couldnt eat more than a slice. Caesar Salad-- no better than airport prepacked salad. Tastes like store bought mass produced creamy "caesar"... major let down for the price. Cheap parmigiano.

After much searching and trying, this is still the best Margherita in town. Not sure about the rest. Tasty yeah, but my pick is always that one. There are a few drawbacks people should be aware of though. 1) They do not take reservations: you need to show up, leave your name, and then they will call you. Sometimes 2 hours later. But it is nice they call you on the phone so you can go to the wine bar one block away and wait for your turn. 2) it is also the most expensive margherita in town. all in all, i always go back when i have a chance.

Just like like the restaurant this place is on point. Razor sharp! The big draw is the fast service. Slices fly out of the oven in less than five minutes. On the two times I've been here, there has been no seating outside so just cross the street and claim a park bench. Tip: One slice is cash only.

So good, I had to roll myself out the door! You are probably thinking... how good can pizza really be? This pizza is by far, some of the best pizza I've had out there. And I LOVE pizza - okay, I like it a lot. Claire C. and I went on a foodie adventure after a 12 hour work day. Yes, I said 12 hours. The wait wasn't too bad on a Wednesday night, though I live in the neighborhood and know that the wait can easily be upwards of an hour plus for larger groups. We sat at the bar where the bartender made us a special drink for the night - he called it the 'sweet Polly purebred gets her revenge' ... you may need to ask him for the story, but it was DELICIOUS. Not quite sure of all of the ingredients but it hit the spot. We ordered the meatballs, string beans and Margherita Pizza - all recommendations from very credible sources. And the best part was, the food met ALL of my expectations. The meatballs were meaty, fresh from the oven. The string beans just perfectly sauteed (I think?) with garlic and olive oil ... YUM! And the pizza... globs of goodness baked on a perfect dough. And the best part? Tony came out of the kitchen to say hello! What a TREAT! Just remember these key facts when dining at Tony's: Parking may be rough, the wait can be long, but it is all worth it in the end when you bite into the perfect slice of heaven.

I can't believe that I'm saying I'm glad that Mama's had such a long line (I really did want to try their french toast sampler), but I feel lucky because without that being the case I would have never stumbled into Tony's and had the best pizza in all of the Bay.  It's expensive as heck - $18 for a Margherita pizza that was slightly larger than a personal pie - but it was worth every gooey penny.  The woodfired crust was perfectly crisp yet doughy and the fresh mozzarella jettied me back to my trip to Italy.  The wings had a wonderful BBQ sauce that supposedly had beer in it and somehow really did have an "Italian" taste (not that I ever saw chicken wings in any Italian cafe).   One of my favorite lunches in the city, made even more pleasant since it was so unexpected. :)

Cozy.  Popular.  Satisfactory. Acclaimed margherita pizza was soggy.  Mozzarella was plastic-y.  Pizza sauce decent. American style Combo pizza was doughy.  Reminiscent of upgraded Extreme Pizza. Truffle fries come out hot and delish. Meatballs are large and in charge. Wait is long (approx 40 min-1 hr) Calling cell phone when table ready is good. Head hostess be power trippin Bar scene looks like a good time Fun for big groups (6-8) if someone puts name down hour in advance. Would rather go to L'Osteria for thin italian pizza in NB. $$20-40 for pizza and apps

Went here on a Friday night after hearing how amazing the pizza was.   Waited for a full hour for a table, since the place was so packed.  We ordered the Little Italy salad to start and had the Margherita pizza with Caputo flour (not the famous one Tony is known for, which uses San Felice flour, but a very similar one).  The salad was pretty yummy but on the small side.  The pizza was also good, but I thought on the smaller side for 2 people.   To be honest, I was a little underwhelmed by the whole experience, and perhaps it's for a few reasons: -Everyone had been raving about how amazing the food was, especially Yelpers - I felt the price was not necessarily justified given the quantity of food.  While I was full after the salad and pizza, I felt I could have gotten a much tastier Italian dish or pasta at another Italian place in the city. - I felt the crust was overly burnt and the cheese and sauce were not seasoned enough. Yes, it was good pizza, and yes, it was authentic Neapolitan style, but was it the best Naples-style pizza I have ever had and worth the hour wait for it, to boot? Not really. While the service was pretty good despite the wait and the food was of good quality, for me it didn't quite live up to its hype.  Perhaps I'll give it a second chance and try a different pizza on a different day...but, for now, they're a 3 for me, overall.

To quote a friend, "This was the best mediocre pizza I've ever had." Given the length of the wait for this restaurant, I expected something outstanding.  On the menu, Tony's winning of some 2007 Italian pizza competition in Italy was compared to the mighty California cabernets that took top billing in the 1976 Judgement of Paris. Given all of the build up, the pizza was incredibly disappointing.  [They probably would have gotten an extra star, had the build-up not been so dramatic.] Now, to be fair, there was nothing *bad* about the pizza.  The crust was the righ consistency and crispiness and the sauce was fresh, but I have never in my life tasted pizza so bland.  The margarita (though we didn't have the special kind) was the best of the bunch.  But bland.  Tony may not have heard about the wonders of salt, pepper, oregano. . . hell anything!  Most every pizza didn't have enough toppings on it.  For example, the puttanesca pizza had one anchovy per slice and such a dearth of capers that we had to ask our waitress to bring out more. With competion in the city from places like Pizzaria Delfina, Little Star, and dozens of restaurants that serve incredible pizza (try Pazzia in Soma for a surprise), Tony's will survive only because of tourist foot traffic.  What a shame!

Went to this place because i had seen it on the Food Network, and another little spot i love, Tommaso's, closes during the holiday so we decided to try Tony's...sooooo glad we did!  You have to try The NEW YORKER...it was so good that words can't even do it justice!  Ended up going back the next night because we had to have more!!!   Also ordered a pasta dish that was simple but very tasty and spicy...so good!  Nice frosty Peroni beer, our server was nice and helpful...just go, you'll be glad you did!

Came on a September Saturday night and loved it here.  Wish they didn't have that 73 quota on the margherita as it forces the late crowd to get the less premium crust.  I was more impressed with the spicy pasta dish that contained a home made hot sausage.  Bar room gets packed, be ready to wait an hour but it's worth it!

The pizza here is sooo good. It was pretty crowded, and I was there on a Sunday night. It was definitely worth the wait. I don't remember which pizzas we got, I think one of them was the Americana. I loved everything about the pizza, we also ordered a salad that was delicious, and some cheesy garlic bread. Yummmmmm.. I will most definitely be back!

I have heard that this place cooks the best pizza in SF so my head was swimming with fantasies looking at all the kinds of pizza they offered on the menu. I was told to get the Margherita, which won some Pizza World Cup in Italy a couple years ago, but seriously there were SO MANY delicious different kinds of pizza I went with the Puttanesca pizza, I couldn't just stick to the Margherita. We ended up getting the Little Italy salad (amazing and just the right amount) and the pizza was great too. It wasn't thin crust, but the crust was perfect nonetheless. The tomatoes in the tomato sauce they use taste authentic and perfect, which really captured my tongue and heart. We also tried the Honey Buck, this insane cocktail they make made with a billion ingredients, and it was delightful, although somewhat incongruous with pizza. Also, their house bread was great. What's more, is that their service was super, SUPER fast. Our waitress was attentive and speedy. Usually I feel like pizza places take a while to get food out to you, but not so here. Thank god, because it really sucks to have to wait so long for something as heavenly as pizza. I will definitely come back because I want to try each and every one of their pizzas. Even if I have to sacrifice my figure for it.

First time Yelp review, so let me preface that I write my reviews on a relative basis.  I am rating this place to how it compares to other sandwich shops, not to Gary Dankos.  That being said... I had been to Tony's Pizza a few times and felt that they were good, but a little pricy. Hearing about the concept of their spin off sandwich place and being from NY I was excited about their opening.  I have always found it difficult finding a place in SF that replicated the NY style deli/pizzeria, and this place met my needs. We went in there late on a Saturday near closing, and the staff was ready to serve us.  We asked for samples their corned beef and pastrami, which they provided generous samples.  As for our selections, we chose the North Beach Hero $8 (a cold mixed meat Italian sandwich served on sliced French bread) and the Triple Double $11 (a double cheese, double sausage and double Chicago style Italian beef sandwich) to share. I plowed though my half of the North Beach (because I was hungry, not because it was small) and was only able to get a few bites in to my half of the Triple Double.  My buddy barely made it though his half of the Triple Double, and could not make it to the North Beach since his sandwich was too much and too good. By the way, we are big guys who can pack it away and were very hungry; that is saying a lot for this place.  My buddy also got the NY All Star $15 (a Corned Beef and Pastrami combo, Ruben style) to take home.  That was the size of a football. All in all, very tasty, great friendly service and well priced. If you question that last statement given that their prices are a few $s more than you would normally pay for a sandwich, consider that these are big sandwiches that can easily be split or saved for excellent left overs.

I almost gave Tony's 4 stars... but that was only because of the Joe Montana sighting.  Joe Montana is a good looking man at his age... and I love to people watch so I found myself eying up this, what I like to call, silver fox while waiting for my pizza at Tony's. Then I was found out, we made eye contact and I got a little smile. It took me another second before I realized who it was, omg Joe MOntana... I smiled back, and  like that he was gone. The legend himself, and by the looks of it I bet he can still throw a mean pass. I would go long for him anyday :) My friend and I ordered the Cal Italia, which is one of it's famous pies. It took forever, but did not disappoint. The fig on the pizza honestly made it. It wasn't heavy and if you can call a pizza refreshing, I will. My only complaint is too much crust around the outside.. give me more cheese and goods! (though that is usually my complaint for all pizza.) Though it did take forever for our pizza to come, I was briefly entertained by some great focaccia bread and sun dried tomatoes in olive oil. Will be back as long as I am guaranteed another eye session with Mr. Montana

I was hungry on a Sunday afternoon and reminded myself that Tony's Slice House was finally open!  I live half a block from here and walk past it on my way to work every day, so I thought it'd be a perfect opportunity to grab a slice. I ordered the pesto pizza, which comes with some onions (not overpowering) and sliced potatoes.  I was a little taken aback at the $5 per slice price, but then I realized how big the slices were and thought it was pretty reasonable. The crust was great!  It wasn't soggy in the middle but was still thin, crispy but not overly so, and the pesto was just plain awesome.  The -1 star is for the potatoes on this particular slice of pizza.  They're sliced really thin but since the pizzas cook so quickly in the oven, I think my potato slices were a tad underdone.   Since the pizzas are sitting in front of you when you order, it would be helpful to have prices listed on the display, rather than forcing people to read the menu, which are available for customers along the wall.   The pizza is damn good, and I am ecstatic Tony decided to open up this slice house.  Thanks Tony!

If you don't know who Tony Gemignani is then you're not following the guy who changed the world of pizza by becoming a legend in the art of pizza acrobatics ! His pizza is the absolute best I've ever had. Probably because he takes great pride in only producing the absolute best product, uses only the most expensive ingredients, and bakes them in the worlds top ovens. I am just so happy I don't have to drive all the way over to Castro Valley to get his pies ! Yahoo !

Love Tony's. Reminds me of the margarhita pizzas in Italy. We had the margarhita, cali special and classic pepperoni. All were finished. The pepperonis are small and crunchy with nice spice, exactly what a roni should be. Cali is awesome. The sweetness of the reduction sauce is like dessert. Crust is thin and crunchy, with enough chew and is strong enough to hold up the slice of pie. We will definitely be back, as we sure do enjoy our pies! Grazie Tony for great pizza!

Growing up on Pyzano's pizza as a kid, I could not wait to give this place a try!  We arrived at 5 on Sat. and were able to get seated right away outside (heated btw).  Points for being kid-friendly (they had a lot of high chairs and give kids pizza dough to play with while waiting for the food). Our waitress was helpful and had good suggestions.  We shared a little Italy salad, margherita pizza, meatballs, and sicilian-style fratellanza.  DH is Italian and had traveled to Italy and said the margherita was very good.  The fratellanza was huge!  I'd never had Slicilian style pizza and it was very tasty (especially the crisp crust on the bottom).  The meatballs were also excellent, very light and seasoned just right. We will definitely return and would love it if there was a pizza place like this out our way!

My girlfriend raved about how good their pizzas were based on the fact they had award winning pizza pies in North Beach so we decided to get a merienda snack (mid afternoon) since the six of us were in the area to show our friends from LA what's up. Well, to our dismay - we ordered the Margherita and shared it with the group. It was meh for me - I personally prefer Pizzeria Delfina or Pizza Antica for their thin crust pizzas. We had high hopes but fell short of our expectations.

Tony has done such a wonderful job at making an old school place and hitting some key chords of people like me...a pretty out-spoken New Yorker.  Tony is in his element at this spot and I wish him the very best in his new adventure.  I know it will continue to be successful.

L'amore di Tony's tanto voglio prendere dietro una scuola media e di farlo in stato di gravidanza. (Hopeful translation: I love Tony's so much I want to take it behind a middle school and get it pregnant!) My friends and I dilly-dallied at our outside table for a few hours on a relatively warm Sunday afternoon. We wanted to get up sooner but we ingested so many f'ing carbs it was nearly impossible to get us to move from our chairs without being wheeled out of them (Side note: they have a "We Wheel Your Meal" deal where you can pay $10 and they bring out a red wheelbarrow and take you to your car*). I don't even know where to begin! You start with these two tasty breads and three types of olive oils: plain, garlic and pesto. THANK YOU (x2090234) for not putting vinegar in the olive oil. But the garlic-infused olive oil was delectable. I wanted to put some in my pockets and take it home with me**. I know the recipe wasn't exactly a secret, but it's so much better when someone else chops those little suckers for you. We ordered the Penne pasta (with the spicy bolognese sauce, calabrese peppers and sliced fennel sausage) which was actually spicy so kudos for no false advertising. The sausage is cut thin and the sauce is hearty. And it even comes with two pieces of chese-topped garlic bread which was outstanding***. We also went for one of the infamous 900 degree wood fired pizzas. The One. The Only. The Mother F'n Margherita. And dude, this pizza was yumtastic. The crust was soft and full-bodied. The sauce was smooth and light. The cheese was placed strategically in groupings around the dough. And the olive oil on top provided a nice smooth chaser to finish off each bite. This place is worth the hype. And it's affordable. And the inside is quite expansive with a very clean and spacious bathroom. If anyone is thinking of taking me on a date soon, this will be an acceptable option to present. _________ *Lies **I started to write a Mary Catherine Gallagher reference here, but fortunately did some editing ***So outstanding I wanna dip my balls in it!**** ****I miss "The State"

Tony, his partners, and all those affiliated with this establishment are professionals, and it is obvious that everybody on board loves being a part of this cohesive, friendly, and humble team.   The hostess and manager were accommodating, efficient, and genuinely interested in how our dining experience was unfolding...and it unfolded marvelously.   The bar manager has compiled a cocktail menu that is sophisticated, unpretentious, and fun (form the Brown Derby to a classic Mai Tai).   The garlic fries were crispy, hot, and flavored to perfection.  The Original Tomato Pie was simple, yet bursting with flavor and freshness, and the crust was perfectly textured and delicious.   The ambiance was a mixture of low-key North Beach regulars young and old, as well as destination diners that have gotten wind of Tony's masterpieces.   The waitstaff was, again, unpretentious and Donna seemed to masterfully juggle half the restaurant while simultaneously making us feel as if we were her only table by recommending the perfect wine, making sure our glasses were always at least half full, and helping us to narrow our selection to the perfect pizza.   Nice work, everybody...we can't wait to come back for more!!!

What a disappointment!  My boyfriend, a self-proclaimed pizza aficionado had wanted to come here forever. He loves pizza and he was soooo expecting something amazing. Instead we encountered flavorless, doughy, limp, droopy pizza. I need to clarify that the one star rating is based on the hype, representations and awards - the famous Margherita pizza simply doesn't live up to expectations. Being our first time, and we went for their award-winning specialty. Unfortunately, its just not that good - ok at best, but certainly not the best in the City, not even in the top 5 imho and certainly not the best in NYC. Really? Under-seasoned is not something you often encounter with Italian food, but Tony's pizza was so lacking for flavor that after the first bite we immediately went for the parm... nope, still bland. The sauce was runny and one dimensional, there were only a few basil leaves so that not every piece offered that flavor note, the mozzarella was rubbery and flavorless. I tried a bit of salt then asked for some garlic powder but they didn't have any, just the fresh minced garlic that they serve with their bread. Obviously, this was much too strong and overpowering but it was the only choice.  I ate it and it was ok, but I would've been just as happy eating the comparable Trader Joe's frozen Margherita pizza - correction at $3.99, I would have been much happier! The whole experience was underwhelming to say the least. The price was not necessarily justified given the quality of the food.  The Caesar salad was very good and a reasonable portion for the price, but the pizza was not worthy.  While the service was pretty good and the servers were polite, overall, it just didn't quite live up to its hype.   All I can say about the rave reviews is that there is either a great deal of inconsistency in the quality of food or they drank the over-hyped Koolaid with their meal. If they cant get their specialty pizza right, we wont be coming back. There are just too many good pizza places in the City. Why settle for over-hyped mediocrity?

Why wait in the long line for Golden Boy when you don't even like it that much? Oh we've been drinking? Well rejoice fellas cause now we have more options with the opening of Tony's Coal-Fired Pizza and Slice House. As the quick-service, little cousin of Tony's Pizza Napoletana next door, TCFP/SH totally delivers on tasty grub till nearly midnight with sandwiches and pizza by the slice (or by the meter, roman style). In fact, it claims to be the city's only coal-fired pizza joint and perhaps that is why the bread has such a delicious char to it. The NY style slices are seriously quite legit and it was a yummy treat to fold the slice and gobble away. Just like the famous Margerhita next door, the cheese slice here is simplicity perfected, sans "we only make 73 a day" exclusivity. Yes the flour isn't flown in from Italy but it's still one mighty tasty slice to me and with cheese slices starting at just $3.50, it's hard to beat. Don't forget to pick up an amaretto cookie at the cashier when you're paying and you've got a nice sweet treat to boot. I am so glad Tony's Coal-Fired Pizza and Slice House is now open so I have a great alternative for delicious pizza slices around my hood. Thank you Tony Gemignani.

[RANT] First:  Please don't complain about the parking.  North Beach has been a parking nightmare for half a century.  It's worse than ever.  The thing that makes the neighborhood so great is that there isn't much parking.  No ugly open parking lots. Nice narrow streets.  If you want parking, go to a strip mall in the suburbs!! Please don't waste pixels complaining about parking in North Beach.  It just makes you look stoopid. [END RANT] So now that you have biked, walked or taken the cable car to the best pizza place in SF, or at least the best I've tried.  What to say? Tony Gemignani came to our table to talk pizzas.  I asked him about the flour he uses to get such good crusts, and he started rattling off names of Italian flours from different districts of Italy which he uses in the 4 different crusts, cooked in 4 different temperature ovens.  Obsessive.  Worth it.  Nice guy.  Amazingly mellow for a chef with a practically full house.  I hope this place isn't spoiled by the instant success.  Beer!  Sam Adams summer fest.  Toasty and delicious, like pizza crust. I'm shouting and cheering for the gorgonzola/proscuitto/fig/balsamic/fig jam pie.  All those discordinant-seeming flavors meld in the mouth and taste like a perfectly executed musical chord.  nothing shouts or overpowers, but everything is there, harmonious and distinct.   The gold-medal-winning Marg (only 73 per day available) was great, but lacked the drama of the previous.  Crust was distinctly different. Still chewy, and baked at a high temperature just shy of carbonization.  I liked it.  Alot. Just not as much as the fig-proscuitto. Can't wait to go back and eat my way through the menu.  On my bike.

I'm eating the pie right now...(take out).   Maybe I've heard too much about this place, but I was slightly disappointed by the world famous, award winning Margherita.  When I ordered the pie, the staff said it'd be ready in 20. When I arrived, it was mobbed, so getting my pie took some maneuvering...and when I got it home about 10 minutes later...it was cold & kinda soggy & spendy.  I never had this problem at another nearby pizzeria who ask when I will arrive and have the pie just out of the oven for me (hot & crispy). Now THAT'S great service. The pizza had great subtle flavors and would be best eaten when out of the oven, otherwise it's soggy and cold. It's very light so either order/make an side dish or you'll be left hungry.

Best pizza I've had in SF!!! So many flavors to choose from too. The wait is worth it! A bit cramped inside, but they also have outdoor seating with heat lamps. Staff is very friendly and our server was on top of everything. Pizzas are delicious, thin crust, flavorful, and the dough is chewy and good. The regular pizzas have 6 slices and they have larger family style sizes to share. - Little Italy Salad: light, dressing good, OK - Margherita Pizza: thin, fresh mozzarella, good mix of tomato sauce - Cal Italia Pizza: complex flavors, fig jam good, salty & sweet - Cholula Pizza: a bit spicy, chicken thinly sliced, good

Best. Pizza. Ever. Try the pizza called "gigante". I had to add another sentence so Yelp would accept this review as one written in the English Language.

Disappointing. I had heard a lot about this place but it just didn't deliver. I thought the pizza was kind of bland. However, they had "run out of margheritas" (apparently they only serve a certain amount of them a day - I find this really obnoxious actually. If you have the ingredients, why wouldn't you just serve more of them when they're in demand?) Maybe the margherita is the way to go.   I'd be willing to give it another chance but only if I'm in the area. It's definitely not a go-out-of-your-way spot for me.

I could talk at length about the awesome wood fired oven (only when you think of baking at 500 degrees can you comprehend just how freaking cool, er, hot 900 degrees). I could use hyperbole to describe how tasty the Margherita (73 a day!) pizza is. I could celebrate the friendly service and reasonable prices. I could wax poetic at the size and deliciousness of mixed greens salad with apple slices, and most importantly, a house apple vinaigrette. And then there is the Cal Italia. I could go on and on, or, I'll just let my friend who was visiting from out of town sum it up: "I am a Midwestern girl who loves her standard meat-filled pizza, and that balsamic/fig/gorgonzola concoction was the best pizza I have ever had. So there you go :)" So there you go. Now go.

Last Thursday I was fiending for italian in anticipation of Jersey Shore's season 2 premiere and found my fix here.  Having since left the Bay I am having violent shakes...in retrospect it would have been best if I hadn't had a single bite. To our surprise, we found street parking right away and were seated immediately because we arrived shortly after the lunch rush.  Being noobs, our server gave us the brief rundown and a few suggestions (none of which we took up).  I commenced this highly anticipated experience with a Moretti (common Italian beer) and the lady kicked things off with a mac and cheese.  Beer is beer to me and I hate cheese so I don't have much to say.   Absurdly, having said the above, pizza is my favorite food and we decided on the classic New Yorker (minus the ricotta, plus onions) which surpassed all my expectations.  The pizza came quickly which was to be expected for cooking only 90 seconds in a 900 degree wood fired oven.  The pizza was firm, the tomato sauce thick, bursting with flavor (the only time my tongue was able to discern the richness in flavor compared to other pies), generous toppings of pepperoni and italian sausage.  I pray that one day they sell prepackaged crusts at my local grocer.   The pizza starts doughy then becomes progressively firmer as you reach the crust.  A nice ashy hue powders the pizza underneath.  What does that mean in terms of taste?  Probably nothing, but it gave it a visual rustic touch. Staff was pleasant, quick.  Decor was predominantly dark mahogany; clean, cozy booths near the bar.  Dining room (downstairs and upstairs?).  Would recommend public transportation or cabbing if planning on eating around peak hours.

Hot damn, Tony's doesn't just serve pizza; it curates all the world's pizza knowledge and bakes it into the dough, producing some of the best pies I've ever had. The people there take pizza seriously, like an art form. You might even say theirs is the Platonic ideal of pizza. They serve classic Italian style pizzas, Sicilian, American, and of course their famed wood-fired Napoletana pizza (award-winning, they're quick to add). The latter they bake in limited numbers every day, supposedly, though I've never had a problem getting one. Napoletana is the original thin crust pie, brushed generously with olive oil and graced with just enough cheese and savory sauce. They also serve a variety of pastas, salads, and other Italian American fare. Their bar and outdoor seating area offer ample room if their main dining room is full (which it most always is). Here are my favorite pies from Tony's: 1. Wood-fired Margherita pizza 2. The Cal Italia 3. Prosciutto e Pomodorini 4. Bronx 5. Americano Finally, North Beach has REAL pizza!

A friend and I have been meaning to try Tony's since before it opened and we finally ventured out this evening.  We arrived around 6:30pm on a Friday and the wait was 30-40 minutes for two.  I think we waited a little longer than that but it seemed reasonable.  Plus, they brought around a meat and cheese platter to satisfy our hunger while waiting, very nice touch.   Once we were seated. the service was very speedy and friendly.  I was quite impressed by how fast all of our food came out.  Our waiter gave us a "tour" of the menu which I found very helpful.  He described the four different styles of pizza and how they were cooked differently in specific ovens as well as gave us some guidance about the portion sizes.  We opted for the famous Margarita pizza, determined to see what the hype was about.  We accompanied this by a pear and arugula salad with gorgonzola and pecans that our server recommended.   While waiting for our meal we were served two types of bread, one crusty and the other more like a foccacia along with olive oil in three vessels, one pure, one with pesto and one with fresh garlic.  The pesto was by far my fav but all were good. The salad is a very generous portion, easy to share with 2+ people! I was impressed.  I've had this combination on salads before and this was very good, but not the best.  I'm not sure what it was lacking but I think it could be slightly improved.   Next was the pizza, superb!  The crust is simply out if this world, a perfectly divine combination of crisp and chewy with that nice wood burned fire flavor.  Honestly, the crust in the middle of the pizza was a little on the softer side, almost too much but the outer rim made up for it.  My friend thought there was too much olive oil but the truth is I loved every drippy bite of it.  The mozzarella and basil were fresh tasty as well.  The sauce is really just pure tomatoes of the highest quality, very simple.   Overall, I'd say the crust is what makes the pizza.  There was nothing wrong with the toppings, but margarita pizza has never been my favorite so I'm looking forward to trying other combinations.  However, I know that only the margarita gets the special flour flown in from Italy, so perhaps the other crusts won't compare.  I can't wait to return and try more! Split two ways, drinking water, my share of the meal with tip was $18, not bad for an upscale restaurant and some of the best pizza I've ever had (and yes, I've had pizza all over Italy as well as many other parts of Europe so I am partial to thin crusts and minimal toppings). Oh, and to make a great experience even better, if you site on the right half of the restaurant, you get to watch Tony work his magic preparing the pizzas in the 900 degree wood oven!   I thoroughly enjoyed this portion of the whole experience.  Tony also periodically wanders out to chat with customers which I thought was nice.  I didn't get to meet him but maybe next time!

Hey'a, Tony, you shoulda knowa that I spenta the lasta yeara a cheatin' on my old woman, the deep dish 'za, witha all these thin crust pizzas ina the Bay Area and Phoenix (is everyone picking up my Father Guido Sarducci accent?). I thinka I found my new love, your DOC margherita.  Thanka youa for bringing her back from Naples.  Everyone in my group was loving the truffle-essence pie.  We were on the verge of getting the real deal, but recognized that we had already ordered way too much for 5 people: a magherita, a truffle, a sicilian with pepperoni, and a speck/arugula.   Everyone concluded that all of the pizzas were fantastic.  We would have been well fed without the sicilian.  That was massive and, though all the crusts and sauce were fantastico, the crowning achievement was the napoletana crust: lightly charred, chewy, crispy; all at once.  Maybe a dash less oil on top would be a bit healthier, but the flavors were perfect. We'll back back again and again. Wait was 45 minutes.  Parking was painful on a Sunday afternoon.  Just plan it that way.  Park 3-4 blocks away and walk off a few bites of the magnicient pies you will pop into your piehole. I really should drop 5 stars, but the prices are a bit exorbitant.  $28 for the sicilian?  $78 for truffle pie and $28 for truffle-less?  That's my only beef.  It is still stellar 'za.   Chicago deep dish = go to Zachary's. Thin crust / napoletana = go to Tony's. You now have the two best pizza places in the SF Bay Area:  Tony's or Zachary's.  Now go pig out.   PS - Chris Bianco eat your heart out.  The wait was only 45 minutes for 5 people at Tony's.  Bianco's was 4 freakin' hours.  Really good 'za, but FOUR hours.

I've heard about this place through some other local blogs and recommendation services and figured I needed to see it for myself. I went with a group of 5 and had exceptional service, little waiting time and great food. I definitely recommend their famous margarita pizza, but their calzones are good too. I didn't order both, just tasted my friends ;) Keep it up Tony!

This place has an insane wait....luckily there is a great dive bar nearby.  Our wait was longer than told to us, almost an hour and a half.  So was it worth it?  No, not really. We ordered fried green beans to start and they were good, but hey, that's not a tough dish to do well.  They were out of margherita pizzas so we ordered the M Extra instead, plus the clam and garlic, plus Frank's True Italian.  The last one was the only one worth going back for: pesto with a lovely thin and uniformly crispy crust.  Great. The clam pizza needs to be renamed "salt pizza" and I am a salt lover.  Not good.  The Margherita extra was soggy and uninspired.  Not my thing at all. We would go back but only to eat at the bar early, and get Frank's pizza or perhaps a pizza in that style that is veggie (there  may be others).  But never again will we wait for a table. The service is great, but it's just not worth the wait when there are other great places in the city to go to instead.

I can't say I'm a pizza know-it-all, but damn this pizza is good. The Margherita here is one of the best pizzas I have ever had. Crush is perfect, toppings are fresh and delicious. The variety of pizza preparations is beyond me, left to be appreciated by those of who know the difference between ovens, flour and water proportions, and whatever else. Good drinks too, good service, fun atmosphere.

I'm giving it 3 stars paritally b/c I think the hype is too much, AND I several gripes about this place unrelated to the food or ambiance. 1) WHY is there no separate yelp listing for the slice place next door? 2) Why is there no online menu for the slice/sandwich place next door? 3) The website is annoying with the musical intro, I bet NO ONE ever uses it and skips it, just a stupid idea, intros and music on website are just plain annoying, WHY does anyone approve such lame website design? I went to the slice place next door. The slice was very good, but not better than Village or Arinel (though they do get a point for the small pepperoni they use - like Amici's pepperoni) The prices for the slices are too high and I think the prices for the other things like sandwiches and calzones are too low (AGAIN this is at the slice place next door. My pepperoni slice was $4. The meatball, mushroom calzone is listed at $6, OR you can get baked ziti WITH a soda for $6.... it just seems like a pretty big disparity. All in all I do want to come back for the chicken parm sammy that was rated super yummy by one of the food blogs I read. Maybe I'll give it another star then.

We finally got around to going!  A pretty broad selection of pasta & pizzas of various styles, & also an impressive bar for a pizza place. A 45 minute wait for 5, but the hostess took our number & we wandered down to Tony Nik's for a cocktail, so it was 45 minutes well spent.  You can eat inside or out, and since it was a nice night, we went with out (though there are heat lamps for the coldblooded among you like myself). Appetizers: Fried green beans - Fresh & tasty!  Without the oil at the bottom of the dish, you'd never know they were fried.  We were expecting something more like deep/batter fried beans, but I think actually enjoyed these better.  Crunchy & seasoned with all kinds of goodness.  Highly recommend. Garlic bread with mozzarella - Pretty much what it sounds like; a half-loaf (meaning a full loaf cut long-ways down the center) of thick garlic bread with a generous amount of fresh mozzarella melted on top & then sprinkled with seasoning.  You could tell that this was VERY fresh mozzarella - it had a very milky character. Calamari - We went with the calabrasi option, which is slightly spicy.  I liked the flavor of it (sort of smoky & concrete-y), but it was a bit chewy. We also had a half-bottle of red wine, though I can't remember now what it was.  It was excellent & went well with the food; on the other hand it was $26 for a half bottle. Pizzas: There are several options here.  You can get classic Napoletana, a number of traditional Italian-style pies, several NY style options, or one of the Sicilian pan-style pies.  Napoletana, Italian, and NY pies are 12 inch pies with 6 slices; the Sicilian pies are about an inch or an inch and a half thick crunch & serve 2-3, depending on how hungry you are.  We tried: The Bronx - a NY style pie with salami.  Tasty!  (Then again, I love salami.)  Needed more sauce. The Original Tomato Pie (De Lorenzo style) - Very basic New Jersey-style pizza - just sauce, cheese, and if you order De Lorenzo style, Italian sausage.  We LOVED the sauce on this one!  Rich, complex, savory, and plenty of it!  I personally thought it could have used more cheese. Margherita - The Napoletana-style pizza that won the 2007 World Pizza Cup!  (You didn't know there was a World Pizza Cup, did you?  Heh.)  They only make 73 per day, but we were apparently in time for one.  Alas, while it was quite good & there was nothing wrong with it, I would not say it was the best Margherita pizza I've ever had. Quail Egg with Speck - This was like having breakfast on a pizza; I felt like I was having bacon and eggs (with a bit of spinach), which was actually pretty tasty.  Nothing wrong with that. So yeah.  Great food & very tasty pizza (especially the Tomato Pie), but I wouldn't say it rises to the food-gasmic level.  Also, kind of pricey for pizza.  After tax & tip, the bill for the five of us was $170.

The ingredients on the Margherita were pretty good, but I didn't like that the pizza had cooled down considerably by the time it got to our table.  Don't get me wrong, I love cold pizza, but I love it as leftovers the next day, not when I order them at a restaurant. I wanted to like the pizza here, but I have to say I left pretty disappointed.

OVERALL:4.5  FOOD:5   SERVICE:4   AMBIANCE:4.5   VALUE:4.5 Short of booking an actual flight to Naples, this is as good & real as it gets.  Seriously, there's pizza...and then there's THIS pizza.  We're talking toe-curling, spine-tingling, religious fervor-inspiring...MMMM!! Can't wait to try all the imaginative combos! *Margherita ($19): award-winning, ultra-thin crust, DELIZIOSSIMA in all its tomato-basil-mozzarella simplicity.  A definite must-try. *Campari ($18): unexpected pleaser...sweet-savory perfection of wilted escarole +goat cheese +sweet peppers +pancetta +mozzarella +blood orange campari redux.  Totally unique flavors! If thin-crust is your thing, do yourself a favor and skip the other North Beach pie joints (except BaoNecci...http://www.yelp.com/biz/caffe-baonecci-?san-francisco-2#hrid:Jp_wF1rydSV029-ii_p4Ig).  Your wallet will just have to take one for the team.  Hey, sure beats the hell outta digging out a passport and jetlagging it.

For a two hour wait I expected Pizza like I've never had before.  It was ok and there is better to be had around the City.  Servers and staff were good.  Pizza was okay despite all the fancy ingredients. If you are in North Beach, a local and don't want to bother for the wait...head to Golden Boy's or Don Pistos up the street. This is the like the Mama's line but at night.

First of all, a word about the servers, since they seem to be disparaged a lot in some of the reviews here: They were fantastic, from the host who greeted us, to the bartenders who poured while we were waiting, to the superb servers, who kept things moving out to our table at a steady clip.  And, Tony wasn't there on the night we went!   Next, a word for Tony Gemignani, who is one of my pizza heroes: Thank you for bringing the Bay Area a place where they can sample the best of the world's pizza styles under one roof.   From his world award winning classic Neopolitan pizza to the great interpretations of Chicago and California style, to the addictive New Jersey pizza (I didn't know they served the sauce on top of the pie in the Garden State), every pizza was excellent.. His Cirigliano oven is an item of envy, having come straight from Italy and turning out the perfect slightly-charred crust, perfectly seasoned cheese pizza.  The only rival to this pie in SF I've seen is A16, and their pizzas can be a little inconsistent when it gets busy.  Tony's was perfect. If you have to have something besides the pizzas, try the truffle fries, which were amazing, and the meatballs.     For a total pizza experience, provided by a man who is leading the pizza charge in the Bay Area, you've got to try Tony's.

Unique takes on some classic pizzas -- such as the Cal Italia. According to my boyfriend, the ingredients and execution were top-notch and he thought it was an interesting concept, but he wasn't crazy about the flavor combination of the sweet fig preserve and prosciutto when he tried it. The Calamari Fritti and the Margherita pizza were also good, though not spectacular.   Didn't love the condescending service, especially since we accepted to sit at the bar (when they couldn't accommodate us at any table, even after waiting) and particularly when the clumsy waitress dropped an entire pizza on my mother's lap (!)... I at least expected a more cordial apology, but that didn't happen. My party seemed to enjoy the overall experience, but I walked away feeling annoyed that we'd bothered to come to North Beach, struggle for parking, wait in line, and then eat uncomfortably at the bar just to get what turned out to be a mediocre meal and sub-par service.

Go early, try the Margherita, it's amazing.  You may not realize how amazing it actually it is unless you have a side by side comparison so I recommend getting any of the other pizza's all are very satisfactory and you will find yourself wanting more. I highly recommend the fried string beans for an appetizer.

Freaking awesome.  We went there last night and had a great time.  The food is terrific, the service is excellent and the bill wasn't too bad.  The only downside is that this place is so good, that it gets pretty crowded, so make sure to leave some time before you are really hungry.  But in the meantime you can grab a drink from the great bar.  From a New yorker struggling to find some good pizza, I've found a spectacular one. Ohh and the fried green beans were sick too - not breaded just a bit crispy and delicious

So, I'm behind on my reviews. Seriously behind. I guess Christmas day will be it. Making it up with Yelp. After a crazy wine event at Bimbo's, we headed out here for some pizza. Not just any pizza as Allen tells us. The Best Pizza Ever and the first person outside of Italy to win the "World Pizza Cup Winner" Naples, Italy. We were all sold on this! It helps that it is his buddy too. So we made our way to Tony's Pizza. I wanted the margherita but by 9pm, it was sold out, so I opted for the truffle pizza but $32 was too much. The last option was for the white potatoes with cowgirl creamery. No regrets. Tony was so nice to stick several "Tony's Golden Tickets," which we all loved. Willy Wonka!!! I definitely will come back here!

Prosciutto was spelled Procutto =( But other than that, I wish all the pizzas were done in the stone oven...the bread turns out mmm mmm delicious =) I also enjoyed the Lardo appetizer...basically thin slices of Lard =) Sounds gross, but think of the fat off of prosciutto..kind of the same thing Grazie mille Tony!!!

Walked into this place in search of pizza without any expectations. The place looked full and we would've been happy sitting at one of the outdoor tables, but luckily a table just opened up. The waitress was SUPER helpful. First asked if it was our first time and answered all our questions, and gave great suggestions. We ordered: Pancetta con Rucola $12- enough to share between 2-3 people easy. Nice chunks of pancetta. Margherita (the 2007 Italian award winner) $18- Simple, but delicious. Very thin crust. Initially I thought the sauce was going to be overbearing, but it ended up well balanced. Cal Italia (Food Network- Gold medal winner) $18- Never had fig preserves on a pizza, but it's GENIUS. Loved the sweet and salty flavors. I can usually take down a quite a few slices of any ol' pizza, but the flavors here were so darn satisfying I didn't feel the need to stuff myself silly. When I'm in the area, I'd definitely go back to try the Pizza Romana (it's like a 3 in 1 pizza!)

The food was terrific here but the dining experience would provide great torture for Guantanamo Bay prisoners! They kept the temperature in this place like that of a pizza oven. Moments after we were seated, my son spilled the beer I was drinking all over me and the table. My son is five so you can imagine that this has happened before.  Usually, restaurant staff clean up such things and bring you another on the house. Not here. Our server cleaned it up only after we hunted her down, then never asked me if I wanted another beer. I only got another after I asked for one and yes, they charged me another $3 for it. We dined under a speaker that blared what my husband called, "Liquid Metal" music onto our heads and when we asked if the music could be changed we were told no, because it was playing on an iPod shuffle. So we ate and tried to talk over the harsh drum banging and searing guitar for another 20 minutes until we actually saw someone scramble up a ladder then do what we were told wasn't possible, change the music! Then oh joy, we got to hear rap music for the rest of our visit. We were here during the North Beach Street Festival so several members of the staff let us know they'd gone deaf during the event. Obviously! Our own server pretty much sleepwalked through our dining experience. She was more interested in watching the golf tournament on the TV over the bar than taking care of us. She offered nothing that made eating at Tony's more enjoyable. In fact, she didn't even offer any of the usual fun stuff that apparently comes with being a patron here. Another diner told us they'll bring pizza dough out for your kids to play with. Our kids got some after WE asked about it. We would have never known otherwise! But like I said, the food was great. I recommend starting with the spinach salad (goat cheese, pine nuts, red onion, balsamic reduction, olive oil) and following it up with the Cholula pizza (mozzarella, marinated chicken breast in Cholula Hot Sauce, sliced Jalapeños, garlic, red onion, chorizo). Be warned though, this pizza is spicy!

Tony's is absolutely amazing! This place is a must for anyone who loves or (even tolerates) pizza. Definitely the best pizza I've had in North Beach or SF so far. The margherita (they only make 73 a day) is the best (yes, it's that good), though with so many options it's really a tough choice. i typically get take out from Tony's since I live a few blocks away, but have dined here once. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable about their 5 types of ovens/pizzas and the atmosphere is nice yet casual. If you live in North Beach, you must eat here. If you don't, it's worth the travel.

Summary: Great NY pizza and meat sandwich takeout. The place is mostly carryout, with very limited seating. I tried a slice of cheese NY pizza ($3) and Chicago combination (beef + sausage) sandwich ($9). Pizza was thin, with a crispy and chewy crust, melted cheese, and a tangy sauce. Great example of NY pizza. Sandwich was on soaked chewy/spongy Italian bread, with a generous amount of sliced roast beef, a split sausage, and spicy (spicier than I expected) peppers. An excellent example of an Italian beef sandwich. They had a variety of other pizzas (Romano, Sicilian) and sandwiches that I didn't try this time. Looked interesting though. I'll definitely go back again, particularly for the beef sandwich.

This yelp member has been out of reviewing commission for a while but after eating at this place, Tony gave me something to yelp about! Delicious! Wonderful service.... We ate with a party that had 6 people and it was perfecto! Spicy Calarmi, deep fried string beans, Cesar Salad were all wonderful starters to this meal. The Pizza Margherita, the Salsiccia and the Bronx were also equally delicious. The Panna Cotta and the Affagato were all the perfect ending to an outstanding meal!

This by far was the best pizza I have ever had!!! I went here for the first time w/ my family. And we all fell in love. I will wait all day in line for this place. Everything was fast and amazing. Will def. recommend this place thanks for my sister's recommendation.

St. Louis style pizza! My husband and I know about this because we are from there. Tony's pizza didn't look like Imo's but I must say I was impressed by how spot on the provel cheese was. Wished the slice meatballs were more substantial. They were so thin that I couldn't taste it against the strong cheeses. The crust was not right- too chewy versus crunchy. Margeurite pizza! My husband has been looking for a wood-fired pizza like the kind at Punch Pizza in Minneapolis. No one has come close except Tony's. The sauce was very fresh tasting. The crust was thinner than I would have liked though. We had very high expectations because we had exact pizzas in mind for comparing. We were surprised that the tastes were great and what we were looking for. But I couldn't overlook the sub-par crusts and steep price. Two pizzas and green beans for $51. Yikes. The price will keep me from coming back here again even though it's cheaper than flying to the Midwest if you miss a certain type of pizza. I'd rather wait for the next trip home. Overall, giving it 4 stars for great flavors but not so good crusts.

I'm so happy that this gets to be my new neighborhood pizza joint! I'm also a little sad that the word spread so quickly...i don't want to have to wait for my pizza!! I only had the margherita pizza and a side of meatballs.  they were both delicious, but i felt a little cheated on the amount of basil on my pizza...don't hold back, that's pretty much what makes the pizza amazing! i'm anxious to go back and try more options, but based on my preliminary findings I'll be returning frequently.

The pizza is good. In retrospect, I would not have gotten the thin crust--the normal crust looked better. It can be a long wait for a table, but the bar is first come first serve, and the service at the bar was EXCEPTIONAL.

First off, mistake #1, I did not have reservations. That's ok, they can still seat you, but it was a nearly 2 hour wait.  Fortunately, they take your cell number and call you.  You can actually explore North Beach/Little Italy pretty extensively during that two hours.   Mistake #2, trying to get a table for 3, especially when the third person flaked at the last minute and didn't make it.  They make you wait for a booth/table for 4, which is few and far between.  Go with one person and a table for 2 is much more readily available.  Also, you can get a patio table under the heat lamps outside, but it is not located in a pedestrian heavy zone, so no people watching....probably not worth the cold weather to sit outside. Mistake #3, sitting down to order at 830pm.  The famed "world's best pizza" is actually Napoletana Margharite pizza, thin crust, watery tomato sauce and a few clumps of cheese with basil, and is probably the reason why so many people is dying to eat here.  I watched the youtube video afterwards and it is pretty impressive seeing the pizza made in the brick oven pizza.  Problem:  They only make about 75 of them a day and by 830pm, they are done.  So we got the electric oven.  Yes, the first slice was pretty good.  Not sure if it was the best in the world, but I will take the judge's word for it.  Unfortunately, the thin crust got soggy in the electric oven.  But it taste pretty good and forever, I get to brag about eating the Margharite at Tony's worlds best pizza.   Not a mistake:  The ambience.  Very rowdy and loud.  Perfect for a night out with an old friend.  First dates, forget about it.  Too hard to talk.  Lots of energy in the room and felt very fun.  Wish I got there earlier and didn't wait so long for a table.  Definitely try it out once if you have never been there.  If you're reading a review of this place, you probably already know about it's reputation, so go already!  Just make reservations and tell them you want the brick oven pizza reserved for you!

Really good pizza. I fell in love with pizza in Napoli, at this little hole in the wall restaurant called "Pizzeria De Matteo". Every time I go to Italy I'd make sure to get over to Napoli for this particular pizza. A simple marguerita served on a tin plate, with the pizza spilling off it, topped with gorgeous basil and olive oil. There are few meals that give such a simple and basic level of satisfaction. I wouldn't say that Tony's quite hits that mark, but they aren't far off. In all fairness I made the mistake of ordering a rustic crust when what I really wanted was the classic Napoli crust, which is super thin. That being said, although what I did get wasn't quite what I wanted, it was very good. I also tried a slice of their quattro formaggio and one with fig on it. Those were both good, but I'm a sucker for simplicity. Next time, and there will definitely be a next time, I will order their classic Napoli marguerita and perhaps the rating will go from a 4 to a 5.

Friday night dinner at 6 pm. Near immediate seating. Wait staff was pleasant. Gave us a run down of the different pizza's and how they are strategically arranged on the menu. Go for the "T" down the middle was my impression. Bruschetta - Awesome. Heirloom tomatoes. Yum yum. How can you go wrong. Delicious. The plate was also nicely decorated by a frame of olive oil and basalmic vinegar drops. Meat balls - Awesome. My only criticism is that they could have been a little hotter and maybe a bit of searing on the outside to aid a bit of crisp texture. Otherwise no complaints. Magherita pizza - Gotta go for the Gold right! The porcelain tower plate was a nice touch. Fabulous. Delicious. I can see how others may not like it. The center part of the pizza (the tips of each slice) was soggy. And yes there is a bitterness to the crust. But that sogginess was actually pretty damn good because all the flavors are concentrated at the tip and the dough kinda mops up all the flavors. Besides on bite the tip is gone and you're on to the rest of the pizza with a perfectly crisp and dry crust. As for the bitterness, that's a taste preference. I personally like the bitterness. Dunno how to explain it except that I liked it. It's kinda like a dark chocolate vs. milk chocolate thing. Well worth it. Gonna come back for the other pizza flavors next time. Can't wait. Good job Tony.

A 1.5 hour wait is no problem, as long as you deliver solid Pizza like Tony's. Baseball playoffs on the Bar TV, cold beer on tap, great friends, great conversation and to wrap it up, some of the best pizza I've had at a restaurant (I'm kind of weird in that I love Round Table above all others). We had the Margherita and the Sicilian style Colombo.  Both were outstanding and left me very stuffed and happy. Service was solid and prices very reasonable ~ only about $20 per person for the two pizzas, a salad, plate of meatballs and sodas.

Rainy Friday night started with dinner at Tony's.  Packed as always, I put my name on the list and was told an hour.  Went to the bar and had a beer to wait for my friend.  1 beer, then 2 beers.  About 40 mins. into the wait, phone rang and table is ready. Started with the spinach salad, which had onions, sunflower seeds and goat cheese dressed with balsamic vinaigrette.  Really good.  Next was an order of the meatballs.  Three large meatballs in a great, fresh tomato sauce.  Great flavor and actually very light.  Final course was one of the pizza's.  We had the New Yorker, with various meat products.  Entire pie was great, right mix of cheese, sauce and meats.  Crust was perfectly done. Service was a little slow, but we weren't in a huge hurry.  If we were it would have made a difference.  Overall, we had a great meal.  Best of all I had a $25 gift certificate, so entire dinner was $14 after the gift certificate.

Man, I just had my second meal at this place in two weeks. It's difficult to wrap my head around how this place can have the best pizza I've ever had, particularly since I just came back from a week in Italy. Before I get to the pizza, let's talk about the other stuff going on at this place. There's a bar that does amazing 'classic' cocktails, made with top shelf stuff and an eye to decadence. Had the 'Aviator', made with Hendrick's gin as my first drink of the morning, and I felt like I was a Pan-Am pilot in the 60s grabbing one before my flight out of SFO. ;) Tony's also has an amazing staff -- lovely hostesses, an on-top-of-it manager, attentive waiters, talented bartenders, and (of course) awesome pizza cooks. Very keen on customer service, and a lot of fun too. Now for the pizzas: Just awesome! I've had about six different pizza types there, but I have to say nothing tops the pizza margherita, which is made in a blazing hot wooden oven with authentic dough and just a handful of ingredients. What comes out just rocks my world -- just the perfect amount of salt, the right consistency crust, great sauce, and it just disappears from any table it's put out on. It's so simple, but God, so good. Also worth calling out the sides: I am a lifelong green bean hater, and I had some garlic 'laced' beans here today that I just couldn't stop eating. Also some yummy garlic fries, and lots of other great sides, if for some reason you want something other than the pizza. Wine menu also seems to have a lot of fun wines, including the Gragnano della Penisola Sorrentina, which is a sparkling red they have in Naples with their pizza. We had two bottles today with lunch, and I was in heaven! I'm only sad this place is so good it won't be long before it takes an hour to get in. Go now, while the gettin' is good. :)

Pizza is usually the LAST craving I have but as I was spending the afternoon in North Beach with my children and they had just attended Mass...in Italian, I thought it only fair to let them pick our lunch destination. My 10 year old son immediately recognized the name of the restaurant from his addiction to the Food Network and pizza is a no-brainer for little kids.. We were easily seated and attended to by a fantastic waiter and were fortunate to order the famous margarita pizza. We also ordered the caesar and arugula salads (more than the 5 of us could eat but tasty and fresh). One child ordered a "mini cheese pizza" from the kids menu and it was enough to feed two of her siblings!!! (nicely priced for  a kids meal) My only "complaint" is that her pizza came out almost 15 minutes before ours.  The waiter was great about updating us and explaining that our first pizza was a bit "charred" and Tony would not allow it to come to the table....if only 73 are made daily you would think they would treat them like gold. However, it was worth the wait!!!  Light, fresh sauce, thin chewy crust and bubbly mozzarella...divine!!! The hostess encouraged the children to look at the awards, wall of photos and say Hi to Tony who was making pizzas in his wood burning oven.   I will happily return!

Guess I should not have had this pizza right after getting home from Italy, but I was craving some good Italian pizza.  Pretty good pizza, but doesn't hold a candle to the pizza in Italy. Too crowded in the restaurant so I went in the back and got a slice and a calzone which was to thick.  I think i'll give them another try as a eat in.

I'm a little irked and need to write a review via my iPhone app. Tried to make an order to go. I let the phone ring for 7 minutes. No, seriously. That's how long it took me to walk there.  Finally showed up and decided to order. I wanted the margherita pizza but they were out. Asked the young lady if they had anything with pizza. She umms and ahhs for a bit and mumbles "no we only have chicken in the salads." and then directed me to another woman to answer my question. The woman looks at me with a confused face like "what's chicken?" finally says I can add chicken to any pizza for $5. I asked a few more questions and the young lady kept directing me to the woman like she was a translator. Ordered two pizzas and it was $47. Really?  Not impressed at all but I haven't eaten it yet. Maybe that'll change my review.

The fabulous truffle pizza was the only good part of my experience here. Everything else was "meh" and in one instance "bat shit crazy". Let me 'splain: We were part of a large birthday party and we called ahead days before asking if we would be able to be seated since they don't take reservations. "no problem!" they said "come early and we'll seat you STAT. We got there and the hostess was FREAKING OUT about the size of our party. She really made us feel that we were somehow nailing her to the cross with our numbers (hello? this is your job...AND we called ahead). Needless to say, we were not seated right away, in fact, they told us to be there at 6 (and we were), but we did not sit down to eat until 8. Onto the food: two out of three pizzas were super "meh". Like, tomato sauce on foccacia bread...nothin' special AT ALL. I was pretty surprised given all the glowing reviews (and as a native New Yorker I am always on the look out for a fine pie). The one shining star of the night was the truffle pizza which was BANGIN' I gotta admit. If everything had been like that pizza, stars would be plentiful in this here review. But alas, they were not. Moving onward: we brought our own cake (given that it was a b-day party and our b-day girl had a very specific cake she loves). They neglected to tell us that there was a bull shit "cake-age" fee of $2 a slice. When we asked the hostess why this had not been disclosed to us before the bill came (and why it wasn't printed on the menu), she yelled "I'm not going to argue with you!!! PEACE BE WITH  YOU!" It was weird, and more than a little crazy. And I won't be going back.

If you love pizza like I do, this is the spot.  I have eaten pizza in this town since I was a kid and I love this new place.  Get there early and if you're in a group arriving separately, every man for himself, this joint packs out fast!  I highly recommend the Margherita (and not just because I dated her in high school).  This pizza has it all, chewy crust with just a bit of charring and a perfect sauce...oh, no I'm starting to "Jones" for the stuff!  Really, if you don't like this pizza you are either loaded or addicted to the Costco combo slice with a Diet Coke.  Seriously, this place makes pizza making a religion. P.S. If the place is full, you can still order at the bar!

Nom Nom Nom.  This is some pretty good pizza right here. They were out of the margherita when we got there (apparently, they only make a set number a day, 73 or something like that...) so we settled on a campari, a new yorker, and a third one I now no longer remember!  However, they were all delicious! Prices are reasonable.  Service was decent.  But the pizza was superb!  Thin crust that was soft but not soggy.  Excellent sauces and ingredients.     Having lived in Chicago for a while now, I am getting pretty picky with my pizza, I would go back to Tony's again in a heartbeat! A+++++++++!  Would do business with again!

Tony's Pizza Napoletana has the best pizza on the planet, period! One trip to Tony's and you'll be sold. It's no wonder why Tony has the reputation in the pizza world that he has. He is truly the best pizza maker anywhere. When you go to Tony's, and you better go, plan on a 45-60 minute wait. There is always a line and rarely does anyone that has been there before pull their name off the waiting list. Yes, it's that good!  If you're fortunate enough to get in the door early and get one of the 73 Margarita Pizzas that are made each day, count yourself as lucky! This is the pizza that Tony has won the world title with and it is the most ridiculously delicious thing you'll ever have in your mouth. If you don't get a Margarita don't fret, every pizza on the menu is top shelf.    On our most recent trip to the Bay Area, last week, my wife and I ate at Tony's twice in a three day period. This is unusual for us especially on a trip to SF. With so many dining choices we try to hit a different place every night, but Tony's is worth a return trip.  The morning before our first dinner we were walking by the pizzeria when I noticed the day's food delivery on the sidewalk out front. As my wife and I stopped to admire the 50 lb. bags of double zero flour we were approached by someone from inside. It turned out to be Tony himself. We asked some questions about the ingredients and I took a picture of Tony and my wife. As we parted ways I noticed that Tony was oiling the wood deck in front of the restaurant and wiping it down. That may not seem like a big deal, but for me if a guy takes enough pride in his place to do a job like that himself imagine the pride he must take in his food.  Later that evening we returned to Tony's for dinner. We decided to try the coal-fired pizzas as opposed to our normal wood-fired pies. As usual, they were delicious! There is definitely a difference between the coal and wood-fired pizzas as the wood changes the flavor slightly, but both are incredible. Two nights later we returned and had the wood-fired sauce and cheese pizzas. This is a solid alternative to the limited production margaritas. You can't make a mistake with any of Tony's pies. The wine list is great and they have a full bar with a good beer selection.  I'm sure that all of the staff is great, but we were lucky enough to have an excellent server both nights, Matthew. If you want to request a server Matthew is the guy to get. He is friendly, knowledgeable and fast.    BTW, if you've never had a Napoletana style pizza let me give you one tip: the crust is supposed to be slightly charred! It's not burnt, that's how it's supposed to be!!

Stopped in after happy hour on a Friday. About a 30 min wait for a table. We went to a bar nearby that I won't mention (because I like it to much to share it), had a drink, and the hostess called us before the drinks were empty. The salsiccia was simply the best slice of pizza I have ever eaten. Clean, vibrant flavors and a crust that somehow manages to be crunchy and chewy all at the same time. Staff is friendly and efficient. Tony came out and chatted with us for at least 10 minutes. We had to go back on Saturday to get the credit card my wife left behind, but it was worth the effort because we found out that they do accept take out orders, so on Sunday we dropped in, placed an order, let our dog terrorize pigeons in Washington Square Park for 20 minutes and picked up two pizzas. Only complaint was that the hostess said she would call when the pizzas were ready, but didn't.

I find it pretentious that Tony only makes a certain number of the margarita pizzas a day.  Why artificially bring down supply? We ordered the fig pizza (forget what it's called on the menu).  Way too sweet.  I had to take some of the sauce/fig off in order to eat it.  Other than that, it was good, but not spectacular.  I'm surprised this won a Food Network Challenge.  The crust was also nothing special, and I feel like the crust is an important metric of a good pizza. My SO was very very disappointed.  We waited more than an hour, and he LOVES pizza, and he pretty much hated the place.  What we did like were the MEATBALLS.  Really big, good value, DELICIOUS, and only reason this review made it to 3 stars.  I'd definitely order the meatballs.  Next time (if it happens, which probably won't), I'll try the special margarita pizza.

During a great staycation in North Beach, a local recommended that we try the new place down the street- Tony's. I have no complaints.... at all.  The bartender was so friendly and even got Tony to bring out a special appetizer for us of figs, Parmesan and a balsamic reduction just cause i mentioned i liked figs.  As for the drinks, they were all amazing, made with fresh, local muddled fruits including a peach Bellini and a white nectarine mint julep. We shared the Greek salad and "THE" margarita pizza which definitely deserved to be the 2007 World Pizza Cup Winner in Naples, Italy.   Tony even came back to see how everything tasted. Top it all off with a delightful affagato.... can't wait to go back!  I just hope that it doesn't get to busy to get a spot at the bar.

Plus: Great location, full bar, good salads and fresh ingredients. Minus: AVERAGE pizza, especially for a place with this kind of "claim to fame". I expected a truly thin crust with that great crunchy/chewy texture, but didn't get it. Very slow service, seemed a bit disorganized and when water spilled all over our table we had to ask them to come clean it up after waiting about 15 minutes. Was told to order 3 pizzas for 4 people, was waaaay to much. Won't go back.

The wait was ridiculously long - almost clocking in at TWO hours!!! Luckily we weren't starving so passing the time in a nearby bar wasn't so bad an option. By the food finally came, I was ready to eat... Of the three pizzas we ordered, the Cal Italia was delightful and the New Yorker and Magherita just all right. I found the famed wood fired dough too soft (and yet not chewy enough), but the coal fired crust was done just perfectly crunchy-crisp-yet-chewy. We also ordered a salad that was decent, but not memorable. And I'd advise to avoid the chicken wings. (Buy a frozen bag of wings from Costco and you'll have a tastier dish.) As far as service goes - I wasn't too impressed with the hostess attitude or the wait. Really... the food doesn't justify that attitude lady. But our waiter was very nice and we never were hurried (although have the dinner at 9 pm probably helped that fact). Overall... I guess a mixed review. I'd definitely go back for the Cal Italia coal fired pizza... but the attitude and the wait and the fact that nothing else impressed me that much probably means it'll be a while before it crosses my mind to eat at Tony's Pizza Napoletana. Oh wells.

Tony knows pizza, that's for sure. Pick from the menu or customize the thickness of your crust. My favorite was the pizza with Prosciutto. We asked to have it made extra thin and it was amazing. It was not too salty, which often times is the case with prosciutto, just perfect. We also had the meatballs, which were delicious and so was the sauce it came with. Overall, 4 people, 2 salads, 1 side dish of meatballs, 3 pizzas and we ate it all. That's how good it was! See for yourself. Wait wasn't too bad. On a Wednesday at 7.30pm, table for 4, about 20 min wait. My 2nd experience at this place on 8/13/2010: Wait on Friday at 6pm, about 20 min. Food excellent. Service on the other hand.... I wasn't that thrilled this time. My husband's ice cream was almost melted by the time he got his espresso for his affogato and other little things that can make a special night out a drag... I would still go back, though.

NOTHING tastes as good as sweet revenge. Let me just start by saying, that's not the type of revenge you're thinking of, it's a drink. I went to Tony's with a friend one day to grab lunch because she's been raving about the pizza and the drinks there. We both are grey goose lovers, so she said I would love the drinks that they make there, and she was absolutely right. I fell in love that day, with my sweet revenge and my truffle pizza. The full name of this wonderful drink is Polly Purebread's Sweet Revenge. It's made with Grey Goose la poire, St. Germain Liqueur, grapefruit and lemon juice, egg white (yes, i said egg whites and don't worry. you wont get salmonella)  and vanilla bean syrup. It tastes like a refreshing light sweetened water. Dangerous because three hours later the next thing you know... you're on your eighth one. If I had it my way, I would order it in a pitcher. Depending on  the season, the truffle pizza may vary. When we went, $39 dollars for the pizza. Not a bad price to pay for truffles shavings. (Mind you, I'll eat almost anything with truffle shavings or truffle oil) We killed the pizza and then I wanted to lick the plate it came on. The only thing bad about this place is the wait, but its well worth it.

Per all of the recommendations, we ordered the Margherita pizza - which reminded me of Italy (and makes me want to go back). The pancetta salad we ordered was delicious - good size for two people to share and the staff was very friendly. As this place is right around the corner from my place, next time I will probably just order pizza to go. The atmosphere is OK but nothing special.

We love this place! We've eaten here on two separate trips to San Francisco, and it's been great both times. Delicious, thin-crust pizza, good wine list and friendly servers. It was a real treat to leave 100 degree heat in Austin in the morning, and then enjoy great pizza and wine at an outdoor table at Tony's, in a jacket and scarf, that same night. The location is great, just off of Washington Square Park in North Beach. Before or after your pizza, head two doors down to Tony Nic's for a Campari and soda, or a Fernet, to complete your North Beach experience.

Why is this place closed on Mondays of all days??? Another great pizza place if you can get a seat, this is where you go when you're hungry and want a hearty pizza. First time I came here, we ordered the seasonal pizza, butternut squash with proscuitto. Amazing.  They are known for their margherita pizzas, but I'm a meat girl and I wasn't overly excited for it. It was so so. What's nice though are the portions are right for the price, and they have either thin or thick crust options.  I'm definitely a thin crust girl myself. Besides pizza, they have a full menu of pastas etc of italian food.  Great meatballs and their lasagna is good. Worth going for takeout, and on nice north beach nights fun to sit outdoors and people watch the activities on washington square.  Fun place to go with groups, hidden gem in north beach but I understand why its so popular. Worth checking out.

Summary:  I thought the best pizza was found in New York, but I was proven wrong. Tony's takes pizza beyond the average slice and makes it an art. I went into Tony's with a very skeptical mind and came out a believer.  The pizza here is special to say the least, with noticeably fresh and high quality ingredients no matter what you order.  Fresh ingredients alone may be enough for 4 stars, but the perfectly designed combinations cooked in the perfect oven (Tony's offers coal, wood, gas and electric ovens) makes it a 5 in my mind. The award winning Margherita is worth a try for first timers if you get there early enough (they only make 73 per day).  If not, I recommend giving the coal fired varieties a chance.  Tony's is a place you will need to go back to a few times to find your favorite pizza from your favorite oven. As with everywhere good in San Francisco, you need to be prepared to wait for a seat.  If you are lucky you can grab a first come first serve seat at the bar, but I would expect a 30-45+ minute wait on most popular nights.  The wait is manageable because Tony's takes your phone number, allowing you to roam North Beach and grab a drink at one of its many bars (I recommend Church Key).

I tried the Cholula and Diavola pizzas, gorgonzola fries and calamari as starters and was sadly disappointed paper it sounds good. The prices are reasonable the choices are great but when factored in with poor service and lacking flavor two stars is being generous.... sorry to say. Maybe it's gone to their head that business is good so far that their staff feels they can be condescending and elitist but I thought I was dining at a local pizza place not a 5 stars restaurant me. All in all I'd skip it order from somewhere that delivers and call it a day.

A good East coast style pie, but more expensive than it should be.  Their pies are mainly one size and they're what I'd call a 'small pie' if you were ordering in an east coast pizzeria. This is the quick takeout place next to the restaurant and you can order any of the pies from Tony's next door. The Margherita is really good, yes, again, but small for $20. We really like the 'fig and prosciutto with balsamic' pie too. They also charge a 'box fee' if you need a box for the pizza, which well, you'll need when you're buying a pizza from a takeout place that has only one table.  Seems a little, well, not right.

Cold bread :( Nice assortment of olive oil to dip the cold bread in :) Pancetta con Rucola salad :) -  This salad was huge definitely meant to be shared.  Nice balance.  Peppery arugula, salty and crunchy pancetta,  sweet balsamic reduction and fresh mozerrella.  YUM!! Margherita Pizza- I enjoyed the taste of the pizza but either there was too much sauce or it was watery.  As a result the tip of the pizza was a little soggy.  The rest of the crust was crisp, light and had a nice char and smokiness to it. In the end this is definitely one of the better pizza places in the Bay and I will definitely be back.

First, a disclaimer: I would have given this five stars were it not for the host, Tyler. Second disclaimer: I worked in the service industry for years, so my patience/sympathy for those who work in it is pretty high. Oh, Tyler. Where to start. First order of business: If you are on the phone while, oh, enough parties come in that that they begin lining up outside occurs, I have some simple advice: put the caller on hold for a second, turn to the people and tell them, "I'll be with you in a minute, thanks for waiting." Nope. If, after ten minutes (we counted), you are still not off the phone, ask someone else to help you. Secondly: seat people in the order you take their name (in regards to the number in their party, of course). What. The. Hell. I thought we were all participating in an episode of 'Punk'd,' but then I remembered we were not famous. Onward! From start to finish, this food was so thoughtfully prepared and absolutely to die for. Apple Salad: Light and amazing, apple vinaigrette was not too sweet, and ho, little scooped out balls of apple! Delightful. Margherita Pizza (__/73): I'm sure it's all been said before. Better than Delfina, better than Beretta. The sauce was so incredibly balanced it made you realize how acidic or sweet most other sauces truly are. Just enough oil, just enough cheese. Pasta Pomodoro w/garlic bread: Super light and fresh and good. We ate our way through a lot of everything, but what I liked was that we didn't leave with that heavy. post-italian food coma. Everything was light and simple. We watched Tony as he prepared everything and it was like watching an artist, truly. He even took two patrons back into the kitchen to see how something worked. It was amazing, and I will definitely be back. Hopefully, Tyler will not.

This is a really fun Italian restaurant in the heart of Little Italy.  Located across the street from Washington Square in San Francisco.  We tried the Cal Italia instead of the Margherita and I must say that we were pretty stoked.  The combination of flavors: shaved parmasean, figs and procciutto were really interesting and complementary.  Nice job Tony! Check out my pictures of the meatballs, too!  We ordered 6 meatballs in addition to the pizza.  It was the perfect amount of food to share.

Tony's Pizza is by far the best pizza in the city. No joke. How is it that I haven't reviewed it yet? I have been here so many times and I literally have a hard time going and not ordering my new favorite pizza the Cal Italia. It is a "sweet pizza" because of the fig jammy on top with the proscuitto and cheese. Its a no red sauce pizza, which I learned is called White Pizza. Of course the Margarita Pizza is delicious, just like it Italy. **If its not too busy, and you have a small enough group, ask to eat by the pizza oven in the side room. Its a real experience to watch the pizza masters in their element working and to see your own pizza be made.** On Easter we also got a free Panettone, which I thought was a really nice mom and pop touch. I enjoyed it very much and left happy! So glad to have some great pizza in my 'hood.

Fantastic pizza joint! It was surprisingly busy for a Wednesday night but the wait was only about 10 minutes even though they told us it would be a 30-40 minute wait. The Margherita pizza is superb as advertised. The crust is thin and crispy. The sauce is delicious and the cheese just melts in your mouth. I can see why it's such a big hit. The Cholula pizza is found under their "Classic American" section and is another good choice. Though not as great as their Margherita pizzas, the Cholula is much more meaty with an emphasis on spicy. They use jalapeno peppers to give it a kick. The hot sauce blended with the cheese works wonders on the taste buds and works nicely with the chicken and chorizo bits. Our waitress was very very cheerful -- almost as if she had too much coffee. Nevertheless, we enjoyed her service and the pleasant attitude she provided. The only gripe I had was that we sat outside on a windy night. The heaters did not work very well so we were suffering a bit. Fortunately, the pizzas warmed our stomachs right up. If I can find parking, I'm definitely coming back again! Big thanks to my friend who took me here for my birthday and was gracious enough to treat! 4 stars.

We stopped in here pretty late on a week night. Unfortunately, they were out of their wood fired pizza, which was the one we had really wanted to try. Even though it was late, our server was pleasant, and patient while we decided what to order. I'm not a huge pizza aficionado, so I let the boys choose the pies we'd share. I don't remember exactly what they were, but they were both thin crust, one had spicy salami, and I believe the other was a simple cheese pizza. I liked both pizzas, but didn't love them. Although, the sauce on the cheese pizza was really good. For my calories, there are other thin crust pizzas I like better. Since I rarely eat pizza, I'd probably try a new place, or go back to Gialina's before I'd return here.

We were lucky to eat one of the only 73 margharita pizzas that Tony's makes each day. I have no idea why 73 is the cap, but I suppose it's a good business tactic. And, well, it's good. With a little spicy oil, it was delicious. I don't love wine coming in a water glass and the decor isn't very interesting, but the food makes up for everything.

The best pizza I have ever had in a restaurant, hands down. You will most likely have to wait a long time for a table: deal with it. Or do as I do on a nice day-order ahead for take out and have a picnic in Washington Square Park. The margherita is what they are known for, but my favorite is the Pizza Campari (formerly known as Scarola y Pancetta). The meatballs are unreal: the first time I tried them, I got choked up with tears. They are that good.

If you are going for pizza in San Francisco, Tony's Pizza Napoletana is the place you should be patronizing, hands down. Tony has won multiple awards for his pizza and the ingredients are imported from Napoli; it shows. This place rivals 2amy's in Georgetown out on the east coast for best Neapolitan pizza. We unfortunately arrived too late to order his award wining Margherita, of which only 73 are made per day. However, they did offer us a version that uses some substitutes and it was well worth the money; true Neapolitan pizza. What was even more fantastic was watching them make the pizza and work the brick oven. There is no excuse... if you want pizza, go here.

This is hands-down the best pizza I've ever eaten. The dough is awesome, and the margarita (either with the caputo flour or the san felice) is perfection. If you don't like the char, please go somewhere else so I can eat 5 minutes earlier. :) I really Really REALLY hate to wait for food, especially when there is so much other great food around. So you know this place and the food is really special. Ordinarily I would deduct a star for the insanely long wait times (last night was 1.5 hours), but they've improved a lot. They take down your cellphone number to call you when the table is ready. So you can go to a nearby cafe, have a cannoli first, relax and have a nice chat with somebody cute while you're waiting... ;)

Wow, this was good pizza. We got 2 pizzas to go. Tried the truffle so we could get something out of the 900 degree oven, and a basic NY style sausage and green pepper. We forgot to ask for the NY to be extra thin (will next time) but they were both excellent. The truffle pizza was rich and decadent. The sausage pizza was everything you want pizza to be; great sauce, good cheese blend, tasty sausage. Except for the truffle pizza prices are reasonable. And getting to go meant no crazy wait for a table. I'll be back.

The pizza was okay - not great but it was the disorganization of the place that brought the stars down!! You walk up and order and expect to get the pizza from the case that just was brought out of the coal fire but no they reheat the pizza for you...it was weird so you end up waiting longer for reheated pizza not to mention we waited 15 for this process to happen.  The dough as a result of the second bake was tough...in north beach with so many good restaurants I would say step your game up Tony!!

Tony makes an iconic pizza that puts North Beach on the culinary map. His margherita could easily be sold in Napoli; it's perfection. There really is nothing more to add. Tip: if he's out of the Margherita (made with San Felice flour), you can always ask for a Margherita made with the Caputo flour.

Perhaps my expectations were too grand.  After all, I had heard only great things from every article I read about Tony's, all the Yelp reviews, and the guy won a pizza award in Italy!  When I heard there were four different types of pizza made in four different types of ovens - I was more than excited, I think I peed my pants a little bit.   I waited until my sister came into town to visit with her pizza loving boyfriend (he had a shirt that simply says, "pizza is the best") to try Tony's Pizza Napoletana.  I figured with five people we could actually order all four types of pizzas and not look like total piggies.  The wait was not nearly as long as I had imagined, although we did go on a Sunday night.  And the staff was friendly and attentive (especially the bartender who really knew his stuff).   On to the pizzas.  Luckily our pizzas were somewhat staggered so we were not confronted with all four pizzas at the same time.  The Sicilian was very thick (as was expected) but surprisingly lighter than I had expected.  The dough is filled with tiny pockets of air so it was more of a focaccia base than a dense dough.  Oddly enough it was one of my favorites of the night - even though I am a thin crust pizza person.  The Margarita was tasty, but I guess I was expecting more since this was the pie that won such praise in Italy.  Crust was very good and charred, but I am not sure it was any better than Delfina or A16.  Both the Italian style and American style were disappointing - I would not order either again.  Very average pizza with a crust somewhere between thick and thin, its like it could not commit to either.   If you are in North Beach then Tony's is a good option for dinner in an area filled with tourist traps.  But I am not sure I would trek out here again, there are better pizza options in the city.

I went here for my co-worker's birthday lunch.  He's Italian and kept talking about how this was the only place you should ever eat for Italian food/pizza.  So we ventured out of the office a little before noon hoping to beat the lunch rush.  Mission accomplished.  In fact, it was busy, but not to the point where anything was lacking. We ordered:  Pizza Margherita, Romano's Original Stromboli, spinach salad and Italian Gorgonzola fries. Everything was so delicious.  I was actually full walking out of this restaurant and we had leftovers.  The service was really good and extremely attentive.  Tony was also there making pizzas and stopped by to check on all the tables.  He sat down with us for a chat and when he found out that it was my co-worker's birthday, bought us a round of drinks.  I'm definitely a fan of the restaurant, the food, the service and Tony. Tony's Pizza Napoletana is like experiencing greatness.

Tony's Coal-Fired Pizza & Slice House brings a classic New York pizza to North Beach. A spin-off of the popular Tony's Pizza Napoletana, which is right next door, Tony's Coal-Fired Pizza & Slice House (TCFPSH) harnesses anthracite, rather than wood, to power its 800 degree ovens.  Made famous by such pizza Meccas as Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana and Sally's Apizza in New Haven, Conn. as well as Grimaldi's Pizzeria in Brooklyn, New York, coal-fired ovens imbue pies with a slightly smoky, earthy flavor, while blistering the crust ever so slightly. The "New York" slice ($5.00) lived up to its name, boasting a thin--but not too thin--slightly crispy crust, barely sweet tomato sauce, and just the right amount of mozzarella.  As is tradition for eating New York pizza, one can easily fold TCFPSH slices lengthwise to make eating easier.  And, slices at TCFPSH are not droopy, slimy, and uncooked in the middle, showing the the pizzaiolo really does know his oven. While slices at TCFPSH bring the East Coast vs. West Coast pizza battle to a new level, the meat ball sub unfortunately was "sub-par" (pun intended).  The meat was tender, tasty, and not greasy--obviously a well-seasoned mixture of beef and veal--but a too-large Acme sourdough bun dwarfed the meat balls and a dearth of sauce made the sandwich too dry.  Other sandwiches like the Chicken Parmesan Wedge ($7.50) looked fantastic.  A slab of breaded chicken breast is smothered with the same sauce and mozzarella from the pizza and served on an Acme Italian roll.  One couldn't find better in the Bronx. Raising the bar in the SF pizza wars, TCFPSH brings the East Coast to North Beach.

The food is great but they need some serious help with their seating procedures. We were quoted an hour twenty inside or twenty minutes outside on a Sat night. The hostess failed to mention you can not drink outside which is why the wait was so short. Tables sat empty for more than 10 minutes with out being bussed meanwhile the line wait times increased. Tony, bus your tables and get more people in. Servers walking past a dirty table over and over is unacceptable.

Yes, you will wait but there are plenty of places to hang out while you wait including the park and nearby watering holes. Love that they call the cell with your table, nothing is worse than loitering around outside on a corner. Excellent salad (gorgonzola, apple, walnuts) and good pizza (panchetta, cheeses, and cherry tomatoes). Crust has a great flavor although I tend to like my pizza with a little more crisp and a little less grease. They were busy and it really made our service slow. Food came out fairly quick after we gave our order, but waiting to get the food wrapped and then waiting again to pay the check took another 20 mins. Not a huge deal but it's a bit of a buzz kill and I like to keep the energy consistent throughout a meal. I would recommend the spot if in the area again, but I visit north beach so infrequently that I'd most likely want to try out somewhere new.

I wandered into this place while they were still setting it up and got to talking with the owner.  He said pizza.  I said nice.  He said authentic Napoli style.  I just returned from Naples and still had the basiganol in my teeth and have made thousands of pizzas in my lifetime. Prove it. I was floored.  It brought me back to this little place in Pozzuoli Naples where they yell at you from the kitchen because they don't write the order down then bring you some wine and sit with you at the table and talk about the family.   We ordered the calamari with some hot peppers and a basic margarita pizza.  I could not stop eating it.  Had to grab a calzone to go and yeah, that pretty much rocked my shorts too. This is one of those places that will be around forever if they manage it well and maintain that level of quality.  I hate giving them 5 stars because now I won't be able to get a table but these guys have tipica Napoletana perfetto! Bravo!

Freaking incredible pizza. My wife and I were in town visiting a friend and had dinner there, outside, with our dogs in tow. The GM (I think) came out was was extremely accommodating to us and our dogs, even searching inside for dog treats to give them. We were so impressed with our Sicilian-style Burratina Di Margherita that we came back the following night, and received the same warm service. The second night we had the Pizza Campari and Pepe Bianco. Both nights we dined late, so service was great, with no wait for tables. I have always been impressed with the pizza offerings in North Beach, but Tony's sets the bar, high, for freshness and deliciousness. * I almost forgot: my wife had a baked spinach and cheese calzone. Again, one of the best I've ever had. We both are vegetarians and had no difficulty with the menu.

Ok, went back and had a completely different (aka BETTER) experience with service -- the host (a different one from the first time) was super friendly and helpful and our server (who happened to be one of the bartenders) was great. Pizza was still really good -- happy that the service is (or can be) too. Maybe weeknights are a better idea for a nicer dining experience? PS Eating here, at the bar, during one of the better baseball games I've ever seen, which happened to be a playoff game where the Giants win? So much fun.

Tony's is the most delicious pizza in San Francisco, without a doubt.  I'm not even much a fan of pizza but I crave this place.  Service is consistently great and I think they are mindful of how they hire - everyone I've met on the staff seems like a genuinely cool person and turnaround appears low, which is impressive for a restaurant.  They had an absolute sweetheart of a host (was there for years, but haven't seen her lately) - I ran into her once at dinner in a different restaurant, ran over to say hello, then sent her and her date a dessert.  She's that great... and prob thought I was a little crazy.  And Tony... he is the best.  He's a modern throwback to every too-cool-for-you character you've either idolized or had a crush on.  It's a special treat to see him working the oven, and watching him interact with the patrons makes you realize that he cares a lot about the quality of the food and gets sincerely excited about how much people enjoy being at the restaurant.   I know for many the pizza crust is just a delivery mechanism for sauce and toppings, the handle thoughtlessly tossed aside, but one of the things that impresses me most about Tony's pizzas are the crusts.  Depending on the style of pizza you get, it comes with a distinct crust, all of which have memorable-ly good taste and texture. Favorites: * Margherita: Of course.  Thin crust.  A little runny with the olive-oil drizzled on top.  There's another version (Spacca Napoli) with burratta and cherry tomatoes that is also delicious. * Jersey's Original Tomato Pie: This is my go-to.  Thicker, chewier crust.  Sauce has more of a garlic and spice kick to it. * Watermelon Radish Salad: These look more like mini-tacos - was surprised when I first ordered them because I was expecting it to look like a traditional salad.  Really pretty presentation. I haven't tried any of the pastas but I can't imagine they'd be anything but awesome.  I mean to order one every time but my stomach can only hold about two slices of pizza at any given sitting and can't not order pizza here, you know?! Tony's doesn't take reservations and even at off-peak hours, there's usually a line.  Good thing is, there's a lot of fun things to see/do within strolling distance so it's usually a fun wait (unless you're super hungry).

The margherita pizza here is amazing. The sauces that came with the bread were delicious. The salad I had for an appetizer was really good. The pizzas serve two people. With drinks and food it ended up costing about $19 per person. Not bad at all considering how great the experience was.  "Tony" came out to check on us several times. I was entertained by how different the traditional pizza was when compared to the "american" pizza. Thin crust is definitely the way to go.

The BEST pizza I've ever had and I'm not exaggerating! Arrived a few mins after noon and was able to snatch the last table available.  Tiny quaint little place.  Already knew what to order as I've heard so much about their two medal winners. Margherita Pizza - World cup winner in Italy...truly lived up to all it's expectations.  The sauce and cheese just melts in your mouth and the crust has the perfect slight burnt and crispiness. Cal Italia - Food network challenge gold meal...a sauce less but sweet pizza...sounds weird but tastes amazing!  The figs are a hit! The pizzas only come in one size...it's about equal to a small at most pizza places.  And they are very light so one person can finish one pizza on their own.  I must say though that it's quite expensive at $18 a pizza but it's well worth it!  Can't wait to come back!

Ah Tony! How much I wanted to love your offering... deep sigh. Where to start? We went to Tony's on a Saturday evening. Not the best decision, but I was huuungry for a pizza, and nothing but Tony's would do. The wait's 1.5 hours; but I'll gladly suffer, for Tony's da man. After suffering through 84 minutes of sheer agony, we finally got our table. We were ready to order before our butts could even touch the chairs. Tony's is famous for their pizza margherita; and that's what we'd come to eat. Now Tony says that they make only 73 of them with the special San Felice flour per day; and by the time our butts were ensconced in those chairs, the special dough was long gone. But, that's our fault and you can't blame Tony for it. So we ordered the next best thing, the "margherita extra", made with the not-so-special Caputo flour. And we also ordered another type of pizza, the "original tomato pie", also known as the "upside down pizza" with cheeze under the sauce. And, for good measure, the stir-fried spinach with garlic as an appetizer. Our upside-down pizza came first. It was quite good. The sauce was flavorful, the crust was medium and well done. We quickly dug into it with excitement (and overdue hunger). Next came the Margherita Extra. Whoa... what a disappointment. Even though both pizzae(?) were supposed to be "medium rustic crust", the M.E. was very thin crust. That, in itself, isn't a killer. The worst part was the sauce: it was absolutely flavorless! It was as if someone opened a can of tomato puree and just poured it on the pizza. There were no herbs or spices in the sauce; and it was thin and runny. And then, there were just 6 basil leaves on the entire pizza. Come on, you need more than just 6 paltry leaves! Anyways: the M.E. was a big disappointment. One final insult: they forgot to bring the appetizer, and brought it after we'd dug into the pizzas. I'll chalk that up to a busy night; but I'm guessing, with all the hype, every night is probably a busy night for them. All in all: I was disappointed. Given the crowds and the lack of parking in North Beach, I don't think I'll be back again.

So, I was on a a bread baking kick.  And like everything else i do, I reserched the heck out of it. Which led me to this place, it was featured in Peter Reinhart's blog about pizzas.  So I woke my husband up and told him we had to go.  He actually didn't mind that I woke him up and we went the following Saturday.  That just shows the respect my husband gives my researching capabilities.   So first of all, try to go there in between meals.  My husband, the non-foodie, did not understand this.  Me, being the foodie, understood that even though the blog post was only a couple of days old, meant it was already old news.  (I also saw that the video blog was going to be on food network, to me, that really means old news).  We got there at 4:45pm and still had to wait 45 minutes.   I was lucky enough to wait next to a regular from the neighborhood.  Her recommendations were (if she weren't there, the "limited" amounts on the menu would have told you the best items on the menu) the giant meatballs and the pizza Margherita.  Geez!   I haven't been to Italy, yet but this is close to what I would expect.   Service was great.  For as busy as they are, I ws still able to talk to the 2 hosts and our waiter.  They said the best time to go was the beginning of the week, early lunch, that is as soon as they open.

Some reviews are simple and brief.  This is one of them.  Incredible pizza.  I thought I was in New York at Lombardi's or Patsys...but then I realized that this may be better than even these two New York standard bearers.  They have several different styles of pizza so just try them all.  What a place.  Head to North Beach and grab a few pies.  You won't be sorry.  I will be back soon.

The Margherita pizza is indeed the best (and thinnest) I've had. Better than Delfina, which was good but not memorable. We also had the New Yorker, which was good, but I wasn't a huge fan of the globs of ricotta cheese on the pizza (it did grow on me as I was eating it). The meatball appetizers were awesome, the calamari was good (but I'd order one of the salads next time), and the truffle fries were disappointing. It was my first time having truffle fries, so maybe it was just me. Overall a good experience, but the wait was a little annoying (we waited for at least 45 minutes). No reservations accepted, but I heard that if you go in the same day and tell them when you'll be coming, they'll try to accommodate you. Oh, and the bar seating is first come first serve.

If there were only ONE pizza joint in the WHOLE world i pray it would be Tony's!  Everytime we go we spend at LEAST two whole hours (although often closer to three) because we enjoy it so much.  From the giant meatballs as an appitizer, a pie (either the margarita, the prosuittio pomodoro, the honey and chilie, or the THREE COURSE pizza with a light salad part, a main part, and a dessert part MMMMMMMMM), the variety or vino on the list, to the tiramisu dessert .... It is a fufilling, incredible italian experience!  The staff is SO friendly and the atmosphere is delightful down to the music.  I don't care how long it takes to get a highly coveted seat here - we wait in anticipation and leave talking about what we are going to try next time!  There is no comparison!!!

seriously - every pizza here is astonishingly tasty...like DAMN. and they really know how to get me with their variety of sweet drizzlings that make for deeelicious sweet and savory pies!!! there are 7 new pizzas on the menu...and they are every bit as amazing as the others! these are lighter pizzas - "california style" - they have the same type of crust as the margherita - thin and wet in the center, light, airy and charred around the perimeter. tried the Wild Robiola (mozzarella, straciatella, robiola cheese, wild mushrooms, truffle oil, speck, piave, arugula) - thick shavings of full flavored and slightly sour robiola cheese, thin strips of smokey speck, and bitter arugula sitting on the surface make this pizza very bold-flavored. the tender mushrooms and truffle oil add even more aroma and savoriness. omg loved IT! also got the Pizza Campari (mozzarella, pancetta, goat cheese, escarole, sweet piquante peppers, and campari blood orange reduction) - this one was basically a mini salad on top of a mozzarella and pancetta pizza. it had sweet red peppers, lettuce, and clumps of pungent goat cheese scattered atop the surface. the BEST part was the drizzle of blood orange reduction that added a zesty, tangy sweetness. i wanted to have this one JUST for the campari blood orange reduction. it was wonderFUL! i'll be back to try the Fear and Loathing pizza - pulled pork in tamarind, habaneros, citrus, and tomato over mozzarella, fresh cactus & agave nectar salsa, and queso fresco - purely because it sounds so ridiculous. i wouldn't be surprised if it was absolutely yummers.

I'm fairly certain I didn't order the right pizzas, and wished I had read these reviews before trying Tony's. If I had done my research better, I probably would have gotten the 5-star experience that everyone else on Yelp had. The first pizza we ordered was the Napoli, which on the menu is described as having mozzarella, basil, sea salt and olive oil.  However, the pizza we received had an added topping, something brown and fairly sweet, that threw off the flavor of the pizza. I'm still trying to figure out what it was.  We also ordered Frank's True Italian - good but I think Pauline's does the pesto pizza better. Next time I'll order the Margherita.

This is the best and most authentic pizza margarita in the bay.  The flavor is great and it is truly Naples.  I've also had the New Yorker which is a great meat pie.  Make sure to get here early, the line gets long and they don't take reservations.  Parking can also be difficult to find.

Got the margherita which was soo good. it's very light, rather than greasy. but the real winner was their special that day. i don't remember the name but it was the pizza with no tomato sauce...it had butternut quash, prosciutto, a thin slice of zucchini which you can't even taste (for me that's a good thing!) and cheese. at first i thought it sounded really weird, but when i bit into it...the first thing i thought was wow...it's sweet and cheesy...and reminds me of the taste of a cooked egg...hah, but in a good way! it is a little pricey, but the food is so good dessert...got the princess cake. what a mistake. my memories of princess cakes are that the green layer on the outside is really soft and fluffy looking, but there's was kind of hard and almost artificial looking...it didn't look good. the cake was good, but that green layer on the outside, was not.

So I had heard a lot about how Tony's Pizza was so amazing and my first thought was, really? How AMAZING can pizza be? But, yes it is sooo yummy!! I tried it for the first time in March and have already been back twice. They really aren't kidding about that Margherita pizza and it's secret recipe for the dough! I had it twice and then once on regular dough because they had ran out! They only make 73 per day. (I will leave it up to you to go and find out the reasoning behind this.) You must try it on their special dough! I lucked out on a week night and a weekend day. It also is a bonus that they happen to sell my favorite white wine... Ceretto Blange Arneis. It is light and smooth with a slight effervescence at the end of every sip :) Be warned, it can be a long wait for a table! I lucked out and found seats at the bar twice and once waited an hour for a table, but like I said, it is worth it!

On somewhat of a whim, i decided to stop in for dinner. Wednesday night and there was a wait time of 30 minutes. Obviously, this place is a big favorite of tourist, locals, and randoms. I was so hungry, that I actually did not want to wait the 30 minutes and started walking up the hill to Don Pistos. Got about eight feet and the host came running out, explaining that they had an open seat at the bar right in front of the oven. Obviously, it was meant to be. I couldn't have been more lucky. I ended up speaking with Tony throughout my dinner. Who is extremely humble, entertaining and skilled. Watching him make those pizzas and learning the reason behind his 73 pizza limit was a special treat. I started with a mussels in white wine and garlic sauce, which delicious. A perfect combination of a slightly acidic wine with a hint of garlic. Tony had a special surprise and served a side of green beans blanched in wine with garlic and salt. They were perfectly cooked and complimented both the wine and mussels I had ordered. Luckily, the restaurant had not hit their 73 pizza limit and I was able to get the award winning margherita pizza. It was perfectly cooked in the 900 degree oven, in about 4 minutes. The flavors were perfectly married together. The light tomato sauce with the mozza and basil topped with a very light olive oil. The dough was absolutely amazing. Light and crispy with the perfect amount of chewiness. Sadly, i was too full to enjoy a dessert but i will definitely be going back to try the other pizzas.

I've had pizza in countries all over the world.  I've spent over 6 years learning how to make authentic Neapolitan pizza from scratch.  I've read every book, and tasted every slice.  I've studied pizza as if it was a science.  And do you know what?   Tony's Pizza Napoletana is pizza.  It's earth shatteringly amazing pizza.  What Thomas Keller did for the multi-course formal dinner, what Julia Child did for the home cook, and what Ferran Adrià did for molecular gastronomy, Tony does for pizza.  This isn't some of the best pizza you'll ever have.  It is THE BEST PIZZA you'll ever have.  They'be been open for less than a week. I guarantee you that the food magazines will be writing about Tony's new restaurant and soon it will become the pizza destination in North America.   Everything is fantastic.  There is nothing I would tell you to avoid.  This is pizza in a way Italians could only dream about.  It's completely unlike anything California, or North America for that matter, has experienced before.

To set the stage of my rating, I'm a pizza fanatic from the east coast and have spent a few months in Italy where the pizza can't be beat. That being said, FOR San Francisco Tony's is one of the best thin crust pizza's I've had. The crust is a little over salted, but overall delicious and definitely want to eat more. If you're not overlly snobish about pizza there's no chance you won't love Tony's pizza. I'm not as fanatical about meatballs, but i thought they were also really good and the bartenders definitely know their stuff and make delicious drinks.

OMG the margherita pizza is the best!  I've eaten a few of their pizzas, which are all very tasty, but the margherita is soooo good.  It's nice to sit outside on a decent day (they have heat lamps and covering for cold/weather) and enjoy the goings-on around the park.  I don't like waiting forever for a meal, but I will wait around a while for a table at Tony's.

The line for this for this place says it all. We waited at the bar for our table. The restaurant had a nice feel to it and I liked the outdoor area. They have a pretty good imported beer and cocktail selection. My friends and I ordered the calamari to start, which was really good. I liked the dipping sauce they used, it was way better than the usual cocktail sauce they serve with calamari. The bread was also a winner as well. If you like beer, I recommend trying the Chimay here, it's really smooth. We ordered the Rosemary, White Rose Potato, & Chorizo pizza, which was really good! I will definitely be back. Next time, I would try the clam and garlic pizza and the margarita one that everyone keeps raving about!

My new favorite pizza place in the city. I love a thin chewy crust and we kept raving about their fantastic crust in between bites. I had their award winning Margherita pizza and it was oh so tantalizing to the taste buds. As "plain" as the Margherita pizza is, the sauce... the cheese...the chewy crust was just perfection in a box. (albeit a box designed by Ed Hardy but who cares? Pizza was astounding nevertheless) The hubs had the Campari. It's sauce-less but the hubs loved every bite of it and never mentioned once about it lacking taste or flavor. He even basked a little after finishing his Campari in complete pizza-euphorism. Pricey? Yes, I initially thought so since pizza to-go for two ended up being about $45 but keep in mind, you are getting quality ingredients. It was worth battling through the insane FiDi traffic jam trying to get back to soma to devour the two beauties of a pizza perched in their individual boxes awaiting their fate in our backseat next to our poor hungry, salivating dog. One look at his face it was obvious he was tortured by the delicious aroma that filled the air. And the second best part of having Tony's Napoletana (the first is actually EATING the pizza of course) is not feeling "heavy" even after finishing an entire pizza to yourself. I never thought that would be possible with pizza. Ever. He even said he can have another slice or two and mind you, this guy doesn't usually eat to the point of complete FULLNESS. There's times when I eat more than he does making me feel like the oinker when I'm polishing things off from his plate. Next up on my list: Truffle pizza

Our service could've been better (we ordered two pizzas for our party and they were delivered 15 minutes apart), but the food was amazing.  The deep-fried string beans are a great appetizer, and our two pizzas (Primavera Classic Italian and Margherita) were among the best pizzas ever. The crust is perfect, the toppings are fresh and the sauce explodes with flavor.  Worth the wait to get in! We've been back several times, and while service is never superior, the food is consistently great.  The last time, we tried the Gorgonzola truffle fries, and it was like an orgasm for my taste buds.  So good!

I had lost hope of finding good pizza in SF and then I stumbled upon Tony's.... The sauce on their margherita pizza tastes exactly the same as what I'd had in Naples.... and the crust.... and the puddles of mozzerella... with the few crisps of basil... Too bad I had to share it! Take note that particular pizza is very thin and small - if it wasn't so expensive I'd order one just for myself! We also tried the Italian Prosciutto Pomodorini. We requested ricotta on it - and that tasted even better than the margherita. The salty prosiutto with warm milky ricotta was heaven in each bite. Thankfully this pizza is larger and more substantial. Can't wait to go back and try some of their other combos!!

Excellent Pizza Margherita - very authentic The meal was let down with the second pizza - one that does not appear on the menu now - but included several cheeses and sweet fig sauce. Supposedly an award winner - it just does not seem Italian. There is a perpetual line up, and there is a spot right next to the oven, which we could only tolerate for a few minutes before being reseated. During our meal, other patrons did the same.

4.5 stars for this wonderful slice of pizza heaven! You haven't truly had good pizza until you've dined at Tony's Pizza Napoletana.  Seriously.  The pies here are THAT good - and it doesn't surprise me that the Margherita is acclaimed and has won honors!  The dough is always the perfect consistency - crispy and chewy at the same time.  I usually don't eat crusts of pizza because there is too much dough, but the crusts on these babies are pretty much doomed when I'm here.  I've tried several different kinds of pizzas on the extensive menu and look forward to my next trip here.  I'm salivating as I write this review.

This place is noms! We went here for a friend's bday with promises that this was indeed delicious pizza. Looking at the 45 min wait, I thought in my head, man, this better be good. We had a large group and ordered pretty much every pizza that had meat in it. Along with the meatballs on the side for an appetizer. Everything was really tasty, the only problem was we had ordered so many pizzas and were sitting outside that by the time we got to try all of them the last couple were cold. Would definitely go back and try it again however.

I finally sacrificed the hour wait to see what all the hype was about.  Service was fab, but I have to agree with Diana below.. all the dishes from the complimentary bread and oils.. to the appz... to the pizzas were lacking something?  That little kick that makes you go OoOOoo...  heaven.  And I loveee pizza, so between my travels through NY and Italy.. I'd like to think my opinion isn't entirely unjust.. Mushroom crostini.. loved the toppings but thought the bread was a bit dry and too thick...  no one fought over the last piece. Margherita pizza (sausage added) had a really thin sauce, which is fine since I don't like too much... but it actually tasted a tad watery as well. Quail egg and speck pizza was nice but again, the ingredients don't pop out at you. Leaving the quail eggs out would have made a small difference. I'd still come back to try some of their other variations, and thought the food was good.  But for a $60 tab for two and an hour wait.. definitely hoped for more =T

Went here last night with a group of friends. Told us it would be a 40 minute wait, rang our cell phone to say our table was ready 30 minutes later - cool. Pizza is excellent. We were a party of 5 and got three pies & two salads and it was perfect. Definitely try their Margherita as it was the best I've had so far on the west coast. Only complaint was that their wine set up is a joke. $11 for a glass of red wine and you serve it in a bucket? We asked about ordering a couple carafes of house red and a carafe that serves three glasses starts at $40-50 bones. C'mon, seriously. This is a pizzeria for Christ's sake. Level out the wine options a bit and we'll be coming back.

AWESOME. Finally a restaurant in NB that separates itself from your standard tourist trap and offers quality italian dishes in a less kitschy manner. Having been in the area for years, this particular space at the corner of Stockton/Union has been home to a long list of failed restaurants but I'm glad to see a place like Tony's has come in to set the place right. They have an abundant selection of pizzas (who knew there were so many options) ranging from traditional italian to american style pies. While the lines remain long to dine here, they do offer a take-out option which works well for locals in the 'hood. The pizza americano and rigatoni bolognese were delicious and a great introduction to their menu. The pizza was a little oily but acceptable given the (3) types of meats slathered on top. They do sauces right and I was definitely enjoying my meal. Definitely my new go-to spot for great pizza. They do need to work on the menu a little to at least explain their pizza sizes (or lack thereof). They don't do your standard S/M/L sizes so almost all of their options are somewhere between 12-16".

Okay, so I spent a month traveling around Italy this summer (where I got married.  Thanks for the congrats.) and ate about 25 pizzas there.  Tony's original margarita pizza is, hands down, the most authentic pizza on this side of the boot that you could ever hope to find.   Mind you, this is pretty damn different from Little Star (I still love you to death Little Star) because it's thin. And light. And Fresh.  And, no offense Little Star, but it doesn't give me those crazy night sweats that your pizza often does.  Not that this stops me or anything. Tony, I don't know exactly how much cocaine you put in your pizza dough, but it's enough to make me go back and pay the $18 for a pizza for two people.  It's still not as expensive as coke, so I guess it's a bargain in the end. Yum.

We came in here after a late movie, delighted to find that they were still open.  At around 11pm, the place is still pretty packed for a restaurant. We had Little Italy for salad, New Yorker pizza, and tiramisu.  HUGE portions, definitely meant for sharing.  Food was fresh and delicious. The crust was a bit soggy in the middle. Wish the tiramisu is more balanced in terms of the cream and cake ratio. Prices are a bit high tho, about $20 for an essentially medium pizza.

Sat at the bar for lunch last week and had a great meal. The bartender works to keep the bar clean and goes out of his way to make the customer comfortable. The pizza crust has great texture.

Tony's Margherita Pizza is hands down the most amazing pizza I have ever had! It certainly isn't cheap, but boy is it worth every penny! This pizza just melts in your mouth. It's an explosion of flavor that I didn't think was possible to attain with such simple ingredients...Tony really knows what he is doing. Only 73 of these amazing pies are made fresh everyday. So I suggest you go early and snag one before they are gone. This place is quickly becoming one of my favorites in the city and I think word is catching on quick becasue there is always a wait every time I go now. The bar is always a great option for a smaller group of two. The service is always friendly and everything on the menu is delicious. I love Tony's!!!!

I noticed this place was opening several weeks back and took some friends to dinner here. One thing that was notable is that they have a champion pizza dough twirler working here - we had a conversation with him about it while waiting for our slices. The slices were great examples of pizza cooked in a really hot oven (my first job was at a pizza place). the thing that really caught my eye was the "Italian beef sandwiches" on the awning. i went back today and got a totally traditional italian beef sandwich. I've never had a chicago style beef sandwich, but if this is what they are like then I must fly to Chicago immediately and try an authentic one. This sandwich was one of the best all meat sandwiches I've ever eaten. It made me resolve to try every sandwich on their menu. I'm hooked, and it will probably take me several months to work my way through their menu. In the meantime, we can all watch the guy twirling pizza dough.

Had a Sicilian pizza, quite tasty but far from the best and not worth the $$$.  The service, however, was horrendous. Our server could best be described as apathetic. It certainly seemed like once he saw our party of six he chalked up his auto 18% gratuity and rarely glanced our way for the next hour. He came by our table no more than 5 times, including dropping off water, taking our order and dropping the check. Otherwise he was invisible. Anything we needed we had to ask a busser or other passing server because he was never anywhere to be found. The owner of the restaurant came by when we asked the hostess if she could find our server because we needed to pay and hadn't seen him in 30 minutes. Instead of apologetic she was rude and condescending. All in all very frustrating and disappointing experience.

This is the best pizza I've had in San Francisco.  Little Star comes close but this was fantastic.  I think maybe they make the crust with holy water, although I don't know what that tastes like.  Could be corn meal in there too.  But it's great. I was so pleased to find three leftover pieces of this in my refrigerator the next day.  It was just as good then, when I was actually sober.

Tony's has ousted Arinell as the best NY Style slice in the city.  They've got plain, pepperoni and a specialty slices availble.  Large selection of sandwiches, stromboli and calzones. 4 Stars because it's a bit pricier than a slice should be.  Specialty slice and a drink was close to $8.  Slices in NYC are only $2.25  That being said, I still go on a regular basis.

First of all, who are these morons who get really hammered, go to a restaurant then still feel it necessary to post a review on Yelp?  "I know I was really drunk when I ate there, but I just wasn't that impressed".   Here's a clue hammerhead:  don't post a review. I don't read the long reviews, so here it is.  Tony's is the best pizza in SF.   In ANY category (deep dish, thin crust, Sicilian, etc.).   Very authentic and fresh.  The meatballs are also slamming.   Bit of a wait, so go early (before 6).

In the true spirit of North Beach, Tony's promotes conspicuous consumption of Italian food with a small side of debauchery.  The pizza is weird, but that doesn't mean bad--and it seems to cure both hangovers and late night munchies with equal effectiveness.  Get the pizza with the carmelized stuff (I think there are pears and bacon involved as well)--it will rock your world.  Of course, their margherita isn't half bad either, just be prepared for something that is not your typical margherita pizza.   If you go anywhere near dinner time (this includes up to about 11 pm in North Beach) be prepared to wait.  For a while.  If there are just two of you, say you're cool with eating at the bar, and then go stake out a couple of people who like they're getting ready to leave.  You'll get food a whole lot quicker, and you get to chat with the awesome bartender (who makes a fabulous spicy bloody, if you like that kind of thing). Damn--I'm nowhere near Tony's at the moment and writing this is making me hungry.

This isn't going to be a review of the entire restaurant experience, but rather a slice of what the establishment has to offer. I've been on a 3 year search for quality Napoletana pizza in the SF Bay, and have fallen short on my search until finding Tony's. Popping into the place on a Saturday mid-afternoon, we saddled up to the bar and chatted up with the bartender. After a quick glance at the menu, we found out we were lucky that Tony still had a few of his 73 special Margherita pizza pies to order. Seeing's that the Margherita is my favorite (and litmus test) of Napoletana pizza's, we ordered one right up. "Not so fast!" says the bartender, "You guys gotta try some of Tony's grandma's meatballs." Turns out that Tony's grandma still makes meatballs by hand in the morning (don't know when and how frequent), but when she does, they are some of the best meatballs that you'll ever have. After expressing a bit of skepticism and polite, "Sure, sure... I'm sure they're great," to the bartender, he promptly assures that if we don't like them, he'll comp the dish. Long story short--those were the best meatballs we've ever had. Not huge, but man... that serving... that sauce... was a meal of perfection in and of itself... couple that with a nice glass of red wine and one of Tony's 73 daily Margherita's--OMG that Margherita*--sums up to a perfect mid-afternoon supper in the middle of North Beach. * That Margherita pizza was absolutely fantastic--perfect chew in the crust... ridiculously thin... and just the right amount of char both on the outer crust AND on the bottom of the pie! *drool* ...I WANT ONE NOW!! PS: On a later date, I took some of my work team to Tony's in the late night. They were out of the magic 73, but had their regular Margherita. It was good, but not fantastic. There's something about using all those top ingredients in the magic 73 that sends it into spectacular category. If you're in it for the pie... go early and get one of the 73!!

I moved out of North Beach for the summer and returned to great news: Tony's, my favorite pizza joint, opened a to-go slices and sandwiches spot...the dream comes true.   Okay, the cheese and pepperoni slices are delicious and on par price-wise with all the other by-the-slice places round da hood.  They also feature 1 "specialty" slice per night for 5 bucks, a bit steep.  But, sometimes they slice them huuuuge so its all good.   The best is yet to come:  the sandwiches.  Tony's killer meatballs on a sub, the delicious chicken parm, and the ridiiiculous "chicago style" beef sandwiches are soo good I hardly ever get the pizza.  Except for the sausage and ricotta specialty slice, that one I can't pass up.  Alot of the sandwiches, and the calzones (7 bucks) are brushed with garlic oil, which is great if you like it, but its strong so be careful. Also, when you ask for a cup of water, they give you a good sized cup, not a dixie cup! Hard to get a seat, but we Tony-goers are used to that.

This place is over-rated. The staff (specifically the hostess) are rude and think they are much better than you. In other words just because I am not an old couple doesn't mean that you don't have to pay as much attention to you. I do (and would have) tipped much higher if I got better service. The award winning pizza is good don't get me wrong, just not worth 18 dollars. You are still hungry afterwards. I think I will just walk down the street for a better experience.

Thin crust pizza, meatballs at the bar with cherry Manhattans by Stephany, Matthew, or the local eye candy sweetheart JP, and this place is the best pizza house in San Francisco.  Hard to find a spot at the bar, as the word is out. My favorite in San Francisco due to ambience. Oddly, the bar area is classier than any in the area, including the 'fancy' restaurants nearby.  But that is because of those behind the bar. Couldn't be happier except for the crowding.

I feel like maybe we got a bad pizza when we came here.  I was expecting so much more after I'd read reviews.  Service was friendly and timely.  Our margherita pizza also came out very quickly.  After pulling out the first piece I noticed the middle was very soggy.  The flavor was good, but nothing extraordinary. Our pizza had a few slivers of basil, I felt like it could have used more.  Sogginess wrecked our pizza experience, we will not be back.

Parking is seriously ridiculous around here, but the pizza is totally worth it! Known for its gold medal pizzas Tony's is a place everyone can enjoy. Not being much of a pizza person I was totally excited about the 12' pies and ate 3 whole pieces! Tony's offers several types of pizza (there's also pasta and other italian cuisine): Neapolitan, Roman, Sicilian, New York, Chicago and Californian style but if I were to have any input I would suggest the Italian styled ones because there ingredients are directly imported from Italy! This may be the closest to having Italian right here at home. What's also great about the pizzas is they're not over priced for a 12" they average $18! My friends and I ordered the Margherita pizza, probably one of their most popular because it's a gold medal winner and is special because only 73 pizza of its kind are made per day!  I also highly recommend the Cal Italia which is Sicilian style and is topped with cheese, prosciutto, and fig preserve which add sweetness. The crusts were different between pizzas, the margherita was fluffier while the Sicilian style was more thin crust. There's just enough crust for the pizza but if you have extra crust you can dip it into the complimentary olive oils that came with the foccica at the beginning of our meal. On special occasions you can have pizza with a side of pizza acrobatics courtesy of Tony himself. He is a champion pizza tosser and will toss some dough for you when he's in the mood. Unfortunately, we got no show during our visit despite seeing Tony wandering around the restaurant. Since this place is new I think lots of people are curious to try it out and we had to wait 30mins to be seated. It wasn't so bad though, they have a full bar in the entry so you can sip on some drinks while waiting, and if there are a lot of people standing around they'll bring out some complimentary treats to snack on courtesy of the chef. I would definitely recommend this place, but unless you're willing to fork out $10 for 2hrs of parking, or to spend 30mins searching for a parking spot I recommend the bus or some sort of public transportation.

This place is SO COOL.   I like the layout - it's casual yet clean and well thought out.  Being seated at the bar for dinner was a different experience, but in a good way.  There was just enough room for the dishes and the bartender/server was very pleasant.  The large bell and baton hanging from the glass behind the bar was also a nice touch - things like these make restaurants so much more interesting. The Margherita pizza was simple and light, but also flavored just PERFECTLY enough.  The NY Sausage & Pepper was a bit more overpowering and salty, but also good.  Both were delicious, in very different ways.  I love this place, and can't wait to go back to try more!

It's so nice to find a great pizza place in North Beach where tourist traps abound. I'm drawn to the hustle and bustle of the neighborhood, but more often than not, am disappointed by the lackluster tourist-ridden choices. Stepping into Tony's felt like old North Beach with a modern twist. We opted to sit at the bar and ended up dining there as well largely due to our fabulous bartender. The cocktail menu has been given special attention and it shows. The classic negroni and blood and sand were both delectable and we thoroughly enjoyed talking vermouth and spirits with our bartender. We felt inclined to order the award winning margherita pizza, but because only 73 made daily, of course they were out. Why only 73? Is it to create buzz? If that's the case, then I'm annoyed. Our bartender assured us that the other margherita pizza made with a different kind flour in the dough was equally tasty. He was right, the crust was perfect, the fresh mozzarella was a nice contrast with the acid of the tomatoes. The deep fried string beans didn't compare to Coco 500's version, but were still tasty, nonetheless. The menu has an extensive amount of pizzas to choose from; Sicilian, American, Romana, Napoletana - take your pick. I want to go back to Tony's and try the award winning margherita along with the "regular" margherita and conduct a side by side tasting to see if my novice pizza palate can detect any difference. Stay tuned!

Reviewer 200. Yay! Wandered into Tony's after a couple mile hike through the City. We've been living in the Bay Area for 20 years now, but it never ceases to amaze and amuse us to be tourists, regularly. Get off at Powell Street BART, traipse through Union Square, up Powell, over Nob Hil...zig zag down through Chinatown...eat here? There? Finally...Tony's. Pizza the way you love it - flavorful, thin, chewy-crisp. Cal Italia to die for. A hair bit too dry on the Cesar salad. PERFECT on the Blue Moon and the muddlied drink. Thanks to the bartender and wait staff for a great little find.

One of the best pizzas I've had in the city. The Cal Italia (Croatian Fig, Proscuitto, Mozzarella, Parmesean, drizzled with Balsamic Vinegar) was amazing. Crust was thin and crispy. Definitely one of the best pizzas i've ever had, especially here in SF! The wait was very long though. More than an hour on a Wednesday evening; I came at 6.45p to put my name down, walked home to wait for my friends and then walked back at 7.45p to be seated. If you live in the neighborhood, might just be smarter to order take-out. My friend's NY Pizza (Sausage, Pepperoni and Mozzarella) was pretty good as well. Service was generally great, except that the server seemed Very overwhelmed and over-extended. She asked us the same questions 2-3x and would walk off w/o getting our answers (which is prob why she asked us the same questions 2-3x. Hmmm). Other than that, service was fairly good for a Very busy restaurant. Will definitely be back, but probably for take-out

My italian co-worker invited us to go to this place for dinner to celebrate her birthday.  She's a big fan of pizza and heard good reviews about this place. First, it's hard to find parking around the area.  But if you're a local you should know that ...knowing the place is a tourist area. The host was really nice and even offered to call me since it will be a 40-min wait.  We ended up sitting at the bar for shots while we're waiting for our table. We ordered the marghareta pizza and the SF sicilian pizza with the walnut/balsamic salad and wine.  The salad itself was really good.  The pizzas were good as well.  I love the foccacia, arugula and prosciutto combination in the sicilian pizza. The customer service was good. I'm not too familiar with pizza but I appreciate a good pizza.  This place pizzas were definitely good. I was happy after leaving this place.  If I'm around the area (not driving) I may come back here and try their other dishes with my hubby.

to me it's still a 5 star, but that's because I only order their 900 degree wood fired margherita pizza (which won the 2007 world pizza cup in naples).   Don't get their garlic bread it's not good- they give you bread in the beginning and comes with garlic with oil, yum.  Prosciutto e Pomodorini pizza wasn't enjoyable for me, and their salads were good but a bit I didn't get much walnuts nor cheese (had to dig around for it).   Must get their ginger cocktail!  It was sweet, but refreshing and so tasty! The perfect girly drink in my book.

4.5 stars (has to deduct 1 for the lack of crispy crust) 1 hour 40 min wait for a table on a Sat night= take out! Margherita (award winner) dough was sold out so we got the 4 cheese. Cheese=A++ Sauce=A+ Dough=C Maybe the dough wasn't cooked long enough, but i like mine thin and crispy- NY style and the crust was def. lacking, not crispy, it was quiet unfortunate, although there are no words for how frekin DELICIOUS the CHEESE was- you could tell they really put 4 different cheeses in it and it was sooo flavorful, not bland like plan mozzerella..AND they put a tremendous amount of cheese- it was falling off the pizza when i picked up a slice. Bottom line: I'll be back, probably earlier in the day so i can try the dough on their famous margherita. Take out, the ambiance is not worth the wait. The pie is small- think 2 people and you may want an appetizer.

We went to Tony's for our latest Thursday Dinner Club and we all really enjoyed our meals.  We had a large group of around 10 and since Tony's doesn't take reservations it made it a little difficult to get seated.  We had to wait but the wait wasn't too long.  In the end we ended up sitting at two separate booths which was fine for us.   I recognized our server from another restaurant and he was good thee and very good and friendly again.  At our table to we ordered three different pizzas including the famed margarita pizza and everything was very good.  I really enjoyed the sausage pizza and would definitely come here again and probably get there a little bit earlier to get seated faster.

I'm going to give it 4 stars, slightly begrudgingly..Because although I had a great experience here and would absolutely come back, I don't know if it lived up to all the hype I read on the menu and such.   The margherita pizza was delightful.  Very flavorful, great paper thin crust.. But, and I'm sorry Tony, but the one at Pizzeria Delfina is better.  If I'm in North Beach / this side of SF I will come here, but if I'm going into the city just for a pizza like that, I'm going to Delfina. The rigatoni with bolognese was kind of lacking, especially for $15.  The bolognese sauce wasn't incredible like I had hoped. Meatball appetizer was very very good..but again, Delfina was better. Nice service, great bread with oil/garlic/sweet red peppers plate to accompany it, and great location and enjoyed the outdoor seating. So, 4 stars because while it was awesome, and while I will most likely come back (especially since I'm in the area a lot, and I think this is probably one of the better places in North Beach), it was not the best in SF.

Great Margherita pizza as noted.  Also want to add that the french fries with truffle oil were excellent.  Hot and crispy to the touch and taste; however, you could smell the truffle oil more than actual taste.  House foccacia bread with three different dipping oils, and a great libation selection. Nice change from North Beach Pizza or Round Table. Service was o.k.

I've been coming to Tony's for the last 2 years since they opened.  Their pizza is one of the best in SF.  I give it 4 stars for food, 1 star for service.   HOWEVER, my last 2 experiences will prevent me from going back.  Several months ago, I went to Tony's with 2 friends and after almost 2 hours of waiting we got our table.  I didn't mind the wait, because the pizza is so good.  What I did mind was the cockroach crawling on the wall by my friend's head.  The waiter tried to grab the roach with a cloth, but it ended up falling on my friend's lap in the booth, and we never found it again.  I understand that many restaurants in the city have roaches.  What bothered me was that we still got a full bill for our food despite not being able to eat half of it since we still could not find the missing roach.   I decided to give Tony's another chance this last Saturday, hoping that the service was just a result of an off night.  I was wrong.  I ordered a pizza off their menu and requested no meat since my dining partner keeps kosher and does not eat pork.  They brought the pizza with meat and I politely let them know that we had asked no meat.  The pizza chef (it wasn't Tony) behind the bar gave a pissed look, took the meat off the pizza and sent the same pizza back to our table....  THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE.  I told the waiter this and he was apologetic, but that was it.  For such a mistake, I usually expect the manager to apologize or for them to comp a dessert or something...., but nothing.  So, I'm sad to say, I'll have to find my pizza fix elsewhere.

I am really sad to write such a low review about our favorite pizzeria in San Francisco. If you want to have a dinner at Tony's and enjoy a nice dinner out with friends, go somewhere else! The staff wants you in and out as fast as possible. So best to get a take-out and enjoy a nice evening with friends in your own home. Still love the pizza, however we are starting to eat at other places, like Lonely Star and Zero Zero.

We came through on a Sunday afternoon- off-season as far as tourists- and were seated immediately. But I will say that within 30 mins., the place was packed. So, there! I've let you in on the secret time to get into this terrific little pizza place: 4-4:30PM We ordered their "special", the pizza that won Tony the award at the festival in Naples a few years ago. He was the first American to ever win it. It seems that ricotta cheese has replaced the traditional mozzarella on the top. I wouldn't have thought of it, but it was good. Oh, Tony's parents happened to be seated at the table next to us and Tony came out from behind the counter to chat them up. My husband and I each had our own antipasti. He hates anchovies and I love them. I ordered the lovely "white anchovies" on a bed of greens. They melted in my mouth. None of that feathery stuff I'm accustomed to eating on other anchovies. My husband had a charcuterie plate- a selection of sliced Italian meats and cheeses. He was quite happy with that. Per a Yelp suggestion, we ordered margaritas, and found them especially tasty. Way to go, Fellow Yelper! All in all, a wonderful meal.

Came here for date night with the boyfriend and I really had high hopes for this place since Tony was on food network's pizza challenge.  We came in around 6pm for dinner after work and got seated at the bar almost immediately.   The bar tender was pretty nice, but seems like one of those real old school bar tenders - mixes his drink then tries it then adds stuff then tries it again etc.  He tried the drink he was mixing like 10 times, no joke.  Once he was done, he came to serve us and he made me this drink that was sweet and tasted like one of those drinks from China town where you have to push the marble in to open it.  Yeah, I wanted something with alcohol in it not something that tasted like soda with a pinch of alcohol.  Boo on that. The food was decent.  We ordered the meatballs, the Margherita pizza (only 73 made a day), and the Cal Italia pizza.  The meatballs were disappointing, didn't come out hot, wasn't super juicy, nothing that you could brag about to anyone.  The margherita pizza was pretty good, super super thin, wish it had more basil and tomatoes on there.  Definitely should eat the whole thing there and quickly too because when it gets cold, it does taste a bit soggy.  The Cal Italia - don't know how this won the gold medal at the food network challenge.  I like sweet and savory, but this fig jam on the pizza was a bit too overwhelming.  I only tasted sweet pizza and not much savoriness.  If I go here again, I wouldn't get the drink, I wouldn't get the meat balls and I wouldn't get the Cal Italia pizza for sure.  Only the margherita pizza wins my heart.  This one did get a medal and it was well deserved.   I still love Little Star Pizza.  So far no pizza joint in the city has beaten out Little Star for a place in my heart.  Little Star FOREVER!!!

PROS: The pasta is ok, the pizza is excellent. CONS:  I dropped my wife off to park the car and they wouldn't let her put our name on the list for a table for 2. "Everyone must be present." That's just TERRIBLE.  What if she asked for a table for 1? You'd still have to give her A table that seats two.  As a former restaraunt owner, believe me, I get that "everyone must be present" concept when you're slammed and you're talking about a table for 4 or 6 etc. but come one, a table for two? Get your heads out of your ass.   -Overpriced too.

my boyfriend and i stumbled upon this place in northbeach one weekend after trying to get a table at DON PISTO'S up the street. we were so hungry that we didnt care about what we ended up eating! we just knew that we're not going to wait an hour an half for DON PISTO'S! normally.. we would but that day... nope. the rumblies in our tummies wouldnt stand for it! so we luckily found this place and were swiftly seated by the bar. our server was nice enough to explain all the different types of pizza they have as well as the different crusts/thicknesses. we finally settled for calamari for starters and the PANCETTA PORCINI from the CLASSIC ITALIAN portion of the menu. the calamari and complimentary bread came out first and they also delivered a dish of different sauces/oils for the bread. the sauces and the oils were so good that i even used it for the calamari! haha. our pizza came out shortly after we devoured our calamari and bread. it was topped with pancetta, wild mushrooms, porcini, thyme and smoked scamorza with truffle oil drizzled over the top. the scent of it was so intoxicating that we quickly dug in. first bite and every bit after that...."mmm.. delicious" it was one of the best thin crust pizzas that i've ever had, next to the ones from zero zero of course! when i got to my third slice.. the truffle oil was getting to be a little much (OILY) but when i tried to blot it off the top.... it just didnt taste the same. =[ but besides that.. everything was great! even the service!! if you're ever in the city, esp in the north beach area.... please stop by! i promise you wont regret it!

OMG! I am embarrassed that I have no other way to describe my delight with this place other than sounding like a 15 year old school girl.  But there is no other way.   The margherita pizza was excellent.  It apparently has won award after award but my favorites were the following: Cholula Pizza: Mozzarella, Marinated Chicken Breast in Cholula Hot Sauce, Sliced Jalapeños, Garlic, Red Onion, Chorizo Cal Italia Pizza: Asiago, Mozzarella, Imported Italian Gorgonzola, Sweet Fig preserve from Croatia, Prosciutto di Parma, Parmigiano, Balsamic These two pizzas are by far the most creative, well done, tasty little suckers in town.  I do think that no matter what you order it will be incredible, but one thing is for sure, get there early.  The wait was 2 hours for just a party of three...you can see how popular it is.

I've been here only twice, and I was impressed. Delicious real pizza, not that Pizza Hut cardboard. I don't mind spending more $ on good food. You get what you pay for so if you're complaining about price, go to Little Caesars. Everything is delicious here. I've tried the Calamari fritti, the Cal Italia, the Little Italy salad, and the seafood linguine All were delicious. Definitely will come back again and again. oh yeah, I broke being vegetarian for 2 months for this food. so worth it.

This place is so good and I'm mad that I have lived in San Francisco for 5 years and in the bay area my entire life and I just tried Tony's for the first time last month! I've been missing out on some of the best pizza around! The variety of their menu makes it hard to choose what to order because it all sounds good, but it doesn't really matter what you order because you will be happy with it. The wait is nuts. I've been told 2 hours before! The good thing is that they always over estimate so you're happy when you get a table sooner. You can give them your cell phone number and go to a nearby bar until your table is ready. They also have a full bar there so you can order drinks while you wait. Lastly, if you manage to grab open seats at the bar and you don't mind eating there, you're in luck.  You can order food from the full menu and it's open seating. P.S. Their Italian nachos are actually delicious.

So for my monthly guys night out, I snagged a rezzie over at Tony's.  They don't normally take reservations, but I wrote a nice email to the owner and he graciously provided some industry courtesy.   That aside, we arrived at 8 and the place was spilling out the door.  Grabbed a beer at the bar and we were seated in 10 minutes.  Our server was excellent.  She was truly the real deal.  Knowledgeable about the food, the big beer list, and the perfect combination of casual-professionalism that fits this place.   Since it was our first time, we ordered the Napoleatano and the fig/proscuitto/gorg Italian style crust.  They were both really great.  I prefer the slightly thicker crispier/chewier crust on the Ital style pie, but that was just personal pref, as our group was split right down the middle.  We had a great salad (big and sharable) and the meatballs to start.   I heard mixed reviews about the place, but I've got to say that Tony's is a perfect addition to the generally poor quality choices in the neighborhood.  Tony was even on the floor saying hi to guests in a truly sincere and inobtrusive fashion.   While the prices aren't cheap, the 4 of us got out the door for like $20/pp which was a steal for the overall experience.  Go check out Tony's.  It's a great addition to our city.

I've found my new hang out bar!  The drinks are awesome!!!!  I did try the fried green beans.   Not what I expected.  I thought they would be crunchy stick like, but they were more like pan fried :(  Had the lasagna and the Sicilian pizza.  Both were excellent!  Yes the pizza crust does get a bit soft, but the ingredients are very fresh - ie moisture...  If you want a thin crunchy crust pizza, go to BJ's  Brewery and order their appetizer pizza.  You won't be disappointed.   The bartenders are very friendly and will make up drinks for you to try.  Tony has been really nice every time I've gone there.

Great pizza. This is coming from a lady who doesn't like pizza....not even at 4 am. The Margherita pizza is ammmazing!! I could have eaten the entire thing. I have also had two of their salads and just had everything family style, which in my mind is always the way to go. I have been here twice now and sat outside each time. The ambiance is nice, with a pretty view of the park.

I went with a big group of friends (about 7) to celebrate our recent engagement.  Tony's has an awesome round table booth inside the restaurant that is so great for big groups.  But of course they don't take reservations so it's almost impossible to plan a big group meal there.  Ughh! So we sat outside but it was so cold we asked our waitress if we could just have some drinks and move inside once the big table was available.  They were really accommodating and great about letting us switch over.  But i still cannot stand the fact that places do not allow reservations!!!!! It is such an unbelievable pet peeve of mine and I just don't think I have it in me anymore to put up with interminable wait times.  For context, it was a Wednesday night. Alas, going to Tony's with a big group does have an upside b/c you can try all different kinds of pizza.  All were fantastic, most notable was the cal italia.  We also started with mushroom crostinis which were fine but I prob wouldn't get it again.  All  in all I was pleased with the food and service, but the lack of a reservation system is so damn frustrating I can't give more than 3 stars.

Their pizza is almost as smokin' as the waiter at the bar. A pleasant mix of tourists and locals, I relate it to a Cheers type of place...for all the regulars....everybody knows your name! Me and the roomie just moved to North Beach, and wanted to try some bomb pizza, so on a recommendation, we went to Tony's. On a Friday night. At 6:30pm. Wrong move.  Wait is about an hour, but we score 2 barstools and order our pizza. It was worth it. We ate the entire thing between the 2 of us.  Will definitely be back, just not on a Friday night :)

I've only tried their STG Pizza Napoletana Wood Fired Margherita pizza which they only make 73 per day.  2007 World Pizza Cup Winner Naples, Italy. It was good but I'm surprised this won an award.  I think delfina's is better.  This pizza has a thicker crust than Delfina.  It's small too.  I think the price is too expensive for what you get but I would come here again if I was in the neighborhood and craving pizza.  I just wouldn't go out of my way to come back.

I was excited to finally try their pizza. The wait was only twenty minutes on a saturday afternoon. We were able to sit outside so we could feel like we were on the streets of Italy hahaha. Started off with the famous margherita pizza, it was so simple but so delicious, I love how light the sauce was . We then planned on ordering the New Yorker and The Clam and Garlic ,but was told they were out of the Clam pizza. BooHoo. So we decided to give their meatballs a try . First let me say I thought I would leave here craving the pizza everyday but one bite of a meatball and I forgot I was here for pizza, I was that amazing. I wont forget to mention how great the New Yorker was , the ricotta cheese made it so unique. I cant wait to go back for more meatballs and hope to get to try the Clam and Garlic pizza.Oh and I forgot to mention the service was incredible.

I've decided -- you can't beat this place. I again had the sandwich, but also ordered the calzone. The sandwich again was amazing. The Calzone was awesome too.  The seasoned dough is just right - really good. I'll eventually eat a slice at the table, right out of the oven. Reasonable prices considering the hight quality and location.

After reading about this place on Yelp, my expectations were way high.  This Tony Gemignani guy sounded almost like a North American Pizza god - 9 time Champion Pizza Tosser and the winner of the 2007 World Pizza Cup in Naples, pizza nirvana of the world, no less.  Wow, this just sounded  too good to be true, and he's serving his award winning pizzas right here in SF?  I thought this is going to be an experience of a lifetime! We made our way over to North Beach that same day after our discovery of Tony's Pizza Napoletana.  Unfortunately, it was a Friday evening.  Parking in itself took 30 minutes and the wait was estimated to be 1 hour.  While waiting, the hostess offered salami and Parmesan to the patient and starving patrons, which was a very nice touch. About 25 minutes into the wait, a couple of bar seats opened up.  We decided to take the open seats and dine at the bar instead of continuing to wait.  Good thing we did, as some of the people in front of us were still waiting after we finished eating our pizza. We opted for the Margherita pizza since this was the pizza he made when he won the world cup.  Supposedly, he has recreated the pizza at his restaurant using the exact same ingredients and methods, including heating up the oven to a toasty 900 degrees. The first bite of the pizza was a bit of a surprise, it wasn't as crunchy as I was expecting.  The pizza was all about the great texture, it was neither crunchy nor soggy.  It was elastic and chewey.  The topping was simple as expected for Margherita - basil, mozzarella cheese, seal salt and tomato sauce.  There is also more sea salt on the pizza than expected. We also ordered a calmari appetizer, fried perfectly in very clean oil accompanied with a horse radish mayo cocktail sauce, which was fantastic.  The salad (Little Italy) was also nice with a balsamic vinaigrette, pecans & Gorgonzola cheese. All in all, I thought the pizza was really good.  But it's not "the best pizza I've ever had" experience I was hoping to have.  I would have preferred more crunch to the pizza.  From what I understand, some of the other pizza styles offered on the menu (there are 4 styles offered), such as the Classic Italian and the American pizzas, have more of a crunch.   Given that the pizza was pretty good here, I will go back to try the other styles (with meat next time and not on a Friday evening) to determine my favorite pizza and my final verdict on this place.

We were hungry and in North Beach, I had heard great things about Tony's, but also knew that they did not take reservations. We arrived around 7:30 and were told that the wait would be over an hour! What the hostess did not tell me was that we could sit at the bar, which is first come, first serve. We made eye contact with the bartender and he told us that 2 people were almost done; we only had to wait about 5 minutes. We were first brought some bread with a plate of pesto sauce, olive oil & garlic olive oil. The pesto sauce was awesome. As we were looking at the menu a server came to the bar and said that they only had two margharita pizzas left! (they only make 73 every day, it was a lucky number for Tony, the guy that started the place, so they only make enough dough for 73 pizzas each day) The bartender quickly put in my order for the margharita pizza...I got the second to last one! The menu consists of 4 different types of pizza...Sicilian, American, Wood Fired & 1 other. They have four different ovens at Tony's. The most famous pizza is the wood fired margharita, which is what I ordered. It was awesome! I loved the crust, very soft and fluffy. The tomato sauce was delicious, the only problem was that it was a tiny bit watery, so the cheese slipped off, but I still loved it. The pizza was definitely up there with my favorite pizzas, I already want to go back. The bartender was super nice and fun to talk to. The Bloody Bull (their version of a bloody mary) was delicious. It is made with a special tomato juice that they make there at the restaurant and has a rim of this awesome spice mixture that they also make there. I do not usually like bloody mary's, but I absolutely loved this one! I am definitely going back to Tony's, soon!

Coworker and I decided to give this place a try for lunch today, we hiked down from Russian Hill.  The Host was not all that welcoming but he sat us right away, the decor is nice but there is something about the place that feels unfinished.   Listen UP PEOPLE!, Our waitress explained to us what "STG" was, a type of standard for Napoletan pizzas. I think the pizza was dead on, (Texture of dough needs to be soft, slightly elastic, easily bendable and not dry) so all the people that complain the crust is not crunchy and mark the place down need to research what the are buying, because what they are getting is exactly what they are ordering. We also had the green beans and Italian fries with Gorgonzola, everything was delicious. Minus one star because we where seated at the last booth next to the restrooms. The way that booth is configured next to the restroom is simply not the best. we where glad no one used the WC while we ate, the proximity to the strike side of the door from the seat on the booth is like 18 inches... too close!!!! Ill come back thats for sure.

Just by looking at this place, you wouldn't think that they would have such excellent pizza.  It looks a little too clean and contemporary American.  Actually, I don't know if the pizza is authentic Italian or not, seeing as how I've yet to go to Italy- but I will say this: I'm lactose intolerant and I still scarfed down the Cal Italia Pizza!  Totally worth it.  The sweetness of the fig contrast perfectly with the salty proscuitto and the hint of gorgonzola added a little sumthin' sumthin' .  Drooool.   I'm so glad my friend lives right down the block from this place.  Now we can go ALL the time when I visit.

This place can be summed up in one word.....YUM-TACULAR!!!! It's a word, trust me! Me and two grown boys ordered two pizzas, a salad, 3 meatballs, and devoured the complimentary bread and garlic oil. We pretty much rolled out of the restaurant. We ordered Tony's world famous Margherita pizza. O...M...G! Amazing! A Cal Italia pizza which was the Gold Medal Winner in Food Networks Pizza Champions Challenge. It's now a winner in my book! Three Italian Style Meatballs, which literally melted in our mouths! And, so we could pretend like we were eating a healthy meal we ordered a Pancetta con Rucola salad. Pork belly and mozzarella salad is healthy right? Yea, that's what I thought! Yea, so I think I'm going to ask this Tony fellow if I can move in to his restaurant.

To truly appreciate Tony's Margherita, you've got to be the kind of person who tastes the difference in flour when you eat your pizza. You have to be a pizza dough maven, critically evaluating the chewiness and elasticity of the crust. You've got to know immediately by looking at the color of the rendered oil from the mozzarella that they're using a high-quality fresh mozz. And you've got to be the kind of person who recognizes the acidity of San Marzano tomatoes, which are only rivaled by our local dry-farmed tomatoes from Santa Cruz. If you're up for that, then Tony's Margherita is a religious experience. If not, you're gonna feel ripped off. That's OK -- they have other products for you -- but it's worth remembering when you decide what to write in your review. Me, I'm busy looking for where I can find some San Felice flour to use at home, and wondering whether or not I can get the same results with some of the local fresh-milled stuff they sell at the Ferry Plaza sometimes. Which is to say that I was more than satisfied.

Checked this place out based on all of the positive reviews and definitely wasn't disappointed. Showed up around 2pm on Saturday, which seemed to be a good time to go since there was absolutely no wait. Service was good and the experience was made better by the fact that we were seated near their wood burning oven. Skipped their renowned Margherita for the Sicilian with peperoni, chopped garlic and Italian sausage. Probably one of the best decisions I've ever made, right next to skipping the perm trend in the 90s. It's probably the only time I'll ever spend $26 on a pizza, but it was worth it. Plus, I'll take any excuse I can to go to North Beach.

I have not ate a more finer and tasteful pizza than at Tony's Pizza Napoletana. I was fortunate to be able to get in line on a Saturday for lunch and was seated immediately when they opened. We tried these dishes: Mussels w/ Chorizo sauce (8.0) Cooked well and not overdone. Very good sauce with good heat from the Chorizo. But it was a bit too rich with the cream.. Meatballs: (10 !) Very tender with good meat flavor. The marinara was very simple and not overly spiced or garlicky. Martguerita Pizza (10): As with other Yelpers saying, it was sublime and refined. If your tastes are tuned to American style pizza that is heavily sauced, cheesed, and an avalanche of meat, this is not your choice. It is MY choice if you want to taste the great crust, creamy mozzarella, sweet tomatoes, and the sharp, fresh basil. New Yorker (10): A totally opposite from the Martguerita, but great because it's sauce and meats. The crust is very similar but not as "nutty". Tony's Napoletana is a great place for premium pies, but it is higher in price. I am willing to pay that and will be coming back for more.

Pizza is one of those dishes that is everywhere, everyone craves it and everyone has their own opinion on it.   So Tony you are da guy.  Da guy that does pizza and only pizza. The Margarita was excellent. The dough is airy and very light. (caveat, if you take it to go the crust may get too soggy by the time you get home so eat it there!)  And the meatballs must of came from bulls b/c they were huge!  Next time I will spluge and try the truffle pizza.

After all the positive reviews I was really excited to go here. I went on a Sat. night at about 8:30pm with 3 other people. The wait was an hour but they take your cell phone number and call you when it is your turn. I knew there would be a wait so the wait didn't bother me. We just went and got drinks while we waited. The service was excellent. The pizza was good but I didn't think it was great.  We got a Burratina di Margherita which was good. I was not a fan of the crust, it was much harder then I am use to. We also got a Prosciutto e Pomodorini which was very good. The ingredient were very fresh but just not what I was expecting.

Let me preface this by saying I just returned from Naples and ate pizza 2x per day while there.  No, I'm not fat.  For those Yelpers that are complaining about the soggy crust....that's what makes pizza from Naples different from pizza in Rome or NY or wherever...the outer crust is crisp and bubbly and the middle of the pie is super thin and floppy and delicious.  Tony has got the crust from Naples DOWN, which is why he has won awards and can open his own restaurants! The Margherita was really good.  The second pizza was pretty good but not great.  The Cesar salad was a mayo fest from hell- and was called "traditional" Cesar yet had cherry tomatoes.  They've got so much pizza competition going on in SF right now that I just can't give this place 5 stars.  The wine by the glass prices are a joke.  $9.50 for a glass of rose? Really? However, after watching the four top of tourists next to us order 4 cokes and one pizza I guess I can see why a guy trying to earn a living in such a high-rent spot is gouging folks for alcohol.  PEOPLE- this is not a "by the slice" sit down restaurant on the corner of Washington Square Park!!  Tony- you need a minimum charge per person or you will be quickly running out of rent money as soon as you land in all of the guide books. Overall, you should go there and order lots of pizzas and just skip mayo salad and the wine until they find some more $6 glasses worth serving. Best of luck to this new hot spot.  I hope it lasts for many decades.

Came here twice already with my boyfriend. Each time, waiting around one hour. The first time, we had the margherita and another pizza that was a special for the night. Both was really good, and yes, my boyfriend and I finished both pizzas in one sitting. I guess that one hour wait made us really hungry. I did notice that the pizza was a bit salty. So second time we went to Tony's, we had the clam pizza and another pizza that was a special for that night (forgot the name). Once again, it was more salty than the FIRST time. It is a great place for pizza in the city, but next time I would probably call for pick up instead of waiting a hour.

I was in town for a couple of days and my cousin wanted to show my boyfriend and I around SF. We got into town pretty late on a Friday evening , but ended up at this cute little joint in North Beach (Little Italy). I wasn't expecting much from this hole in the wall, but from what she told me the pizza champion owner makes some awesome spaghetti and meatballs and award winning pizzas! No joke! The owner Tony Gemignani was very nice and came to greet us at our table. I didn't know this at the time, but I recently saw him on an episode of the Food Network Challenge and he won every round in the challenge. Super cool right!? And what's even cooler is he makes the pizza right infront of you! Anyway, we ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, linguini and clams, and a margherita pizza to share between the 3 of us. Definitely hands down the best spaghetti and meatballs I've ever had in my entire life! I'm usually not a big fan of meatballs, but this one stole my heart or my stomach rather. The pizza is baked in a wood fired oven so it had a nice smokey taste and was fresher than any pizza I've ever tasted. There is a limit of 73 pizzas made per day so make sure you get your hands on one of them cause this place is a must try if you're in San Francisco!

The best Margherita pizza I have ever had, definitely worth a try! The bartender was also super friendly and the sicilian mojito i ordered (he made) was quite yummy (although a little sweet)! I didnt try much else other then the bread/pizza/mojito but those three things i highly recommend.

I'm a stern critic of pizza joints having worked in one myself - had a whip cracked on me by a strong yet fair owner gentleman who knew his way around making sauce and crust. So, that's in my bones. TPN - I would give 3 stars for good taste, etc. 1 extra star for the outstanding service. Hannah - I'm looking at you - thanks for making our dinner awesome. Gotta be honest - worth $70 for dinner for 2? Hmmmmm. Debatable.

The best pizza in SF- wayyy better than Delfina. The margherita pizza won the World Cup Pizza challenge in 2007 (I'm guessing that's pretty big but who knows- they could have made it all up for all I know) and is pretty tasty.  A little on the salty side but no problem if you've got some nice wine or an ice cold beer with ya.  The New York pizza with sausage and pepperoni is a meat-lover must- also very salty given the abundance of cured meat on it, but verrryyy tasty.  The dough is soft, not cardboardy like a lot of places, and keeps well for microwaving for lunch the next day.  Be prepared to wait in line though- this place has crazy lines at peak hours and short waits even during non-peak hours.

To have the pizza to go, and not have to deal with the compulsory wait is a good thing. To top it off, the sandwich's are a great addition, well put together and for the most part seem to be larger than expected (the mozzarella on focaccia is HUGE). Can it be taken out of context if I say that any place with Italian Beef is good in my book? Granted the sandwiches warm my heart a little less than Molinari's, but hey, as I learned as a child different doesn't equal bad. Still, as noted by other posters, the pizza is reheated and we all know reheated pizza is rarely as good as the first go around. Did I mention you can't head in Mondays and Tuesdays? It's just plain wrong...

Tip: Plan to wait 30-60 min for a table as this place is very popular. We ordered the margharita pizza and new yorker pizza, both very delicious. We also got the salad with gorgonzola, apples, walnuts etc...very tasty. The only downfall was that our waitress talked to us like we were 5 years old, not a dealbreaker by any means though. I would definitely go back to this place and recommend it to friends. As long as you go there knowing you are going to wait for a table, then you won't have anything to be dissapointed about.

Here's a pizza joint that can satisfy all the preferences in your party.  From the 4 styles of pizza, I prefer the simple Italian margherita. Better eat it fast or it'll sog.  Eat it too fast and it'll burn you.  There's balance somewhere, but I'm still learning.  It's so good that we usually have to order two.   The spicy meatballs and green beans are also excellent.  But then again, if you choose to stuff yourself on anything but flour and water, that's up to you.

Margherita was over-rated. The Brooklyn was good, though. Didn't think it was that spectacular, but maybe if I lived nearby and this was a convenient local joint for me I would be more excited. But I'm from out of town, so it was just "a-ok."

North Beach has long needed a good pizza joint and there's much to like about Tony's.  One is that it's there. Also included is good service, delicious tomato salad but then the pizza. Our special pizza had loads of flavor (good) but the NY Classic less so. My points-off are mainly for the soggy crust. I like a thin-crust pizza but I'm not sure soggy is acceptable. It's one dinner and perhaps not all pizzas come out soggy; I'll give Tony's another chance but at the price, only one more.

Pizzas are to die for.  Why am I giving them a 3 star - is their level of service.  Went there to celebrate a birthday...service started out pretty good then when it came down for coffee and dessert, the waitress did not know that my brother brought down the cake and when I explained to the waitress that we had a cake...she then went on to say over 3 times - we charge for cake age fee...she said it so loud that two other guests also hear and perhaps the party girl did too.  She said do you want us to cut the cake for you - I said we have candles and would like to sing Happy Birthday at the table.  Now who cuts a birthday cake before we sing Happy Birthday?  When the bill came the waitress said out loud again, because there were 10 of us, they put on a 18% tip on our tab.  Can we not find someone who has to shout it across the table.  She could had whispered it to me when she gave me the bill and I would had shared it quietly with the other guests.  So I just wanted to share - party of 10 - expect an extra 18% for tip and if you bring a cake - they will charge you $2 per person.

We had four incredible pizzas.  The menu is divided by cooking style (wood-fired, coal, gas, etc.) and temperature.  It's ideal to try a variety -- I think any one on its own would have pleased us, but four very different pizzas that were all great in their own way, that was incredible.  I recommend a wood-fired one for the delicious crust and the Fear & Loathing for overall taste.

Overrated. We got the meatball, the margherita, and an Italian tomato-less pizza with ham. Though the meatball itself is good, the sauce it's in is overly sugary. The pies were simply a little plain, with (in my opinion) a too-soggy crust on the neapolitan. You're better off at Delfina's.

OK - I'll go out on a limb here:  this is the very best pizza in North Beach! This pie was a true rustica, just the right thickness and the toppings were fresh and plentiful.  The staff was very friendly and since I ate at the bar, the bartender was everything you'd want in this person.

For now, I'm rating Tony's at 4-Stars, "Yay! I'm a fan."  Next time I go, it could easily move up to 5-Stars.  The reason I'm holding on to that final star is because I want to try a little more of the menu. We had three items today...  the Speck Wrapped Burrata, The Little Italy salad and the Margherita pizza. All were very tasty, but I think the Little Italy was probably actually the best item.  The balsalmic reduction really tasted fantastic with the gorgonzola and the olives.  It's easy to put some gorgonzola and balsalmic vinegar in a salad and have it taste good - but Tony's seems to have found the best pairing of the two.  I suppose you could say that the olives were julienned, and that was another great decision - you don't get super strong salty olive taste, you get just the right amount of olive to go with the rest of the flavors in the salad. The Margherita pizza is a classic and that is the centerpiece of the menu at Tony's, so we had to order that on our first visit.  In general I find Margherita pizzas a little bit unexciting, and that flavors my review a little bit.  The sauce was super, but I really can't wait to get back and try some of the other pizzas.  I think that's when I'm going to really be able to finalize my opinion of Tony's.  It was really good, and I'm going to go again as soon as possible - but is it exceptional?  The kind of place I make sure to bring all of my out-of-town guests?  I'm excited to find out!

This is truly the best pizza I've had since moving to the bay area from NJ 2 years ago. I've tried the other highly rated places (Gialina, Pizzaria Delfina, Giovanni's, Cheeseboard Pizza) and while they're all good in their own ways, Tony takes it one notch higher. His homemade tomato sauce is unreal-- my favorite I've had outside of NYC/North Jersey. All of the ingredients are top quality (and many imported from Italy) and the flavor combinations are very creative. Here's what I had: the Margarita, Cal Italia, the giant pizza Romana, the "New Yorker" (special, not on menu), "Jersey" style Tomato Pie, Sicilian Fratellanza, the Rigatoni, Pasta Carbonara, and the meatballs. Everything was fantastic. I especially liked the Tomato Pie and the meatballs (which I couldnt' stop eating). Plus Tony himself couldn't have been a nicer guy. Try it!

I grew up in California on Dominoes, Round Table, and Pizza Hut. I never had any complaints about this type of pizza, but understandably, as this is all I had ever experienced, I was not really all that in love with pizza. I never understood "pizza snobs" until I moved to Manhattan and experienced my first late night pizza slice. As annoying as I know I sound,  I now see how pizza is supposed to taste. Nothing west of the Mississippi can even come close to that 99cent slice you get on St. Mark's street in the East Village of Manhattan. That said, Tony's has the best pizza I have had in San Francisco so far. True, it costs more than $0.99, but it is really delicious. Apparently, Tony is from New York and knows what he is doing. I tried to get fancy and ordered the Cowgirl Creamery cheese and truffle oil pizza. While it was certainly not bad, go with what works and get the Margherita. You would think that part of the appeal is that they only make a certain number of these pizzas per day (thereby keeping the supply/demand ratio favorable for business), but this gimmick is not what attracted me, as I only found out about it later. It's just damn good pizza. One drawback: Both times I went, the hostess pretty grossly underestimated what the wait time would be. However, she was very apologetic and sweet, and if you can keep your cool and kill time walking around North Beach, it's worth the wait. Also, these times were both right around the restaurant's opening and the staff might have figured out how to gauge the correct amount of wait time by this point. In any case, don't let a 40 minute wait stop you from enjoying this pizza.

Nothing but praise for Tony's While we were too late (6:30!) to get one of the 73 coveted pizza Margheritas made each evening, my date and I were completely thrilled with our choices.  The fresh anchovy appetizer was the essence of purity:  great fish in the most simple vinegar and olive oil dressing, served with hot red peppers that highlighted the anchovies without overwhelming.  We followed this with the pizza with escarole, sweet and spicy peppers, goat cheese and mozz arella, and never thought again about the margherita we were missing.  The combination of flavors and textures was inspired, the pairing with an excellent Montepulciano was as perfect as the bartender suggested, and we left wanting absolutely nothing!

Another one of the tweeners that I'm a fan of, but would probably give 3.5 stars if I could. I like it, don't love it, and there are a few quirks that detract from it. Really good pizza (although I can't honestly say North Beach needed ANOTHER pizza place) but Tony's stands out for its really great thin crust wood fired pizza. The highlight item is the Pizza Margherita, of which only 73 are made per day (to symbolize the day Tony won a prize for it...kinda weird and superstitious, but whatever). The service can be a litle slow but they are friendly, and the outside seating is somewhat difficult due to it being on a slight up hill slope, but overall it works.

My SF native friends warned me that when I moved from NYC to SF, it would be difficult to find good Italian food and good pizza....... so far, I'm off to a great start! Tony's reminds me of NY style thin-crust pizza and the sauce is just terrific!  Don't be afraid of the touristy North Beach location - this place is great!  We had the Margherita pizza which reminded me so much of my favorite pizza back in NY and then the yummy original tomatoe pie! I loved it and I'm coming back for more!

To sum it up, the best pizza I've ever had. I'd easily give this a 5 if I knew the rest of the menu was even half as good as what we had. I decided I had to go here during a weekend trip up to SF. The wife and I wandered in early on a Saturday night looking to get a small first dinner before regrouping and heading on to our late second dinner with friends. The place was busy and we were kind of in a hurry. We decided to forego waiting for a table and waited for a couple of spots at the bar to open up. The bartender was nice and really helpful picking out drinks and a pizza to share.  We couldn't resist ordering the garlic truffle fries which were scrumptious.  Soon after we polished off the fries, our bianca pizza arrived we dug in and were nearly floored by the awesomeness of the pizza.  The crust was crisp but had a nice chew and there was a great complexity of salty, bitter and fatiness with the asiago, arugula, prosciutto, and mozzarella that made each bite enjoyable.  Needless to say, we demolished the pizza and didn't have much room left for our second dinner.

This place was such a treasure! We were wandering around SF and craving some pizza and drinks and was brought here by our friendly cab driver. There really wasn't a wait, (we sat at the bar). They start you off with some tasty bread and garlic, pesto, sweet pepper dips. YUM. We then ordered some drinks from the well seasoned bartender. He fixed us up with some tasty tasty drinks. I know one was a side car, and I forget the name of the others but they were deliciousss! We ordered a fig/procciuoto/parmesan pizza and it was very tasty. Semi-thin crust, crunchy and the bit of fig jam balanced out the salty parmesan perfectly. Tony's is a great place located in North Beach with a friendly local vibe. Would definitely return for drinks and pie!

Tony's pizza is just a few blocks from me and I salivate every time i pass by the storefront.  It's thin crust (ny style!! yeah!!) pizza.  They have many different toppings/styles.  My personal favorites are the the  Fig & Proscuitto pizza and the classic margherita style pizza.  You can get starters like green salad which is decent but it's really the pizza that is the star.  They use a special brick oven which is said to impart a special flavor to the pizza.  Dinner time gets crazy at Tony's, and there is usually a substantial wait. .There really aren't many good pizza joints in this town and Tony's happens to be #1 (at least in my mind).   Be prepared to wait and pay (more then you usually would for pizza) for Tony's Pizza.  It's OK, it's worth it!!

If you can't make it to Naples, make it to this place.  This is authentic as it gets on the west coast. Make sure to show up early enough to get the special pizzas (they only make a certain number ever day, so by dinner they're usually sold out).   I always stick to the basics and get the classic margherita and have never been disappointed.

Good pizza, worst service. It was during the North Beach festival which I know can be chaotic but this woman giving us pizza was so rude! I was putting my change back in my wallet and waiting for my slice of pizza and she yelled at me to move and get out of her way. I told her I was waiting for my slice and she told me she didn't care and to move again as she proceeded to shove me! I told her I am going to call and complain to the owner and she said she was the owner. She was blonde, had really bad skin and older. I really hope she wasn't the owner because I will never eat there again. Till this day I haven't been treated so rudely and that even was almost a year ago. I tried to refrain from giving a bad review but 9 months later it still bothers me. Basically beware of the nasty lady!

Some very tasty pizza but I think people get a bit caught up with this supposedly being some of, if not the, greatest pizza in SF.  Definitely wayyyy better served hot at the restaurant than pick-up as by the time pizza gets back home and probably needs to be reheated, it tastes pretty average. I've tried both the thin and the thick style and while both were good, the thin pizza is definitely better.

Not so concerned about authenticity, cooking temps - this is food, it needs to be appealing to look at and delicious.  And the pizza from this store is at the apex!  The pizza here is excellent. I never really clicked with whole-grain or multi-grain breads.  That all changed with the multi-grain pizza from Tony's Napoletana.  Excellent -- highly recommended.

First time visit to Tony's on Sunday. We only waited 10 minutes for a table and the service afterwards was fast and friendly. Since we were first-timers our server went over the different types of pizza and offered some reccomendations. We devoured the warm Foccia with the three dipping oils and five of us shared the Cesar Salad. the dressing was rich and creamy, the romaine crisp and the Parmesan had a wonderful bite to it. I had the award winning Margherita Pizza and so did a friend. Our table also ordered the Americano, which was feast for the eyes as well as the stomach; the New Yorker and a Stromboli. Everything was delicious. The atmosphere was fun and lively and our server made sure we were doing ok without being intrusive.

Okay, so I admit I was starstruck when we were seated and I look to my left and Tony Gemignani himself is in the open kitchen whipping up pizzas. This guy has been on Food Network, The Today Show, The Rachael Ray Show, and he's the freakin' World Pizza Champion!!! Get the calamari! You can have it half traditional and half calabrese style like we did...you won't regret it! And the pizza...I don't think there's a more authentic place on the West Coast to get pizza than Tony's! Once you have the pizza here you'll know why it's award-winning...that's all I can say. Even the dips that accompany the complimentary bread they give you here is drool-worthy. There are also so many ways to have your pizza made: wood-fired, coal-fired, or by gas or electric oven at various temperatures. The only reason I'm taking a star off is because the pizzas here are some of the most expensive I've had, so this can't be a regular spot for a college student like me...but you can bet I'll be back!

Tony's is the best. We are nearby neighbors and this is our go-to spot to take visiting friends and family. The staff is always warm and helpful. But go for the PIZZA! the Margarita is brilliant marketing with only 72 made a day (or something like that), but it really is the best thing on the menu. So delicious and so authentic. If you are lucky enough to sit at the counter where they make the pizza (only 2 seats), it is definitely a treat to watch them create the margarita and the care they take in making it just perfect! Looks like they are opening a cool hip slicery next door too. Can't wait for that to open... Yay for Tony finally opening up a great pizza restaurant that will actually stay in that space that turned over so many times before it!

Delicious, well-priced, and well worth the wait.  And the best part about the wait-- they'll take down your number and give you a call when your table is ready, so you don't need to sit in their tiny foyer and drool.  You can go to a nearby cafe instead and sip on a latte while planning the perfect order!

The best pizza in the bay area. Three styles (Neopolitan, Italian, American) each with a variety of topping options. All top quality made with the best ingredients by a master craftsman pizza maker. I recommend the Neopolitan style because it's so rare to get these pizzas executed correctly. I also recommend the Italian style "cal-ital" for it's mouth bomb of amazing flavors (just enough gorgonzola, prosciutto, parmesan, fig jam, balsamic vinegar). Cool space in a great location. Nice and professional staff. Sit in back to watch the master at work. Go eat the best pizza!

A buddy of mine was at this place for the launch!  Since he lives in North Beach he met the owner and got invited. This is damn good pizza!  I ordered the Tomato Pie (Jersey style) which is basically tomato sauce ( very zesty made from scratch) with cheese on a light crust.  I added italian sausage.  We inhaled it!  It was so damn good I called in to order the Margherita which is the one the Chef is known for - he won awards for.  It was damn good as well.   I was advised by the order taker over the phone that the Margherita is best served hot ( best eaten in-house), it is not the best to pick up since they do not cook it completely (90 seconds in the oven according to a previous user here). The good thing about these pies is that they are not as filling as Pizza normally is.  It is very light dough and not oily at all. Give it a try if you haven't!  You won't be disappointed!!

Tony's could be your destination for Pizza snobbery.  Enjoying pizza Margharita and Marinara the way Neapolitans intended you to enjoy it.  You can even get a pizza with real slices of black truffle and cowgirl creamery cheese (my birthday pizza).  The salads are also fantastic; I particularly enjoy the spinach salad with balsamic reduction.   That said, this could also be your neighborhood humble pizza spot where you get an after soccer practice with the kids pizza pie.  The Frank's pizza with pesto with tomatoes is a great example of what there is to like about cheesy American style pizza. The management is friendly and great, they even gave me tips on pizza ovens for my Mom, who is getting one installed in her backyard (mid-age belly here I come.) I would be remiss if I didn't mention that the fried green beans are great too.  My one constructive criticism is to serve the Neapolitan pizze with a steak knife as they do in the old country.  The chewy dough gives me carpel-tunnel when cutting it with a butter knife.

Ok, Tony's is like INSANE GOOD... but the limited number of Margarita pizzas... kinda kills me.   All day i'm stressed if I'm going to make it in time to get one of these coveted pizzas...  however, it's well worth it. Tony - way to fix the market ;) your pizza strategy is working. btw - you just got promoted to sharing the best pizza pedastool w/ golden boy... you guys are too different to compare.  play nicely w/ one another ;)

Wow. I've had a fair amount Napolentana at this point back in DC - including 2 Amys and Pizzeria Paradiso, both of which I'd have to count among my favorite restaurants. Tony's stood up to both of them with ease, though. Starting with the calamari appetizer was a great idea, it was fantastic. Everyone ordering their own pizza... well, it was a delicious idea, but it was an absolute ton of food. I had the clam and garlic pie and it was wonderful. Salty, garlicky, and delicious. The service and the atmosphere easily matched the great pizza and I know I'll be hitting Tony's again next time I'm in SF.

I've had Pyzano's which is the place that Tony used to run.  The pizza is as good as it was over there, except for the Margherita...The margherita is actually served here and tastes awesome.  The dough is chewy, but light and crispy.  There is not too much else to say as I got take out, but it does keep well in the box. Note that they run out of margheritas because they only make a limited amount of dough in a day.  I'll be back to try other things.

Ever since Tony's opened, I have heard so many rave reviews... Finally I have eaten there, but can only give them 3 stars. I dined at Tony's with 4 other guests (total 5) on a Wednesday evening.  They do not take reservations, so we had to put our name down for a table.  Close to an hour later we were seated at a booth, suitable for 4.  They added an extra chair to the end of the booth to accommodate our party of 5.  If I am going to wait 1 hour for a table for 5, I'd expect to have a table suitable for 5. 3 stars for that.   I will agree with everyone else that the pizza's are great, but they are on the pricey side.  We ordered the Clam & Garlic and Fratellanza, $21 and $28, respectively.  Delicious, but in my opinion nothing absolutely spectacular. Lastly, our server Amy was knowledgeable, attentive and nice.  No complaints here... I would give them 4 stars, but the long wait time and oversight of offering us a booth for 4, brings them 3 stars.  Better next time....

After reading about this guy and his award-winning pies for 3 years, I finally came by this last Saturday.   Our group of each had a pint and split the two most highly acclaimed pizzas.  Our server was nice, but forgetful.  We got our bread after our first pizza. The Margheritta (Naples Winner), which I've dreamed about, was very good.  It didn't blow my mind like I was expecting - perhaps my expectations were unreasonable.  Still very good.  The sauce was the highlight. The Cal Italia (Food Network Winner) had a lot of intense flavors that complemented each other nicely.  Of the two, it was the preferred pizza in our group. I'd most likely come by for lunch sometime.  Looking forward to trying some of the other creations.

Such a great restaurant! Food and service was excellent. We had the spinach salad with balsamic reduction.. Soo tasty, especially with the goat cheese they put on it. And also ordered the famous pizza. It's not too thin like ny pizza and not too dense and thick like Chicago, but just perfect with a crispy crust. I came in just before the lunch crowd on a sunday and didn't have to wait long at all for my food. If the tables are full, you can sit at the bar and enjoy crisp mimosas with your pizza! Ohh, and they have good bread too! :) Yummmy

Once heck of a pie was our experience.   Bread came to the table with three variations of the olive oil dipping sauce (pesto/plain/garlic)... meatballs (Polpete) were tasty, in a very nice sauce, well spiced, came to the table warm, and we ate them all. The Margherita pie is notable---the crust is tasty and savory, the tomato sauce rich and fresh tasting, no off "tin can" or "toasted" flavors in it.  Waistline disaster; two of us ate the whole thing. ARGH! Wine list is well matched to the pies and Italian food; Caesar salad is well large enough to split with two or even three. Wait staff was excellent; knew the menu and the pies cold; outlined the best matching wines---and then, unrequested, provided small tasting sips of two other wines after we simple-mindly had selected the Rose and helped us make a better match with dinner; pacing of service was dead on. We'll be back.  Yes, there are tourists there; who cares? Sometimes, it's nice to be a tourist in my own home town...

World Pizza Cup Winner, Amazing Service, and a specialty in wood-fired Italian pizza?? Tony's is the place to go! I saw this place featured in a 7x7 magazine article and was curious how an award-winning pizza would taste like. AMAZING BEYOND BELIEF. The place was packed. We didn't make a reservation until we got there so we had to wait for a while but given that the parking in the area is so hard to find, the wait ended up matching the time it took my friends to find parking and meet us right as we got seated. The server was very informative giving us a basis of how they prepare their pizzas and bake them in 900 degree oven. Each pizza is only baked for 30 seconds and served instantly. It was actually very surprising how quickly we got our food considering the packed house. The ambiance is really cute, a perfect a date in the city or a girl's night out. Appetizers: we were given bread and sauce. both were really delicious and never ending :) He KEPT filling our bowl. We had to fight the temptation to not get full off of bread so that we could eat our pizzas. Among the 10 of us, we ordered: 1) The New Yorker: Mozzarella, hand crushed tomato sauce, natural casing pepperoni, sliced italian fennel sausage, ricotta, chopped garlic & oregano--- ATTENTION MEATLOVERS. CALLING YOUR NAME. 2) White Potato and Rosemary Pizza: mozzarella, white rose potatoes, rosemary, calabrese peppers, cowgirl creamery's fromage blanc, lavender sea salt-- It was a really interesting yet delicious pairing of potatoes and peppers. 3) AWARDING-WINNING Margherita Pizza: san marzano tomatoes dop, sea salt, mozzarella fior di latte, fresh basil, extra virgin olive oil-- I can tell why it won an award. It's SOO delicious. I think what made it so unique was the sauce. It was very flavorful yet at the same time light. They only make a certain # of these a day so if you make the trip over, I HIGHLY recommend getting this one. 4) Classic Caesar salad 5) Lasagna: OMG. best lasagna EVERRRRR. The portion isnt that big to share among a lot of people but just even a bite was worth it. Very cheesy :) Normally, I don't eat the crust of pizzas but at Tony's the pizza crust was SO GOOD. Very soft & doughy. i am definitely a fan. Good recommendation 7x7

Soooo good! Delicious drinks, super friendly staff and amazing pizza. Had a margherita pizza subbed burratto cheese for mozzarella, highly recommended! Thin chewy crust, we devoured the whole thing in about ten minutes. Probably could have eaten a whole pizza myself, let's be honest.   On our way out we heard the hostess tell someone the wait would be an hour and a half. I guess that explains the couple that creeped behind us for 20 mins as we finished our drinks, and pounced on our seats the second we stood up. Get there early to avoid a wait!

Okay, this place has way too much hype. The awards and the name that comes with this place makes it more than what it is.This review is more for the pizza I ordered the cal Italia after reading how great it is and the awards it has received I was excited to try it...well, it was way too salty, the cheese was chewy and tough, flavor was eehh, and the fig syrup did not go with it at all. It comes down to your taste, but honestly I have had better at round table. The bread and prosciutto was delicious though and the location was great. Also when I tried ordering over the phone to avoid the lines, the girl who answered seemed to be confused over what I wanted to do, how confusing is to take an order? She made me call back when they opened why she didn't say this from the start I have no clue. For 20 bucks and 6 slices! I was expecting more pizza and better taste. Oh well, I might try a different pizza, if I go back. BIG IF...If you like weird combos try it, if you are more classic don't.

Ordered 3 pizzas.  Two came out.  30 minutes passed.  45 minutes passed.  Still no third pizza.  Server said it was coming, of course.  An hour went by before our third order arrived.  The hostess did come over and did the right thing by taking the late pizza off our bill.  The thing that was really aggravating was the attitude of our server who didn't really seem to know, nor explain, what the problem was and didn't seem to be too concerned. The pizza was ok.  It is over-priced like most everything else, but I would likely give it another shot.

Tony's is an excellent place for pizza. I live more than 10 miles away and I will drive all the way to SF just to have pizza at this place, so that says something right there! Their menu is very hard to understand but the servers are aware that the majority of customers are brand new. They explain the menu in great detail and are very willing to make you understand. Its pretty expensive but well worth it. I would recommend the Margarita pizza and their cheesy garlic bread!

I would have given 5 stars but for them taxing at the old sales tax - so I tipped a bit less to compensate. They have a wide variety of pizza. Service is excellent. Can't believe one pizzeria to have so many different types of ovens to bake pizza - coal, wood, gas, electric, at varient temperatures as well - for the world champ to the Californian, to NY to Sicilian. Your choice.

The whole experience at Tonys was excellent.  The beer list was awesome- though I don't understand the pricing!  Yuengling out of PA was $8.50 ( basic lager) and Chimay Red was $6.  Holla!!!  We started with the meatball app ( they were out of the bone marrow fondue - which I had been super excited about). The meatball and the mushroom cream sauce were heavenly.  We had the New Yorker and the Americano for pizza, with the Americano being the overall favorite though they were both very good.  The service was good and I definitely want to go back.  Word to the wise- stop by and put your name on the list.  They do not accept reservations, and we had an hour and half wait on a Wed night.

There are a ton of extensive reviews about this place so I will keep this short: - Go here - Get the Award Winning Pizza (Limited to 73 a day) - Savor the crust - Compare every other pizza you eat for the rest of your life to this Amazing!  Best pizza I have ever had.  There are like 3 or 4 different kinds of ovens in this place, depending on which pizza you order, it gets cooked in the proper oven for that kind of pizza. Service was great, drinks were also amazing. Bottom line, this place rocks.   My wife and I will be back for sure.

They say this is the best pizza in SF. I agree. If you can stand the wait (usually always a wait), totally worth it. They cook the pizza for 90 seconds in a 900 degree oven- and the pizza turns out pretty amazing. Different than other pizza I've had. Try it out- I think it's worth it, here in North Beach, land of pizza places.

Finally got to go to Tony's yesterday night.  We got a table right away, the place had a few tables open and I noticed that a lot of restaurants in North Beach weren't that busy either, slow night on a Wednesday. Me and my gf had the Italian Salad, which was a good starter. Pizza -  Margherita - The Napoletana-style pizza, when I asked the waiter if there was any left, he said that we're number 56, since they only make 73 per day.  It was really good, but that's all we can order with 2 people.   Service was outstanding, waiter was nice and when we left, he noticed that I was looking at the wood fire stove and he explained to me how it worked and why their pizza is so good.   I want to go there again with more people next time so we can have other kinds of pizzas.  So I can really get a good feeling for this place. 1 pizza warranted another visit for sure tho.

Don't try driving here and then moan about the parking....just walk, cab, or PT it and get here to try their amazing margarita pizza.  They fly in the olive oil and the flour and who knows what else but it totally works for a melt in your mouth super thin and tasty pizza.  I wouldn't try to do take out with this pizza because the thin crust might get soggy and is best eaten right out of the hot oven (leftovers aren't likely).   They also give you bread with yummy olive oil to dip - one with pesto, one with fresh chopped garlic, and one plain.  Soooo good.  We also had a salad to start which was more than enough for two to share.  Can't wait to go back to try other varieties but would absolutely get the award-winning margarita again.

We've been looking forward to eating at Tony's Pizza Napoletana for a while now.  We came with a big group, drove 1.5 hours in traffic from San Jose, and had to wait for our table...but the delicious Sicilian mojitos made the wait worthwhile. We sat in the back room where we were able to watch Tony make the pizzas in front of the wood burning oven.  We started with some great apps... anchovies on top of a bed of arugula, spicy calamari, deep-fried green beans, and rosemary garlic fries.  I know we were hungry but they were all delicious!! Fortunately we saved room for the real reason we went there...Tony's pizza.  The clam pizza came out first and was really tasty.  Covered with clams that were cooked perfectly.  I've had this pizza before at another restaurant but the clams were overcooked & rubbery. Next came the Cal Italia which was a long rectangular pizza which crossed the length of one table.  There are three different types of pizza and they recommend that you start with the olive & cherry tomato first, the pepperoni & arugula next, and the fig & prosciutto next.  I'm not a big fan of sweet pizza so the fig wasn't my flavor, but the others were perfect!   We were getting full but had to save room for the pizza we were waiting for...the margherita and the quail egg & speck.  The quail egg & speck was my sister-in-law's pick and although I didn't think i'd like it...it was surprisingly tasty.  There was prosciutto and cheese with a layer of delicious (almost creamy) quail egg.   If I see a margherita pizza on a menu, I'll always order it...and I'm usually very disappointed.  Tony's (which they only make 73 a day!!).  This was amazing!!  The crust almost tasted like naan bread.  My favorite part was dipping the crust in the tomato sauce...which is nothing like the typical dark sauce you'll find on most pizzas.  This was light, subtly sweet, and complimented to crust & fresh mozzarella perfectly!! I can't wait to eat Tony's pizza again.  Please open in Vegas!!!

We were looking for a cozy casual resto for a quiet New Year's dinner, and Tony's fit the bill. Although we had about a 40min wait when we arrived at 7:30, there was plenty of space at the bar to wait for the rest of our party to arrive. Our server was very friendly and knowledgeable, and helped explain the menu which is a bit confusing with the different styles of crusts and sauces. We selected the house special pizza with sausage and pepperoni, the Cal Italia, and the Clam and Garlic Pizza. All were hits, although some at our table were not a fan of the fig jam on the Cal-Italia. I love sweet with my savoury, so was not a problem for me. Also have to mention the starter salad, which was mixed greens with walnuts and amazing shaved Parmesan cheese, drizzled with a balsamic dressing. Tasty. The panne cotta for dessert was also a different item to try, very light and refreshing. Thanks you Yelp! for another great recommendation.

We ate at the bar and tried both the award winning margherita and the classic americano.  The margherita was just about perfect.  I loved the tangy sweet sauce and the nicely charred and slightly chewy crust.  The americano was a nice representation of a familiar standard all american combo pizza done very very well.  Again, the crust, though different than the margherita, was delicious and held up well even being reheated the next day. The bartender was friendly and poured us a sample of a new brand of beer they were considering to carry.  So 4 solid stars for the pizza and one extra for the service.

Tony's Pizza Napoletana is a fantastic addition to SF's North Beach scene.  It's a trip around the world, Pizza-style, without leaving the little restaurant at the corner of Union and Stockton Sts. (BTW: I use to love La Felce, and miss Romano and Flora, the former owners). But Tony G. offers almost every style of pizza known to man: NY, Jersey, Naples (I don;'t think he's added Chicago deep dish...yet).  All are suberb!  Man, it's making me hungry thinking about it!   I posted at podacst all about Tony and his pizza passion.  It's "The Attitude Adjustment Hour".  Please check it at http://bit.ly/8M2Fhv

I. LOVE. TONY'S. I could do without the long waits and the 73 Margherita limit though, the Extra just isn't as good when you're used to the real thing... My boyfriend and I usually get the Margherita and the Scarola con Pancetta, which are both fantastic. With out appetizers, we generally have a few slices left over. (I've had other pizza's as well, but none are "stunners" worthy of five stars.) The hosts are amazing and will take your phone number, rather than make you wait in the bar. Courtney always remains patient, and even set aside our leftovers when we forgot them one nice! Highly recommend, but allow for an hour wait or more in the evenings.

This place is nothing exceptional. I ordered the linguini and it tasted pretty cheap. If it's gonna taste cheap it should be cheap! The pizza was okay but nothing exceptional, but it wasn't overly priced like the linguini though. So I guess that's something! I would rather buy roundtables or fat slice and save money and eat better pizza.

I have to highly recommend the Margarita pizza here. Very tasty with high quality cheese and fresh tomato and basil on it.  They are putting in a new tap system and the selection on their tap list looks very impressive with a large selection of Belgians.   My two complaints are that everything is on the expensive side and the service is pretty slow. The  Margarita at $18 is a bit more than most places in the area.

This is some amazing pizza and I have had a lot of pizza in my life. Pizza is one of if not my favorite food,  you can do so much with it. I have had some of the best pizza in the country Tonys, Grimaldi's, Mozza, and Delphinas just to name a few. My boyfriens and his family went to Tony's on a Sunday afternoon, if there is one complaint its that you cant be seated unless your whole party is there, but I think that is a San Fran thing due to parking being such an issue in the city. We started off with the rosemary french fries they were some of the freshest flavorful fries I have ever had. then to get to the pizzas. We had 4 people in our party and 3 pizzas were more than enough. Since we were there early enough in the day we were able to order one of the only 73 award winning pizzas Tony makes a day. Its the pizza he won the 2007 Pizza world cup in Naples Italy. I will say it was a great pizza the dough, the sea salt was amazing and the over all flavor was great, it is a thin pizza but a good true Italian pizza and a thin style. Picture perfect comes to mind We also ordered the Diavola con Rucola a hot pepper oil, spicy salami, arugula pizza. I have been looking for a pizza like this since I went to Italy 10 years ago. It is a truly flavorful pizza that is actually spicy. It was absolutely delicious. I have been craving it for the last month. When you order food at Tony's it is made with such care, time and elegance you just want to take a picture of it before you dig in.

Probably the best pizza I ever ate (although I did have a stand up elbow to elbow place in Venice, IT that was perhaps an equal as far as a pure slice to slice comparison goes). Had the Margherita pizza with a few pepperoni added.  Two beers each and a pizza each and my wife and I hit about $75.00 for lunch with tip, so it's not cheap if you're not sharing a pizza. That said, at $100 for the lunch it would be one to remember.  Go there and get their Margherita - get Bufalo mozzarella if they have it.  Fabulous atmosphere, and great food, with plenty of wine and beer choices.  If there is one restaurant to have lunch at in San Francisco you will not miss out here.

My husband and I were in the area, saw this place and decided to give this place a try for lunch.  We were very happy we did.  The gorgonzola fries were absolutely delicious - crunchy and creamy textures with just the right amount of saltiness.  We had the truffle pizza but with truffle oil instead of shaved truffles (ballers on a budget).  The pizza was so tasty and I loved the mushrooms.

Tony's... Thank you Jesus and F*ck France! Because the French dip is dead and Tony's Italian beef sandwich is the God of all Beef Au Jus sandwiches. It says, "Hey kiss my a** France; Suck my d**k. The Italians took your sandwich and f****d you up."

I am a pizza snob since an 2007 trip to Napoli so when I read about Tony's and the fact he won the Italian Naples pizza contest I knew we would be there opening day!  We have been several times since especially since he is now doing coal fired pizza!  Absolutely delicious!  Brought back many warm memories of Italy.  On our first trip Tony came out personally and asked me what my ultimate pizza would be.  I gave my criteria in within 8 minutes he was there with a personal sample pizza for me that almost made me shed a tear!!!   If you haven't gone go now!!

Best pizza I've had in quite some time. The "we only make 73 a day" margherita was just as good as anything I tried in Naples, with super sweet crushed tomato, mozzarella di bufala and fresh basil. Also tried the "diavola con rucola" -- sopressata, arugula, mozarella and parmigiano -- which was sinfully delicious with a lovely doughy crust. Tasted more American (thicker, chewier crust than typical Naples-style thin crust), but oh so delicious.

do not ever go here.  this place does not honor their wait list.  the hostess quoted one hour to one and one quarter hours wait.  four of us waited one and a half hours - and gave up...after we spent: one bottle of wine, multiple slices of pizze next door, and calimari appetizer fees.  these people should not be in the restaurant business.  they do not know how to manage a small restaurant, and take care of their customers.  do yourself a favor and go elsewhere - there are many, many alternatives to this disaster.

Tony's has ruined me for all other pizzas, this place truly is the best I have ever had. On top of great, world class pizza we had a wonderful meatball in perfect marinara sauce. The Staff was hardworking and very attentive. My younger son is a connoisseur of pizza and after praising Tony, was rewarded with a close up view of the pizza ovens. My favorite was the coal fired pizza (1000 degree oven) but it was all good. I can't wait to go back!!

This place is great.  They use some of the finest cheeses and i hear they shipped the brick oven from Italy.  We ordered calamari (1/2 reg, 1/2 spicy) and the New Yorker.  That ricotta cheese is creamy and tasty and blends well with their delicious pizza sauce.  This place is always busy and the food have yet to disappoint.  Beer selection is great as well. Had a Peroni on tap.  If you're in the area, make sure you check em out.

I went here with a group of about 8 of us and Tony's claimed the wait would be an hour....we got seated within 10 minutes (very lucky).  Every pizza, appetizer, and salad we ordered was great.  This pizza comes pretty close to the Pizza in Italy.  Very casual spot.  If it's a nice day in San Francisco, I would enjoy the outdoor seating.

Pizza-gasm!!! Over and over and over again! My sister had always wanted to go to Tony's when she lived in San Francisco but never got to-we went for her graduation and it was worth the wait. They have so many choices, and the detail how hot the pizza is cooked and for how long in what type of oven. They are known for the Margherita pizza, and boy is it good-light, crispy, just the right amount of everything- it cooks in a minute and a half at 1000 degrees! I also had the Pizza Americano with everything on it, and it was delicious as well. The cheesy garlic bread was yummy, but if I go again, I'd save more room for pizza, it's so good. Closed Monday/Tuesday, be aware, and of course parking can be a challenge, but this is worth a visit if you head to North Beach.

Since that first experience that I yelped about I've been back to Tony's countless times, and it just gets better every time I go. I've started working my way through the menu, and so far every thing I've had has been better than the last. The fried calzones (FRIED!!!) are absolutely orgasmic. The drinks are just as good as they were the first time. They are VERY consistent, which with such complex recipes is not only difficult to pull off from bartender to bartender, but shows how serious they are about their craft. GO GO GO!

I'll definitely give this place another chance. The pizzas we ordered were just ok, one was an award winner and had a marmalade on it which was creative but not really delicious. The crust seemed gooey. One person I was with had the margherita and it too was soft/gooey and they said it was just "ok" too;. The other was just okay. Next time I will try the tomato pizza pie which looked the best of the pizzas I saw delivered to other patrons. It's just impossible to top Tommasso's.

Good pizza in North Beach?  Now I've seen everything. Not only do you get award-winning world champion pizzas here (we got the Burratina di Margherita, a classic margherita pizza with extra creamy mozzarella topped with fresh tomatoes, basil, and a little drizzle of balsamic), but the prices are reasonable (our pizza was $30 and easily big enough for 3 people) and the food is extremely high quality without falling into the common "gourmet" trap of having anemic portions. If they delivered, I'd never get pizza from anywhere else.  Will definitely be returning next time I'm in the area.

Hello yelpers, here we go. I went to Tony's on a non busy Saturday and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of their pizza. We orders the margerita-award winning pizza and it was awesome. A little pricey, but the quality and service was outstanding. They place is not that big, so I personally suggest to call ahead and make a reservation. Parking situation is a bit tough, but no matter where you park, the neighborhood is fantastic. Plus, a little walk after dinner never hurt nobody.

Tony's a pizzaiolo who's puritanical about quality pies and it comes through on the menu that covers a ton of Italian, American (and Californian!) styles of pizzas cooked in three different types of ovens. The meal was off to a great start with perfectly poured Negronis and speck-wrapped chunk of creamy burrata drizzled with olive oil that was so good you weren't sure if you should eat it or rub it all over your face. In my book, the true test is the Margharita.  The wood-fired crust and fresh mozzarella were perfect, but the sauce (and I know it's supposed to be thin and spare) was kinda weak...was it just me? The Cal Italia  is a HUGE departure from traditional italian pies, but what an incredible trip with a fig-based 'sauce' and drizzles of balsamic-reduction over a smoky cheese topping.   The Scarola Con Pancetta was the table-favorite with mozarella, peppered goat cheese, pancetta and sweet piquant red peppers that balanced the creamy cheeses with a not-too-spicy kick.   There were a bunch of other pizzas, salads and appetizers that I can't wait to go back and try.   I'm strongly considering turning Tony's week long class in Neopolitan pizza making intp my next sta-cation.......

Finally San Francisco has great pizza!  I'm from New York and have never found a place in SF that compares to what I grew up with until Tony's opened up. There's a pizza contest held in Italy each year where pizza makers from all over the world compete for the best of the best award.  In 2007, Tony shocked the Italians by becoming the first American to beat the pizza gods with his Margherita Pizza.  A legend was made and lucky for us he opened a shop in North Beach.  Try the Margherita Pizza and the meatballs.  There's a full bar and the staff is very friendly.  This is a great place to eat and drink!

Truly a great pizza experience.  Bummed that they were out of clams for the clam pie, but the margherita, white, and tomato pies were all fantastic.  The mushroom and pancetta pasta was out of this world.

there is nothing better than having the owner of Tony's Pizza personally bring out your pizzas!!! My husband and I took a weekend trip to SF and made a special trip up to North Beach to try this supposedly amazing pizza. We were not disappointed. The Margarita pizza was amazing!! Not only did we get excellent service from Tony himself, he even brought us a pizza on the house!! And after gorging ourselves on 3 pizzas between the two of us, we had plenty of hillside streets to walk up and down!! *A note to people who like soda drinks: they do not offer refills on any fountain drinks and they run about 3 bucks a glass. Also, only 75 or so Margarita pizzas (the award winner) are made each day.

Could a new pizza restaurant in North Beach actually succeed amongst the numerous pizza and Italian joints??? Tonys has seemed to have the pizza game figured out. This place is always packed and for good reason. The Margarita pizza is just amazing and so is the Sicilian style. But I think my favorite thing here is not the pizza (what?!?!). Its the bar!!! The bartenders are AWESOME. They make up cocktails on the spot that are delicious. So I've actually sitting at the bar the last couple times I've gone. Overall this is a quality spot.

Selected this place after reading the rave reviews here on Yelp.   My party of four ordered a variety of items to share: Pizza Campari, Picante, original stromboli and calzone. the best one was the Pizza Campari.  The crust was light and delicious, and the goat cheese was awesome.  I felt the Picante would've been better with less toppings.  The number of toppings led the finished product to be somewhat greasy although the flavors were very good.  The stromboli was on the salty side, be sure to eat it with the marinara sauce that comes with it.  It definitely helps cut the saltiness.  The calzone was not what we expected.  It tasted and looked like it contained ricotta cheese in it which is not on the ingredient list on the menu.  I would not order this item again if I went back.

Sign me up brother, this place is as legit as it gets.  They have like five different styles of Pizza, one kind we had cooked at like 750 degrees for only 90 seconds, another kind at 1000 degrees for a little longer for a slightly different style, they also have sicilian styles and more american styles, all use different kinds of dough with different ovens, tons of topping varieties from traditional to gourmet.  Extremely reasonable considering the quality, quantity, and location.  "I'll be back."- Terminator

900 degrees. 90 seconds. That's how Tony cooks his award-winning signature Margherita pizza. But this is not a surprise at all. All the Neapolitan pizza has to be cook in this way. If not, you cannot call the pizza Neapolitan. To commemorate the day, 6/13, when he won the competition in Naples, only 73 (6+1 and 3) Margherita pizzas are served a day. And Tony skillfully uses 4 different pizza ovens depending on the types of his pizza. Which other pizza restaurant in San Francisco has 4 different pizza ovens? My friends and I waited for 80 minutes to get a table. You can leave your name and cellular phone number and walk around the neighborhood while you wait. They will call your phone when the table is ready so don't worry. On that day, our server took us to the booth where my fellow Yelper, Tiffany K and her mom had just vacated. As soon as we were seated, water, pieces of focaccia and bread, dipping olive oil, garlic olive oil and sun-dried tomato olive oil were served. Please don't skip the olive oil at this stage. If you have olive oil before you eat pizza, your body will absorb "less fat" from your pizza. Smart Italians! What I like about this restaurant is that we can enjoy some of his award-winning pizza in the city. Below is the food that I have tried so far. 1. Margherita....2007 World Pizza Cup Winner, Naples, Italy This was a delicately delicious pizza. The famous classic pizza dedicated to the Princess Margherita of Savoy has 3 colors of Italy, green (basil), red (tomato sauce) and white (mozzarella). Everything was surprisingly delicate. I loved the delicate thin crust, the scent of basil, slightly sour but delicious tomato sauce, and the floating islands of mozzarella. The greatness of this pizza also comes from the imported ingredients from Italy and the oven that is the replica of the oven used by Tony when he won the competition in Italy. Their menu only says "San Felice flour" but we know that the flour is essential to authentic Neapolitan pizzas and it is also called "00" as Zero Zero. I almost took off my shoe to hit a friend of mine in the head when he said, "Ewww, this pizza is too soggy to eat with hands!" No, dude! Italian pizzas are supposed to be eaten with a fork and a knife. That's the manner. There's always the best way to eat certain food. 2. Cal Italia...."Gold Medal" Food Network Pizza Champions Challenge Simply good! I don't usually like blue cheese but even I could enjoy this pizza very much. This was exactly the opposite of the simple Margherita pizza. With such complexity, this pizza played with our brains. Mozzarella, asiago, gorgonzola, sweet fig preserve, prosciutto, parmigiano, balsamic and tomato sauce gave our brains the fireworks of flavors! Sweetness, sourness, saltiness and bitterness. I had never heard 3 guys moan with joy at the same time previously in my life so it was a little bit weird but it was that good. I think this pizza is the best when you share it with somebody because the sweetness of the preserve will prevent you from eating much. 3. Classic Pepperoni...The most American pizza! Yes, it was just a pepperoni pizza but still it was really good. I liked the crispy pepperoni shrunk like mini-bowls. 4. Meat Balls...As our friendly server recommended, they were very good. They were big, hot and juicy meat balls. 5. Tiramisu...The obligatory dessert! This was actually just "average" but the pizzas were so good that we just wanted to finish our wonderful meal with this dessert. The service was excellent. Our servers were very friendly during my two visits. There are so many pizza restaurants in San Francisco but how many restaurants have "Neapolitan" or "Napoletana" in their business names? Just a few. Tony's restaurant has it. Naples is the birthplace of pizza. People in Naples are serious about their pizza and are proud of it. They even have the Pizza Napoletana Association. If you open a "Napoletana" pizza restaurant, the inspectors will visit your restaurant to check if you are using the authentic ingredients, if the dough is hand-kneaded and if the pizza is baked in the brick oven with an oak-wood fire and with the heat of 900 degrees or not. If you cannot serve authentic Napoletana pizza, you may lose the word, "Napoletana" from your business name. I give this restaurant my 5th star for Tony's courage and his skill to serve the authentic Neapolitan pizza to San Franciscans. Just in case you don't like his pizza when you try it, "Wine a little, you'll feel better."

Once upon a time there was a guy from New York who moved to San Francisco. This guy was saddened that despite living close to a plethora of Italian eateries---he could not find a pizza like he enjoyed back home. Then one day---on the advice of a neighbor, this guy (and his Gal) went to Tony's. We were greeted by Amy----who upon learning we were virgins to Tony's, walked us thru the menu--explaining in vivid detail the choices that were ours to make. She----in our humble opinion, is a top notch employee----and one of the reasons we'll be going back. Whats the other reason? OMG---The Pizza !!!!!!!!! We got the pizza with the eggplant----and the meatballs---- Where else can you get these kind of meatballs for these affordable prices? No-place Should you look further if you want awesome pizza?

While we waited for them to open, we popped over to their takeout place next door and got a slice of Sicilian which is the closest I have found to the East Coast Sicilians in SF.  Then we ordered the Margherita at the restaurant and it was like pizza you would get in Italy, very thin but not crunchy crust with toppings sliding right into your mouth as soon as it comes out.  Wanted to try the truffle pie but was advised that they didn't have the cheese that normally goes with it so if it's a must on your list, go on Wed or Thur shortly after they get the shipment for the week.  Also it's seasonally priced so there may be times it can be $70 for the truffle one.

Discovering that this place had an Italian Beef Sandwich made my spine tingle.  I love Italian Beef, and it's one of the things I miss most since I moved to San Francisco.  Last night I went to Tony's with my buddy from Chicago try try it out. Overall, the experience was meh.   Tony, 1) Please teach your employees how to say the ingredients.  Listening to the girl behind the counter try and say giardiniera was painful. 2) My sandwich was dry.  Like seriously dry, which was a surprise after being explained the overly complicated dipping levels (I've never heard of the 3 different levels of dipping a sandwich and I used to eat Italian beef 2x/ week).  I asked for it soaked (3 dips?) and my sandwich and bread was almost completely dry.  The bread should be soaked all the way through and falling apart. When you say soaking - SOAK IT. 3) The bread was inappropriate for this sandwich.  It was too wide, which made it extremely difficult to eat.  It was also too hard, and almost burnt on the bottom (there were three of us eating them and we all had the same experience).  Maybe it was the thick shell that repelled the jus when it was dipped, but maybe they just didn't give it a good dipping. 4) The jus that it was dipped in didn't have a lot of taste.  Maybe it's the fact that they haven't had the same bin of juice for the last 50 years that they just keep reusing.  Whatever it is, it didn't add much to the sandwich. Overall rating: If you really need an Italian beef, it could substitute in a moment of desperation, but mostly it just made me miss Chicago. also- apparently the sausage on the Combo is pretty good, but that sandwich has the same issues as the italian beef.

We came here for lunch on the Veteran's Day holiday.  Both sides of the restaurant were pretty packed, and we were hoping that this place would be worth the wait.  We waited about 20 minutes for a table and were located in the cramped table next to the small booth outside the kitchen door.  My fiance had the Americano pizza, which wasn't bad, and I had ordered the rigatoni with chicken--eh.   Our waiter had to be reminded by one of the ladies at the oven to take our order, and when he finally came, he didn't even bother to write it down our order! I understand that a calamari appetizer, Americano pizza, and rigatoni with chicken may be a simple order, but he forgot to even place the order for the calamari.  He never even checked on us once we got our food. All in all, the pizzas may be award winning, but that's about it.

So the margherita pizza is actually really good.  I loved the cheese and the sauce especially.  However, it was also $19.  We also had the frisee salad, which was also slightly on the pricey side for $9.  I shared this with a friend and left barely full.  So food quality good, but prices a bit high, so minus one star for that.   Also, the only place in the city that carries Yuengling, for those who don't know, it's an awesome lager from central PA.  They actually have someone drive it out here.  Amazing and major props for the effort.

Wow Wow Wow. I visit Pizza Rock in Sacramento on a weekly basis and found out the co-owner/ chef also has a pizza place in little italy so naturally the next time I was in SF I had to check it out. Absolutely amazing, I was with a group and we ordered the margerita, americano and the wild robiola. I had already had the margerita at Pizza rock- best ever; fresh mozzarella perfect sauce and crust. I've also already had the americano- its almost exactly like the sacramento at Pizza Rock. I loved the Wild Robiola- the truffle oil and wild mushrooms with arugula paired so well. This fabulous meal was followed by amazing deserts; tiramisu and meyer lemon panacotta. First of all that was the best tiramisu I have ever had, most times its soggy- not here- no sog at all, it was light and fluffy and so flavorful. I always ignore panacotta on a menu because I thought it was more like a mirangue. Tony (the tony) recommended this so I went for it- this was like heaven in my mouth. The texture was so smooth and creamy I couldn't stop putting it in my mouth. The meyer lemmon flavor was perfect not to sour just perfect. to Tony- mmmuagh and belissimo!

Pluses: I like that you can get slices here instead of a whole pie. The place is pretty cool looking and you can see into the kitchen in the back. The NY slice had good sauce and the Romana was cracker thin and you could pick three toppings for the Romana. Ehs: There was no was no way our 8 dollar Romana slice was 1/4 meter (~10 inches). It was more like 7. The reheating made the pizza more tough and was soon cold after a few minutes. I wish there were more seats. There's only one table inside and two tables outside. When we were eating, people started standing outside and eating. You can a comparable NY pizza slice at Arinell's.

I've been here six times since I moved to SF 10 months ago.  It has not disappointed once.  I've tried three different pizza's here and the margherita is by far my favorite.  Everything from the appetizers to pasta has been delish.  The burrata boat!

The perfect take-out food for the Washington Square is from Tony's Coal-Fired Pizza and Slice House. We have enjoyed Tony's Pizza Napoletana (next door) in our year in the neighborhood so we predicted that we would like his "take-out" place next door.  We did!  It's an attractive addition to the 'hood and we like the novelty of the coal-fired oven.   Get your order to go and enjoy it in the park, (Washington Square Park is "right there.") Food always tastes better when you know it was prepared by someone who knows what they are doing and cares about your experience as a customer.  Tony and his crew always manage to convey that they value their customers. Yea for Tony's newest business and yea for us that we have a top notch choice for good food in the park!

Just over 2 stars: good pizza, absent waiter, boring salad.  There was a table open as soon as we got there and our watier seemed very engaged when we first sat down, but then he disappeared.  That's not good when you have 3 people trying to order alcohol.  We got a salad to break up the cheesiness of the meal, and it was pretty boring.  The pizza was fine, but there's lots of good pizza in the city.  Given this experience, I wouldnt not wait in a long line for a table.

Three girlfriends and I came to Tony's for lunch on Saturday and left full and happy :)  We were told it would be 30 min wait, but it ended up being about 15.  Our waiter was great!  Very friendly and attentive, as was a lot of the staff.  We split the Margherita pizza and the Franks True Italian.  It's not hard to see why the Margherita pizza has won awards, and Franks is one of the best pesto pizza I've ever had!  For dessert we split the Apple Calzone.  It smelled and tasted heavenly!  Cannot wait for the next trip to SF so I can enjoy more!

So lucky to be able to come here at lunch and avoid the hordes! This time we had the Truffle Pizza. For me, throwing down $38 on a pie isn't a big deal. Especially when it's as decadent as this one. The dough for this pie uses the Caputo flour which  is what alot of top pie makers are using these days. It certainly works for me. I liked it just as much as the flour from Italy pie that is on the Margie. It will probably take me 5 to 50 more each to distinguish the subtle difference... I love tomato sauce pies but this Truffle pie is extraordinary. The heady flavor of the truffle shavings along with the three types of ultimo cheeses and arugula is heavenly, truly one of the best pies I have experienced. Tony uses extremely top quality olive oil which is important. As an experienced pie maker, I bow down!!! Also had the San Danielle Prosciutto and Buratta. Talk about a meal! Wow! Save some of your focaccia for this app. and make sure to swipe your bread in the reduced balsamic drops and XV olive oil on the plate. Kudos to the lads behind the bar as well. They may not be the all stars of Baretta, but they are not bad either! The Italian 75? I think the number was...was very nice. Thanks go out to Delfina for introducing me to having Prosecco with pizza!

It was great seeing Tony in action. Big congrats to him on this awesome new international pizza school and already popular restaurant. We went on a Wed and only waited about 10 mins before getting seated at a table right across from the wood-fired oven. We first got drinks at the bar which were nice, unusual mixtures with a bit of heat (ordered spicy drinks). Onto the food: green bean appetizer was yummy since I like garlic and salt. Hubby ordered the signature Margherita pie and I had the Cal-Italia which remains my favorite - first had it at Pyzano's in CV. Normally we'd never order two pies but since these are 10" it wasn't a problem to wipe the trays clean. We heard the wait can be looooong, so the next time we're up for the drive to the City, we'll plan it on a Wed evening. Can't beat it!

Tony offers an incredible selection of pizzas that may be unrivaled by anyone, anywhere!   I've never been overwhelmed by the quality of pizza to be found in North Beach but no longer. Tony's creative pizza menu demonstrates his incredible knowledge of the pizza making craft. I've tried the Classic Italian Quattro Formaggio and Diavola con Rucola pies and both exceeded expectations. But, pizza is not the only thing that Tony's excels at. Be sure to try the Deep Fried String Beans and Italian Fries as appetizers. Always a fun place for kids too. During my visits I've seen Tony himself entertaining kids with a pizza dough tossing demonstration.

I too looked forward to eating at Tony's.  It is a lovely  location, the parking God was favorable, we got a parking space on Stockton, next to the park. Staff is friendly, the bread and condiments very good.  Alas, the pizza, though very good is not up to the hype.  It took FOREVER to get our 2 pizzas.  Pizzaiolo, Gialina, Picco & Dopo make a better pizza.  The crust on our Margherita and other pizza (I can't even remember what is was, it was so pedestrian) was not memorable, the tomato sauce bland.  It was too bad, because the restaurant has so many great things going for it, including the  cocktail menu, but the most important thing - the pizza does not live up to the restaurant's hype of world class pizza.

So a few friends and I headed over to this place after seeing a show at Cobb's comedy club - we got there late (around 10:20) and the place closed at 11. We had a bit of trouble getting a table for 7 even tho it was so late but it all turned out well worth it. Since we were the last customers of the night they had run out of dough and only had enough for 3 pizzas.. and of course they told us this after we had ordered 4 or 5. But they were super cool and hooked us up with 2 FREE lasagnas on them! So safe to say we had plenty of food and it was all fantastic. Pizza have deliciously thin crust and the flavors are fantastic. I recommend the Cal Italia (a gold medal winner) for those that have a bit of a sweet tooth cause it has a 'fig sauce' on it - trust me, so damn good. And the prosciutto and arugula with cherry tomatoes. 5 stars for a combination of accommodation, service, and food. Thanks Tony's.

In brief: - OK, I get it, it's the best pizza. Sadly, I was not feeling well and my tummy disagreed. Nothing to do with the pizza, but I just couldn't get into it. - Tried three pizzas: potato and chorizo, margherita, and a strange pork one...obviously wasn't into that one. - Quick service, but strange decor for a world renowned pizza joint   In depth: - Best pizza, by far, was the margherita. We missed the 73 special pies they make during the day, but they can still make it with different dough. Highly recommended. Perfect size and the sauce was unlike any I've had before. - Chorizo and potato pizza was first rate, but needed a little pepper to spice things up. I was pleasantly surprised to find the chorizo was cut like sausage, since I was expecting it to be more gushy like in an omelet. - Didn't really have much, but will be going back to get the real experience. You should go, trust me. My tummy reluctantly gives it 4 stars, but I say hands down - I'm a fan!

The calamari was awesome, but they didn't provide and marinara sauce (we had the food to go). The margarita pizza was amazing. It's always busy, so I call ahead and pick up the pizza to-go. Sometimes the line is still long to pick it up, but it's worth the wait!

Just moved to North Beach, and in an area jammed with restaurants whose modus operandi is to just get a tourist to sit down at their table before dumping a plate of half a**ed slop in front of them, this place is a breath of fresh air. The wood fired pizza is the best you'll find in the area.  You can tell the ingredients are good, and the crust is spectacular. Pro-Tip: The Truffle Pizza is EXCELLENT, but don't let them fool you that you have to get the $80+ pie with Italian truffle on it - they'll sell you one with truffle oil instead for $23, last time I checked. Update: We've been coming here about weekly for the past YEAR. The white wine mussels are usually a good bet, and we always get a margherita or a coal fired pie.  (Simpler = better for us.) The tiramisu is great. New Tip: If there's a long wait to be seated, go to Delluvia around the corner and have a glass of wine.

This place is amazing! My husband and I were looking for a nice and not too expensive restaurant to go for our forth anniversary. A quick search on yelp and we ended up at Tony's. He had Pastrami Pizza with coleslaw on top which was soo soo delicious. I ordered Cal Italia and it was unbelievably tasty. It had some unusual ingredients for a pizza; like fig preserve and balsamic vinegar; but the whole thing was absolutely delicious. Service was great. Will definitely come back very soon!

PIzza was made really well, but the wait and the service was not good. Not a good value for the price. Seemed more like a trap than a real pizza joint. Still, the pizza is worth trying - especially the coal roasted pizza.

Went all the way to North Beach excited by the award winning pizza that I read about recently.  We were advised by our friend to skip the main restaurant and go the next door shop instead if we just wanted a couple of slices.  The shop was small, but still fits a booth in there, cozy and old-timey.  Service was friendly, pizza slices giant.  But I thought it was just okay.  The dough was pretty good, but other than that, I couldn't distinguish it from any other pizza places like Escape from New York.  My husband's homemade pizza is way better.

Super delicious pizza.  Not as great as I expected.  We ordered their New York coal oven pizza.  Very excellent.  But still not as excellent as I'd expected, given all the hype.  I think Delfina's is a bit better. I shouldn't complain about the menu and all the choices, but it was definitely a bit difficult to navigate the menu and make a decision, especially keeping in mind of what was unavailable (ie sold out) due to the late night.  It's very nice that they have something for everybody (ie pizza pasta appetizers etc), and nice that each category has so many flavor choices.  But there are almost too many choices. It's amazing about how busy they were at 9:30pm on a Wednesday night.  I'm very impressed and happy for them. I'd like to return, but don't think it's worth too long a wait; I'll probably go during an off-hour (like 3pm some weekday).  As much as I love pizza, I don't think any pizzeria is really worth that long of a wait for a table.  And I'm including Delfina's and Gialina's! I'm not blaming the restaurant for being popular, though. So if the New York pizza had been better, maybe they'd get 5 stars.  Next time I'll try the Margherita 77, assuming it's not sold out, and if it's as great as (again) expected, then I'll re-review them for 5 stars:D

Visited during early afternoon hours so there was no wait for a table, and pizza came out rather promptly.  Service was polite & efficient, prices were fair, and the pizza was very good (but not great).  I opted for the thin crust, but my neighbor's medium crust looked better with a lot of pillowy tough curled up at the end of the slice.  Cheese had a good flavor and consistency.  Restroom was clean.  Nice spot.

All I have to say is that we were in San Francisco for 3 days, but we ate here twice.  We didn't just eat, we gorged ourselves.  The pizzas were to die for, the calamari and pesto sauce appetizers were excellent.  Service was good both times, but the first night the server accidently charged us for a bottle of wine we hadn't ordered.  Good thing I always try to review my check.  Everyone needs to come and try this place when in SanFrancisco.

This is one really good place. I came here several months ago and did a check in on my phone but I never wrote a review. I uploaded a picture of the Italian nachos I had ordered though and it was freakin amazing. It's not like any other nachos you'll ever order. It's like a thick, fluffy, but crisp bread with nacho toppings but it just has this distinct taste that was so flavorful. I would definitely come back here again if I was ever in the area. They get really busy on weekends and nights but you'll come to see as to why once you try their food. There's seating outside also with heat lamps so it's not so bad.

After living in the city for 4 years and hearing many people yap about this place my daughter and I made our way to North Beach. The service was great! Starting with the host. Like many great restaurants there is usually a wait. The host was very patient and friendly with everyone. They also extend the courtesy of calling you on your cell phone once your table is ready. This is wonderful if you want to wonder around the neighborhood to kill time. My waitress was engaging and prompt. She was could tell you everything from how the dough was made to where there ingredients come from. OHHH...the food was delicious!!! I had the margarita pizza. The crust had and wonderful texture and nice flavor.  We also had the seafood linguine. The sauce was light and very fresh. Tony's will definitely see me again.

You can sit at the pizza counter and watch em make your pie. It's just too good. Drag your New York friends in and watch em melt. Did you even know there was a detroit style pizza!?

have you ever started walking towards your car only to notice that someone is trailing you in their vehicle, stalking you for your parking space?  do they hover inches behind as you slide into the driver's seat, invading your psychological space with unnecessary stress before you even put your car into gear?  and you had so many things you wanted to do before you departed, like adjust your mirrors, check your teeth, reapply your chapstick... but alas your mother raised you to be a gentleman (or lady.)  do unto others as you would have done unto you.  ie.  don't make people waiting for your parking spot to wait any longer lest their heads should explode from anxiety. this is what it feels like when you eat at the bar at tony's pizza napoletana.   be prepared for the hourdes of drooling patrons whose eyes have followed you for for the past hour until your last bite.  watch as their shifty eyes glare at those in proximity who may attempt to take claim to your seat before you even sign the bill.  escape as they battle over your bar stool, arguing entitlement with wait time, their hands clenched and white with determination. you have survived the pizza that is tony's napoletana!  and it is so worth it! must get:  $5 meatball platter must try:  cal italia (fig & proscuitto for those who like salty & sweet) pass:  clam & garlic the crust is to perfection (there are several different categories of crust, be sure to ask.) service is friendly.  crowds are scary.  no reservations.  expect a 45-60 minute wait for two on a friday night.  cab it.

Lets just say that the pizza on the west coast is lame!  Well not here!  Tony's has amazed me every time I come to the city.  I have been to Tony's about 5 times now and it has become a staple for me and my wife in S.F.  We first started to eat at Tony's after reading about it in sunset magazine and found out why, the margarita pizza (only 73 made a day, not sure) is the bizzomb!  Wow, you must try it before ordering any other pizza there.  If they have specials order it, because every special of the day pizza I have ordered is off the hook good.  I have only found a hand full of places on the west coast that do pizza right and I gotta say Tony's is legit.  I have been to NY, and found some of the most amazing pizza and its so hard to find anything that comes that close.  They have 4 different style ovens, and some only take 90 seconds to cook because of the 900 degree oven.  The only other places I can recommend is Hoboken pizza in Pacific Beach in San Diego, and Ollie Pizzeria in Santa Barbara Ca.  Other than that, buy a ticket to NY or Italy.

Tony's Margherita Napolitano won the 2007 world pizza cup in Naples, Italy.  This same pizza wins 4 stars from me. Sitting centrally in North Beach, a neighborhood catering strictly to tourists and where delicious Italian food is ironically extremely hard to find, Tony is trying to fix that.  Healthy douses of olive oil and fresh basil leaves, sprinkles of sea salt, dollopy pools of melted mozarella and fresh out of a wood burning oven imported from Italy, the margherita napolitano immediately beckons all the senses.  Our pie, however, would win no grand prize on this night for the middle had sogged through and I prefer my pizza still firm in the center.  Good flavor, a little obvious on this occasion, but solid four stars for west coast pizza.  Not sure how this place would fare in NYC, maybe a 3-star effort?  Pizza of this caliber is readily available in most of the 5 boroughs. Highly recommend the meatballs, very lightly seasoned and extremely lightly browned and able to marinate in the rich fresh marinara. Gorgonzola, candied walnut, and apple salad was massive.  Four hearty servings, half of which we left on the plate sadly. Skipped the lardo and sardines as we indulged on both of these the night previous across town at Spruce (house made charcuterie and cured blue fish)...  ~sigh~ Back to Tony's, worth it if you're in the neighborhood otherwise not really worth the long lines (we lucked out on bar seats in less than 5 minutes whereas the host quoted 30 minute wait for a table). Blonde bartendress is friendly and super helpful.

Tony's margherita pizza is simply sublime. Super thin crust, flavorful ultra thin yet not doughy but chewy crust, terrific sauce and outstanding mozzarella. The gigante meatballs was the best meatball I have ever had and I grew up in Boston's North End (Little Italy). The salad, bread with dipping oils, wine selection, tiramisu, pannecotta were all worthy of the finest restaurants in the city. Make no mistake, this is much, much more than a pizza joint. One of the best meals we have enjoyed in SF. Come early, prepare to struggle to find parking and come hungry!

Thanks, Yelpers! First time in San Francisco and in love with the city, people and Tony's Pizza Napoletana! Would like to give it a 4.5 stars due to the pushy Host. Gave us a menu and kept saying "So, should I seat you?" The first time was before my friend and I even opened the menu (my friend had not yelped prior.). And, after the second time, he started to walk away with a attitude of "Oh, come on and decide." It was barely 12:15pm...not a mad rush. Anyways...onto the food. Delicious! My friend and I ordered a Burratina  Di Margherita. Which says for 2-3 people. It's more like 3-4 people! Huge! So much cheese!  Crust is thick and chewy. And the Balsamic Vinegar and fresh basil adds so much flavor! Also tried the Caesar salad. The Parmigiano..delicious as well! Wish I lived closer to so that I could continue trying the different pizzas/styles. A lot of them sounded amazing!

+1 Star for a great location (including outside seating) +1 for a stellar menu with options for every pizza lover -1 for slow service on a Sunday afternoon (took us over 10 minutes just to get our drinks) +1 for the focaccia bread with dip that's served as you arrive +3 For the Cal Italia Pizza - talk about all the right ingredients coming together for an orgasmic pizza experience!! Seriously the Sweet Fig preserve from Croatia took this pizza from really good to an exploding orgasm of flavor bursting in your mouth! +1 for the Margherita pizza (it was just as described, floppy and full of flavor) -1 for forgetting our order of meatballs -1 for having to ask 3 times for a side of ranch (yes I dip my pizza in ranch, get over it!) +1 for a deliscious, and healthy serving size, of the Little Italy salad -1 for being a little on the pricey side ($78 for 2 pizza's, salad, & 2 glasses of house wine....a little much for lunch) Grand Total= 4 stars. Well deserved!

2 stars for our bartender because he was awesome..but did not say goodbye before leaving...in terms of food- we had the margherita and the salsiccia con treviso (honey sausage) and they were just alright..the dough was REALLY doughy and soggy...I like my dough more crispy..I love delfina...if you feel the same way..chances are you probably will not love this pizza...

I went here on Wednesday night with my husband and 7 yr old daughter. I chose to eat here solely on the Yelp reviews. What a huge mistake. My daughter's cheese pizza was disgusting, the cheese would separate from the crust and would ball up like a piece of gum! Our pizza was super oily and the toppings were just average. We spent $90 for the 3 of us!!! unbelievable! Never again.

This is probably the best pizza that you can get on the west coast that is New York style thin crust.  Just amazing the bread is thin the ingredients are at the right proportion.  Not to much cheese, not too much sauce, it blends they have it down.  The basic margharita is the way to go.

Awesome Pie, long waits, damm good meat balls, Best Margherita, the Alba Truffle pie comes out to be 15 bucks per slice if you have a group of 6, not much truffle but then again the pie is only 90 bucks. Go to TFL spend 150 per plate if you want loads of it :-). I would totally come back this spot is far better than his original spot in Castro Valley.

I went to Tony's for the second time in about four months today. Visions - or more like stomach sensations - of their Cal Italia pizza have danced in my senses for quite some time since the first time I had it. The first time we went we were a party of four. I really liked it, but decided writing a Yelp review was a pointless waste of time because everything had probably already been said. The four of us gourmands, that night, ordered four pizzas from across Tony's spectrum including two napoletana style, one sicilian (Pesto Sauce, Chopped Garlic, Ricotta, Cherry Tomato, Fresh Basil, Goat Cheese, Roasted Pine Nuts, Parmigiano) and one traditional. They were all excellent, although I must say I prefer my pizza toppings to be liberally scattered in small bits rather than intermittently applied in large chunks. That is an American thing I'm sure. For example. Osteria del Forno has one of my favorite pizzas, their porcini mushroom pizza. In the past - say 10 years ago - they would put very small bits of porcini, garlic and parsley all over the pizza so the different flavors were strongly infused and you got a little in each bite. Now, they put big chunks of porcini all over the pizza, which I don't like as much. This is splitting hairs though and I'm now talking about a completely different restaurant. At Tony's, I've had the Cal Italia, the Puttanesca, the "star" Margherita with tomato and basil, and the green sicilian with basilico and fresh tomato. Of those four I was most ambivalent about the puttanesca. It was simply too similar to the other napoletana pizzas I think, and there was also the forementioned small bits factor. That time, we ended up taking some home, and the one which thrilled the most after the fact was the Cal Italia (Asiago, Mozzarella, Imported Italian Gorgonzola, Sweet Fig preserve from Croatia, Prosciutto di Parma, Parmigiano, Balsamic), given one's propensity to enjoy cold / room temp pizza in the morning given the chance. It's the perfect hearty breakfast snack. The very salty but delicate prosciutto with the asiago and fig preserve is just perfect, and the crust has a lot of structure but isn't too doughy. Today I did notice an absence of balsamic drizzle when it came to the table. Perhaps it was under the cheese, perhaps not. The staff at Tony's are exceptionally nice. I don't always know what to expect when I go someplace alone, but I sat outside on a stellar day taking up a four top, and the wait staff were encouraging me to stay and relax. Everyone who works there seems genuinely happy. Not only does Tony's have very good pizza but it's also an excellent, well-run restaurant with fantastic service.

Update: Still the best pizza in the city by far. Plan on putting in your name and then grab a drink or two in the hood. Never had any problem with the front of the house...

Well, I was definitely expecting more. Here are the pro's and con's. Pros-Fresh, good service, plenty options for a meat eater. Cons-super dooper cramped!, limited options for a vegetarian (even with the pizzas you'll have to settle), Super runny marinana! the sauce just dribbles off the pizza no matter how carefully we tried to hold a slice, extremely pricey! My friend and I were so excited due to the reviews & we get there and r told it's a 40min wait. We luckily scrambled a seat at the bar or we would have left all together since it was 48 degrees out. We ordered appetizers to tide us over for 40 min and bam! Suddenly a magical table opens up and now we had 2 appetizers coming we would not had otherwise ordered. The gorgonzola fries were great, but it is now 16 hours later and both of us are so parched from them that I'd never get them again. The Little Italy salad was good. The table they gave us was so tiny that anytime they brough something we had to do puzzle work to try and fit it. I wanted a pizza that apparently had no cheese & since that would defy the entire point I had the waiter suggest something else with no meat. I was getting the first because it was veggie and for this place, inexpensive. I ignorantly assumed he was suggesting a special that was close to the price range I was gonna order, so I didn't think to ask. Our bill comes and that pizza, which wasn't even tasty was $21! Just for me. The other pizza we got was the Margherrita (or however it's spelled) and that was like $17. Our bill for just 2 humans was $75! We both almost fainted, I have never been that shocked over a bill. Their pizzas are very expensive & fresh or not...OT even worth it. Will not return. Far too many other options around every corner there to go back.

the margherita pizza really is that good.  if he only makes 73 a day, you know you have to get it.   we came here last night before watchinwicked, so we were fairly early.  when we walked in at 6, the party before us got the last table, so we decided to sit at the bar, which was empty.  within 10 minutes, the place was packed to the gills.  our bartendar was super nice, and the place has great cocktails.   we started w/ the side of spinach and the deep fried green beans.  then the star of the show arrived...the margherita.  the crust was crispy yet super chewy, and the sauce was soo good.  i'm sure it helped that there was a swig of olive oil on the pie, but hey, olive oil is good for you, right?  the 2 of us devoured the entire pizza w/in about 10 minutes.   i can't wait to come back and try more pizzas...or maybe i should just stick w/ the margherita, if it's available.

I dunno, Yelpers, I don't think I can agree with you on this one. The pizza at Tony's was full of great, fresh flavors but the crust got soggy. Like cheese slides off the slice because the crust droops to the floor soggy. The highlight of our meal were the meatballs. Big, round, well-seasoned balls of beef topped with amazingly fresh tomato sauce. Pair that with some pasta and who needs pizza? Service was a bit sloppy. While I enjoyed our waiter's thick Italian accent, he forgot to put in our order of calamari and rarely checked up on us throughout the meal. All in all, not worth the wait and not worth the trek to NB. Beretta is still far superior!

Review of Italian Beef @ Tony's As a Chicago-ian, I was sooo excited to hear that there is a place that serves Italian Beefs in the city.  My Chicago friends of mine, all who are transplants to SF, got together and went to enjoy some iBeefs... Two Words: MAJORLY DISAPPOINTED The Italian Beef was horrid... Taste = Below Average. The Bread was just NOT Authentic... The Beef was NOT Authentic and was horrible.  I cook Italian Beefs at home and I would say my recipe is 100x's better than Tony's Italian Beef.  Mmmm.. Maybe I should open a Italian Beef Stand. If your looking for a Italian Beef sammich, do not go here... Trust me!  Either go to Chicago and/or go to Da Beef in SOMA. Thanks, but no thanks Tony...  Two Thumbs Down

Tonys rocks, this place turns out an awesome variety of pies and gnabs the top SF pizza spot in my book, edging out  Gialinas and Delfina. Do it right and order 2 pies-the new Yorker and the wild robiola. The new Yorker is my stand by meaty heaven opus of pepperoni, fennel sausage, ricotta chunks, and sauce on top of coal fired crust goodness. The wild robiola is our new infatuation of truffle oil, speck, porcini mushrooms and other greens. Skip the overated award winning margherita. It's a popular place so we find weekend afternoons or late night dinners the best times for avoiding a wait. Good beer list. Summertime dining on the sidewalk overlooking washington square park with pies, beer, and our pup can't be beat.

I love Italian beef sandwiches, and the fact that you can't get one in San Francisco is a travesty. Sadly, Tony's does not adequately fill this void. The bread has a thick, tough crust, and there's too much of it. The meat is flavorful, but dry. It should be soaking in juice! And there weren't enough peppers. What it lacks in taste it makes up in heft, which it better at $8. Not worth the tradeoff, however. Sadly, the search for a decent Italian beef continues.

Last night my friend and I were looking for a nice casual place to grab some dinner and this place was actually recommended to us. Upon arrival we originally put our name on the wait list but ended up eating at the bar. Sometimes the bar can feel really crowded, but this one was much more spacious due to the larger chairs and counter, so we were able to thoroughly enjoy our meal without feeling like we were on top of our neighbors. So start we both had a glass of the sparkling red wine which was so good that I ended up having a second glass. Then we ordered the calamari which was pretty good, I wouldn't say it was the best I've ever had, but it was still good. Then we split the famous Margherita pizza which was delicious. I LOVE thin crust pizza and the toppings were so fresh and delicious! I would definitley recommend this pizza! They are serious when they say that they only sell 73 of them because we ordered one of the last ones! We overheard the bartender telling a couple that they were no longer serving the famous margherita because they had hit the 73 mark. (If you're wondering why 73, the story behind it is on the menu). Overall the pizza was definitely delicious, and I would recommend sitting at the bar if you're solo or plus one because the bartenders are very nice and helpful.

This was forcefully (not to be mistaken for unwanted force) recommended to us by our cab driver today. The food was amazing. We had the truffle oil margarita pizza and gorgonzola salad. The food was beyond fantastic. The problem however lacked in the service. It literally took us more than 15 minutes just to get a water. And despite asking for the check, that still took us 15 more minutes. When we were done with things such as our salad being finished, instead of picking up the plate, they would just shove it aside and put something else down, causing a crowd on the table. Granted, the food was 5 starts, the service seriously needs help.

Had the award wining margherita and the meatballs. The pizza knocked my socks off - perhaps the best crust I have ever had. I could eat the crust all day everyday. The ratio of cheese to sauce to crust was also just right. On our pie, we had just the right portion of basil as well. This is pretty incredible pizza. Go eat one now. The meatballs were excellent too - a large portion of about seven giant meatballs for $5. The marinara was a touch on the salty side for me. According to the bartender they have only been open for 13 days. The service was really stellar for just getting started. The only hiccup was the prediction for our wait. The hostess said 25 minutes. We walked around for about 40 and came back and there were still several groups ahead of us. We ended up sitting at the bar, which was great because the bartender was charming and a real pro. The transformation of pizza in SF over the past couple years has been incredible. We are so lucky! We went from a 2nd class pizza city to a world class pizza city! Thanks Tony!

I want to make this short so you don't waste time reading when you could be at Tony's having pizza.  One word?  Fabulous.  Amazing.  Un-freaking-believable.  How's that?  First visit, we got right in (unheard of) at 6:15 on a Saturday because we were just two people and they happened to have a 2 seater.  We had a great view of the oven and Tony, the owner/pizza maestro.  The Truffle pizza was Tony's recommendation and he was right...it was out of this world.  AND the meatballs, recommended to me by the owner of a pizzeria in Berkeley, were amazing as well.    Can I go again tonight?  I'm saving the clam & garlic to have with my husband -- it's New Haven style and I have a feeling he's going to LOVE it.

I've now been to all the top rated pizza places in the Bay Area. Tony's is very good, but others are better.  I can,  however, easily see how others would love this place.  I completely disagree with other reviewers who complained about the service. We had GREAT service even though the place was very busy. I would have given it a solid 4 stars, but it's a little on the expensive side for pizza.

Even more special than saying, "Gods gift to Pizza", this is "Pizza's gift to God".  Seriously, this place is nearly perfect and about the best thing you can get outside of Italy.  I recommend the Jersey Style and Margaurita.  Overall, the crust was excellent and sauce perfect.  I did not find the cheese to be that delightfully soft Buffalo Mozz - like I had in Naples a few years ago.  Service was great - but get there early because the line is very long.  Also, the Marguarita pizza's take 90 seconds to cook, so time your meal accordingly and eat it while it is hot.

The short short version:  fancy, expensive pizza. The longer version: First, know that Tony's is crazy popular.  Expect a wait if you're showing up during typical dinner time. Second, know that they have a full bar.  This can ameliorate the waiting quite effectively (though it'll probably also be crowded).  Luckily, if the bar's full, they take your phone number and call you when your table's ready, so you can walk next door to Tony Nik's and have a nice cocktail in peace and comfort. They've got a bunch of appetizers, many of which are pretty tempting.  Don't be tempted by the Calamari.  It's typically fried, but was sadly tough and chewy. The cheezy garlic bread on the other hand is delicious.  The fried green beans were also fantastic - very, very lightly fried just to crispiness, with great seasoning and a shit ton of olive oil. Pizza: The focus is thin crust, though they do offer some Sicilian as well which we didn't try. The World Pizza Cup Winning Margherita, that they only make 73 of a day?  Eh.  Kinda ordinary, really.  I wasn't particularly impressed with any part of it, and thought it was slightly overcooked, as the cheese had started to brown and gotten a little chewy.  Delfina wins this battle hands down. Quail Egg with Speck: brilliant.  I'm normally a believer that any pizza without tomato sauce isn't real pizza, but some kind of abomination.  This pizza could convince me otherwise.  The richness of flavor the egg added was astounding, and blended perfectly with the crispness of the crust and the fresh leafy greens. Bronx - NY style with salami: good enough, though not really anything amazing.  Some of my East Coast originating compatriots complained that there wasn't enough crust handle around the edge to qualify for true NY style. Original Tomato Pie - NJ style, with Italian sausage: fucking incredible.  First, I have to mention that I didn't even know there WAS a Jersey-specific style of pizza.  Can't say I'm surprised, but still.  The main differences seem to be a slightly thicker, richer, more paste-like tomato sauce than their other pizzas, and significantly more of it.  This was a seriously sauced pizza!  I love a lot of sauce on my pizza (my biggest complaint is usually insufficient sauce), and godDAMN this was good.  The sausage was incredible also.  This is one of life's most perfect pizzas, and the only pizza other than the Quail Egg one that I'd go back for. They've also got a nice Italian focused wine list, including a few selections available by the carafe and half-carafe, but they're pretty pricey - our half was $26, though it was very good. But the real pricey things are the pizzas: they're all in the $15-20 range and serve maybe 1.5 people each.  It's very easy to walk out having spent over $30 each, so be aware of that even though it's a pizza joint. The restaurant itself is surprisingly big and bright, and has some outdoor seating as well under heat lamps.  Service is prompt, friendly, very knowledgeable and efficient.

It was raining cats and dogs tonight, but Liz and I were determined to get to TPN in the middle of North Beach.  We scored a stone's throw parking spot and a "signore bello" even offered to pay for our meter.  Hmmmm...good omen.  So far so good.   Stood in line and was politely whisked to "Tony's Counter".  Hmmmm....good omen (again).  Time to buy a lottery ticket?  Yeah, it was like sitting behind home plate or the front roll at a concert.  We got to watch Tony and his side chef diligently prepare works of art on their canvas made of dough, put them into the oven and in minutes ... voilà!!! ... mouth watering masterpieces were created.  Every pie that came out looked distinctly dddddddddddddddde-licious.  OMG... what are we going to order?  We wanted one of everything that was coming out of the oven.  Since it was Liz's first time at TPN, Donna (our super kick ass server) suggested the Margherita with a prize winning chewy dough.  (I could still taste it as I write. Can I call it al dente?  It has such a yummy distinct chewy bite.)  We told Tony we wanted a thin crusted pizza like the pies in New York.   So, he made a complimentary (sooooo kindly sweeeeet.  Whata doll!)  NY pizza pie that he wanted us to try.  I've had a lot of pies in my life (in the USA & Italy), but I never had one like this.  The cheese was on the thin crust and topped with an aromatic oregano herbed tomato sauce.  It was like an upside down pie. Both pizzas were to-die-for.  Tony only uses the finest and freshest ingredients, passion and TLC in his food. Honorable mentions (clap clap clap) go to the gorgonzola & apple salad and the moist limone torta topped with pistachios.  We were happily stuff to the gills and can't wait to return to try the clam & garlic pizza and then the fig, gorgonzola & prosciutto pizza and then the.... :)!  TPN a must try.  Go with no expectations except that your palette will be satisfied on the corner of Stockton and Union in the City by the Bay.  Buon appetito!  Mille grazie, Tony and crew.  You guys rock!

Probably the most Italian thing here is the shadiness of the management. After listening to my companions rave about the pizza here for the hour-plus wait (ok, it's a popular SF location, I can handle that), we were dismayed to find that they weren't serving their special anymore (I guess they limit them to 73 per day...odd, maybe arbitrary, but ok - fine). We were then offered a LESSER pizza (doesn't come with the wood-aged dough)...for the SAME price as the special. OK, that's a little weird. It only got worse. My friends ordered a half carafe of a Barbera red wine - when it came, they knew immediately that it wasn't the wine they ordered. It tasted like grapes fresh off the vine. They asked the waitress about it, and basically insisted that she bring them the bottle to look at and have a taste from. She came back 10 minutes later saying they had "just run out". Hmmm. So they basically tried to pawn off some cheap jug wine as a bottle of 10 year old Barbera? Something was definitely up with this place. My friends then asked to have the crap wine replaced with a half carafe of a Chianti, which was cheaper than the original Barbera...and far better tasting than the mystery wine. However, when the bill arrived...they charged them for the Barbera! OKAAAY...then when we raised it with our waitress (who, to her credit was patient and sweet and accomodating the entire time), she said we should just take the difference OUT OF HER TIP instead of asking her to raise it with the manager. WTF? Apparently the management at this place treats their employees so poorly that they are actually afraid to report to them that the rip-off scheme didn't work this time and could they please reverse the charge. I got the distinct impression that this kind of thing was regular practice there, and we insisted that the charge be reversed. So in sum: the shady, corrupt service, poor treatment of employees AND customers, unevenly cooked overpriced pizza (oh yes, soggy middle, I mean you), lame-ass Ed Hardy pizza box that isn't actually meant to be used for pizza (am I supposed to frame this?) = One Star, and shame on you, Tony. Oh yeah, and they didn't even offer any Italian beers.

We used to go to Tony's restaurant in Castro Valley. When we opened the menu we realized, "We're not in Castro Valley anymore." We've been there twice now. I never knew pizza could be so fancy. First time there we had a truffle pizza that tasted amazing. Second time, the truffle was off the menu. But, we had so many other great options to choose from! The place is hot. So, plan on waiting for a table and then be prepared to be in a loud and busy room while you eat. Still, lots of fun.

I'm not sure why everyone is raving about this place. Now, I love pizza. All kinds of Pizza- Meat, Vegetarian, Pesto (my fav), Chicago style, New York style, and just plain old cheese style. I was excited to try this place since I moved to the area about a month ago. After trying their award winning pizza -the margherita- I was sadly disappointed. I came and picked it up right on time, and when I got home two minutes later, the pizza was cold. After heating it up myself, I was again disappointed. The pizza wasn't that good and for 21 dollars for a medium size pie- I was shocked. Sure, you can tell the oils it was cooked in was a great add-on, but it definitely wasn't worth the price. I suggest going around the corner to Golden Boy's where one slice (brick) can fill you up and its 10 times better. Easily. And Cheap.

How does a place that tells you that you have a one hour wait, and when that wait is over, that it will just be another 5 minutes, and in the end the total wait is over two hours get 5 stars?  Because the pizza is that good, honestly as good as any I've had.  The service was good, the pizza was great and the atmosphere was fun.  I don't know if I'd ever wait two hours for pizza again, but their by the slice place on the side is a must...

Best pizza I've had maybe ever!   We started out going somewhere else, but decided to eat here instead because it had 10 x as many people.  We had Ceasar salad, which was delicious! And the Margherita pizza.  I swear we fought over the last slice!  And they had Dogfish Head Beer!  Who could ask for more.  Can't wait to go back..

If you are a pizza fan, this is definitely a place to visit at least once. It is above average southern Italian style - great tomato sauce on there classic margherita. We will go back to try other flavors which friends say are even better, but you gotta try their classic one. One pizza is medium diameter and very thin, so for two diners we noticed others having one classic and one of another flavor. Staff were great. Not a fan of the black decor. Not a cozy place in that way.

I had luke warm expectations for this place.  An old friend and foodie had been trying to get me to come here with him for months.  But for some reason, pizza just didn't really seem enticing after a long day's work in the financial district.  All I ever really want to do is battle my way home on BART, have a glass of wine, and eat something less ordinary.  I know... I'll try hard not to be so closed minded now.  Long story short, I finally went.... I complained a little on the way, ... But let me tell you... the award winning prosciutto & fig thing they whipped up for us (the Cal Italia)... paired with an amazing $9.50 glass of red, was basically an orgasm in my mouth.  (okay, stop imagining something gross.)  But really... this is EASILY one of the places I will crave and favorite as long as that piece of heaven stays on the menu. We had the award winning margharita too... and it was delish... but what I really want now that I'm finally writing this review, is what I described above.  So now you must go.  And when you do, please take me with!

This is some of the best pizza in the city. In the heart of North Beach, the location couldn't get any better. The food, also, couldn't get any better. Their specialty is their Margherita pizza. It was really good, but not the best margherita i have ever had. A job well done, nonetheless. However, the New Yorker pizza made up for whatever they lost on the margherita. Topped with sausage, ricotta cheese, and a plethera of other toppings, this melted in your mouth and made you beg for more. It would be a sin to miss this one.

I read about Tony's in Food & Wine magazine, and it certainly lived up to my expectations. We got the cup-winning Margerhita. The crust is light & airy, the tomato sauce simple yet deliciously flavorful, and the cheese is cheesy like all cheese. I appreciate the many choices of pizza styles they have available, and plan to return to try them all.

A gorgeous Sunday afternoon in SF, and we were jonesin' for some authentic Neapolitan pizza.  Our quest began last fall when we returned from a trip to Italy, and our taste for pizza was spoiled forever by the pie we consumed in Naples.  It was life changing.  Truly.  We have tried to find a pizza like the heavenly one that we had on our trip, tasting pizzas that claim to rival their Italian counterparts, but have been disappointed.  Until now.   We intentionally arrived a touch before the dinner rush, taking advice that there can be quite a wait.  We timed it just right, and were seated at a comfortable booth without waiting for more than five minutes.  Our waitress was quick to let us know that she would be right with us as she was delivering drinks and taking orders at other tables.  I couldn't wait to ask if we had arrived in time to order one of the 73 limited Margherita pizza's, and thankfully we were.   In total we ordered: Salumi & Formaggio $11 ~ Served on a wooden cheese board, nice size for the price and tasty but would have been nice to have someone tell us what we were eating? Deep Fried String Beans $7 ~  Really good - crunchy, not greasy and with just the right amount of fresh garlic. Spinach Salad $10 ~ w/Goat Cheese, Pine Nuts, Red Onion, Balsamic Reduction, Olive Oil.  Really large salad, but overall nothing to write home about.  We had just a few bites and decided it wasn't worth ruining our appetites. Margherita $18 ~ This was a truly amazing pizza, photo attached.  The crust was very thin, perhaps too charred in some spots but that was forgivable knowing that the inferno of an oven makes this crust amazing.  The sauce is to die for, it tasted exactly like the delectable tomato goodness in Naples.  Just the right amount of fresh basil leaves on top.  The cheese used is the only let down over the pie in Naples.  The Mozzarella Fior di Latte on the limited availability pie is made from cows milk, and the one that wowed us in Italy is mozzarella di bufala campana.  Next time I'll see if it is possible to order the STG Pizza Napoletana with the bufala instead.  I have a feeling that will make this the ultimate pizza. I will definitely be back to Tony's to try the multitude of artisan pizzas on the menu as well as to try the STG with bufala.  I'll update if I've found my pizza nirvana, as another trip to Europe is not in the budget anytime soon.   Tony and staff ~ Grazie molto!

I'm in love. I have a new pizza passion. I am in trouble. The hubby and I stopped in on the 4th for some pizza action. The place was jammin. We would have attributed it to the holiday,however we'd walked by the past few days and every day the place was jam packed. So today we went in ready for the wait. We scored some prime seats at the bar. Ordered some cocktails and their fried green beans. Yum. Both were tasty. We got a table about 20 min later. What a great pizza menu. NY style, italian style, sicilian style, um, a few others too I'm not really doing it justice. I loved the little descriptoins of how they differ and whats different about the ovens their baked in. Very informative. We went with a classic NY style and just gobbled it up. the sauce was super fresh with zing, crust was perfect, all the toppings were great. The only way they could improve would be to have a few more beers on tap. But the pizza was perfect. We will be back again and again. Thank goodness that corner of Union and Stockton finally has someplace that looks like it will stick around for the long haul.

My experience here was pretty disappointing.  Went solely based on the great reviews and expected "Wow" and instead got "blech."  Tried the Margherita Extra which came with burnt basil and was generally off-tasting.  Also had the Sicilian Style Colombo and I wouldn't have been surprised if someone told me Pizza Hut made the dough.  But the manager and our server were both very nice so 2 stars for that...now I need a Zachary's fix.

Tony's isn't just the best pizza in the city, but it may be the best pizza I've ever had! This restaurant is the ideal pizza place for me. Different types of pizzas, ovens, flour and toppings. The salads were delicious to start with as were the wings. We decided on three pizzas to share; the fennel sausage, the new yorker and the famous Margherita. The fennel sausage was sweet and went nice with the caramelized onions. It was real good, but the least favorite of the bunch. THe new yorker was the perfect pizza. Light crispy crust, sausage and pepperoni. And finally the Margherita; it's safe to say that this was one of the best pizzas I've ever had. I usually don't order margherita pizzas because they are always a little boring. The combination of perfect cheese, perfect crust and perfect sauce made this pizza truly something special. What amazed me was that there was no grease anywhere. To top off the meal, their house rootbeer was Henry Weinharts in a bottle which is the ideal drink for delicious pizza. Overall Tony's is the place to come for phenomenal pizza. Whenever I'm  in the city, Tony's will be the first on my list.

We happened to be walking through nb last night looking to grab a quick bite before an appointment.  We wanted to eat at Tony's but the line was out the door...as usual.  Anyway, as we were walking by to find somewhere else to eat we noticed an open doorway right next door to Tony's main dining room, with counters full of freshly made pizza pies...the windows were covered in butcher paper, but we walked in anyway (the sight and smells of the fresh pies were too hard to resist)...the counter was fully stocked with both kitchen staff and food.  Walking in we asked if they were open yet, but unfortunately they were not. The man in the front area invited us in anyway and offered us some food!  Just our luck!  They apparently were doing a soft test launch prior to opening their walk up take out counter next week!  The kind man who welcomed us in was noneother than Tony himself! Anyway, the pizza was absolutely simple, uncomplicated, and straightforward.  Beautiful, clean sauce with just a hint of fresh herbs and clean, sweetness from the tomatoes.  The crust is slightly crispy on the outside, with just enough elasticity and bite when chewing through the crust.  Exactly how pizza is supposed to be.  Not dense, or dry but just right.  In addition, Tony is trying to bring a Chicago staple to the bay area.  ITALIAN BEEF!  I'm sure some of you may have heard of or even tried it, but for some reason, it really hasn't caught on here on the left coast.  Hell, if you can bring a Pittsburgh style sandwich to SF (Giordano Brothers), Stuffed Deep Dish (Zach's or Paxti's) why not an Italian Beef sandwich (Portillo's, Johnnie's, Bueno Beef -  for you Chicago transplants out there)?  Being from Chicago, Tony's is a valiant attempt.  The beef is very well seasoned, and apparently is broiled in their coal ovens.  The beef/roast gravy added just the right touch of moisture and spice to the beef of the sandwich.  Their pepper giardiniera is apparently brought in from Chicago.  Careful folks, their hot giardiniera packs a serious punch.  The only miss is the bread.  The crust is a bit too tough for my Chicago beef standards. I think it may have something to do with the water.  You can't beat a true Italian roll in Chicago from the Turano bakery.  If u are from Chicago you know what I mean. Regardless.  This will be an absolute treasure in NB, and will absolutely kill every other place in the hood.  I will be back, and back, and back!  BTW, the staff there was awesome.... Mmmmmmm.  Italian beef and za!

This place is clearly overrated. 1. After eating pizza all over the country and in Italy, I can honestly say that it neither resembles East coast or Italian. Both pizzas were overcooked, sauce was terrible and bitter 2. The positioning of the dive bar style restrooms which open up to the main restaurant makes the whole place smell less than appetizing.

Why does it seem like every good pizza place in the City is closed for the holiday season? While searching for an alternative to Gialina Pizzeria, I came upon Tony's Pizza Napoletana. How can I not try pizza made by a 9 time world pizza champion? After reading about the fresh and imported ingredients and the authentic wood fired oven, I was excited to  come try authentic rustic pizza. I just prayed that the famous margherita would still be around by the time dinner rolled around. We had a huge party of ten coming so I knew getting a table would be difficult. They didn't take reservations either so I was skeptical if we would eat here at all. Luckily, we were seated after half an hour which is nothing compared to the hour plus wait other people had to endure. Sadly, they were out of the margherita so we had to settle for ordering the margherita extra, which differed only in the type of dough. We also got a New York special along with two Cal Italias. If you are hungry, these rustic pizzas will not be enough to feed a hungry group. But they were nice enough to slice the pizzas into ten to give everybody a taste of each pizza. The New York special came out first. It was average and I didn't care too much for the burnt crust, but the sausage was pretty good. Next was the margherita extra, which I was pretty excited about. Unfortunately, all of my toppings fell off when I went in for a slice and disappeared onto someone else's slice. I was sad, but I got to taste part of the delicious tomato sauce that was left. The dough and crust was really good. Last came the Cal Italia, a Food Network gold medal winner. The sweet fig, prosciutto, and balsamic really worked well together to give it that sweet and savory balance in flavors. I think some parts had sweeter fig preserves than others and it overpowered some of the other flavors, but overall it was a good pizza. Pizza was good, but sizes weren't great for groups. You're really paying for quality ingredients and authentic rustic pizza. I must return with a smaller party and try that original margherita pizza one day.

The margherita pizza (w/ sausage, per our server's recommendation) was the juciest, best 15 minutes of "pizza heaven" i've had in a while. (although I recently pledged my allegiance for little star).  The pizza had a slighty salty taste to it, which was different and delicious at the same time.  The tomato sauce had the right balance of bitter and sweet.The salami was platter was decent, but next time we'll probably try the calamari.  Moreover, heated sidewalk patio seating made this a great "sunday funday" lunch meal.

We eat here a couple of times a month.  First, I do suggest that you eat here first before doing any take-out.  Some of the options don't travel well - you want to eat that wood-fired, thin crust pizza right after it comes out of the oven.  My favorite flavor is "The New Yorker," my son loves the pepperoni (which is real, hand-stuffed pepperoni) and my daughter loves the sausage (fennel and all).  My husband loves all the flavors and also always orders the rosemary garlic french fries. The atmosphere is casual although it can get loud.  If you have kids, try dining before 6:30PM.

Michael Bauer has reviewed the place. http://bit.ly/xguyr Rave review with only 2.5 stars. Lord knows how he rates restaurants, but I am on with five stars on Yelp. Went there last night again. Talked a little to Tony, had an amazing Ward 8 from Nobel, the bar manager (he made his own pomegranate juice, which was to die for), shared another truffle pie (don't tell my nutritionist!), and throughly enjoyed the evening, even though we had to wait more than an hour for our table. (Had fun at the bar at Joe Dimaggio's across the street; Carrey, the bartender, actually lives above Tony's Napoletana.) The only question is how many times will I have to go before I try something besides the truffle pizza!

Finally made it over to North Beach to try this place.  This is the slice place next to the restaurant - what a great idea.  The slices are thin and look like what I think a NY style slice should look like.  I went for my usual cheese which was $3.50 for a slice.  Not made fresh but they do a very brisk business so the slice was in good shape - good size though not huge, oregano integrated into the cheese, crispy crust, good ratio of cheese and sauce, good sauce, I really enjoyed it.  A couple tables inside, a couple tables outside.   Just soft drinks.

Came here by chance with a group of  6. Sat outside ona  beautiful sunny Saturday. They sure do have a nice selection of different ingredients and pizza sizes. Very interesting set of styles but we ended up eating the Margherita with the Rustic medium crust. the waiter said it was a world cup winner and that comes out in 90 secs, and we were hungry so we went with that. I guess with that said, i had super high hopes of this pizza blowing my pumas off my feet but when it came out...i can say it was good and tasty but so good where i would keep coming back and make this my pizza mecca in SF. Sad to say, i enjoyed the bread and oil dips more. Im sure they won that award for a reason but for me, it was A-OK. I will give them another run and probably get a different style of pizza.

I really liked Tony's - the best pizza we got was definitely the Cal Italia.  They had just sold out of the limited Margherita so we missed out on that (next time!).  The sicilian style pizza was good but I'd say stick to the thin crust and leave the sicilan style for a trip to golden boy.  We also ordered some apps and wine; we got the calamari and they did a combo for a us so we could try both styles of calamari which was nice.  Be careful if you order the truffle pizza - upon ordering we found out it was ~$50!!!  And you could also be faced with a long wait so try to time accordingly :-)

Possibly the best pizza you can find in SF! here they really give the impression to know what they are doing: my world awarded Margherita pizza was excellent, even though a little bit different from a traditional Napolitan pizza (which usually doesn' t have a perfectly round shape and has both fiordilatte and buffalo mozzarella on it). Anyway, absolute top! The service is also great! I'll be back and back and back again ...

This place is over-hyped. Last Sat the wait was long (45 min.) when we arrived and bordering on the absurd (2 hours) when we left. Yes, the pizza is good, although too much on the chewy/rubbery side for my taste. I still prefer the thin-crust, crispy pies from Pizza Antica or Delfina. Cheapest glass of red wine is $8.50. No thanks. Service was gracious, even though they have tables outdoor in the cold fog (?!?) and tried to seat the 5 of us there at a table that clearly could accomodate only 4 people. However, they quickly found us a table inside. Pizzas are quite large and can feed two.

So, Tony is evidently leaving the pizza biz behind to go into the jazz club business.  They were kicking paying diners out at 9 pm on a holiday weekend night to empty the place out to make it into some music club.  Did Tony win some competition for jazz clubs that makes this a good business decision for him?  I think not!  If you want pizza, you have to go to a place that will serve you a damn pizza.  Not someplace that wants to play tunes for you while you starve.  Never again!

First off, I will start off by saying I have already been here 4-5 times in the last month and a half, and I don't live in the city.  Yesterday, I stopped by her with my girlfriend and it was better than ever.  The drinks from the bar were innovative and tasty, and the food was out of this world. We have not been disappointed once here but I would definitely recommend the Margherita Pizza.  A thin, crunchy crust with a taste of the wood used to cook it baked right into the crust, and the freshest ingredients I have ever tasted since I was back in Italy. This does not overshadow any of the other great food:  SALADS with sweet balsamic vinegar that accentuates every bite, LASAGNA that has a pop of tomato and cheese that dances on your taste buds, and GREAT Sicilian pizza with a crust that is crunchy (no matter if it is a center or end piece). Lastly,  the bartenders and Tony himself are amazing.  Extremely friendly, helpful, and will to take a few minutes out to just chat about food or whatever.  The service has always been quick and friendly, and as stated above, this does not eclipse the quality of the food in the slightest! Thank you Tony and I hope to be a regular as long as you are around!

Nothing special at top-dollar prices. I was strongly advised to order two pizzas when I would have more than sufficed. Frankly, I resented the hard-sell and won't be back.

I won't go back despite the fact that the the pizza is as good as described by many others.  Lame servers with bad attitudes. I liked the guy who put the pizza in the oven and served it to me, shouting with a Brooklyn accent, Yo, Slice of cheese. Owner - do yourself a favor, fire the bitchy servers who stand around and blab among themselves while patrons wait with cash in hand to order and pay.

Best pizza I've had in my life so far! We had the margherita and the new yorker. Both were delicious. The sauces were very different on each pizza and obviously hand made. Each pizza had its pros and cons but the world champion remains supreme (margherita) =)

I got the crispy thin crust and my BF ordered the gluten free pizza.  Unfortunately the were out of GF crust but they had gluten free pasta so that was OK.  My pizza was very good and we got a salad to go with everything and it was out of this world.  All very yummy.  Next time in San Fran this place is a must to revisit.

The pizza here is very good and there are a ton of choices. A word of caution, there are so many choices, it is a bit overwhelming. We ordered a few different types, not knowing what each was. I recommend having your server explain the differences so you end up with something you really like. Great food.

Tony's may not be for somebody with an adventurous palate, in search for the latest trendy topping combination or inspirational, unconventional mix of pizza ingredients.  Rather, Tony's excels at the tried and true classics and it's hard not to consider this joint one of the best pizza places in SF solely for the mastery of these simple and timeless types of pies.  Their Margharita pizza is the best in the city.  The sausage pizza is close behind.  If you're looking for that egg pizza with middle eastern spices topped with Nettle, this isn't your place.  If you're looking for the perfect, no-frills, quintessential Margharita made from DOCG flour, it's worth the often lengthy wait for a table.

Okay so I first heard of Tony's through a coworker who's husband was apparently raving about this place.  That wasn't really enough for me to brave the parking in North Beach so I put it in the back of my mind.  Then when I was judging at the Boss of Sauce contest, I tasted the most amazing sauce and later found out it was from Tony's.  Unfortunately they didn't win the contest (they were robbed!) but came quite close for a first-time contender.  So yes, I am ashamed, I first came to Tony's to eat the pasta, not the pizza. So then the first time that we came, there was a line already waiting outside before the place opened.  That was my first sign that I was about to experience something great.  Then when I came in, I got to meet Tony who I'd seen on the Food Network and he was even nice enough to take a picture with me by the pizza oven.  They told us that everything was imported from italy, from the pizza oven to the salt that they use in their cooking!  I'm a sucker for things like that.   So on to the food.  I've been here a few times and even convinced a friend to have her bday party here so got to try quite a few things. 1) The Margherita pizza is ridiculously good.  A guy who has never like pizza (and he's from NYC) told me that it was great!  They only make 73 per day so make sure you get here early enough for this.  I've been to the famous place in Naples for their margherita pizza and this was definitely comparable.  We had to try the Margherita extra once when they ran out and while it was good, it definitely was not as good as the world pizza cup winner.  The pizzas are decently sized with 6 slices each so I would allocate 1 pizza per 2 people if you wanted to try other things as well. 2) The quail egg and speck pizza is amazing and a close second for me.  I love runny egg yolk and it was brought out to us when the egg just starting cooking a bit.  Together with the speck it was bliss. 3) I personally didn't love it but everyone else raved about the Cal-Italia  with the prosciutto and Croatian fig preserve. 4) The fried Calamari cooked calabrese style is a great appetizer!  A bit spicy for those of you wimps though. 5) The lardo was pretty good but not as good as Batali's and it was difficult to share. 6) The fried string beans were okay but not amazing enough to justify $7.  The lack of batter made some people like it but I didn't think it was crispy enough. 7) Burrata, eh... okay 8) Spaghetti with Meatballs, so freakin good!!!  Love authentic spaghetti! 9) Rotelli, very good!  I love the pesto, a definitely try if you are looking for something different and are not filled by the pizza. About the parking.  It was pretty terrible.  I had friends driving around for almost half an hour.  Also they have valet supposedly outside for $10 but if you ever find the valet guy, you let me know because he was completely MIA on a Saturday night.  Maybe he was still circling for parking.  As for large groups, this is difficult.  They have one table that fits about 8 people comfortably and I was convinced to just take the table next to it but it didn't work well because it really isolated the two groups from each other.  If you are willing to get everyone in earlier like around 5:30pm, Marnie, the GM will hold those two large tables in the oven room for you. Finally as a nice touch since we had cleared out their supply of a certain Belgium beer, one of the managers came over and gave us 3 different kinds of belgium beer to try for free.  Very cool.  Will be back again and again and again!  Love love it!

Great lil joint! Definitely try the award winning magerita pizza which is limited to only 73 pieces a day! It's cooked in the wood oven and had a great smoky flavor to it! We had the caprese salad as well and those tomatoes were so awesome and sweet and I loved the thick tasty balsamic vinegar that was used to frame this dish! The mozarella accompanying this was heavenly! Service here was excellent and staff were knowledgeable! It's definitely a gem in north beach

Not so much. Pizza just okay, nothing special. We were excited that we were actually gonna get a pie similar to NYC but it was actually pretty bland and tasteless. We liked the side order of spinach best (not great to say for a pizza joint).  We had a great server. But we gave our cell phone to the guy at the front who told us it would be about 25 min and went to the bar for a drink (right near where he was standing). And he said we didn't answer our phone and skipped us. Uncool. They fixed it but not too aware. Also, SCREAMING child at the table next to us didn't really help the ambience.

I've taken quite a break from Yelping, but it is only when I feel like something is infinitely horrible (Flour+Water)  or infinitely good (Tony's) that I write. I didn't go to Tony's for anything other than trying his Marghertita pizza. DAMN!!! This is up there or EVEN BETTER than some of the high end pizza's in The City - Delifna, A16, Giliana's, Berretta, etc. Just absolutely perfect. I can't speak for anything else other than the pizza, but you should come here just for that. This is how Neapolitan pizza should be made. Knocked it out the park. So much so that I would actually go to North Beach voluntarily on a weekend to get it. Come here and avoid disappointed at places like Flour+Water.

Definitely best pizza that I've had that I can remember. The Margherita is light and really tasty. Had the Colombo as well and it was great but not as good as the margherita. What surprised me most about this place is the salads are incredible. You can't find too many pizza places with great salads.

After watching a foodnetwork show on the best pizza in the East, we just had to have a good pie and we new nothing in Contra Costa County  would match up to the thin crust marvels we saw on the show.  So off to North Beach we went on a Sunday evening. The place was packed and we had to wait 45 minutes... but WOW! Pizza to die for... can't beat a crust form a coal fired brick oven. The ceasar salad was excellent except for the store bought croutons and the service was fantastic - fast, efficient and very personable. My only regret is that it's not closer to home.

We got here right at Noon on a Saturday and there was already a small crowd waiting for the doors to open. When the doors opened everyone filed in single line and we got seated right away! The waitstaff is helpful and friendly. We ordered the Margherita, New Yorker, and a sweet Fig/Brushetta pizza for 4 adults and 2 children. It was great because we got a taste of it all. They serve some yummy foccacia bread with olive oil while you wait for your pizzas to come out of their brick oven. It was perfect.

The Margherita pizza is probably the best ive ever eaten. The sauce and cheese were awesome. The crust was super soft and according to the staff cooks in 90 seconds. 5 STARS! We also tried the Americano which wasnt too special. It tasted like any other combo pizza. Not sure if they use the same pizza sauce for both pizzas but it sure didnt taste like it. 2 STARS. Overall 3 stars. I would like to come back to try the other types of pizza on the menu. Hopefully the other ones are better. See you guys next time.

We ended up at Tony's Pizza by accident just walking around Little Italy and what a surprise!!! My husband had the Margherita and I had the Truffle pizza. We both agreed that they were the best pizzas we've had. The Margherita is basic and simple ingredients but just so, so good. Sometimes simple is just better! I'll definitely come back next time we're in SF.

Chewy Moist deliciousness. The pizza dough here was pretty fab- and we only had a 30min wait. We started with the gorgonzola salad and were thrilled with the giant portions and cute apple balls. And that garlicy olive oil for bread dipping made my breath super kissable afterwards (good thing the bf ate it too!). We ordered 2 pizzas - we figured if we are here might as well go all out and take home the leftovers. The first was the award winning Margarita, with our add-on of prosciutto (I mean, what's a pizza without the meat?) And the 2nd was the jersey style one with sausage. Both of the doughs and sauces were superb. Our total bill was over $100, mostly because of drinks- so probably won't make it my regular place but is def a special treat. Also, a plus that you can give your cell # so you can enjoy Washington Square Park or a bar nearby while you wait.

I am sorry to have to disagree with a lot of the positive reviews I read below.  If you have read the press, you already know that Tony was the Neapolitan Champion at the 2007 World Pizza Cup in Naples, Italy for the Best STG Neapolitan Pizza Margherita.  A while back, he got permission to have a wood-fired oven in the parking lot outside his pizzeria in Castro Valley for only one day, to serve the pizza that won the competition.  My wife and I made the trek out from San Francisco to try this pizza, and it was well worth the effort. That pizza was a revelation.  Thin, chewy, sweet crust.  Wonderful sauce.  Creamy mozzarella.  Luscious basil.  And, in an interesting twist, more than a dash of salt.  While startling at first because it was saltier than the Margherita pizzas that we traditionally get here in the Bay Area, after a couple of bites, it became apparent that the salt brought out brightness in all the other wonderful component, uniting them in a wonderful gooey whole of pizza-goodness. Sadly, the Margherita pizza that we had today was a sad shadow of that pizza that we remembered.  To be fair, we came on a Friday lunch in the second week of business, so perhaps Tony was back at his Castro Valley pizzeria.  The pizza was...okay.  The crust was thicker than and not as chewy as the crust we remembered from the parking lot.  Also, it was not nearly as tasty.  The sauce was bland to the point of needing salt, which was in total contrast to the brightness of the original pizza that we remembered.  All in all, it was fine.  A perfectly nice pizza.  Good, but not better than the pizzas that we have had at either of the Delfina pizzerias, A-16 (back when Christophe Hille was making the pizzas), or Pizzeria Picco.  And that made us sad, because the pizza we had in the parking lot would have given all of these pizzerias a run for their money. Combined with the pizzeria's location in the heart of the touristy part of North Beach, and I don't know that we will be making a return visit.  Unless Tony comes back and starts making THAT pizza that we remember.  Then we'll come over and refuse to leave.  Until then, there are many better pizzas in the area.

Had tried to eat there in the past but the wait list was too long.  But finally last night I got in!!!   I sat at the bar, eager to begin my Tony's experience.  And I have to say I was disappointed.  The service at the bar was horrible. The bartender greeted us with a bar menu and got our drinks lickety split.  But when it was time to order, he paid no attention to us at all.  He walked by 3-5 different times without acknowledging us.  He never checked on us or offered to get us another drink or pizza menu, nothing.  Finally we spoke up, asked for a menu and were able to place our order.   Thankfully, when our pizza arrived it was piping hot and DELICIOUS!  The margarita pizza was the night's saving grace.

Being a fan of Pyzano's in Castro Valley (Tony's other restaurant), my boyfriend and I decided to try his new place in North Beach SF! Deeeeee--lish! Good job Tony. Everything was great. I recommend the Sicilian Mojito to start and the SF Italia pizza or the Margherita pizza which is made from a special flour only from Italy.    The service was great and everyone was very friendly. Tony is usually always there and he is very active in his restaurant, talking to people and spinning dough. Great place for a date or for a family outing. Please try this place out next time you are in the city.

Some of the best pizza I have ever had in my life.  I can see why this place was busy.  My group and I had the pepperoni pizza and some kind of fig pizza.  Both were good but the fig one stood out.  My fiance likened it to dessert.  Pizza and dessert in one ain't such a bad thing.  If you have a hankering for pizza, you need to go out of your way to come here.

sorry but despite the ridiculous hype the pizza is just not very good. If u like beyond thin Italy style pizza u might be ok but it's way off.  As usual Californians who didn't grow up on quality pizza are wowed I give them credit for trying to make good sauce but the texture consistency amount of cheese is way off -- the crust while not terrible is hardly special or up to the standards of either champion east coast or the best of artisan west coast. Spinaci salad was solid and meatballs ok so they got the 2nd star but they need to pay me to eat that so called pizza again the ambience is weak too and bad music bad wall art bad lighting I live in da hood and I'm here to tell u this place has blown up and it's super over rated

This place is terrible. Don't go here. If you do, they may run out of the margherita pizza (limit of 73 per day) and there may not be any left by the time I get there. They have nailed it here - awesome cocktails, good wine, orgasmic pizza, and moist chocolate cake. They don't take reservations and they don't deliver, but it is definitely worth the walk and the wait!!

Oh man oh man. My sister and I fell upon this place thanks to Sunset Magazine, as it was highlighting the best pizza places around the bay area/west coast. I'm so glad we came to Tony's out of all of them on the list. We took a table outside and was seated immediately. We ordered of course the margherita and the spicy calamari. Both were heavenly and I was really trying to stop eating so much of the delicious calamari to save room for the amazing melt in the mouth margherita pizza. The bread came out with three types of dipping sauces, and was also really delicious. I hope to come here again soon because it's SO good. I couldn't breathe after because I ate so much pizza, but man it was worth it. The service was great also from the woman who sat us at our table to our waiter who ... I'm not sure.. but I think he faked an Italian accent in the beginning.. unless all the workers are supposed to do that..? Anyways, it's delicious. But if you want to eat a margherita, order it soon! Because they have a limit on how many they serve a day!! Go here!!

I really was looking forward to going here... but unfortunately was disappointed. I was expecting something amazing, and ordered the famous Margherita Pizza with the fresh mozzerella... honestly it lacked flavor. It had the burnt crust flavor true to Napoli, but the ingredients could have used something... like a touch of salt. If you want the best Margherita go to Lombardi's in NYC, or Delfina's in SF. I often judge a place on its margherita pizza since it is all about simplicity... I would go back and give it another shot maybe.. but the place is packed, we waited an hour, and the pizza wasn't as good as some other places. Top 3 in the city: 1.) Delfina's 2.) A-16 3.) Maybe tonys but likely something else...

We were luck to get a bar seat right away because the last time I came, which was around 7pm on a weeknight, they told me the wait would be about 2 hours for 2 people... they took my number and said they would call when seats opened up.  They never called so I assume no seats opened up that night... I could have starved to death if it wasn't for good ol' Sodini's around the corner! So my friend and I got the bar seat and it wasn't too bad... not the most comfortable seats since we were eating and sharing food but it was better than a 30-45 min wait at 5pm!  The service at the bar was excellent!  We got water, bread and menus right away.  I didn't actually know it was happening when it happened.. they're quick.  Then our meatballs and salad came almost 2 minutes after we ordered it! wow!  I was already impressed!  Meatballs are delish here!!! worth it too, 3 for $5 or 6 for $7.  They're between the size of a golf ball and a baseball, so good size.  We had the Gorgonzola salad which was good, but now that I think about it, the pancetta salad would have been better paired with the meatballs. We ordered the Margherita pizza because on their menu they highlighted that it was their award winning pizza and that they only make 73 of these per day, then you're SOL.  Well, it was eh....... to be brutally honest.  I've obviously had better margherita pizzas in Italy but I've also had better ones here in sf...  So I don't see what all the fuse is about.  I think we will order the prosciutto, cheese and vinegar next time (the guys next to us who ordered that looked happier than we were with ours...) We'll definitely come back but now we know better ;)

The ingredients are of ridiculously good quality and the pizza margherita definitely lives up to the hype. The only problem was that we demolished the pizzas in about two seconds flat and had to make some extra dinner (yes they are absolutely tiny weenie little pizza). At twenty dollars per pizza approximately the entire meal was well over sixty which definitely is in the upper stratosphere of pizzas. I have never actually eaten at the place, the two times I tried to make reservations they were completely booked. Definitely a great pizza if not the best I have ever had, especially when I'm not paying for it.

Yeah - I like it here.  This was my second visit to Tony's for Pizza.  I would come here all of the time if it was in my neighborhood.  I have yet to actually eat at a table and found the bar quick and satisfying.  I am a fan.  Moving through the pizza list.  Two down and pleanty to go.

came here 8pm friday night 30Oct (when the bridge was closed) and waited 38 seconds to be seated, party of two.  yup, there was no line.  it was AWESOME in northbeach with no bridge and tunnel people.   get the margherita pizza.  it's limited.  i mean why not?  while you're at it, get the mushroom crostini's and the meatballs. while the toppings are good (they are very good), this is the FIRST time i have eaten pizza and really really really payed attention to the way the crust tasted.  if you try the different pies that are baked in different ovens, you really can taste the difference in how the crusts taste, are made, baked, and texture.  it is amazing - definitely a lesson in pizza eating. now its 20 days after our first visit to Tony's, and we've been there 2 times since, yes - 3 times in total in 20 days.  though for the record, we do live 1.5 blocks away. SHUT THE BRIDGE DOWN MORE OFTEN!

i came here on a recommendation from my friend who said that it won some international pizza award for its margherita pizza.  i admit that i'm not a huge pizza snob.  take me to my pizza hut or typical new york pizza place and i'll be just as satisfied. however, always down for an opportunity to have my mind blown, i came to tony's with an open mind and hungry stomach.  i was not let down in any way. the group ordered a margherita pizza, a garlic and clams pizza, and prosciutto and figs.   margherita pizza: yes, i can see how it's award winning.  it's difficult to describe how much better this one is from other margherita pizzas besides the fact that the crust has the perfect crunch and it's got the perfect blend of greens with cheese and tomato sauce.  there isn't 1 thing about it that overpowers the other and steals the show.  the ingredients seem to work in a perfect harmony with each other. clams & garlic: i hate clams.  i don't think it belongs in my mouth, let alone a pizza.  while i'll stand by this statement anywhere else, i could barely taste the clams or any other form of fishiness in this pizza.  while the garlic was probably the balancer, this doesn't mean that the it was a typical garlic pizza.  i was amazed that i liked this one. fig & prosciutto:  this pizza can even be categorized as a dessert pizza.  i stuffed myself silly with this last choice and loved every bit of it.  the sweetness of the fig balanced out the saltiness of the prosciutto and was the perfect way to end the lunch that i'll never forget.

Delicious, even when lukewarm after being transported home for take out. I have to admit that I don't see the huge deal with the Margherita, but it was still good. The Cal Italia was quite sweet but the saltiness of the cheese contrasted really nicely. I'd love to try most of the menu.

Managed to nab a table without waiting at all! I think I came with too high expectations. I ordered the Cal Italia, the seafood linguini, and the limited margherita. Liked the Cal Italia the most for its interesting twist and the sweetness of the fig preserves, but I prefer Grimaldi's in Brooklyn.

Pizza lovers....Meet the holy grail of authentic pizza outside of Italy.  The pizzas are amazing.   As soon as we sat down we ordered the famous Margherita seeing as they only make 73 per day (I'm not sure if this has been tested, but they seem like the people to acquiesce to requests).  It's salty, ooey gooey goodness with a trademark tomato sauce that an Italian grandmother would make.  Next, the New Yorker satisfied our inner carnivores with sausage and pepperoni. I loved the globs of mozzarella and medium thick crust. My favorite by far was the Cal Italia.  Slap prosciutto on anything and it's my new favorite dish, but this pizza was rich and delicious.  It may have been too rich for my parents (to my advantage) but the combo of balsamic reduction and fig preserves has always been a match made in heaven. I even bought a shirt to commemorate my experience and I swear it smelled like pizza for a week after I bought it. This is the type of place I would wait in line for hours for (and people do every day) just to get one piping hot piece of cheesy, saucy perfection.

I'm a self-professing pizza freak - especially for neapolitan style pizza.  When I moved here, I sought out the best pizza I could find in SF and this is it.  I've tried most of the highly-touted, trendy spots - flour + water, Pizzeria Delfina, A16, Gialina - and none of them can hold a candle to Tony's.  It may be touristy and not have the trendiest crowd, but all that matters is the food.

AMAZING!! Does not even come close to the wonderfulness of this pizza!! They have a sister restaurant in Castro Valley- Pyzanos, however they do not have the wood fired pizza- which is probably better for me and my husband because we would be eating pizza 5 nights a week if that were the case! Went a couple weeks ago, initially had plans for a intimate dinner for V-day but told my hubby scrap it and lets get pizza and beer instead.. what can I say I am an awesome wife right!?!? :) Cannot wait till this Saturday- I surely will be there stuffing my face!

Went for lunch on a Saturday. They started us off with  Foccacia and Olive Oil & Garlic, Olive Oil, Olive Oil & Pepper Dip. This was really tasty.  We ordered salads which were excellent and then split 2 pizzas between 3 of us.  Got one of the Margheritas that they make a limited number each day. It was okay; not sure why it is so limited.  Also got the Uncle Vito but substituted mushrooms for the pancetta since we are vegetarian.  This pizza was awesome.  It's pretty pricey (bill was 75.00 for 2 salads and 2 pizzas) but was good.  We didn't wait at all by sitting outside.

Now this is pizza!!! This pizza is so GOOD, I don't even know where to begin... we tried Tony's original pizza, Margherita.  Only 73 Margherita's are made per day (because that's Tony's lucky number).  It's wood fired at 900 degrees for 93 seconds.  You can taste every single ingredient with every bite.... each bite is like a subtle burst of flavor in your mouth... and that flavor stays with you for hours... I never knew that pizza could taste like this...  Tony please come to Los Angeles!!

After living in SF over 3 years, I have finally tried Tony's Pizza. I am happy to say, it was the best pizza I've had in SF!  I went on Saturday night, around 9:45pm, so I did not have to wait for a table. I was happy because I've heard getting a table is a bit of a nightmare. We had 1 order of meat balls & the Margherita pizza. When the pizza first came out, I was fearful it had too much sauce, but it was in fact, it was the most perfect combination of super fresh ingredients. The meal was extremely satisfying & with great service! I left feeling happy, with a big smile on my face.

Went here last weekend with my boyfriend, sister and her fiance.  Delicious!  We put our name in around 7:30 and there was an hour - hour and a half wait.  The hostess offered to call us when our table was ready so we could get a drink somewhere else, which I thought was awesome.  When we got seated, we started with the meatball appetizer.  I don't even really eat meatballs, but these were delicious.  We wanted to try the margherita pizza but they were sold out.  They only make 73/day.  We definitely over ordered, but it was good to try a variety, and we had tons of leftovers.  We left the ordering up to the boys, and they went with the Pizza Campari (amazing), Cal Italia (my fave), and then a pizza romano, which is a combination of different pizzas.  Can't wait to go back!  YUM.

I have to admit I didn't read all 457 reviews of this place. I'm just chiming in, as a local North Beacher and one who is very skeptical of new Italian restaurants in this neighborhood, Tony's is great. The problem: the crowd. So I go in off hours, and lately I've been mostly impressed with the fig pizza- the special Foodie one. Anyways, I bow to the 457 reviewers here. Pretty intense. Let's hope Tony's stays consistent & good!

Woohoo! First to Yelp! A word to the inevitable critics for my claiming the 1st to Review Title: I won a golden ticket for the soft opening, so I really did go and try the food, it isn't mere speculation. So, what can I say? It's Tony's. What would you expect from Mr. Gemignani? Anything less than perfection? Of course not! Tony will open this little gem next to his already famous Pizza Napoletana restaurant this Friday to the public. It's a walk in place for people on the go. As you walk in you will see the huge coal fired oven just in front of you and the other huge oven (he brought that one in from Texas I think) to the left. You can order a custom pie or a true Chicago beef sando (disclaimer: they were only alloting one item per golden ticket, the wife is a vegetarian, so I sadly could not try the beef sando. I spoke to someone who was enjoying one though who said it was "awesome"). We ordered a half cheese / half pepperoni thin crust from the coal-fired oven. It did not disappoint. It's all about the sauce here, folks. He slathers on a generous amount of potent, semi-spicy sauce that is just perfect. The crust couldn't be any better, and of course the cheese is cooked perfectly. If you're in a hurry, go here. If you have more time, go next store to his sit down restaurant. In my opinion, it's the best pizza in SF, definitely this side of the Mississippi, and arguably in the country, although I know personal tastes vary and this will be a hotly debated topic for the forseeable future. In my camp though Tony reigns King, and I consider myself blessed that I am fortunate enough to live in SF and partake in his creations whenever I want. Oh, and one last thing - Respect the Craft!!

Had the 1 pepperoni and 1 sausage from the different ovens.  Went around 5:00 just before it got packed on a Friday.  Staff was very friendly and good at explaining the menu and all about the ovens and such.  Good water service.  Nice little free bread and dip to tide you over.  1 pizza is a lot for 1 person.  Their 1.5 servings per pizza is a good estimate without any starters.  Very reasonable price for the quality.  Nice atmosphere inside.

After my breakfast at Mama's down the street, my friend insisted I had to try the Cal Italia pizza at Tony's, so I ordered one to go- Asiago, Mozzarella, Imported Italian Gorgonzola, Sweet Fig preserve from Croatia, Prosciutto di Parma, Parmigiano and Balsamic. It was really delicious, but I would have liked it with with more prosciutto, there were only a few pieces and I loooove my prosciutto. Overall it was good and I would definitely go back but it wasn't out of this world like my friend described it.

A little too eager when I got my beautiful, giant pepperoni slice from Tony's, I decided to bite into the piping hot, cheesy, deliciousness and burnt the roof of my mouth. Was it worth it? Yes. A very good New York slice. What I appreciated the most was the slightly crisp crust with a really good chew to it. That, balanced with a bit of a kick in the sauce and a nice gooey layer of cheese made for an excellent pizza. While not the best pizza I've ever had, one of the best New York slices in the Bay Area. Looking forward to trying an Italian beef sandwich next time.

Thought we could beat the crowds and come on Sunday at 3pm. We ended up having to wait  just 30 minutes for a group of 6 before being seated. And it was well worth the wait. This pizza was BOMB! The wood-fired Margherita pizza was so simple (mozzarella, tomato sauce and basil) yet so so authentic and delicious! It was just like the pizza in Naples. The Cal-Italia pizza (which won Tony a gold medal on the Food Network) was very unique. A perfect contrast of sweet (fig preserves and balsamic reduction) and salty (prosciutto and cheese).   The Sicilian-style pizza was fantastic as well. Very different from the classic Naples-style, which has a thin chewy crust. The base of the Sicilian pizza was a thick, tender focaccia-like bread. Ours was topped with buratta cheese, cherry tomatoes, basil and a balsamic reduction. Yum!!!

I was intrigued after hearing this restaurant housed the first American to win the World Pizza Cup for his pizza Margherita.  And if it wasn't enough Tony only makes 73 pies a day!  It was this combination that made me think damnnn this must be good. On top of that my boyfriend is a pizza snob and he was wolfing it down before he even considered his wine.  He kept pointing out the pizza was cooked in a wood fired oven in 900degrees and took a minute in a half to cook.  He was a happy camper thus I was.  I may never hold a pizza to his standards, but I loved what I ate.

Best pizza in North Beach, by far! Margherita pizza is to die for. If you like thin crust, this is the spot. The marinara is ridiculously good and the meatballs will leave you salivating for more. I've never ordered anything I didn't like but my go to dinner for 2 is meatballs, little italy salad, magherita pizza. The wine list is pretty pricey and there is almost always a wait but the food makes it all worth it. They will also take down your phone number so you can head over to Tony and Nick's (cutest bar ever)  for a drink while you wait. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Tony's!!!!

These are wonderful pizzas. The pizzas are a little large for one person, too small for 2 people, unless you get an appetizer. The appetizers are delicious - the garlicky string beans, the artichoke dip and olives - yum. I loved the Margherita pizza (especially the crust), as well as the special of the day potato, mozzarella, garlic and pancetta pizza. I wasn't as thrilled with the classic pepperoni, but my husband liked it. We like Tony's and will come here for lunch - but we're sticking with Tommaso's for dinner pizzas that we can share.

apparently there's only 73 of the most famous pies made daily, and i showed up too late to have one. the pizza was good, no doubt on that. the meatballs were better. we had a bit of this and a bit of that, i enjoyed myself but didn't feel as though the meal was worth all the money we paid (but i suppose eating anywhere in north beach with a name is going to have that rolled into the price). i'd cruise back again, i mean, i love a decent pizza.

S.B. and I had dinner at Tony's Pizza tonight and I begrudgingly became a fan... I walked in with the preconceived notion that it was some tourist trap in the heart of Little Italy and that it would be nowhere near as good as the Cheese Board Pizza Collective.  No way, no how.  I was promptly corrected of my mistaken notion once we were seated comfortably and the bread was served. We ordered the following: 1. Gorgonzola con Mele Insalata - This salad was so delicious!  The best I've probably ever tasted, the house made apple dressing was probably the best part about it, but the fresh bits of sweet crispy apple, candied walnuts and creamy gorgonzola were also top notch.  I needed more of this salad, S.B. and I shared it so I didn't get enough. 2. Margherita Pizza - This came to our table straight from the 900 degree wood burning oven.  The tomato sauce tasted very fresh - though I suspect it is a canned tomato, the mozzarella was melty and stringy as it should be, I would have like the basil to be fresh rather than baked, but there wasn't enough of it for me to really complain.  Then the piece de resistance - the crust - steamy hot, crispy, yet doughy and slightly chewy, the texture was perfection.  Only criticisms here are that the flavors were a little on the plain side - I had to sprinkle with parmesan and chili flakes to give it the proper punch, and the crust was burned black in parts which made the pizza taste somewhat bitter. 3. Panna Cotta - too much cream, not enough raspberry, this needed more fruit to cut the richness of the cream.  It was OK. Total bill came out to $48 w/ tax and tip...Surprisingly with all that food, I still came out a little on the hungry side, which made this meal all the more expensive.  I had to subsidize with a snack later in the evening. Is this pizza better than the Cheese Board?  Probably not, but it is in the ballpark and it comes mighty close in it's own way.  Does this place stand on it's own merit (not just a tourist trap) - absolutely yes!  We will definitely be back, if even just for the salad alone.

Came on a Saturday night at about 6 and our party of four was sat right away. Enjoyed a nice Negroni and ordered the Margarita to start. It was a s it should be and that was pretty damn good. Followed that with the Sicilian Burratina and a white pie. Thought the white pie was the clam pie out of the coal oven. It was my fault. With a menu with this many inter related options a numbered system would be advised. The white pie was nothing special. The Sicilian was very good. Crisp crust good toppings, very flavor full. Had a nice vapolocella by the carafe that I enjoyed as well. I would definitely come back and want to try out the take out place as well. Nicely done.

The menu is too long and confusing. The are too many sub categories for their pizzas, two different flours used and there are at least 3 different ovens used. So you have to be careful when you order to make sure your pizza will come out of the wood fired oven istead of the electric one. I tried the classic margherita and it was good most of the times. There were days it was oily.  The ambiance is ok. The main dining area is very crowded. I was really disappointed with the desert menu. We went with six friends so we tried most of the desserts. The tiramisu cream left a really bad aftertaste. The wait time is really long.

Three things about me: I'm a purest, I judge pizza on its crust, I'm from the East Coast.  My favorite pizza ever is John's in NYC, the Village location.  Crispy, thin, chewy, and slightly blistered and charred.  San Francisco doesn't have anything like this...til Tony came along.  Now to be fair I've only tried the Margarehta, or which they only make 73 a day.  The Margareta spoke to my purest heart loud and clear.  It was pure perfection with no bells and whistles, it didn't need any toppings.  It had the light of heaven shining down on it.  With its paper thin, crispy, yet chewy crust,  it chipped away at my disdain for West Coast pizza.

We only go take-out, so I can't comment on the long wait for a table. It was movie in Washington Square Park night, so we got a pizza to munch while we waited. Feeling adventurous, we tried the truffle pizza. It was good, but I don't think worth the cost. But I'll bet their other pizzas are just as good and at a lower price point, are very good values for the quality.

5 stars just for the award winning Margherita pizza of which they onlky make 73/day. Just when I thought I was pretty in the know for pizza, I met this pizza which blew all others out of the water.

This is good pizza.  Tony's offers a straight forward single page menu with thin crust pizzas and a few other dishes (pasta, salad ...).  I got the Cal Italia and it was delicious.  Among my friends, this is a two-person pizza.  The ingredients are really come out in the pizzas and it's well-balanced in the sense that there's no overwhelming pizza sauce or ooey cheese (which isn't always a bad thing).   I live in the area and I was a bit sad to see the Jazz place close at first, but I'm glad Tony's has taken over and become the darling of the Stockton/Union intersection.  Anything to take away some of the undue attention from Mama's.

This place was really good. They had quality ingredients and the wood fire margarita pizza was amazing. We had out six year old son with us so they brought him his own ball of pizza dough to play with. Before the meal they give you fresh bread with olive oil, olive oil with garlic, and a pesto sauce to dip the bread in. The restaurant is small but it has a romantic quality about it. It was great people watching too. Our wait was about 15 minutes but very worth it. Our waiter could have been more attentive, but hey everything cant be perfect.

OMGOMGOMGOMG!!!! This is THE BEST PIZZA I have EVER eaten in my long life.  I have eaten pizza in Rome, Italy; I have eaten pizza in NYC, but this is without a doubt the most delicious I have ever tasted.  We ordered 2 pizzas and we got the famous Margherita pizza which was unbelievable.  The crust was transcendent:  just the right amount of char and perfectly chewy, but the sauce!! Oh my, my...it tastes like just picked tomatoes from the hillsides of Tuscany; incredible!  The mozzarella cheese was rich and just the right amount.  They put sausage on it  for us and it was perfectly seasoned and of course, delicious.  The other pizza was goat cheese, pancetta, pickled peppers and escarole...what can I say?  The goat cheese was creamy and there were chunks of pancetta (not too many) instead of thin slices and the 'scarole was put on top after it came out of the oven, so the flavor was so fresh. We have decided never to eat any other pizza out, or to order any other pizza in... We plan on making this a monthly trip and will go through the entire menu of pizzas (but always ordering the Margherita) and then start again, I'm sure.  The wine list is good, and it looks like they serve some nice cocktails. Can't wait to go back!

Second time here and still impressed!  We ordered the famous margherita, of course, and the new yorker.  The margherita never fails to disappoint and the new yorker was absolutely delicious!!!  A new favorite that I look forward to ordering again.  We arrived at 7pm on a Saturday and was told the wait would be about an hour.  Luckily, we saw bar seats and asked the hostess if those were self-seating or part of the wait list.  Self-seating she said - SCORE!!!!  I've only eaten at the bar here and that is aok with me.  The bartender is super nice and the wait for our food isn't very long.  I'd skip the long wait time for bar seating any day!  Looking forward to another visit to Tony's...drooling just thinking about the new yorker.

The best pizza i have ever eaten (including trips to New York & Chicago).  This restaurant has 3 different types of pizza ovens to get each pie just right - and it is all perfection.  They don't take reservations but go and wait in line.  You won't be sorry.  Definitely try the New Yorker and everything else your server suggests.  I may plan a trip back to the city just to eat here again.

Went here for Tony's award winning margherita pizza.  Overall a decent pizza.  The crust tasted good with just the right amount of salt and chewiness.  However, the crust was slightly thick for my taste.  Good amount of mozarella but the tomato paste was a little overpowering.

Overall, really good pizza.  The NY style was very good.  However, the New Haven style coal-fired pizza, not so good and NOTHING at all like Wooster Street apizza.  The crust was way too thin (almost cracker like) and the sauce was overspiced.  I'll definitely go back ... but I'll definitely avoid the NH style pie.

I had an amazing slice of cheese pizza here. Just fantastic. And this is coming from someone who is somewhat of a pizza snob--as friends know, 9 times out of 10 I'd rather make my own pie than eat out. (It takes a lot to impress my pizza palate!) But Tony's hit all the right notes, starting and finishing with the crust. Cornmeal dusted, crisp, thin, and airy, it was pitch perfect! And for under 4 bucks the price seemed about the same I'd pay for any number of (lesser) slices in the area. I don't visit North Beach too often but next time I do I know where I'm eating.

I was excited to finally try this place. I live two blocks away and have been anticipating it's opening since the owner of Via Spiagia next-door told me about it. I came with my brother who was visiting from NYC. There was a 30 minute wait and because there were no spots at the bar we went across the street to have a drink at Joe DiMaggio's (which worked well, because we could see when people left and could gauge when we needed to head back over). When we were seated (which ended up being almost exactly 30 minutes later) we decided to share a salad, a pizza and a bottle of wine and we were happy with it all. We started with the gorgonzola and pear salad, which was tasty and I was surprised at it's size, fairly large for a starter salad...perfect for sharing. Then, we had the Margherita pizza. It was a delicious pizza, not the best I've ever had, but still VERY good. I look forward to many more meals here...I just wish they weren't closed on Mondays and Tuesdays.

Toni makes an incredible pizza matched with a fun and exciting atmosphere (feels like a big family reunion w/o the creepy uncles or psychosomatic relatives). I couldn't help but have a great time, with the exceptional cocktails made by Noble the bartender, the great service, and even the other customers who actually shared a couple slices w/ us. (I spent an entire minute just breathing in the aroma of a slice of thin crust, truffle pizza that was offered to me). It very much reminded me of both my time in New York and Venice. Can't wait for a reason to go back!!!

Wow . . . incredible, authentic pizza in SF.  Now to be honest, I'm not terribly impressed with the pizza scene here in SF.  There are some that I think are pretty good (Goat Hill, Patxis, and Irving Street for a late nite slice come to mind) and down on the peninsula, I love Toto's . . . and that's about it.   Tony's Napoletana is a different pizza experience than the others.  They actually treat pizza as serious food, and not as, well . . . pizza.  There's an obvious amount of care that goes into each Neapolitan style pizza.  I'll start with the appetizer we ordered, Lardo.  If you ever watched a bougie style travel show, where they go to europe and eat, then you probably know that Lardo is just cured back fat.  Although the serving size is small and delicate (euro style as opposed to the way we Americans like) the taste is fantastic.  We kicked off the pizza eating by ordering the Award winning Pizza Margherita.  The best way to describe it is clean and fresh.  Pizza Margherita is super simple, and so the only thing that sets one apart from the other is the freshness and quality of the ingredients.  Here, a perfect tomato sauce is married with delicious mozzarella and basil, with a nice thin crust.  I was very impressed.  Of course, being the pizza fanatic that I am, we couldn't just stop there.  We went on to order the Prosciutto y Pomodori pizza.  Different style of crust ( a little thicker) but same delicious result.  You can really taste the care put into each pie.  The ingredients are top notch, and the technique is impeccable.   Tony's can be a little pricy, but honestly in this instance, you get what you pay for.  I'd suggest to go, order two pizzas:  One Margherita and something else (you have to get there a little bit early as they tend to fill up fast after 5pm, and they only make 73 Pizza Margherita per day).  And that's for 2/3 people . . . if there's more than that, order accordingly.  Pizza treated seriously.  I love it.

It's been three days since I had Tony's pizza and I'm still dreaming about the Cal-Ital. Fig, prosciutto, a splash of balsamic - amazing! The other pizzas we had were also delicious. The phrase "melt in your mouth" is over-used, but damn if that crust didn't melt in my mouth. Tony himself cannot be more charming.

Pizza was ok.  We had the Margherita.  The turn off was the service.  If we didn't have such an obnoxious server, we may have enjoyed the pizza more.  We felt we were in a place a step down from Bucca di Beppo's...  Make sure when you order "2 glasses of house wine" you know what you're ordering.  Our server picked the most expensive red by the glass.  Overall a really bad experience and we'll probably never go back.  We felt ripped off and treated like stupid tourists.  I don't know why they have crowds there.

I went here on Wednesday night. Granted, I was extremely drunk, but I found this place to be only  "ok". Pizza is hard to mess up and apparently this place has a great reputation. However, I wasn't that impressed.  I shared the Margarita pizza with a friend, but the dough had too much flour on it. Everything else about it was good, especially the wine.

The pizza at Tony's is quite possibly the best I've ever had.  We had four different pizzas, a sicilian margherita, the famous award winning margherita, the peppers and sausage pizza, and the meatballs. Despite being stuffed after a few pieces I still could not help myself from trying all of them.  Each pizza had a distinctly different crust and taste and each one was absolutely delectable.  I can't wait to go back. One consideration if you are planning on going: get there early. We had to wait for over an hour and weren't seated until after 8:30.

I've had Tony's Pizza a few times, but it was always take out. It was good but not amazing. I recently went back and ate there with my mom and now I know why people rave so much about Tony's Pizza. First of all they give you a ton a fresh bread and there different kinds of olive oil. We split a little Italy salad which was salty and delicious. Then we split the world famous Margherita pizza. It really was the best pizza I've ever had. It was simple but the flavors and the textures were incredible. It was worth every penny and every calorie. I'm just glad that we walked home.

I looked up best pizza in SF after planning a trip there from LA and after many Yelp reviews I decded to go here. After letting the initial line die down my fiance and I walked to the booth to put our name and luckily there was a spot at the bar with a great view of the pizza making process. To our surprise, Tony was there making pizzas! We didn't know who he was we just assumed he was the kitchen lead because it was obvious that he was in control of his kitchen. I ordered the margherita pizza with pepporonis and they were perfect small penny sized pepporonis. My fiance ordered the Detroit style deep-dish-ish pizza and when we asked the server if they had sun-dried tomatoes he said no and Tony overheard (we diidnt know it was the main dude) and he said yeah we can, we'll go next door and get you some. Sweet! Tony also overheard it was my bday and we just got engaged and we flew in from LA so he offered to buy us dessert. It was a delicious lemony custard ... the waiter said the lemons came from Tony's mom's house, true or not, it was delicious. As an appetizer we ordered 3 meatballs and they were very flavorful as well with the right amount of sauce. Great experience, we will return everytime we are up there hopefully we get lucky again with the wait. Thanks Tony.

We were in San Francisco for the July 4th weekend and happened to come across this gem of a restaurant in North Beach.  The pizza was absolutely amazing as was the service.   I recommend that no matter what pizza you get, also get the side of meatballs.  For $5, you get 5 big, tasty meatballs in a delicious light marinara.   5 stars from Chicago visitors!!

Had the Margarehta, which seems to be their signature pizza. As other reviewers have commented, they only make 73 of these a day. The best part was the crust, which was thin, well cooked, and tasted like what I think of thin crust pizza. The sauce and cheese were ok. The cheese was rather rubbery to my taste. The only topping was a few sprigs of basil. Was it good? Sure. Was it great? Not really. Did it fill up 2 adults? Barely. Was it worth $20? Nope.

This posting is primarily focused on their service, not so much the food. I admit, I am not a connoisseur of pizza from Naples, simply because I had not previously been exposed to it. For example, I was unaware that it had to be slightly burned. Nonetheless, I went to Tony's and inquired about it from the Italian waiter, and he simply said that "It is thinner and different than the traditional pizza." When the pizza came, my significant other was not pleased with the burn, so I asked the waiter if we could get another one. We were seated in the back where the oven was, and the waiter went to the chef, probably a manager of the kitchen of sorts, and they both came back, the frowning chef asking me if I knew what a true Napoletana pizza was like. Admitting my ignorance, I said "no", which was then followed by a negative smirk, saying curtly that "This is how it's supposed to be - slightly burned." With his frown ostensibly imbuing frustration with our stupidity as this education was settling in our minds, he asked "Do you want me to cook you a traditional pizza?" My significant other, who tends to read nutrition magazines that talks about things like how burned food causes cancer, nodded to me to accept his offer of this alternate traditional pizza. The chef then turned away, that perhaps not being the answer he wanted, and headed to the kitchen, shaking his head leaving us all behind. The waiter stayed and smiled at us, powerless to intervene in the events. If it was up to me, I would have stuck with the pizza, but these were the cards I was dealt. Nonetheless, I felt bad, and stupid, for not being so informed about this variety of pizza - something that a customer really shouldn't feel if a restaurant wants a return customer. I decided to let it go, but the negative experience continued when I received the check, finding out that they charged me for the second pizza. I asked the waiter to speak to the manager. The waiter went back to the chef, and with another head shake and some words from the chef, the waiter disappeared, perhaps talking to the restaurant's general manager, and in the end deducted the charge for the pizza. The pizzas were good. Both their traditional and , yes, even the Napoletana Margarita Pizza. I see why people like this crisp variety of Pizza, and I will never display this pizza ignorance ever again. Moreover, the waiter did handle the situation and was very nice, although he could have informed us ignorant Napoletana pizza eaters about this important burning dynamic of the pizza when we initially asked him to desribe it; let alone that, although offered seemingly as free, they were intending to charge for the second pizza - especially since they immediately whisked away the Neapolitan pizza once we went with the new pizza option. The location in North Beach is great; the pizza was good, not exceptional in my opinion; and, although food is important, so is the dining experience. So I think that two stars is a fair rating.

Many different style of wonderful pizzas to choose from. Go for the more traditional classic Italian pizzas with the thin crust. They are incredible. There are also the Classic American style pizzas, but I don't think they come out as amazing. The first time we went, they had this incredible dessert pizza. I had to order it. Only was able to eat one piece, but it made a great pastry breakfast the next morning.

I can't say this is the best pizza in SF, but it is def in the top 2 or 3.  When we left for the east coast 5 years ago, there really was no great pizza in SF.  What a fantastic surprise to move back to some really great pizza (just as good as the stuff I used to chow in NYC!)!  Order the "special" margharita pizza (the one they claim they only make 70-something a day of).  If you are with two people and you are even a bit hungry, you will need 2 pizzas.  We tried to get by with ordering a salad and one pizza.  We left happy, but still a tiny bit hungry.  Service was great, wait was more than reasonable.  If you can, cab it.  It's North Beach, so parking is the pits.

Wow...I've eaten at Tony's several times now and the quality of the food and the atmosphere never ceases to impress.  It is as good of pizza as you will find anywhere (and he has the medals to prove it), but the atmosphere is also lively, unpretentious, and inviting.  Usually I just get to enjoy the food, but yesterday I went to a special event set up by http://Homerun.com and Tony and the staff put on an amazing show.  It really was an awesome experience.

I really enjoy their simple Pizza Margherita. Its perfectly done, as it they take great care to ensure it meets Italian D.O.P. standards of quality (strict ingredient guidelines, etc). So Tony obviously loves what he does and I think it is reflected in his food. I will always go out of my way to go here if I get a craving for a good Pizza.

Probably one of the best margherita pizza's I've ever eaten except for the crust. Everything was on point, the crust was a bit burnt and not comparable to the rest. LONG wait but that's how any popular spot will be (+1 hr)

I Heart Pizza, so anytime a new place opens up I'll be one of the first in line to order. Tony's is AMAZING. We new going in that the wait would be long since its new and they don't take reservations. They came around with some delicious meet and cheese to sample. We were able to grab two seats at the bar and the very knowledgeable bar manager, Noble, recommended we just eat with him. Since they only make 73 Margherita pizzas per day we ordered up since there were only a few left. DELICIOUS! perfect combination of sauce and mozzarella. The crust was to die for. Meatballs - Best $5 you can ever spend... 6 yummy meatballs in sauce. String Bea Fritti - great to try. the best I've had in the city... not too greasy. of course we didn't finish them because it was just the two of us, but definitely worth trying. Prosciutto San Danielle- Combination bites of the prosciutto and mozzarella was perfect. I would have liked it if they drizzled more balsamic reduction on the plate. Last order was the Cal Italia - this is the winning pizza Tony made on the food network. Such a unique pizza... Croatian Fig, prosciutto and Parmesan. It was hard not to finish the whole pie. Of course this was way too much food for the two of us and we came home with a good amount of leftovers and i know they won't last long. Cheers to you Tony.  We'll be back soon, if not ordering a pizza for take out tomorrow!! PS. Turn the music up at the bar please... would make for better ambiance and a more pleasant wait.

The pizzas were amazing. It doesn't matter which one - they were all so good. There were a section on the menu that says serving size for two - well, it's more like for 3 or 4 people aka huge. It was cooked on a 9x13 inch pan and cut up to 12 pieces. We tried the meatball for appetizer and it was so good. Definitely worth it!

I very much wanted to love this place, missing terribly some of the great Brooklyn pizzas I left behind. Alas, the pizza margherita  was just ok, could have been left in the oven just a bit longer. They seem to have a bit of a numbers fetish here (only 73 margheritas per day, 90 seconds in the oven, etc.) I will try it again, maybe ask for 'well-done' next time. Also, no unsweetened ice tea?  C'mon guys.  The service was quite good.

Tony"s Pizza is absolutely the best pizza I've ever had.  Try the Margherita or Cal Italia.  You won't be disappointed.  There aren't a ton of tables in the restaurant so it's best to go in a group no larger than 4.  Try to get in for an early dinner, as it can get pretty crowded.

Love it! Really authentic Italian pizza. Didn't try to the New York style, but I'm sure that's great too. Definitely get the meatballs for appetizer to share. Value for money is decent (not bad, not great), but overall well worth it. This is how pizza should be.

Went there this weekend after a walk around Embarcadero. I initially wne there after reading some good reviews on this site. From what i had gather i was expecting a hole in the wall pizza joint, it is not which was a little surprising at first, but the atmosphere and food did not seem to suffer from it. We tried the limited (73 per day) Margherita pizza, which apparently won some award in Italy back in 2007, and it was really tasty. The pizza looked greasy, but it did not taste greasy so that was good. The pizza was 18$ which is a little high considering one can eat an entire pizza by themselves but then again it is an award winning pizza, so i guess you're paying a little for the name. We also had a couple drinks which were pretty tasty.

This place is great. Very accommodating for groups and friendly staff.  The Cal Italia was wonderful, but the Margherita was a little disappointing.  In my opinion, not the most authentic Italian pizza I've had in the city, but delicious none the less.  All in all, a great place to get pizza with your friends before rolling over to La Trappe for drinks.

Yeah, this is the real deal for pizza authentico.  It is always crowded, but don't give up, as it's worth every minute you wait in line.  Three different ovens produce a wide array of yummy pizzas at very fair prices.  Don't miss the Bianca, which won Tony one of his many trophies in Italy.  If Tony is there, he will stop by and greet you as well.  It is our favorite pizza place outside of Italy itself.

Had dinner here on Saturday night - party of 5 - had to wait about 2 hours for a table.  Which is both indicative of how amazing their pizza is and therefore well worth the wait!   We split 4 pizzas: Margherita Extra - We wanted the famous Margherita of which they only make 73 a day - unfortunately all those people who were eating for the 2+ hours before we were seated finished them up!  That's okay though - the Margherita Extra (only difference is type of flour) was delicious enough! Diavola con Rucola - a good alternative to the traditional pepperoni.  The Salami and Arugula compliment each other nicely. Cholula - The chicken in cholula hot sauce + jalapenos were an excellent selection if you like your pizza hot.  I usually put Sriacha hot sauce on all my pizza - but there was no way I was going to disrupt the flavors going on with Tony's Pizzas.   Classic Pepperoni - We got this pizza with a thin crust and it was an excellent decision. I enjoyed all the pizza - my favorite was probably the Margherita Extra though.  There is something fantastic about the simplicity of this pizza - its no wonder this place has won such awards and we had to wait 2 hours.  I am already planning on going back with guests from out of town in a couple of weeks - I'll get there early next time though - I am determined to get there before they run out of the 73 Margheritas!

First off, the food was amazing, but what they did with my credit card puts them on my S*** list. They charged me correctly my half of the bill, but then decided two days later to MANUALLY charge my card for the whole bill, $88.92, not cool. Had to cancel my card and start fraud charges. If it is a mistake that is fine, but putting my card number in manually something is fishy.

I had the pleasure of attending the private event that Tony's put on with http://HomeRun.com last week and it was the culinary experience of a lifetime!  After a happy hour that included a sampling of pizzas/pastas/salads from the menu, the 60 lucky attendees were split into two groups of 30 where they learned how to craft the perfect pizza and cocktail from the best instructors in the business.  Tony put on an incredible pizza throwing display, talked about how he got his start in the business, and then helped each table develop their pizza making skills.  He was even gracious enough to spend time answering people's questions after every last bit of pizza had consumed.  If the two parties decide to put on this event again, I highly suggest that you check it out.

I made a special trip on my day off. Unfortunately, this place is overhyped... much like Tomasso's. Tried the marinara. Decent upskirt char, but lacking char around the rim. I also found the sauce a little too sweet. Also, please lose the whole cloves of garlic; they're mushy and don't belong on a marinara. A16, Pizzeria Picco make much better pies. Delfina and Gialina's make better pies too (and they're not even using a wood-fired oven). Tony, your pies won awards in Naples? Against whom exactly? Some advice: take it easy on the hype, will ya? Spend more time behind the counter perfecting your craft. Your pies have potential. Keep at it.

Being a huge fan of the napoletana pizza (the last trip to Italy, I tried a different napoletana pizza for 5 days in a row!) I really wanted to love their pizza.  We ordered this one, the pesto/tomato one and margarita.  The crust has great flavor.  Thou my personal favorite as in Naples is to go with an even thinner crust.  And I love the fact that the cheese is light on pizzas in Italy.  So those are the only two things preventing me from giving 5 stars.  The pizza though is still by far some of the best in town and the pistachio panna cotta is superb.  If I want pizza, I go here

Had the Jersey style tomato pie and a small order of meatballs. It was the best pizza I've ever had...as we would say back east (I'm from Boston) "legit". The crust is perfect, crispy and chewy; sauce, sweet and tangy, with just the right amount of mozzarella, herbs and topped with a dusting of Romano. Meatballs are east coast typical...very tasty! I made a point to get here early 3:30 Saturday afternoon to beat the dinner rush and I was seated right away. If this place is on your list (and if you're looking for the best pizza around, it should be), do yourself a favor and do the same. It's worth it.

Totally love this place!! The pizza is amazing. I have actually told so many people about the pizza shop. YOu may have to wait a while but totally worth it. The only down experience I had, was the first time I came for my friends Birthday, we brought our own cake. They wanted to charge us a cakage fee. Yes a "CAKEAGE" fee of $2.50 a slice there was 30 of us. They never told us about the fee. We disputed it..and they removed it off one of the bills. The manager who we gave the cake to and she never told us about the fee. When she removed the fee said "god be with you." First of all in a business you should inform the customers if there is a fee. It is our choice. Other than that it has been a great experience. Just remember they may have a cakeage fee.

Tony's Pizza was on my to-try list after seeing Joanne Weir rave about it on her blog. We tried Tony's award-winning Margherita ($19) and the pancetta-porcini (pancetta, porcini, various wild mushrooms, truffle oil--$19). Margherita was, unfortunately, disappointing. The tomato sauce was bland and had a canned taste, not at all impressive. Pancetta-porcini, on the other hand, was much better. I loved the truffle. Still, $19 is a little expensive, and I have had a better wild-mushroom truffle oil pizza from RNM. The calamari is good deal for $11. It easily served four, and it was cooked just perfectly and wasn't too greasy.

Honestly?  Not that great.  The bartender was very friendly, and the fried green beans were tasty (though oily), but the pizza was just ok.  The crust was pretty soggy.  Given all the rave reviews, I'm guessing we just got an odd soggy pizza.  We'll stick with Gialina and flour+water.

I've always wanted to try italian style pizza & saw this place on yelp & saw it had good reviews. We came here w/my brother & Jan's mom last week on a beautiful day in the city. I liked how it had a slightly modern take w/an old school italian pizzeria feel. We were seated after a 5 minute wait & we look over the menu. We decide to start w/their fried green beans & order 3 pizzas (I know it makes us look like fat asses since for 4 people all the pizzas would've been good for at least 6-7 people, but we wanted to try different styles of their pizza!) The pizzas we order is their famous Margherita pizza, Fratellanza & Primavera. Their fried green beans were simple, but good & soon after the Margherita comes out. Was really good. It was light & fresh like an appetizer kind of pizza. I really enjoyed it. Then the Fratellanza came out which was sicilian style pizza & it was HUGE! It was good & hearty w/all the meats on top. Even though the crust was thick, it was nicely crunchy on the bottom & had a nice chew to it. The Primavera was very tasty w/the pesto & veggies on top. It was a good vegetarian pizza. Their pizzas here is WAY better than fast food pizza cuz you can really taste the fresh ingredients they use & their pizza dough is good. Overall, we all liked this place. Nice decor, decent prices for the amount of food you get, quick & friendly service & tasty, yummy pizzas. We're definitely coming back to this place.

I lived in Italy for a semester. I ate pizza almost daily, and Tony's pizza reminds me of the delicious and authentic pizza that can be found in Italy. I rolled in Sunday evening and surprisingly there was no wait! My friend and I ordered beers. The salami and cheese appetizer was ok. Nothing special about it. Most of the meats seemed dry and we had to ask for bread. They messed up our pizza order, but once the Primavera came to the table it was amazing! I usually loved meat on my pizza, but we decided to go down the veggie route. Every bite was mouthwatering and left me wanting more. I was slightly disappointed, since I thought the crust would be thinner and crispier than it was. Overall a nice dining experience. I will definitely come back and try a different appetizer as well as the margarita pizza!!

The pizza is really good, and we will definitely come back.   We had two of their "classic" style pizzas and both were excellent, wtih chewy dough and great ingredients.  The Truffle pizza was excellent but at $32 I don't think we'll be getting that again.   All in all worth the price, but we're not going back until after the tourists are gone-way too crazy in there.

Excellent pizza at a reasonable price - great sauce and cheese, and a crispy crust. Finding really good authentic pizza that's not overloaded with ingredients can be tough. But this pizza does it - all the flavors come through. Also excellent - the best I ever had - is the Caprese salad - a large plate of delicious Mozzarella with tasty tomatoes and basil. I ate the whole thing myself but it's a good appetizer for four (and at a reasonable $9). Very friendly place in the heart of North Beach (Stockton @ Union). The waiter was from Venice and gave us the lowdown on the pizzas. You can eat at the bar, and every Giants game is shown. Can it get any better? Muni: 45, 30, 9. Closed Mon & Tues.

All I can say is it's the best wood-fired type pizza I've had in the city!  It blows away Pizzeria Defina. We ordered the Cal Italia and a couple of others because we were a big group.  I'm not going to go into the details of the others because one bite of the Cal Italia and I was hooked.  A little Gorgonzola, fresh parmigiano, sweet fig and prosciuto.........to die for!  Try it!

We went to Tony's on Sunday for the first time and enjoyed the rucola with pancetta and speck with burrata (really good combo of crisp/salty and creamy/sweet) as appetizers with our prosecco (which lacked bubbles from the bartender pouring the end of two bottles) at the bar while waiting for our table. The wait wasn't bad, about 30 minutes, and they seemed to move people through pretty fast although there were some parties that left once they learned how long the wait was. For dinner we had "the" Margherita and Pesto pizza. After the hype about the margherita, I was a little disappointed. It was a little bland and a little wet from the sauce. The pesto was also a little bland but comparing the San Felice and Caputo flour was interesting. Watching the pizzas come in and out of the oven was cool and the smell of truffle oil was intoxicating. Tony was very amicable and always keeping an eye on the room as he worked furiously. Overall, not the best pizza ever as it was just missing something (I'm not sure what, some earthy/salty flavor, maybe just the mineral content of Italian water?). However, Tony was very nice and made the entire dinning experience fun and pleasant so, for that, I would come back again.

First time at Tony's last Saturday night.  Some friends suggested I hit the joint as I am on a perpetual quest for the city's finest pizza pie. Though Tony did not throw the best - I will return. The menu was a tad overwhelming as pizzas are cooked in a few different ways.  The menu overview from the waitress took about 90 - 120 seconds.  I don't need a lot of options - just point me to the good stuff. My friend, Tony, no - not the Tony, and I opted to try one of the wood fired and I think it was, brick oven.  The wood fired won hands down.  Simple mozzarella, a little sauce, and crispy basil.  The wood essence really melded well with the classic Italian flavors.   The other one - puttanesca - was Ok.  It needed less sauce.  All of the pies are advertised as medium crust - both would have fared better with a thinner crust.   Highly recommend the sauteed spinach with olive oil.  Perfectly salted and kissed with garlic. To start the meal they set-u-up with some bread (it was Ok) & a medley of dippers - olive oil, pesto, and garlic.  The pesto was well balanced - the best.   Wine selection was Ok.  Spendy 1/2 carafe for house wine. A tad noisy - mix of locals and tourists that probably heard about Tony on the Food Network.  Clean, good service, and ample portions. I'll  hit Tony's again on a Wednesday and stick to the WOP-style pies.

Got the Marinara ($13).  It doesn't come with cheese, but it was still awesome.  Can't wait to go back.  The crust was crispy and the sauce tasted fresh and homemade.  Really can't say enough good things about this place.

We went to this place after wandering around the city for the better half of the day and I was pretty psyched to get some tasty-ness on at this point. My friend was excited about pizza and had looked this place up so we came here. The place itself is cool, the staff is friendly and the service is great. Clean bathrooms too, that's more than a superfluous detail in San Francisco. The drinks were my favorite part, partly cuz I'm a fan of the afternoon cocktail hour but mostly because my cosmo was actually really damn good. I didn't fully realize this until I had another later at a sports bar downtown that wasn't. We got the famous margherhita pizza that is award-winning and whatnot. My friend dug it and chowed almost the whole thing, although he did say "I wouldn't give it an award or anything." I was far more neutral. The crust was too soft for what I like on a thin-crust pizza, I prefer more crisp. Also there was visibly craploads of oil on the pizza which was a major turn off for me, I thought it was too greasy. The ingredients were quality tho, I had a couple bites and the cheese and the basil were both tasty. I also had a ceasar salad but there is not much to say about salad without dressing. It came on a cool plate? It did. The other thing I did seriously enjoy here was the espresso. I believe I said "this is just a smidgeon below what I want an espresso to taste like" which is the best review of an American espresso I have ever given, this one was very good! If I were reviewing the coffee I'd give it 5 stars. Overall it was a cool place but I was not as psyched on it as I had hoped to be with the yelp reviews we had seen.

Finally, a break from the mediocrity of North Beach Italian! The pizzas are amazing, the meatballs were out of this world, the salad was the perfect accompaniment, and the wine list was to die for.   It was almost a shame they weren't small plates portions so we could try everything.   Our service was a little spotty, but we were also stuck in the corner.  But Tony kept an eye on us and made sure we were taken care of  - a sign he genuinely cares about his customers and business. The bar is also solid - great cocktails, service, and conversation. I can't wait to go back!

We happened upon Tony's as we were wandering around North Beach on a pizza quest. It was Valentine's Day, so the one-hour wait was not entirely unexpected. Food was very good, but service was very disappointing and slow. I was shocked to get my $12 glass of Zinfandel in an 8 oz. rocks glass when we could see that there were dozens of wine glasses at the bar. We also ended up eating our pizza off of dirty salad plates. The gorgonzola apple salad was good, and a very large portion, and the Quattro Fromaggio pizza was excellent. I think if the service and attention to detail had been better, it would have improved our experience greatly.

Having lived in North Beach for over a year I was frustrated there was no place immediately in the Washington Square Park vicinity that I could pick up a great, true italian style pizza, without spending an arm and a leg. I refuse to buy pizza's from the big restaurants as just pick up. Finally Avenue G closed and a true pizzeria has opened in the park!  It was sad to see La Felce go after so many years but finally something worthy has replaced it! Atmosphere is great. Owner, hostess and waiters are kind, friendly and funny. Eating at the big round table in the window is very nice but last week I was in a rush with 2 friends from out of town and we ate at the bar for just as good of an experience.   Great true italian style pizza's for a reasonable price. You have to order the cal italia pizza...my personal favorite!

Visiting San Francisco from Baltimore, for 2 days, we tried their very famous award winning Margarita pizza. It was a good pizza with great tasting sauce and fresh basil. However, the crust was lacking the kick that I expected from Tony's. I have tried napoletean pizza at several famous locations but I haven't had a better crust than Iggies in Baltimore yet. Be sure to check out Iggies pizza in Baltimore on your next trip.

I'm a pizza snob, and this is definitely very good pizza.  It's not mind-blowing pizza, so I'm not sure who awards world gold medals or however it's advertized on the menu.  My biggest complaint is the price, which probably comes from being in North Beach:  a $19 margherita pie might serve a single adult.  The truffle white pie, meanwhile, was worth every of the $32 I paid (market price, so your results may vary); it may have been the best mushroom pizza I've ever had. The crust is excellent:  a great chewy texture with crisp outside, deep flavor, nice smoke and char without being unpleasant.  I was less wowed by the sauce, which I found just good, but that may be my own preference for something a little sweeter (this was very dry and quite sharp).  Very good cheese, too. So, as I said above, the chief complaint is the price.  I also only tried the wood-fired oven pizzas, so I can't speak about the other categories, but it's interesting they offer so many.   This place could definitely stand on its own in New York.

Well despite Tony's above average staff, their pizza, though flavorful was very greasy.  Their Little Italy Salad was pretty good, but they overseasoned it.  If they could tweak their food prep a little, this place would fare better.

I came here around the opening, and being italian and not a jersey shore type italian, but the one that actually grew up there i always set my standards high for pizzerias! as i walk in i noticed a very odd layout as the chef is in the middle of the restaurant making the pizzas in a wood burning oven! the ambiance had already been set as he tries to bring the authentic italian experience here. we had to wait a little for our table, but not long at all. as i sat down the waiters were nice, friendly and made me feel very comfortable. but man when that pizza hit the table awaiting for it  to be all over my mouth and face, god did that pizza hit the spot! not the gross dominos greasy, oily, thick, and drown is cheese, this was just a splenderous pizza!! not too thick but not too this, perfect amount of  mozzarella!  thats all i can say, everyboy just leave NOW! and get that pizza!!!! dont hesitate, dont think about it, just eat it!

i went here expecting so much and i was let down.  The first thing i would have to say is the wait here is crazy long. While waiting in line i was thinking that this place must be really good to be jam packed. I was wrong. The wait for a take out pizza must have been at least 45 mins. I asked for the largest size and it came out looking like a small. The pizza sucked i could have went pizza hut for a better tasting pizza. Second it is way expensive as hell. If the pizza was any good i wouldnt mind the price but since it sucked i was pissed off. I ordered a margarita pizza and it was the worst i ever had in my life. I should have just went to a real pizza joint

On a trip to San Francisco with my boyfriend, we were determined to eat at great and original places. Tony's popped up and we were very excited by the reviews we had read. We walked in and the atmosphere was great! They were busy and all of the guests looked very pleased. We were seated right away and began looking at the menu when the Margherita caught my eye, so we ordered that and a salad to share. We watched our pizza being crafted as we sat right by the oven. Once it came out I was concerned, but that first bite was nearly life changing. The pizza crust was the perfect thinness, the sauce was incredibly velvety, and the mozzarella was deliciously fresh. I fell in love with the food. I've already tried other pizza places and the Margherita at Tony's stands alone as the best!! The price was appropriate and we will defiantly drive 7hours back to have another :D

I really don't get the good reviews and lines out the door.  The pizza is not good!  And it's expensive: nineteen bucks for a one-person pizza.  The  Margherita I ordered (tomato and cheese) arrived as a drippy, soggy mess.  When our waiter solicited my opinion, I commented on the very soggy crust and he condescendingly informed us that the pizza is met to be "wet"  because it is baked in a 900 degree oven.  This place is great if you're into water-logged crust.  Good thin pizza is crispy, not "wet."  Ditto for the lasagna: mediocre and pricey.  Two stars instead on one for the good salad.

I couldn't have asked for a better experience for my first time at this restaurant! I'd always wanted to eat here--ever since I found out that the Margherita pizza was made from authentic Neapolitan ingredients. ( I am from Napoli originally). So one Friday evening at the end of February, I made my way to North Beach to visit this dynamite place! I got there around 5 PM and fortunately for me, there was a cute little two-seater table right by the window. My server was really nice and when we made conversation, I told him I lived in Iowa and he said he'd gone to college in Iowa! Small world! I ordered the Margherita pizza and a glass of ice tea. First they brought out some bread with these great dipping oils. I savored it as I sipped my tropical tea. But the best part was that Margherita! It was like heaven! I devoured every bit of it--the crust made from Neapolitan flour, the San Marzano tomatoes, the fior di latte mozzarella and the fresh basil. Amazing stuff!! What a great place! I simply cannot wait to go back!!

i've been here multiple times and not for the pizza.  in fact, i haven't even eaten the pizza here!  nope, what draws me back is the chicago-style dipped beef sandwiches.  these remind me of the great dipped beef sandwich i had back at portillo's in chicago.  these are spot on in flavor and texture. i have had the cheef (beef/cheese), tomato beef (beef and tomato sauce) and the combo.  all come w/ some hot peppers and can be asked to be served dipped in a number of ways from dry to soaking wet.  i typically just get barely dipped and get au jus on the side to dip as i feel needed.  the taste of the beef is tender and very flavorful and the peppers add a huge kick (you can get em w/ no or fewer peppers).  the bread can make or break a sandwich and here it does the job well as it holds together a monster sandwich while tasting great!  of the three varieties of the sandwich i tried, the cheef was my favorite because of the cheese.  the combo comes w/ a half of an italian sausage and is great but only for the hungry.  i also saw a triple double on the menu (double beef, double cheese and doble sausage).  a co-worker of mine tried this and barely made it thru so it looks like it's only for the extremely hungry! they also have a great soda there called the manhattan special which is an espresso flavored soda and is a great sidekick to the sandwiches! i hope to one day try the pizzas, especially the coal fired pizzas but i'm just too happy w/ the sandwiches for the time being!

I had been wanting to try Tony's for quite awhile -- I definitely consider myself to be a pizza buff with high standards. People rave about this place and after eating there earlier this week, I just don't see it. It was not an authentic experience at all, and even felt like a rip-off of Lombardi's in NYC in terms of the interior. The Margherita pizza was just OK -- doughier than most -- and the Roman-style pizza was just plain tasteless. As far as other local spots, Tommaso's, Zero-Zero and Flour + Water all easily surpass Tony's. And, it's overpriced to boot.

Tony's is pizza heaven.  Its claim to fame is the margharita pizza that won the Naples annual award for best pizza.  This distinction tends to overshadow the fact that they make some great pizzas in four significantly different styles. Everyone has their personal preferences when it comes to pizza. The odds you will find the style you like are pretty high, plus it will be done extremely well with the best ingredients.

Good pizza.  The Jersey Tomato pie is one of the greatest pizzas I have ever eaten but I have to say every time I walk out of there I feel a bit ripped off because of the wine prices.  $12 for a glass of not very good chianti is the norm.  Make sure you make that one glass stretch for your entire dinner or you walk out with a $70+ sting.  Not a good value.  Looking forward to new restaurants opening in the neighborhood.

Went to Tony's pizza today and picked up a couple Marguerite pizzas to go. Before I go on I have to say I ate the first pie in the car so I could have it straight out of the oven!!! One thing that has to be said for Tony's is the attention given to every pizza coming out of the oven. The pizza was good but not exceptional, my biggest problem was with the tomato sauce which could have used a touch of salt and pepper and a little something more. Simple details that separate amazing dinning experiences from nice and welcoming but nothing exceptional. With all that being said I'll drop by Tony's to get a pie and enjoy this pocket sized restaurant with it's great staff.

I have to preface this by stating that pizza is one of my favorite foods.  I would eat at Pizzeria Delfina, Ragazza, Zero Zero, and Little Star multiple times a week if I could.  So when I found myself in North Beach around lunch time, I knew I had to try this place.  I ordered the slice of the day to go, which was topped with sausage, peppers, mushrooms and ricotta.  The (enormous!) slice was $5 and they heated up in the oven quickly before giving it to me to go.  $5 is normally a bit much for a slice of pizza, but it was more like 1 1/2 slices in size, and it tasted fantastic! It was clear that the ingredients were high quality and very fresh, and I would rather pay a bit more for that quality any day.  The dough they use has great flavor and bakes into a nearly perfect crispy-yet-airy crust.  My only gripe is that they didn't quite heat the pizza up enough, so it was a little lukewarm when I ate it.  That minor issue aside, I will definitely come back to this place for lunch, dinner, or a quick slice to go.

5 stars for the food. The American style was excellent.  The sauce was fantastic.  The award winning margherita was very good though a little runny. I guess I'm used to regular pizza,  so I'm going to stick with the American style pizza. The pasta was great as well. The sauce was addicting. Keep using the pizza crust and bread to dip in the sauce.  Service was so-so. The waiter brought the wrong drinks and pasta.  At least I got a free drink.   Can't wait to go back again though to try their other styles.

My friend and I hit up Tony's based on a reccomendation from an actual Italian, haha.  We were there about 4 on a Sunday after hiking, so a beer was definetly in order.  Even at that time, it was busy but since there were only 2 of us, we were seating pretty quickly inside.  However, we were seated very close to the kitchen door, so my friend had to kinda hunch toward the table or he was sticking out into the aisle.  We were also next to the 'staff' table it seemed, since a number of staff would sit there and eat, and also make up schedules, so we heard alot about the restaurant operations but that wasn't a big deal.  We got the 'special' pizza of the day which was spinach, ricotta, sausage, black olive, and cheese. It was very good!  It took a while to get our bread and water before the meal also, but they were busy so it was forgivable.  Overall, the staff seemed very attentive.  Would definetly go back!

We had their "award winning" margherita pizza and the italian salad.  Both were very fresh and tasted real and clean.  The crust esp on the outside was excellent.  The middle was a bit soggy and the sauce was runny.  The pizza and sauce just tasted very fresh.  Sometimes food just taste fake, or just over done with spices, etc.  With that said, if you are used to pizzas with tons of toppings, sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms then you'll be disappointed.  We also had their tiramisu and it too was not too sweet, and quite good.  Would highly recommend!

By far the best pizza in North Beach (although I have been known to wait in line for quite some time at Golden Boy at 1 am) Great beer on tap including yuengling for all the east coasters out there. Put your phone number down and grab a drink at Tony Niks just up the steet. I am a big fan of the Margherita and the New Yorker which they now coal fire. Speaking of the coal fire, the slice house next store is the best to go if you are looking for take out pizza. The wait is usually 5 minutes and the pizza is still awesome!

i had really  had high hopes for this place but i was quite disappointed. we ordered the classic margerita which i hear they only make 75 of each night and a pesto pie. both pizzas had a soggy mushy crust which pretty much failed my pizza standards -  pizza crust should be crusty and chewy and not soggy in the middle - inmo - maybe they were having an off night? two stars are for the meatballs - boy were they tasty. sadly im not going to make the trek back -especially since in the Nbeach.

This place had good but not great pizza.  Not sure if we were here on an off night or not.  Had the Margherita which didn't blow us away.  Kind of soggy.  The mozzarella and basil were fresh, but I have had  better.  The Sausage pizza was much better with a firmer crust.  The Italian Salad was the hit and large enough for four.  The meatballs were good as well.  Probably would go back if we were in the area, but wouldn't go out of our way or wait for hours to get in.

I spent a lot of time in Italy growing up and go back there often so I'm an unapologetic pizza snob and this is the closest to real Italian pizza I've eaten outside of Italy. Don't faff around with sausage and all that crapola, or if you do order at least one of his famous margaritas as well. It's thin and light and tasty and superb. The place can be a bit hot and crowded and it doesn't take reservations but they'll take your phone number so you can go have a drink at Tosca while you're waiting. Tony's been there in the kitchen most nights I was there and he's a friendly down to earth guy, hands-on and totally into his pizza. I'm not a fan of North Beach in general it's touristy and soul-less but I make an exception for this place.

Walking up Stockton St. on a beautiful saturday afternoon me and the wife decided to stop in for lunch.  Being the pizza connoisseur that I am I had been wanting to try this place for awhile.  Walked up lady said it would be 10 minutes till we were seated.  So we walked across the street to the park sat on a bench and enjoyed people watching while we waited.  They called us about 15 minutes later (they call your cell phone if your not out front) walked in seated in a booth next to a bar.  We decide to order the meatballs for appettizer and the margarita for our entree.  Both were amazing and there was a real contrast in sauce for both.  The sauce on the meatballs definitely  taste home made, it had so much flavor and was the perfect way to start the meal.  They also brought us three types of bread with three different Olive oil dipping sauces and that was also great.  Warm bread and olive oil you can't go wrong.  On to the pizza which was perfect for 2 possible 3, a hot margarita they only make 73 a day.  The crust was crispy, sauce sweet, and cheese gooey.  It makes my mouth water writing about it.

Amazing thin-crust. The spices and herbs really come out in the pizza, and the cheese seems really fresh. I've never had one of their sandwiches, but they are supposed to be good.

I used to come to this place when it was La Felce and it was wonderful. I am happy to say that this new restaurant has fantastic pizza and has done a great job of maintaining the 'old school' vibe of La Felce. I loved the Margherita pizza and can't wait to go back and try some other ones. I also tried my friends Stromboli pizza (it was rolled) and it was delish as well. They have a nice wine selection that is '80/20' Italian/Californian wine so I think I'll have some vino next time around. This new kid on the block is a keeper!

have frequented a lot of pizza restaurants in the area so decided to give tonys a whirl, especially considering the lines usually out front. after ordering our appetizer, they came back and told us they had run out of the ingredients, so we ordered a plan B and their margherita pizza, which has won awards and apparently been featured on tv. they came back and told us they had run out of the dough used for that pizza but could use their regular dough instead. even aside to the crust being burned, it really didn't seem like a great margherita. it was fine and enjoyable, but if someone asked for the best margherita in the neighborhood, it'd probly be about third on the list.

pretty awesome clam and garlic.  i'm a big thin crust fan.  his award winning margherita was just ok with me since it was the medium crust.  2nd time i went and had the basic ny style cheese, it was not flavorful.  the cheese was so bland.  very disappointed.  i called this my favorite pizza place before the 2nd time.  i like ford coppola's cafe on kearny and columbus much better for their thin cheese pizza.  cheese is so tasty there.

Tried to get a parking spot and a meal at Tony's on 12/03 FAIL.  I suppose that made me all the more motivated to try and have a meal there.  The next day an opportunity arose and this time Sabrina and I were not disappointed.  Despite it being a Friday night in North Beach we managed to score a parking spot within walking distance (pure luck and timing!) and no wait on a table.  Secret - even though there was an hour wait for tables inside - there was no wait for an outside table.  The outside tables are located along the Union Street side of the restaurant - there are heat lamps overhead .  It was a nice kind of heat - warm enough to kill off the chill and not scorching like the other kind some restaurants have.  We ordered the Classic Calamari appetizer (the Calabrese is the spicy version) and the fried green beans.  The calamari was good in the sense that they were perfectly fried and fresh - definitely not the battered rubber bands some restaurants serve to the tourists who don't know any better.  The green beans were wonderful - crunchy and not at all greasy!  We were both hungry so we split a Caesar salad too.  That was ok - the romaine was still crunchy and they don't over do the dressing.  I ordered the Margherita pizza (the limited number one) and Sabrina had the Ravioli.  The pizza is six slices and very good.  The basil really comes through and the crust is perfect - not too doughy and not too brittle.  Sabrina's ravioli came with a hearty bolognese and a hunk of bread with cheese.  We were going to order a Classic Cheese to go for sabrinasdad but we ordered so much food we had enough to take home! (Not to mention the meal started off with a basket of bread - crusty baguette and foccacia served with olive oil, a garlic dip and roasted pepper tapenade trio). No dessert for us because we were both stuffed.  There will definitely be a next time!  Sabrina's friends swear by the Cal-Italia, I would love to try a "thin crust " pizza (either the Bronx or one of the classics) and the spaghetti and meatballs.  Some side notes - soft drinks from the bar are not refillable - Sabrina had a Dr. Pepper which was enough for her but the table next to us ordered Diet Pepsi and tried to get refills but changed their minds when they found out refills were not free.  For $3.00 a glass, sodas and ice tea should get refills.  Also there is an incline on Union so one false move and there goes your drink (happened to the table on the other side of us).  Doesn't help that the tables have "grates" in them - even on a level floor, a misplace of your glass on an open area between the slats could cause a drink to tip.  Overall a good experience.

We had the fries green beans, Margarita pizza, and angel hair pasta with pomodoro sauce.  I thought the pizza was good, but not the best pizza I've ever had for being such a renowned pizza.  All around a rather solid restaurant, with everything being tasty, just not 5 star worthy.

it's that good.  i never thought i'd be able to find good pizza in sf.  i gave up.  then my coworker, an ex ny'er, told me about tony's.  i swore by it so i took down to north beach (horrible traffic and misdirections and all) and sat at the "chef's table" which is the counter where the brick oven is.   i'll cut to the chase:  new yorker was AWESOME. here is a rundown of the ingredients based on what was layered first. the dough was perfect. i thought the ny pizza was so good b/c of the water but this is on par.  sauce wasn't too sweet and just right.  the mozzarella was nothing amazing but worked perfectly with the pizza.  the ricotta tasted so fresh and perfect.  the pepperoni was small and thick. the sausage wasn't overly spiced.  all this put together in a wood oven made for one of the best pizzas i've ever had.   added bonus:  tony himself chatted with me about the pizzas and how he's judging some of the travel channel's pizza wars competitions.  super cool guy. will definitely be back to try some more.

I never feel great after I eat Tony's pizza. I think it's the cheese. I think they are cost cutting on the cheese. But I give it 3 stars because everyplace else does that too. I've made my own pizza with great cheese bought at Molinari, so I know how you're supposed to feel after a good slice.

Read many great things. Had to go. Went and was disappointed for starters by: the hostess telling us we had a 1 and 3/4 hour wait bu,had BART-ed over and (read first sentence again)gave our name and as it was crowded there thus uninviting, we proceeded to walk around north beach and experienced a drink here and there. We arrived back in about an hour and a half...whoops, no record of our reservation and it took about 15 minutes to come up with a resolution, guess she was correct with the original wait time but...We were brought to a spot directly in front of the wood fired oven. We waited a while not too much longer honestly , place our orders , wine and pizza...go figure and got to watch them made and bake...WOW!!! they were out as were our drinks fairly quick. The product/pizza did not live up to all of the reviews that I had read...muddled flavors, a barely crispy crust and a show watching the manager , stuff and I do mean stuff her face  about an arm;s length away dipping focaccia in olive oil ..very entertaining and obviously anecdotal but really, couldn't that be done in the kitchen away from the guests...oh yeah, best for last...you get to take your left overs home in an Ed Hardy designed pizza box...WOW!!! kind of explains the prices and all of the hype... Quite disappointing, think twice about the PR surrounding Tony and his pizza.

Every meal we've had at Tony's has again been great, but somehow several friends we have sent have come back with less than rave reviews - varying from cold pizza to unimpressed... So maybe the quality is variable. My tip - if you sit in the room with the pizza oven, your pizza will be hot and delicious!

Probably the best pizza in San Francisco, and there's no pretense in the place, just good food made and served by people who seem to care.  We've been many, many times and have never had a bad meal.  A perfect meal for two:  Side order of meatballs, margherita pizza, and a little italy salad.  Oh, and on special occasions, the panna cotta is tasty!   Be forewarned, there is almost always a wait.

Believe the hype.  Though more expensive than I anticipated this place is worth the wait.  We had a fantastic time.  Ordered the truffle pizza and the soproano pizza and didn't regret either - place is spectacularly good, and the 90 minute wait forced us to have a few too many drinks in North Beach which is always the right decision...  Valet parking at the old Moose's restaurant up the street is the right move by the way!

Simply, hands down the best pizza in SF, if not all of California, perhaps, the country.  Tony is the first American to win the Naples pizza competition in Italy, and it shows.  The wood fired pizza oven cooks your pizza's in 90 seconds, he's a great host and you will not be disappointed.  I go here once a week with my woman, we LOVE it!!!

The Margherita is INCREDIBLE. Hands down the best pizza I've ever had (with Pepe's in New Haven, CT in second place). Everything from the dough, tomato sauce, mozzarella and olive oil was top notch. The flavor resulting from the cooking in the wood-burning oven is truly unique. The chef cooks only one pizza at a time in that oven, and only for roughly 90 seconds per pie since the heat is so high. Tony's PN is a must go for every pizza lover.

The best pizza!  My husband and I recently ate here during a trip to San Fran after a recommendation from a local.  It was SO delicious.  We got the margherita pizza, which they're famous for, and it was so worth it.  My husband started with the 3 meatballs and he reported back that they were amazing!  They even serve a huge, 1 pound meatball which the kid next to us at the bar got!  He said it was amazing and devoured the whole thing.  I started with a salad which was also so good but a LOT bigger than I anticipated!  I expected it to be a smaller starter salad but it ended up being my meal along with a slice or two of pizza!  The slices of pizza are on the smaller so if you're with a few people and/or super hungry, you could probably stand to get two pizzas.  We ate at the bar and received amazing service from Robvell, the bartender.  He was very friendly and knew so much about the restaurant and the menu offerings.  Wish we had time to eat here again during our trip but we were only in SF for a few days!  They also had some pasta dishes that looked delicious.

A totally happy experience.  Just looking at the jumbled assortment of bottles exuberantly arranged behind the bar made me happy.  This is someone's (Tony's, obviously) temple to the delights of pizza.  But first we had to sample the meatballs, which came out a winner.  Generous sized, plenty of tomato sauce, and with a perfect velvety texture that melted in your mouth.  If someone can make a good meatball they are my friend for life.  After that two pizzas--the regular margarita and the cal italia.  As for the margarita, Kathy Dinner Panic got it totally right in her critique (crust a bit bitter, not really to my liking, and the pie itself a bit bland).  It was good, but to my taste not as good as Four+Water or Delfina.   Ellen loved the Cal Italia, with its combination of sweet (fig conserve from Croatia, or something like that) and savory.  I liked it too, just not quite as much.  But the whole experience was so much fun that we definately plan to come back--Sunday--to try 2 more pizzas.  Stay tuned.

Best pizza I've ever had...seriously.  I even got angry that night thinking about the pizza.  Why?  Because I realized that every time I want to eat it I'm going to have to fight my way over to North Beach and cram my vehicle into a crappy parking garage.  Because it's so worth it.  We started with the Margherita wood-fired pizza.  The mozzarella is so beautiful - soft, unctuous, not too salty.  The tomato sauce was a light, bright tomatoey flavour.  And the crust - puffy, crisp thin crust with charred blisters!  The quattro formaggio was balanced and not too salty, which can happen with so many cheeses on a pizza.  Next was the Scarola pizza, with blobs of goat cheese, hot peppers, cubes of pancetta and freshened up with tender romaine salad on top.  Finally, we finished with the white clam pizza:  garlicky, tender clams and clams in the shell decorating the top.  Then I thought about that crap Round Table passes off as pizza and got angry again.

I've eaten at Tony's twice now.  The first time we sat outside under the heat lamps and the second time we sat at the bar.  I've had the Cal Italia, the Margherita, a couple of their salads and the appetizer wings.  The wings are fall off the bone tender--probably the best chicken wings I've ever had.  The salads are huge and good to share with 3-4 people as an appetizer.  I didn't love the Margherita, but I would give it another chance.  I liked the Cal Italia because of the interesting flavors, but I thought it was a bit dry--even for a sauceless pizza.  I love love LOVE the spaghetti and meatballs.  DELICIOUS must-order.  I also love that they give you more than the standard oil and vinegar for your bread.  Excellent flavors in the dipping condiments for your bread.  Service is good and mindful.  The first time we sat at a table outside and the second time at the bar.  For a party of two, I would probably sit at the bar--our bartender was really cool.  Will definitely be back.
