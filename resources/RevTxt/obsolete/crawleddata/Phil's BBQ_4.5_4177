Hands down my favorite BBQ spot ever!!! I must say that I would wait an hour or 2 to eat here and I think that I would only do that for this place and Sushi Deli 3 in Hillcrest!! I freaking love the people here and the food is awesome!!! FINGER LICKING GOOD!! Ê I've had the pull pork sandwhich and my favorite here is defnitely the BEEF RIBS!!! The french fries are addicting and the beans are delicious! I love the bbq sauce here and i enjoy the big portions you receive... If I wasn't such a porker I would have left overs!! I'm def going to miss this place while I am going to be changing my eating habits!! YUM YUM!!! I want a rib right now while I'm talking about this!! LOL

Absolutely love this place! I live in Orange County and a few of us still try to make the drive down a few times a year just for Phil's BBQ. The beef ribs is my favorite thing to get there. As for sides, the macaroni salad is simply the best. Prices are somewhat reasonable compared to similar places like Lucille's. My only negative feedback is that every time I went, no matter what time of day there is always at least a 30 minute wait. Other than that, still pretty good BBQ.

I wanted to give this place a 4 simply for the value. ÊFor about $19, you can get yourself a full size baby back ribs rack. ÊNear the same price you can get even more quantity with the beef ribs. ÊThat is cheaper than many other places you will find such as Lucille's. ÊStill, at the end of the day, I could not give 4 stars because the taste was so-so. ÊForgive me guys but I think Lucille's might even taste better. Ê I am a sauce man. ÊI drench everything in sauce. ÊHere though, I wanted to be as objective as I can be and determine taste from both sauce and flavor from the meat itself. ÊThe texture is spot on; very easy to eat, though not exactly fall off the bone-type. ÊIt is a no-effort bite and tear with your mouth affair (This applies to both beef and baby back ribs). ÊFun! ÊAs for the sauce, it is not overwhelming in that it does not try to mask every flavor. ÊYou would still be able to taste everything, which is always good. ÊStill, I found myself wanting more flavor, especially from the meat. ÊThe beef ribs were my favorite, but maybe it is all the hype of this place that got me expecting out of this world flavor. ÊThough it is above average for sure, it was not extremely satisfying with every bite. The sandwiches (We got tri tip and pulled pork) was even more underwhelming. ÊIt was good because it had an extraordinary amount of meat, but it was so much that as my friend Michael L. stated, it did not seem like it should be a sandwich. Ê Needless to say, I was in a food coma at the end of the meal. ÊI was satisfied, but when coupled with the long wait, I cannot say that the next time I visit San Diego, the first place I would visit is Phil's. ÊI would rather try out a different Yelp-approved place. ÊI guess the hype and all the great things I have heard about this restaurant made me expect too much, and all of those expectations sadly, were not met.

Everytime I come here, I drool....and you know what...you will too. The ribs here melt off the bones. It's not like Lucille's; over-priced and mediocre. Sweet, succulent, tangy, and tasty! Portions are HUUUUUGE. I was stuffed like a fat cat. I had the pulled pork burger for dessert. My tip for this place: Practice Patience. No matter what time you come, you'll be waiting in line. I came here on a busy Saturday evening and also on a Thursday early evening and the line was horrendous. Their site has a camera, so you can scout the line before you come. If you bring a date here, and he/she digs it (not expecting $150 omakase and fancy doo-da shit), you've got yourself a good mate!

When I get my nails and hands all dirty for some meat, particularly baby back ribs, it has to be Phil's BBQ. Nowhere else would I use both my hands to eat some meat. This place isn't a romantic dinner with a beautiful view. Instead, it's a lick-the-bone clean type of joint. Phil's BBQ really knows how to cook and marinade their meat! On weekends, the wait is about an hour. It's outdoor waiting, too. parking is compact but you'll find one eventually. There is lots of tables inside so bring your family and friends. The staff is great! They'll find you seats to accommodate for your whole group and pass out Popsicle when you're in line on hot days. They have conversations with you, make recommendations, the whole package. They got a bar on the outside and the inside. You order first then get seated and wait for your food. The Pork Baby Back Ribs is what everyone comes here for. Deliciously cooked to tenderness and watch it glide smoothly off the bone. The Beefy Ribs is another popular item. It's a bigger image of the baby back ribs but beef instead of pork. The sandwiches are huge! Expect to order and share, because you're a real fatty if you can finish a whole order by yourself. Free refills on soda which is good for me because all the food makes me thirsty. I love their corn on the cob, but at the same time, I love any corn. The potato salad is a good side to order. if you like onion rings, order the Colossal Onion Rings. It's a big pricey but you get good quality food and really good service. I cannot give them the perfect score because despite the great BBQ food they serve, the menu in actuality is pretty limited. One of my biggest pet peeves about this place is that every time I come here, I have a discussion with the hostess at the front about how Phil's should have Mac and Cheese. The hostess always tells me they feel the same way. It only makes sense for me to have my mac and cheese with my BBQ!

There are plenty of reviews here about how good Phil's is so I will just write about a few things that made it even better for me! - TICKLER options are smaller portions and allow you to enjoy Phil's without feeling like you doubled in size! And it lets you feel like you have some self-control even though you really don't. I got the baby back ribs tickler and it came with plenty of cole slaw, fries, and 2 onion rings (OMG delish). I was very happy and full, but not bursting. - CLEAN: Yes, a clean BBQ joint! Phil's does a few things that really impressed me, and some of you may not care about clean, but I do! They have this glorious trough-like stainless steel hand-washing, automated soap-dispensing, automated paper towel thing in the back, next to the bathrooms. It is GLORIOUS! Right when I was noticing that Phil's did not give me any wetnaps to clean my hands, I walked over and saw the shiny hand-washing station. I was in love! Inside the bathroom, Phil's also has a way for you to open the restroom door from the inside without using your hands - it is a forearm handle. First time I've ever seen that. I prefer the shiny hand-washing station outside, but still, a place that values cleanliness like that is a gem indeed. - FRIENDLY STAFF OUTSIDE: We ate outside and there was a nice server there to help. He seemed solely dedicated to the patio area which is nice because I thought it would just be a self-serve type of place. Overall, it is the little extras that puts Phil's in a category above the rest!

Lucky me, first time trying it and NO LINE. After trying it I'm glad that I didn't have to wait in line for this place. ÊThe bbq is good but definitely not so good that I'd wait more than thirty minutes for it. The good: 1. Yes, the ribs are indeed "fall of the bones" tender. ÊI can't stand places that claim that they are fall off the bone when they really are not. 2. Generous with the sauce. ÊI love sauce, and when it comes to bbq... I need a whole bottle's worth. 3. AMAZING onion rings. ÊFried so perfectly! ÊGreat batter and good bite to it! The not so good: 1. The sauce. ÊI think a good sauce is just as crucial as the meat for bbq. ÊI'm not a big fan of this sauce. ÊIt's too tangy/sour/tart whatever you want to call it. ÊToo many parts vinegar for my liking. Ê 2. The party of 6 or larger to sit at the bigger tables rule. ÊI think that needs to change to a party of 5 or bigger. ÊThere is no comfortable way that a group of 5 adults can sit anywhere else at Phils other than at the large tables. ÊMy party sat the bigger table anyway even though we were 5, but I don't want to feel like I'm committing some cardinal sin while doing it. Ê Phils is a decent bbq joint. ÊTasty bbq that I'd come back for, but wouldn't wait in line for.

Visiting San Diego this place was unknown to me, but like my father who is an avid Yelper- this many good reviews can't be wrong-right?! First off the line was around the building. I like BBQ all right but an hour or more wait to eat some ribs? Maybe I am just impatient. By the time we got around to the "picture booth" which was not working I was just agitated. Once we ordered, sat, and got our food things went smoothly. The staff is super friendly. The food-meh. It was good, it was hot, would I wait another hour to eat here on another day knowing what I know now? No. I would order to go and pick it up next time but it certainly did not warrant the wait. I don't think it was as good as everyone says. Portions were great, but it's just BBQ people.

While researching places to eat in San Diego Phil's BBQ always seems to be the first thing to pop up so how could I not try a place with over 4000 reviews? ÊObviously Phil's is doing something right if people will wait for hours for a plate of BBQ. Ê I went on a Tuesday night before 6PM based on all the warnings of long lines after 6PM and there was already a line out the door. ÊThe food looked promising as my friend and I were staring jealously at all the people eating their BBQ. ÊAfter about a 30 minute wait we got to the front of the line and we each ordered a full rack of baby back ribs with two sides each, onion rings, and a couple of sodas which came out to about 55 bucks. ÊThey give you a little buzzer when your food is ready and you find your own seats which is easy to do. ÊEverything is self serve from drinks to getting your own leftover boxes and bags. ÊThey have their system down to a tee which is great especially for a place that is so busy. ÊWithin five minutes of sitting down, our food was ready. As soon as I saw my friend bringing over two huge pizza pan trays of food I knew we ordered too much. ÊWe both got greedy due to hunger and one rack of ribs is definitely enough for two people. ÊThe ribs were definitely tender but I did not like the sauce. ÊIt was too tangy for me, I'm more of a sweet and spicy kind of a gal. ÊI got coleslaw and macaroni salad as my sides which were good as were the jumbo onion rings. ÊWe ordered the small onion rings which was a pretty large portion, I'm scared to see what large looks like. ÊI kind of feel like the place was a bit hyped for me but then again bbq sauce is based on personal taste preference. ÊAlso keep in mind California is not the mecca of great bbq so this is probably the best bbq we can get here in so Cal. ÊYour only other option here may be Chili's or another chain restaurant. Based on the food I would say 3.5 but I'm bumping it to a 4 since it was a nice experience for my first time at Phil's.

3.5 This place is WAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY too hyped up. Sadly, it didn't meet my expectations because I wanted the best damn barbecue baby-back ribs. When I got my ribs, it was mostly fat and not that much meat... and maybe it was a rare occasion that my order was like this but hey, I'm just reporting on my personal experience there. The BBQ sauce was really sweet and it goes well with everything. I tried the BBQ chicken and onion rings as well and it's nothing spectacular. I felt like I've had better chicken and definitely had better onion rings elsewhere. The wait was like 40 minutes (which isn't a big issue... I've waited 2 hours for a donut once) and in the end, it wasn't really worth it for me. I probably wouldn't drive out to San Diego to try this again.

Better than Lucille's. Better than ANY BBQ joint I have ever sank my teeth into. There's a reason why people will wait 2 hours outside, in line to eat Phil's BBQ. We came on a Sunday at 11:30 (they open at 11am) and there was a line...luckily we only had to wait 40mins. We actually came here the night before at peak dinner hour and we were way too hungry to wait 2 hours. Next time, order to go, surpass the line, and enjoy the ribs at home, at a park, or on the beach.

The hype is alive! And the hype demolishes the wait. The ribs are obviously the way to go. Beefy Ribs are humongous. 5 beefy bones is very difficult to complete. 5 does not sound like much, but it is enough. Also, their onion rings are a good complement to the ribs. The only thing holding this review/rating back from a 5-Star is the massive amount of their signature BBQ sauce they put on their ribs. I know that is what they are known for, but it was way too much for me. Next time I am going to try the baby back, and ask for their BBQ sauce on the side. Other than that, Phil's BBQ is a must visit spot when in the San Diego area.

My friends were stoked to eat here, and I thought they were just hyping it up. NOPE! It was amazing! We waited in a long line (that was totally worth the food!), and while in line, there was a photo op machine that my friends and I had fun with! Super cool =) Then there's the official tweet spot. Gah! I totally tweeted on there without even realizing I was standing on it! =) So cool! Then we walked in ordered food. My friend and I shared a whole rack of baby back ribs, fries and cole slaw. =) Yum! The ribs were cooked so perfectly, and they tasted amazing! They also provide bibs for people who want them (like my friends and I, who were first timers!). Best ribs I've ever had in my life =) Definitely earned those 5 stars!

My friends and I ended up at Phil's BBQ after a long day at Sea World. We were starving and ordered a BBQ Turkey Burger, several Baby Back Rib & Chicken Dinners, the Colossal Onion Rings, Baked Potato, Corn-on-the-Cob, Steamed Veggies, Fresh Cut Fries, Sweet Baked Beans, Fresh Cole Slaw, Potato Salad, and a Macaroni Salad. The BBQ and sides were fantastic. I loved the Turkey Burger, Onion RIngs, and Fresh Cut Fries. The next time I am in San Diego I will make it a point to visit.

The short version: (out of 5) Flavor: 5 Originality: 5 Presentation: 5 Thanks to Adam Richman's Best Sandwich in America. ÊBy chance I happened to watch the show the night before leaving for San Diego. ÊAfter being crowned the best sandwich on the West Coast, I had to try it. I had worked up a massive appetite biking from Coronado. ÊThe place is quite popular so expect a long wait. ÊIf you're by yourself, skip the line and try getting a seat by the bar. ÊBetter yet, if you're in a hurry, call in your order. I spent an hour in line in anticipation for this meal but I was able to get a small sample of an onion ring and was really impressed. ÊVery nice crunch with a flavorful thick onion inside. ÊThe ranch dressing had a nice tang to it. ÊI needed more. ÊCould these be the best onion rings I ever tasted? I finally bellied up to the counter and placed my order. ÊThe tri-tipped sandwich (El Toro), beef rib dinner which comes with two same sides or one large one. ÊSince the onion rings don't count as a side, I order the "small" portion of rings and the fries and cole slaw as my sides. They give you a pager as you wait for your meal. ÊAbout 10 minutes later, 3 trays worth of bbq goodness was there to greet me. ÊI needed an extra pair of hands to help me get all the food back to my table. I attacked the bull sandwich with both hands. ÊThe tri-tip was a cut I was unfamiliar with. ÊYou could tell that the firmness was braised long enough to leave succulent portion meat afterwards. ÊThe "sauce is the boss." ÊFeel free to order some extra. ÊThe variety of spices meld together complementing any meat or side dish. Based on the suggestions on yelp, the beef ribs were where it was at. ÊWith the dinner portion, you get five bones. ÊThese are massive. ÊNot enough to tip over a Fred Flintstone car but good enough to fill most people up after two. ÊKeep in mind that I only ordered the small portion of fries and cole slaw. ÊThe slaw was pretty typical and about the portion of a cup that you'd see at KFC. ÊBut man the fries. ÊI don't know if they were feeling generous that day, but the ribs were layed out beautifully on this bed of potatoe heaven. Ê Getting back to the beef ribs. ÊThey had a nice char which balanced out the fat against the tenderness of the slow cooked beef. ÊJust admit to yourself now that there is no way your mouth will remain spotless when eating the ribs. ÊGood thing the have a roll of paper towels on each table. ÊBibs are available if you need them. Lest we not forget about the onion rings. ÊThese are huge. ÊLike size of your hand huge. ÊNot sure where they source them from but I would imagine they won first place in the county fair. ÊAfter devouring through them, I can confirm that these are the best rings I've ever tasted. The meals are best shared and I would challenge anyone to leave here hungry. Thanks Phil. ÊI'll you again in September.

Who hasn't heard of Phil's. I mean everyone talks about Phil's and San Diego in the same sentence. I hear things over the years but I've never been tempted to try it. I mean how good can BBQ get right? I had some buddies kidnap me and take me here for lunch on a Saturday. I hear crazy stories about the lines being out the door and wrapping around the parking lot. It wasn't so bad when I was there. It was out the door but it took only 20 minutes. It moved pretty fast. They had the menu posted all over so you can plan out your route of attack and conquer. Once we got in, we ordered and received a vibrating pager. The food took like 5 minutes before the pager rang and we carried platters of meat back to our seats. My first thought was everything was so cheap for good quality BBQ. My second thought was how am I going to finish all this. I ordered the Beefy Rib and Chicken Dinner for about $13. There was plenty of meat and sides to feed a family of 3. The BBQ sauce was addicting. The ribs fell off the bones and melted in your mouth. The corn was sweet. I liked the condiments they had at the table. On top of everything, we ordered a large Colossal Onion Rings which we could be a meal in itself. I didn't eat again for about 12 hours! Next time let's pace ourselves shall we? There are 2 wash stations on opposite sides of the restaurant to get all the grease out of your fingernails. Next time you come here, make sure you wait because it was worth it. Don't flake out and eat at Red Lobster next door, that would be pathetic and you will regret it.

SO good and so cheap ! I was supposed to go here for a graduation party, but we switched locations because it was so busy. I wish I went earlier ! But I finally got to go and it was SO good ! I honestly thought it was going to be over hyped because a lot of my friends raved about how good phils was and it totally met up to my expectations ! We went at an awkward time between lunch and dinner so we didn't have to wait for more than 5 minutes. The food came out surprisingly really fast too! I got the baby back rib tickler and I got really full too. I read in the description that it comes with two onion rings and I thought they were gonna be small, but they were HUGE. I couldn't even finish my whole plate. I wish there was a phils bbq in the LA area !

OK, front of the line BIRTHDAY PASS.. most awesome thing evvver! Ditch the hour and a half line on the week of your birthday by signing up with Phil's Fan Mail. Took 3 of my friends with me, jumped to the front of the line after secretly feeling deep satisfaction as I looked at each person and ditching the line that wrapped around the building. Handed over the birthday pass email and my ID to the host and ordered within 2 minutes. Sat down and literally my order was done in 5 minutes. I looked like a little girl in a candy shop as I took a look at my "Best of Both Worlds" order. Got the baby back ribs and 1/4 chicken dinner with a large corn on the cob with the sauce on the side. PERFECT ORDER. Both chicken and ribs were easy to pull off the bone and the tangy BBQ sauce to top it off was delicious. Got to try the fries and the mac salad ad both are highly recommended. Got to taste the el toro sandwich, and definitely has my seal of approval! I was such a happy camper that day! Granted if I had to wait an hour and half this review might be a 4 star rather than a 5 as I do get a little bit***, I mean, cranky when I'm hungry. But this birthday pass was like gold. Loved it!

On my way to Del Mar and decided to see what Phil's was about. Parked to find a line around the building, which is what I was expecting. No worries. Made friends in line that gave me and the Mrs. the lowdown and what they liked. 45 minutes later, we were ordering! We shared the pork Rib Dinner with macaroni salad and coleslaw, small order of Onion Rings and the Tri tip sandwich (Matador). Impressed with the service and how dialed in the operation is. Finding a seat was no problem. We have had traditional BBQ, so not sure what to expect. Pork Ribs were meaty and really good! Make sure to order extra sauce on the side to get your fix. The ribs can be a little dry, but that is the way i like it. The tri tip sandwich was excellent! The tangy sweet tastes was smokey and very flavorful. The onion rings were plentiful and so glad we ordered the small. They were crispy and really good! The sides were good too! To ne honest, this was an excellent dinner and was worth the experience. I am still dreaming about those ribs! Make sure to get a Red Velvet Whoopy Pie! AWESOMENESS! I will be back.

This place serves Kansas style bbq -- so the sauce is sweet. Like everyone mentioned, expect a wait ... even on an off peak hour. We waited 1/2 hr. You order at the counter, pick up at the side when you're buzzed. Seating is free for all minus the seats with "for groups" sign. Despite the wait, the order was fast and efficient. We got their combo ... half baby back ribs with chicken. It comes with two small sides so we opted for the sweet beans and macaroni salad. Since everyone touts their onion rings, we got a small order of that too. SMALL is an understatement ... we could NOT finish the onion rings. It was definitely good though. I liked how tender the meats were but wasn't a fan of the drenched sweetness of the sauce -- next time I'll have to order with it on the side. The sides weren't too memorable. Overall, a good experience. Tender, moist meat with deliciously deep fried onion rings are always a winner in my book. But, hold the sauce please. ;) ... btw... free re-fills!! We got to - go cups and filled it up before leaving. :)

I guess I'm contributing to Phil's selling point of over 1,000 5-star reviews here on Yelp but I honestly feel like it's that good. One of the first things you'll notice is the line. A line that literally stretches around the block. It's funny b/c I really didn't know anything about this place and no one had told me about it and I vaguely remembered seeing this name on someone's Facebook status a long time ago. But this place is right across from my hotel so we decided to go. Even though the line looks daunting, it's really a matter of crowd control for Phil's since they are inundated with families, large parties and everyone in between. You get a good long opportunity to decide what it is you want to order and then when you give your order to the people, you wait for your little electronic buzzer thing to go off. My family got the BBQ ribs and chicken and fries, macaroni salad and potato salad. Yes, obviously an incredibly healthy meal. But the meat. My god. The meat was SO. GOOD. I've never been to a real BBQ place and the only one near FC is that shitty Armadillo Willy's place. But this is authentic, "made with love" kind of BBQ. The sauce was amazing and the meat literally fell off the bones. It was not greasy or gross or overly sweet or anything. It was all just so good. And their onion rings are MASSIVE. We got the small order which was about 6 rings and that alone could have filled us up. And what I like about this place the most is how self-autonomous you an be. Essentially the wait staff is there to guide you and take your order, but you get the drinks and plates and utensils yourself and since they know you can't finish it all, all of the take-out materials (to-go box, bags, etc) are all there for you. I really liked having that there. And even though it was busy and crazy it never once felt crowded or overwhelming or out-of-control. Everyone working there knew what they were doing and were very friendly. I can definitely see why this place has gotten so many 5-star reviews! They need one in SF!

Great service here! Staff is extremely friendly :) I ordered the BBQ Baby Back ribs (that is pork) as well as the beef sandwich and they tasted pretty good. I'm a bit sensitive when it comes to saltiness, and I felt that the BBQ sauce on the ribs was a bit overwhelming for me, and I noticed myself constantly rubbing the sauce off the ribs before eating them. Nevertheless, the ribs were tender and the sandwich was huge and filling! The potato salad was very good, and the sweet baked beans were tasty. However, because of the crazy wait time, I wouldn't come back that often.

Was it bombdotcom and all that? YUP! Was it worth the hype? YUP? Worth the 40 minutes wait at 9:30pm on a sunday evening? Definitely. Yes yes, some people really don't see what's so special about PHIL's bbq, but simply put .. their ribs are AMAZING! Tender, sweet, juicy...and a whole mound of sauce. I have to say, you have to LOVE lots of sauce on your ribs to like the ribs here. If you're more of a dry rub kinda person, this might not be your place. I've been waiting to try this staple for the longest time and I am glad i finally did. Honestly, the prices are decent, portions are huge, and the service is amazing. You even get a cute little piggy sticker to indicate to the waiters that you're a "first timer". Everyone is very eager to help you make the best selection possible. A friend and i share a full rack of ribs with 2 sides and another dinner plate with a quarter chicken. I went with a group of 4 and the 4 of us shared another order of onion rings. WAY TOO MUCH FOOD. The next time i would definitely just get a tickler plate. That seems like more than enough food for one individual. If you had to get anything, go for the RIBS! The chicken was juicy and moist, but nothing too spectacular. Make sure you go with friends that are as eager as you to have succulent juicy bbq pork. Otherwise the wait might seem like a long journey. Well worth the wait though, and will definitely return....after several months of detoxing.

@PhilsBBQSD finally! After sitting in 3+ hours of traffic, all my friends and I wanted to do was get to Phil's BBQ as fast as we can. Traffic from LA to SD was horrendous since it was Comic-con weekend and I was expecting that the craziness would extend to the very popular Phil's BBQ. I was a bit worried about the parking and how long the wait would be. Luck seemed to be at our side when we scored parking right up at the front. The wait to get in wasn't even long! 15 minutes, yay! Waiting in line to Phil's BBQ reminds me of Disneyland. It's like that Big Thunder Mountain ride with all the wooden panels and signs. I guess I wasn't the only one who felt that way since I overheard the folks in front of us say something similar :). I was tempted to get one of the rib or chicken plates but my friends and I had a whole day of SD foodie adventures planned out and I wasn't sure if it would be wise to eat so much so early. This was only stop one of of our foodie adventure Saturday! I ended up getting the El Toro sandwich ($6.95) and a small side of fresh cole slaw ($1.50). So much for a small first meal because this sandwich was huge. The sandwich was overflowing with char-grilled tri-tip and oozing with BBQ sauce. It was one messy and tasty sandwich and I got through about half of it before deciding to box the other half. The cole slaw was just OK for me. It was fresh, light and crispy. Thought the cole slaw was OK, I will be choosing to get another side next time I am here. I also ended up taking half of this home. Lastly, I was debating about getting a dessert to take home but I had heard great things about the red velvet whoopie pie. The red velvet fanatic inside of me convinced me to not walk away without getting one and I am so glad. It was such a yummy huge treat. It was big, sweet and wonderful :). The red velvet itself was nice and moist and the filling inside was delightful. Heaven in a little red pie :). People reading this review, get this! You won't regret it :) I am review #4101 of Phil's BBQ. All my Yelp friends love this place and this place was listed before as one of the top ten places to try in California. After my trip here, I can see why :).

Phil's BBQ reminds me of one of those food spots that they have in disneyland. boyfriend and i came here for a late lunch. probably around 2pm. anyways, we didn't expect it to be busy but when we got there there was a HUGE HUGE HUGE line. i almost didn't want to eat here anymore, but since i've been wanting to try it forever i waited. first off, don't get turned off by the line. it actually goes by quickly. why it reminds me of a disneyland food spot is because as you wait in line there are two menus to look at and decide what you want. as you wait, you can also take a picture. not sure how much it cost but they have a photo booth lol. moving on, as you enter you wait until one of the cashiers are available to take your order. after placing your order you take a buzzer and find a seat. drinks, utensils, plates, bibs, etc are all self serve. when your buzzer goes off you get your food. this place has a restaurant vibe, but it really isn't. no one takes your order, gets your drink, etc. i think their way of doing things help people come in and out quickly and efficiently. food: half order of baby back ribs: they use a dry rub and bbq sauce. i actually really like the dry rub. the bbq sauce is okay. the ribs were really tender and moist. the meat just falls off the bone. sides: cole slaw: def. not my favorite. baked beans: WOW they are amazing! def. will order this again. colossal onion rings: small order is def. enough for 2-3 people. i actually really really liked them. the batter is def. not something i've had before. it's really good. these onion rings were very crispy as well.

When we arrived, the line looked like it was going to be over an hour and half wait. So being hungry like we were and craving bbq, decided to just call our order in and get into the shorter phone in to go line. Been coming to Phil's for years, but tonight was very disappointing. I don't know if it's because it was a really busy night and they're trying to get food out as quick as possible but the order of FULL BABY BACK RIB DINNER we got was NOT COOKED THROUGH. More than half the ribs were not up to the Phil's standard we are used to. It was UNDERCOOKED, TASTED WAY OFF, and NOT fall off the bone goodness. Would this experience stop me from coming back? Probably not. But I just want Phil's BBQ to pay attention to the quality of the food they send out. Also, I was told SWEET TEA was coming back but it's not. Whatever tea they have is not the same. I miss that Gold Peak machine.

Once every month I'd scrap all my change go to Phil's and treat myself to some bomb-ass RIBS! (student life!) YES, there's a wait. Who cares its worth it. I'm usually in line for 20-40 mins. If you can't wait, get it to go or eat at the bar and enjoy some beer. If you're a beast get the full rack. If you're a vagina boy/girl get the half rack(still gets the job done). The main dishes come with two sides. I'd recommend the fries, potato salad and the mac salad. There is cole slaw, unfortunately I dislike cole slaw. I been to a couple of rib joints and I AM NO RIB EXPERT but the sauce here is damn delicious. It's sweet, tangy, with a side Chuck Norris round houses. Trust me you're, winning if you dine here. The only thing ISSS, I've had their half rib half chicken entree and for some reason the chicken is not always consistant. Sometimes its on point and sometimes its dry. Also the last time I ate at Phil's I felt like the side portions became rabbit sized. Economy? MAYBE! Phil's financially hurting? SIKE, they basically own that plaza! Def. recommend this place THO!

I've been to Phil's bbq at least 5 times, so I can't believe I never review them. Oh well.. First couple of times going there, I've always ordered the best of two, starting with beefy rib and chicken, beefy rib and chick-less, baby back ribs with chicken and chickless. On those four occasion, I have to say that the chicken and chick-less meat are quite ordinary. Nothing special with them other than if you just dump a lot of bbq sauce there. Beefy rib is good, but I still prefer the texture and taste of the baby back ribs. BBQ sauces are as amazing and tasty as always, and the onion ring is very good. On all occasions, I've got to wait in line at least 20-40 minutes, but the wait is worth it because I've had a great time hanging out and eating with friends. My last visit to Phil's was about a week ago, and it's as packed as it's always been. However, I kinda want to try something new from the menu, so I ordered the baby back Tickle and the BBQ Broham (basicaly pulled pork BBQ). I want to say that both foods are a good deal for what I actually got. For the tickler, I got pretty much 3 baby back ribs, 2 onions rings, fries, and coleslaw for just $7, and the Broham is about the same price with a freaking large amount of pulled pork on top of a bun with another bun aside from it. That pulled pork is very good, but remember to ask for an extra BBQ sauce coz I will need it to devour all those pulled porks. Anyway, the food's as good as I can remember, and will most definitely come back next time

Beef ribs hands down. Forget the long line. Forget the hype. Forget the obvious blatant request for 5 star yelp reviews on many of the banners. The beef ribs are freakin good. My GF took all the babyback ribs. I did not give a shit. More beef ribs for me!! I didn't care for the onion rings. They were extremely oily, and some were soggy. Giant? Sure. Not the tastiest though.

Phil's, Phil's, Phil's... Some people plan a trip to San Diego just to get this place off their bookmarks, haha. I didn't come down there just for Phil's but it was a no brainer that I stop by here while in the area. This place has over 4000 reviews, so I'll just point out a few things. Even though I waited an hour in line (Friday night), I was amazed at the efficiency of this place. Once we got in and ordered, my food was literally ready before I sat down. Portions are much larger than other BBQ places; I feel like 1 full rack order that comes with 2 sides are enough to feed 2 people (unless your name is Connie C.). I deliberately avoided eating for 8hrs. to pig out at Phil's but I was no match and could barely finish half of my full rack order. Food wise, I wasn't a fan of their BBQ sauce. Too tangy for me. I would've loved some selection with the sauce to be honest. Onion rings were meh, didn't live up to the expectations set from reading the reviews; a little too hard and not flaky enough for me. The quarter chicken I got was a pleasant surprise though, and I think I enjoyed it more than the pork ribs. Some things that really impressed me were the service (even though this place is pretty much self-service, you'll see what I mean when you go there), the sinks behind the soda fountains where you can conveniently wash your hands without going to the bathroom (pure genius), and the arm hook on the bathroom door. I wish every restaurant puts this on their doors because I hate touching doorknobs; I know I washed my hand, but did the guy before me who used the knob wash his hand? Well the arm hook solves that problem! Food only, 3 stars for Phil's. But in total, as an eating facility Phil's gets bumped to 4 stars. There really aren't many places you can wait an hour and say you were impressed by their efficiency.

Had to yelp Phil's to become the 4111 person to review this amazing place. This place really does stand up to all the hype around it, and is probably the best BBQ I have had from San diego... But this is not the best overall BBQ I have ever had, But probably the best Baby Back Ribs, but it is a close one between Phil's and Henry's Hi-Life in San Jose. Ê The line was out the door, around the corner at the front, around the corner in the side, and into the parking lot. ÊI waited in line for about 5 minutes and decided to order a beer at their beer stand out front. ÊGlad I did because the guy working the stand informed me their was a couple seats inside at the bar... Saving us at LEAST an hr of waiting in line. Ê Got the half Baby Back, half beef rib dinner. The beef ribs are waaay tinier than the pork, and much less juicy and tender. ÊThey weren't at all bad but would not order them again. Ê The Pork BABY BACK is where its at!!! The ribs are glazed with Phil's bomb ass bbq sauce to the point where they STICK to your TEETH. ÊSo tender, the meat just falls off the bone. ÊWOW i am salivating just writing this review. Ê Onion rings are bombay, but their coleslaw had too much cabbage and their fries are nothing special. ÊGot a Kona Brewing Co. Maui Coconut and some other beer from a Mission Brewery in DAYGO and made for the perfect lunch.

Service: 5/5 Food: 3.5/5 - meat lovers would disagree with me! Cleanliness: 4/5 Area: 4/5 Price: 5/5 - a lot of food for what you pay. So I came to San Diego before and me and my boyfriend were trying to eat dinner here and the wait was 2 hours long. ridiculous. but we came at 11:30am before rush-hour and got our food very quickly. Service was very helpful, the cashier explained and helped me pick my side-dishes and explained to me what the Chick-less dinner plate was. So I gave her a 5/5. She took the time to acknowledge my existence as a costumer. Food wasn't what I hoped for. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing, or maybe I'm just not a big fan on meaty plates but I wasn't feeling the Chick-less dinner. The proportions are huge and big for the price you pay. I had leftover lunch for the next day, however they are known for their baby back ribs and probably the sloppy joe which I saw a lot of people ordering but they could consider making the "less fattening meals" taste better. I felt that the chicken just was covered in sauce and really lacked juiciness unlike my boyfriends ribs which were pretty good and the pork could be pulled right off the bone. the fries were pretty good and crispy and baked beans were okay, which is why i think this place is only known for just the ribs. I guess my advice is don't order what I got, and if you like big portions. go for it. but I wouldn't wait 2 hours to eat here. i feel if the restaurant took the time to better their other dishes, I would've gave them more of a plus. I'm just not that into meat i guess.

Wow! More ribs than I can chew! Tender baby back rib.... makes me want to sing the Chili Baby Back Rib song in my head over and over again! The beefy rib just melt off the bones. Usually pork is the meat of choice, but when I tried my friend's beef rib... man... I wish I was a carnivorous cow with 4 stomachs keep all the food in! Why do they call their fries small portion? It's more like XL and XXL... I had to tell myself that it's not worthy getting a heart attack. Live to eat another day, y'know? I enjoyed my coleslaw... KFC is still my standard by which to judge all coleslaw... and this is pretty close. Beans are sweet... hmm... I'm not much of a bean person and still probably won't get it. Nevertheless, I can see why people like it. Oh yea, get the onion rings! It's different than most places... I don't know how to describe it but whatever adjective I use it's synonymous to good.

Boy was I disappointed with this place. I was surprised to see that the menu did NOT have brisket, pulled pork or hot links. I don't know about you, but a proper BBQ establishment should have those items as Êstandard, right? I ordered the "Rib-Less Dinner"... That's just pork shoulder chunks. It came really fast, (Despite how busy they were and I was pretty impressed with that)... And it was a HUGE portion, almost enough to share... Though the meat was definitely NOT slow cooked in a smoker, therefore it wasn't BBQ'd, okay? Was the pork of good quality? Yes it was, though all I'm saying is that it's not the real thing, that's all. But what really shocked me was that everything comes out of the kitchen smothered in a very sweet sauce, almost like a Chinese sweet & sour takeout style. So did I finish my plate? Yes I was hungry! Would I return? Probably not because this IS NOT real BBQ. However if you are just plain hungry, or got a family to feed, or want large portions at reasonable prices, or worse if you don't know how glorious 'real' BBQ is, then this place is for you, (As long as you're not a diabetic).

I came here for the full baby back rib dinner with a large side order of fries and a fountain drink with free refills ($23.64 total). The meat falls off the bone and you get this smokey and savory flavor in every bite. This may be weird, but if you're daring dip your ribs in extra bbq sauce and sour cream, it'll give that cool refreshing taste in your palate from the bbq sauce (that's just nasty bro). The fries were on point, crispy and moist. If your hands are already filled with bbq sauce and you don't want to use a ketchup bottle, just dip it in the excess bbq sauce that's all over your plate, you won't regret it. As you wait for your food, prep by ripping out paper towels for you and your friends so the roll won't be stained by your bbq fingerprints (MY GERMS!!!). Also get some wet naps armed and ready when you're finished devouring your feast of a meal. Expect a long line, being a vulture when it comes to finding a table (unless you're with a big party), and a full stomach. Call your friends or relatives also when you're waiting in line and tell them to go to the Phil's bbq website to see you in the live cam feed online. "OH S___!!!, I'M ON CAMERA, FIRST THE POLICE NOW THIS!!!" I took my friends word going here, and now take mine and all of our 4-5 star ratings here.

Delicious baby back ribs that are also affordable. This is the place to get your barbeque fix when you're feeling your carnivourus side of you bubbling to the surface. If you're looking for a full rack of ribs, which I am pretty much always down for, and dont want to pay $23 or even more at the high end restaurants just for the ribs by itself, Phils BBQ is the place to be with their full baby rack dinner including 2 sides for $19.99 (I hope that's right!) With the enormous amount of sides that they give you, I highly suggest that you split the sides with someone. My best suggestion here is to order one of their dinner combos to include the two sides, and have the second person only order whatever meat they want to eat. You will definitely not regret it when you're actually able to stand up from your table. I've done the whole dinner on my own once and couldn't stand up for a good 15 minutes before I digested just enough to get out of the place so the other customers who are standing in line for what is usually about half an hour can have a table to eat their delicious barbeque at. Aside from their deliciously affordable massive amounts of barbeque, the people here are just SO NICE! All the servers who work here talk like they love what they do, and that makes me happy that I can eat at this establishment. Their tables are cleaned really fast so their efficiency will make it so that your wait isn't longer than it should be. Once you order, you get your food only with a few minutes of you getting the pager in your hand to tell you when the food is ready. They give you so much condiments so you'll never feel like you're lacking anything! Cajun seasoning on your table goes super well with the fries! Overall LOVE this place!

Totally need to try this place out if you're in SD and you're a fan of BBQ. I've had this place bookmarked for months!!! So I was excited when we finally found my way down here. FOOD: Delicious, it's really not a sweet BBQ. It has so many different dimensions to it: sweet, smokey, spicey, and a bit of tartness to it. In my opinion it is as BBQ should be. It's also smoked/grilled BBQ, not boiled. Definitely cool points on that. The ONION RINGS are massive and battered perfectly. SERVICE: I'm including the wait in the service department. Ridiculous!!!! I get that this is good food, but the wait is a turnoff. It's also the reason for the knocking down of a coveted star. Btw we came on a weekday, around 3-4p so I suspect this is a natural occurrence. Luckily, I'm a savvy Yelper and realized that I could phone in my order. SCORE! So that's exactly what I did. As the throngs of people waited restlessly, the mister and I simply breezed by to the pickup line. All this took about 15 mins... possibly less. We ended up eating in the car, because you can't sit in if you take out. But who cares?! Gotta love Yelp for all these helpful tips ;) I do wish they had a better selection of sides. What BBQ place doesn't carry mac n cheese???? C'mon! Totally BBQ staple!

What can be said that hasn't been said already. It's arguably the best BBQ joint in Southern California. The meat, sauce, side items - everything's excellent. It's a great location being right by the San Diego Sports Arena and Sea World. The only reason I give this place four stars instead of five is the fact that it's ALWAYS crowded. The lines build up before the place even opens. But as the other reviews mention, it's worth the wait. There's a reason the lines are huge. Try to come during an off time, you'll be glad you did.

The onion rings are amazing. The line kinda sucks. Go with friends that you enjoy talking to/hanging out with. The ribs are decent. If you like the sauce, then you'll like the ribs...if you don't, you won't. I don't crave Phil's, but I definitely like it. The ribs are easy to eat because the meat just falls right off the bone :) I DO crave my dad's BBQ cooking, but then again...that's a different story.

Is there any real reason to review this place anymore? Phil's is outstanding, but I've only ever had it to-go, which apparently is the the way to go on a crowded night (which might just be every night). Calling in ahead of time is a life saver. The lines look daunting but there, on the left, is your very own express lane, also known as the side-eye line as all of the hungry people in line for a seat glare at you for calling in your order. The beef ribs are ginormous and have flavor as big as the ribs themselves. I'm a pretty big eater and I couldn't tackle three ribs plus fries and slaw in one sitting. Come hungry or be prepared to be defeated. Quick side note, after picking up our food, we were deterred from our immediate course straight freaking home so we could eat by cravings of Extraordinary Dessert and the need to drop food off for a friend. Despite these delays of about an hour, the food was STILL warm and delicious when we finally did get down to eating. The fries had cooled off and got a bit soggy, naturally, but everything else was outstanding. Just a heads up for anyone worried about traffic or a commute on a pick-up order.

I don't know why it took this long to get my butt over here. But that's not important because yesterday, I finally got to taste the famous baby back ribs. And it did not disappoint! Truly did fall off the bone! For sides, we got the onion rings (huuuuge and crispy), mac salad (This was just okay.), cole slaw (Liked this better than mac salad), and corn on the cob. Onion rings = #1 side. The next time I come here, I don't think I'll even bother getting any side with my ribs except onion rings!

By far the best barbecue that I have ever had. Came here on a Saturday afternoon on Memorial day weekend. Yes the line is long and parking can be a pain in the butt but it's totally worth it. Did I mention you can grab a cup of beer while in line too? I had the half rack pork ribs dinner with macaroni salad and beans. I don't usually get beans but damn it was all good. Pork meat came right off the bone. Since I knew I wasn't going to come back for awhile I also ordered the BBQ pulled pork sandwich with cole slaw. Took a bite out of it but I was already done for lunch. Anyways, it still tasted just as good the next day for lunch! Oh and a quick note, get a bib and if you want extra barbecue sauce you can ask the servers! There are restrooms if you need to do your business and there's a massive sink if you just need to wash your hands from all that barbecue sauce too!

Had to hit this place with 4000+ Yelp reviews. And it lived up to its hype. Probably said 4000 times already, smokey fall off the bone baby backs with such delicious sauce that I shamelessly licked my fingers in public endlessly (and probably would have licked anyone else's fingers with bbq sauce on them too). Beef rib was succulent and tasty. The onion rings were huge and good if you love thickly battered stuff... if not, you can pass on this. Bottom line: Crazy busy place with even a separate wait line for pickup orders (?!). Friendly staff with kickass ribs. All hail to Phil's.

Beef ribs are top notch here! So tender and juicy and drenched with their signature wet BBQ sauce. Baby-back ribs are really good here too! Half a rack is pretty huge!! 3 Beef Sampler is also very huge. They are really generous in terms of portions! Sssshhh don't tell them I said that. :P This is definitely Home of San Diego's most famous BBQ joint! Over 4000 reviews and counting! They do a real good job with marinating and cooking lots of meat! There's always a lineup to get your order/seats anytime during the day. Very surprised at how well they maintain the quality that comes out of their kitchen with such a large continuous mass of people ordering. The staff are very nice here. Very prompt in providing plates and utensils and providing wet naps! They even have their boss/managers ask around to make sure everyone is enjoying their meals! So thoughtful of them! I do agree that waiting for over an hour is a bit overkill. If I want food I want it now or soon! Be aware they close on Mondays! Many times I myself or friends crave to go on a Monday just to be so excited to see that there's no lineup but oh crap it's closed!! It's funny because their menu never really mentions about lunch options. Food portions is just so huge here that it's more dinner high calories meals! The prices are pretty fair I think for what you get. There are secrets to beating the lineup. One, just order it to go and you completely bypass the lineup. Or you could also just eat at the bar and order the food. Those are the best bets if you go during their peak hours. If not, you'll have to suffer waiting in line. Definitely a must try if you come to San Diego!

Phil's is good. Long wait, but fine if you're waiting with a group. The red velvet cream pie was so good! Ribs fall off the bone, you know... what you'd expect from a BBQ place! Food comes out fast and portions are huge. I shared. Mac salad is yum!

Not much more to add here that hasn't been said. Took advice and got it to go. ÊRestaurant felt too much like an amusement park. Staff VERY friendly. We got the baby backs and it was indeed falling off the bone. My only complaint was the sauce was way to sweet and took away from any smoke flavor of the ribs.

Visited this place on my way to check out Comic Con. ÊFriends said its suppose to be one of the top 10 places for BBQ in America. ÊSo I thought we might as well give it a shot since we were around the area. This place did not disappoint. ÊThe baby back ribs were amazing. ÊSweet and tangy and also meat so soft it falls off the bone. ÊYou must get the onion rings as it is off the chain good. ÊThe onions rings here put other places onion rings to shame. ÊI also had the El Toro sandwich which is a deli sliced trip tip with bbq sauce. ÊThe pulled pork sandwich was also very delicious. ÊYes I ate all that. ÊI was stuck in traffic for 4.5 hours and was starving all the way through traffic for this so I might as well make the most of it. Ê The parking lot is huge. ÊJust be sure to park on the side where the plaza is at not where the main Phil's parking is located. Êthat parking lot was full when I arrived. ÊThere was a line when I was there, but the wait was about 45 min and it was worth every minute. Thank you Mr Phil, I do look forward to future bbq meetings with you!

I'm surprised as to how many 5 stars this place has. ÊHere are the facts: Pros: Ê - ÊThe BBQ meat was super soft and cooked well. - ÊService is great, staff is friendly, and food comes fast. Cons: - There is always a line out the door, and you have to wait 30 min plus just to get seated. - The all important sauce - way too tangy for beef or pork ribs. ÊGood for chicken, but not ribs. ÊIts an all in one sauce. ÊWe went as a group of four, and very hungary. ÊAt first we were glad we waited, and the first few bites taste super great, but as we started to fill up, we all found the sauce very unpleasant, and unfortunately all the food is completely saturated with it. So two stars for the long wait times and choice of only one mediocre sauce. ÊA better sauce or at least a few varieties of sauce and this joint would be 4 stars, get rid of long lines and it would be five stars. Sorry, but as is, the place is over rated. Tip: If you can't wait, get the food togo. ÊYou'll be in and out in 10 minutes or less.

HELPFUL HINT: If you can get it to go and eat it somewhere else, I highly recommend it!! I stood in line for about 20 minutes when I said eff it, I walked up to the phone order/to-go line and placed an order and my food was ready in less than 10 minutes. I took my food and just went across the street and enjoyed it at the food court with my girlfriends. Of course I could go on about the flavor of their delicious food and what not, but my review will be much like everyone else's. Therefore my best advice is, if you can avoid dining in, take it to go!

Kinda stupid to be writing a review for this place. But in summary: 5 stars for sides + ribs! Quick tip - if you don't want to wait in line, go to the bar and order a drink! The bar is usually much faster than the tables and you can still get your rib business on over there.

Phil's BBQ is a San Diego favorite. Every time I go home, It's an absolute must! Delicious ribs falling off the bone, soaked in a sauce that's the perfect blend of sweet and heat. No matter how long the line gets, it's worth the wait (and the weight). Your mouth will thank you. For first timers, get a half rack rib dinner. For someone who wants to sample it all, go for a ribs and chickless/chicken dinner. All their sides are delicious, but their onion rings really standout - step it up by dipping them in the house ranch. For people who aren't in the mood for ribs, go for the Broham pulled pork sandwich (but ask for the slaw on the side, you'll get more than when you ask them to put it in the sandwich directly). This place is awesome. I guarantee it.

So my friend's and I went there for dinner after Comic -con. I was told the bbq here is fantastic. Upon arrival, I noticed the long line just to get into the restaurant; reminded me of Pink's hotdog line in LA. I was told this is typical with this restaurant and the seating is first come first serve. We waited like 45 mins. There were restaurant staff entertaining the waiters. They were very nice and socialable and introduced new comers to their menu. ÊThe service was very friendly and staff made sure you were comfortable during your experience. I ordered the full rack baby back ribs with fries, macaroni salad, and onion rings. My partner ordered the El toro. ÊI also tried their chicken and pulled pork sandwhich. What stood out were their sides and baby back ribs. The chicken, tri-tip, and pulled pork was dry, the extra bbq sauce on the side didn't help the dryness eigther. I didn't give it 5 stars due to the dryness of the other meats. ÊBut their baby back ribs and sides and onion rings are superb! (and their service and food pricing :) )

At Phil's, the beef ribs themselves are about as good as the handful of previous reviewers (about 4,000 or so) have claimed. Meaty cuts, smoky (though they could be smokier), and fall-off-the-bone tender. The Beef Rib Dinner (three ribs with two small sides or one large side, $13.95) is more than likely enough to satiate most appetites. As the cashier will warn you, the beef ribs come slathered in sauce, unless you explicitly ask otherwise. The sauce here isn't bad. It's both sweet and slightly tangy, but so much so that I felt like it overshadowed the meat. And the sweetness felt ever so slightly cloying by the time I moved on to my third rib. I'd probably go for the stuff on the side next time. I was mildly annoyed that the onion rings here, so exalted by thousands of other reviewers, weren't available as a side. Instead, you're forced into ordering them separately -- $3.95 for a small, $5.95 for a large. Fortunately, the small is hardly small, as both the portion size and the rings themselves are enormous.

My cousin recommended to order our food by phone and just pick up. SMART MOVE! Even though we phoned in, we still had to wait in the phone line, about 15 minutes. Then they told us food would be about another 20 minutes, but it actually came in about 10. They were really nice and gave us cups to get lemonade while we waited. Gripe: Nothing irks my butt hairs more then people messing up to-go orders. You have a receipt check list of what should be in the bag, USE IT! We took our food to go and were half way to eating our food by the water when I looked in the bag and realized they forgot our onion rings. I was quite upset. No side orders for all this meat? Dang. It was hard to swallow. EL TORO SANDWICHES (TRI TIP): The meat on the El Toro sandwiches were smokey and tangy and I had nothing to mellow it out with (the bread was heavily drenched with BBQ sauce). Although the meat was good and had a hard smokey flavor, the BBQ sauce was super tangy and like I said, nothing to cut it with. I could only get through a 1/4 of this meat. http://www.yelp.com/biz_É BABY BACK RIBS: These are a freakin' winner! Tender, juicy and fall off the bone delicious with the perfect amount of seasoning and sauce. I could have easily ordered a whole rack. Some sides or something would have been nice.... ONION RINGS: Yep, they forgot to put them in our bag. WEAK! RED VELVET MOON PIE: This pie was super tasty. Fluffy and flavorful and had a delicious, not overly-sweet cream cheese filling. Even the Canadian liked it and he doesn't like Red Velvet too much. I would definitely get this again. http://www.yelp.com/biz_É Other than the onion ring slip up, the food was good. I called back and talked to a manager and he said they would give me a refund on my missing onion rings (as they should. Why should I pay for something I never received?). As I told him how hard it was to eat all that meat without having any sides and how it was so inconvenient being we weren't from there, he did nothing to appease that they messed up: didn't offer free soda, no free dessert, nada. That is just weak sauce customer service in my book. Bummed deal as having no sides definitely changed my opinion on if the food would have been better. Having an all-meat meal is definitely not that tastey. Just make sure you double check your to go order before you leave (no matter how pushy they are to get your bag to go). Four stars for the food. Dock a star for their customer service.

We went to Phil's BBQ for the very first time on a Saturday around 5pm. We waited in line for about 40 minutes. I guess that's not too bad according to other reviews. Pulled pork sandwich - 3 stars The meat was a bit dry although it was slathered in a lot of BBQ sauce. Don't get me wrong - Phil's BBQ sauce tastes great, but it was just too much and therefore too salty. El Toro (tri-tip) beef sandwich - 4 stars The tri tip was cooked and sliced perfectly. But again, it was too salty because of too much BBQ sauce. Baby back ribs with 2 sides - 4 stars I really wanted to give a 5-star rating for this. However, both slabs of the baby back ribs were burnt. The surface turned black and had the bitter taste. Sigh~ We like the mac and cheese and baked beans. The cole slaw and french fries were mediocre. Onion rings - 5 stars They are huge and very very crispy! The prices were very reasonable considering the huge portions of everything we ordered.

Lived up to the ridiculous hype. Having lived in Texas for two years, I was fairly certain I had already had the world's best baby back ribs. I was wrong. The ribs here are spectacular.

So an old CSUN friend was elated when I told him I was coming down to San Diego. I knew he had lived down in SD for a coupla years and even though he now lived in Los Angeles, I had hoped he'd kept his ear to the streets down in SD so I asked for a coupla recommendations of food hotspots and he gleefully churned out this place. Apparently it was on MAN VS. FOOD a few years ago and my friend swore by this place. The MAN V. FOOD appearance, coupled with over 4,OOO Yelp Reviews made this place a must stop. ---------------- LOCATION ---------------- On SPORTS ARENA DRIVE, near the casino, among a ton of strip malls. I was warned the average wait time to be seated is 45mins-2hours but I swung by around 5pm on a Monday and shockingly it was closed. Apparently MONDAY'S THEY'RE CLOSED. Came back TUES. around 6:30pm and the line was around the block so we ordered our food to-go. Still a 20 minute wait so didn't really check out the interior other than the cashiers place where it was a madhouse. About 6 cashiers with registers lined up next to one another. Super busy. ---------------- THE FOOD ---------------- ~ BBQ SAUCE - I got two extra sides of their sauce to evaluate it. The perfect combination of Tangy & Sweet. It was perfection. Like DRAKE aka "Aubrey Graham also known as Jimmy the parapelegic for Degrassi" would say... it was "The Best I've Ever Had." (5/5) ~ ONION RINGS - My friend told me I "had" to try em, so when I went I did. Paid $2 extra for the "COLOSSAL" size, so unnecessary... so many rings. It'd would've made Sonic the Hedgehog jealous. The battered crispy outside was amazing. Possibly the best onion rings I've ever had. (5/5) ~ THE BROHAM - This was pretty damn good. I think it was $6? Anyway it was pulled pork marinated in BBQ sauce atop a bed of coleslaw. There was SO MUCH meat in here it was ridiculous. It was an interesting combination... I added extra BBQ sauce... it could've used a small slice of cheese or something else. I felt like it was missing something. Perhaps one of those awesome onion rings sandwiched in-between. (4/5) http://www.yelp.com/userÉ ~ PORK RIB - No one else wanted one so I but one singular one for $3.95. Definitely not worth it if you're going to order just one. It was nothing special. Good not great. (3/5) -------------- AND SO... -------------- This place has 4000+ reviews and a 4+ star. Honestly I would definitely comeback to have the full dine-in experience and explore their menu further. With such an amazing BBQ Sauce I regret not trying any of their chicken options. All-in-all a good spot with decent prices. Going to look up the MAN VERSUS FOOD episode later today to see what he ate there...

I'm not a huge fan of BBQ, but I'm a fan of Phil's. Sizable portions of good food at reasonable prices - who doesn't love that? Their meat falls off the bone and melts in your mouth, and their BBQ sauce is pretty good butttt I don't love it. I'm no BBQ aficionado so take my opinion of their sauce with a grain of salt, but I really just find it to be average. That being said, all of their food is fantastic and you won't be disappointed with the quality of your dish. I recommend everybody ORDER TO GO. If you want to experience dining in the restaurant and are willing to sacrifice an hour of your life standing in a line with strangers then go for it but ordering to go will definitely shave off a ton of time and you can eat in the comfort of your own home. There is a separate line for take out and it is sometimes empty so you can get in and out and bypass all the chumps twiddling their thumbs outside. Whoever wrote that the line goes by quickly is flat out lying unless they somehow got lucky and came at a time when the line was only 20-25 people deep. I've never seen this place not have a line slinking along the perimeter of the entire parking lot and I've had to stand around for almost an hour and a half multiple times.

My most recent visit was probably the most enjoyable. ÊI usually order chicken but this time got an order of baby back ribs.....MOUTH-WATERING. ÊIt basically fell right off the bone and I could not get enough of it. All their sides are great but I'd prefer 2 small sides rather that 1 large side with my order. ÊThe cajun seasoning they offer at the table is soo good to sprinkle over almost anything, especially if you order fries. Outdoor patio is perfect if you want to keep an eye on your little pooch, and by pooch I'm talking about your animal not the stubborn portion of your "abs".

This place is AMAZING! The sauce is really good. Its BBQ with a hint of spicy. I got the Half Rib Dinner and shared it among 2 other girls. We each got about 2 ribs and it was definitely enough food, but I could have eaten more. The macaroni salad is good. Oh and make sure to get extra sauce on the side so you can dip your fries in.

LOVE THIS PLACE. I had to wait an entire hour before entering the restaurant. The lines were out the door and around the corner. There were a lot of graduation celebrations going on that night. Thankfully, the restaurant also sells beer to those that are waiting in line. Before I was in the restaurant we had polished off quite a few cans and happily buzzed. the FOOD is delish and the wait time from ordering the food and eating it is surprisingly short. (10-15 mins) I had a great time here- great energy, yummy food. (it can be a bit saucy so you if you dont like that, you should ask to have the sauces to the side)

I know many of my fellow San Diegan's LOVE this place. It's okay, and yes, I am qaulified to say so. It's good, but by far not the best bbq. On a scale of 1-10, I'd say it's a 6.5, maybe a 7. I grew up in Kansas City, I myslef am a pit master and smoke master. I can say that this is not the best BBQ. However it is some of the best that SD can offer. What can you expect for southern californian? That would be like asking for a great surf shop in Kansas CIty. Just trust me. If you ever get a chance to visit the midwest, you will find a lot of BBQ that will Blow Phil's out of the water. You will still like Phil's, you'll just know and understand why it is by far, not the best!

By far the best BBQ ever! I drive all the way down from LA just for Phil's. So worth it! My mouth is watering just thinking about it. The meat just falls off the bone, and the BBQ sauce is perfect! The prices are very reasonable as well. I typically order: Full Rib Dinner (10 to 12 Bones) $19.95 Full Beef Rib Dinner (5 Bones) $19.95 Each rib dinner includes 2 small sides or 1 large side. The onion rings are huge! Beans are very tasty. There are also sandwiches. The BBQ Broham is bomb! Along with the BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger and deli-cut sammy.

We decided to get take out because we didn't have much time to wait in line and sit down and eat at the place. We had 7 people so we ordered what seemed to be a lot but was just right. We placed a phone order for a beef rib dinner, baby back rib dinner and a half a chicken dinner. We also had some sides such as mac salad, coleslaw, fries and onion rings but none of them stood out much. The beef ribs were the best. Tons of mean and fell right off the bone. Deft suggest that! The baby back ribs were just okay.... kinda dry and not very tender..... the chicken was very moist but was drenched in too much bbq sauce. Overall I'd deft go back for the beef ribs, but that's about it.

With over 4000 reviews, I hesitated before writing this because I know Phil's really doesn't need another review. Call me a BBQ snob, but I wanted to speak my mind. Although the general consensus seems to be that this is the greatest BBQ place of all time, Phil's BBQ gave me mixed feelings. Ê - I loved the smoky flavor of the baby back ribs, but I didn't love the sauce. - I enjoyed the fun atmosphere and great service, but it felt a bit commercialized for my taste. - I drooled over the onion rings, but was unimpressed by the macaroni and potato salads. - I appreciated the rib meat that fell easily of the bone, but the tri-tip in the tri-tip sandwich was dry and boring. - I'm no mathematician but BBQ + Beer = Delicious, but at Phil's, you cannot order your beer with your BBQ. You have to go outside and purchase your alcoholic beverage at a separate cart. Although I had a really enjoyable time at Phil's, the food didn't impress me enough for me to go back and wait an hour for dinner. The sauce was too tangy for my taste, sides were just okay, and what, no mac and cheese?! ÊI still give it a solid four stars because it's a great environment to enjoy a meal and a very pleasant experience. ÊIt's always wonderful to share in a meal of BBQ, dig your fingers into something saucy, and laugh while everybody gets sauce all over their faces. Conclusion: ÊDo I think it's jaw dropping fantastic BBQ? No. But if you have the time to wait and are in the mood for BBQ in San Diego, I think Phil's is a great choice.

Phil Dear Phil how I love you so! I've been a HUGE fan of Phil's since the original location that was so small you had to eat outside. We picked some up for the 4th and I guess everyone else had the same idea! We took it back to the house for everyone to try and I swear even the Vegetarians came out of the closet. You cant get BBQ anywhere else in San Diego that good and you cant get anything even close to it in Los Angeles. This is worth driving for at all costs!

Big shout out to Alfredo for excellent service and making my first time at Phil's with my roommate a memorable experience! Besides the great service I received, I had no trouble finding parking in their private lot, and the line for that day was surprisingly short! I came around 12pm, and the wait only took around 20 minutes. Turned out there was a fair or carnival going on nearby(: I was set on getting the baby back rib having heard great reviews from my friends. I ended up with the baby back rib tickler, which includes 3 bones, 2 onion rings, cole slaw, and fries. The portions were generous, especially with the amount of fries! The ribs were meaty, moist, juicy, and came right off the bone! The bbq sauce for the ribs was not overly sweet or salty, right on point. Also, the ribs had a charred smoky flavor which I really enjoyed. The cole slaw was fresh and light on the dressing. The onion rings were giant, crunchy, but a bit oily and heavy. The fries were average. I also got to try some macaroni salad from my friend, and that was my favorite side out of the 4. I would definitely come back again!

Wow, I really love Phil's BBQ. It's awesome if you can manage to get your party or date a seat. There is usually a long line during peak lunch and dinner hours however, you can usually avoid this by going on their website and checking out the cameras that show how long the line is! haha... one time, my family from Germany saw me on the camera from overseas. Thank you internet!!! The staff is excellent so much props to you. When we were ready to eat, I was fascinated by... ma meal. :} I ordered the 5 full ribs with all fries baby. This is what real BBQ tastes like, I am not into Lucille's sweet style BBQ at all. I'll be back for your ribs Phils!!!

Okay, WOW. I found it hard to believe when I saw that this place had 4.5 stars after 3000+ reviews, but the hype is spot on. We got there around 5 pm on a Saturday and waited about an hour to get to the front. We had a huge party of 12 but they managed to accomodate us anyway and in such a friendly manner that I was taken aback. I got the baby back ribs & chick-less dinner with potato salad and baked beans. The food came out within minutes -- another star for service. But the best part was how AMAZING everything tasted. I was blown away -- the meat was sooo tender (even the chicken, which a lot of people have complained about being dry) and the sauce was bursting with flavour. The sides were probably my favourite part. Both the potato salad and baked beans were perfect. I had a few of my friend's onion rings, too, and I can see why people are crazy about them. Phil's BBQ is totally worth the wait, especially if you haven't been there before, and I don't say that about very many restaurants.

I've never in any state ever had a place so cheap they had to have a ""BBQ Sauce Profit Center"" Ê there's too many good BBQ places in San Diego to ever go to Phils again... try Downtown on Harbor Drive ''Kansas City BBQ" Ê[Free sauce]... and terrific meat.

The sauce is simply amazing. I love how the ribs just fall off the bone. I think the chicken could be a little juicier. Also, while the potato salad was delicious and the fries were pretty damn good, the mac salad was kinda tasteless. Cole slaw was alright though. This place, while the wait for food is pretty long, is totally worth it for the delicious bbq. Cheap too if you can get a lot of people to come.

If you're looking for some ribs to dirty your hands on, Phil's is the place to go! If you want to dine in, I recommend going there 20 minutes before opening time because there will ALWAYS be a long snaking line around the buildings for the rest of the day. If you're lucky, you'll only have to wait for ~25min. While you're in line, you should figure out what you want to order already. Once you're in, the process is pretty fast and simple. You go up, order, pay, get a buzzer, find a seat, and wait for your buzzer to go off. I've tried the Award Winning Ribs and Beefy Ribs and they were both delectable! I've also tried the pulled pork sandwich when it was catered to UCSD. The meat is always tender and juicy and the sauce is amazing. Their potato salad and macaroni salads are a good complement to all the saltiness of the ribs so I recommend one of those with probably fries or corn as the second choice. The beans are meh. Definitely a place you have to try but not a place you'd want to frequent if you're watching out for your weight and health! Also, I'd recommend splitting a full rack with someone rather than getting 6 ribs yourself (if that's what you were planning on getting)...it's the same thing and it'll save you some money!

Crazy long line with smiles, it must be good to go. The line was wrapped around the building (if you were waiting to eat inside). The to go line wasn't that long. We waited roughly 30 minutes from the time we walked in until we had our order in hand. I must admit the food was well worth the wait. As the other reviews said the ribs are fall off the bone perfect. The sauce is sweet with just enough bite you make you lick your fingers. The chicken was tender and juicy and pulled pork sandwich was unbelievably delicious. All I can say is YELP strikes again. The staff were super friendly despite how busy they were. Here's the five star factor the one thing that pushed them over the top ( besides how delicious the woopies were). The manager came out and greeted the party I was with and held a conversation with us. That's one of those rare things that just doesn't happen these days. You usually only run into a manager when there's a problem, but not here.

Okay. I can't believe I didn't write a review for this place yet. It. is. THE BEST. RIBS I have EVERRRRRRRRRRRRR eaten. I've tried Lucielles. I've tried all those fancy shmancy rib places and NOTHING can top phils. Do you remember as a kid where you watched cartoons and when the lion eats meat off a bone, the meat just slid off? Yeah... that's how it is here. It just slides RIGHT off the bone. And the meat? it LITERALLY melts like cheese in your mouth. Wait... I'm not done, and the barbeque sauce is like heaven juice, overflowing in your mouth and exciting your tastes buds juuuuuuusssst right. I think I came to eat here after every finals. And there was never a time where I hated it. And the service is just amazing. O yes. I'll be back.... I'll be back....

I know this seems pretty sketchy since it's my first review, but hear me out. Ê I've been to this place twice. The first time, we got there around 6pm and didn't start eating until around 8pm. The food was good, but I don't know if it was worth the wait. If it were just for that time, I'd give it 4 stars. But this time I got take out...and they forgot my onion rings! Now normally I wouldn't dock a star for forgetting an item, because honestly, shit happens. but seriously? my onion rings?! The girl even asked if I wanted extra ranch for my onion rings. What onion rings?! Moral of the story - always check your order before you leave.

I've been putting off this review for one reason... how does one even begin to articulate the deliciousness that is none other than Phil's BBQ? It's one of those rare dining experiences where one does not even need to think twice about whether it lives up to the hype, and trust, there's plenty of hype. The first thing you'll notice is the ridiculously long line that follows along outside the building. Expect this at almost any hour; I came here one weekend just as it opened and there was already a line before me. For my first time, I dined in, so it was roughly an hour's wait before we got inside (regardless, worth the wait). Cut the time by calling in. I ordered the baby back ribs, which comes with about 10-12 bones and two choices of sides. The ribs are amazing! I honestly order them every time. The meat is incredibly tender and combined with the generous coat of their tangy sauce, it's the perfect filler. The onion rings are crispy and by no means just any kind of onion ring you've seen before -- they're huge! Delicious. This place is always packed, but there's a lot of seating indoors as well as the patio to accommodate for their many customers. There's a bustling and busy atmosphere to it, but the servers are definitely attentive! It's plain to see why Phil's has so many people at every hour of the day. Will be back.. plenty of times.

ummmmm...YES. Typically, a place that I had to wait an hour and a half to order would not get 5 stars...but this place is simply that good. My first visit to Phil's was 4 years ago. I think they must have recently moved at that point, because their old address was still in the GPS. Fortunately, though, we were able to find the new place. Back in 2008, Phil's must have not had been nearly as well known as it is today, because over the course of 2 days, I'm pretty sure we went there 2-3 times...maybe even twice in the same day. Each time though--no wait. Now 4 years later, I finally returned to Phil's, wanting to remind myself why I was so in love with this place. When we pull into the parking lot...a HUGE line. I immediately said to my partner in crime: "We came this far...we are waiting". I can only assume that Phil's has grown in popularity IMMENSELY. But ya know what, I have to hand it to them...they have taken it in stride. They have built an impressive business (not just a restaurant). It's an experience. As you're waiting in line, you mingle with your fellow linemates. You get a taste of Phil's as they bring around a tray of their delicious onion rings (they are seriously unreal). They also have a photo booth, toys that you can buy, an "Official Tweet Spot", and even a pre-entry stand where you can get yo drank on before even stepping foot into the restaurant. If that isn't enough, Phil's has seriously employed probably 75% of San Diego. They have what I like to call "Official Schmoozers". These are people who are outside with the people waiting in line just chatting you up, asking what you are going to get...just being friendly. It's a nice touch! Once you finally get inside, there are at least 8 different cashiers ready to take your order. After taking the order, I couldn't believe how fast they got the food out! It couldn't have been more than 5-6 minutes. Now up until this point, I have only commented on the experience, because hey, if you are going to be waiting in line for an hour and a half, you gotta have something to entertain you! But what you really come for, is the food. Each time I've gone to Phil's I've only ever gotten the ribs...and for good reason. I don't know what sort of sorcery they use to make these puppies, but my oh my. They just fall right off the bone, they are meaty, and their homemade sauce is just AWESOME. Part of me wishes after waiting that long, I had gotten something like a pulled pork sandwich to go because it looked so good too! Nevertheless, I couldn't have been more pleased with my choice. If you are ever in San Diego, you MUST go here. If you live in SD...I envy you.

When I think of San Diego food establishments I think of Hodad's, Roberto's, and of course Phil's BBQ! ÊI have just never had any other bbq comparison that can even come close to the Phil's BBQ experience. ÊI may not have had much great BBQ in my life but I love meat (that's what she said?) and this is definitely the place to get it. Ê The only thing that could possibly detract stars from this place is the fact that the line is very long and goes out the door. ÊWhenever I bring people here, I use the opportunity in line to talk up the place and describe the food in gross details so by now, the wait just adds to the overall experience. ÊAlthough it may take awhile, Phil's is also absolutely amazing at seating large groups despite the huge mass of people. ÊEasily some of the best service I've ever had. Now onto the food. ÊWhen you come to Phil's you MUST get ribs. ÊDon't be fooled by Adam Richman in Man V. Food and merely order a sandwich (although I've tried the El Toro and it WAS good but it wasn't the ribs). ÊThe ribs are absolutely amazing. ÊThe baby-back ribs have a very nice smoky flavor and are always charred perfectly. ÊMeat comes cleanly off the bone. ÊThe sauce is coated and grilled onto the ribs. ÊThe sauce is sweet but has a nice spicy bite to it that I really appreciate. ÊI could put it on anything! ÊI always ask for extra sauce to put on (I'm a sauce guy). Ê Now even though the baby back ribs are delicious, I will always prefer the beefy ribs. ÊIf you were a caveman hunting for a dinosaur and BBQ'ed it, you would get the Phil's beefy ribs. ÊEach bone is big enough to hold in one hand and really makes you feel like a man biting into it while holding one in both hands. ÊAlthough there's not as much smoky flavor and the meat is more chewy, there's just so much meat flavor on it that you can't go wrong. ÊI love being able to bite into it and tear pieces of meat off. ÊI've been living in SD for 7 years now and I still have cravings for them. ÊFor $20, you can get 5 ribs and two sides (which are also delicious...BBQ beans here are very good). Ê Go right now and I'll see you in line!

Very very delicioso. The ribs were so tender and slid right off the bone. It was definitely finger-licking good. I did take off a star for the cashier getting us coleslaw instead of fries, but I re-added that star remembering the photo machine thingy right outside the entrance. You can even email yourself the experience for free! But I did take off another star for the long wait. It's good but I'm not sure it was worth the hour and a half. If I come back here next time, I'm going to definitely get it to go and eat it somewhere else.

"The best things come to those who wait". Ê Way back in The Day, The above was the tag line from a famous Heinz ketchup commercial starring an incredibly young Matt Le Blanc. ÊWho knew they were really talking about Phil's BBQ? As a general rule, I am not a fan of waiting in line for anything, least of all restaurants. ÊIf a place I want to go to takes reservations, I'll make them; if they don't, and I arrived to discover the wait is longer than 30 or 40 minutes, my tendency has been to seek nourishment elsewhere; life is short, lines are Evil, and they're for amusement parks, not for restaurants. At least, that's what I used to think. ÊThis Old Dog learned a new trick on a recent trip to San Diego: restaurant lines are sometimes an Evil worth enduring - especially if you've got good company, and the light at the end of the tunnel is particularly bright and alluring :-) Having just spent a perfect afternoon strolling through Coronado and the Hotel Del, then enjoying some time on Coronado's beautiful, broad, white sandy beach, my friend and I were looking forward to dinner at the legendary Phil's BBQ. ÊWith over 1,000 five star reviews (says one sign), it made Yelp's Êtop 10 restaurant list for 2011 (says another sign), and as of this writing has close to 4,000 reviews, with an average rating of 4.5 stars - quite a lot of hype! ÊWe arrived at 5pm on a Sunday. ÊI remember thinking, "how bad can the lines be this early?" ÊThat turned out to be about the most misguided thought since it occurred to John McCain that he could broaden his appeal to women (not to mention intellectuals) by adding Sarah Palin to the ticket... The line was literally around the block - and then some! ÊI must admit I was stunned, and for a fleeting moment I thought about suggesting that we leave, but I knew my friend wouldn't want to, and if ever I've had a friend worth indulging, it's this one. ÊBesides, we were already close enough to be in range of the tantalizing smell of BBQed meat... We waited about an hour and a half; it was a warm night, the atmosphere was festive, and I couldn't have asked for better company. Ê NOTE: When we rounded the final corner, I noticed a booth from a local winery that was offering free tastings - they should have several signs for this all along the line so people know it's there, but I'll know next time, and you know now :-) Enough waiting, on to the dining experience! ÊLet's start with the bad things first: - Phil's has no table service; you place your order at a counter, then get a beeper which will alert you when your food is ready so you can go back and get it. - Beer and wine is sold in a separate bar area; you have to go there and wait in another (and somewhat shorter) line to get it while you're waiting for your food to cook. - The Fresh Cut Fries are nowhere near crispy enough; in fact, they're borderline soggy, and not particularly tasty either. We found a table out on the patio and a couple of minutes later, it was time to try some of Phil's legendary fare! ÊWe wanted to try a good cross-section of what Phil's had to offer, so we ordered a 5-bone Beefy Rib dinner, which includes 1 large side (we got the Corn-on-the-Cob) or 2 small ones, and a half-order of Baby Back Ribs. ÊWe also got separate orders of Colossal Onion Rings and Fresh Cut Fries. While the corn was mediocre, the rest of the food we had was amazing; I'm not exaggerating when I say the ribs were so good they bordered on orgasmic! Beefy Ribs: Êhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_É These amazing specimens of BBQ fabulousness are big enough to feed an armored division, and they'd all die happy :-) ÊTender, perfect, melt-off-the-bone and into your mouth wonderful. ÊIt simply doesn't get any better! Baby Back Ribs: Êhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_É Serious BBQ perfection, these fabulous babies are fall off the bone tender, with a slight char crust from BBQing, and coated in Phil's wonderfully tangy sauce that's sweet, smokey and zesty. ÊThe best damn pork baby backs I've ever had! Colossal Onion Rings: Êhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_É These were stupendous! ÊPlumb on the inside, crispy on the outside, perfectly battered, golden brown and flavorful. We had an excellent meal, and I'm glad that I added another play to my personal playbook. ÊWhen coupled with good judgment about what to wait for (and what not to), I now see that being willing to endure a long restaurant wait can sometimes yield an incredibly worth-while result. Was Phil's BBQ worth the wait? ÊTotally! ÊI'd go back in a heartbeat, though next time I'd start the wait at 4pm for dinner, and hope that would have us eating after only an hour - a man is only as good as his dreams! :-)

Boy was it horrible when we came here right after UCSD's graduation. ugh, learned our lesson. It was my cousin's graduation, and she decided to take our family here, and so we did. Our moms and dads stayed in the car while we youngin' were waiting in like for about an hour and a half... I have never been and but heard from friends that this place is amazing and that the wait was well worth it. When we got to the front line, I was super tired...Wished we were here on a freakin' weekday. Alright, enough of my venting, when we sat and got our food, everything was good until I got the pork. Did not like it. Get the beef ribs! Those are way better. I will come back when it's a weekday, never a weekend (unless I come early)

Nothing of value to add other than that my favorite meal here is a full rack of pork baby back ribs with the sauce on the side. :)

Right when we opened our car doors, we could smell the BBQ goodness. I'm NOT a big BBQ fan, but I had to try it out. They've been a yelp and twitter best. When you walk in you stand in line and are greeted by a host, who then sends you to a counter. At the counter, you order your food and get a pager. It's self seating, but luckily we came in on a Wednesday after the lunch rush. You get paged, pick up your food and chow down. We ended up getting the ribs, onion rings and potato salad. Like I said earlier, I'm not a BBQ fan ... Why?! Cause I'm very picky about BBQ sauce. The sauce at Phil's is a different treat. Not too tangy, not too sweet, just right. And the sauce wasn't just dumped all over the ribs, so the clean up wasn't bad. Overall, it's a place that you must try at least once. If you're a BBQ lover, you'll appreciate this place. The price for the quality and amount of food is decent, not overpriced. And if you don't like it, Valley View is next door and I heard they have a great lobster buffet.

Despite the 8 million reviews, I must still weigh in on this fabulous location. They definitely KNOW what they are doing here. While there may be a wait involved, it goes quickly, and their system is organized. There are Disneyland-esque markers informing you of wait-times from certain points (fairly accurate by my count), and inside an employee directs you to a cashier who takes your order. Then you are given a number. You can choose your seat, and wait til you are buzzed/called. Obviously, food is amazing. Even the chicken is tender and delicious. Yes, the sauce is more sweet than spicy, but it will please you with its smoky transition to slightly sweet aftertaste. Sides? Onion rings and fries are a YES. Plus, there is a row of sinks behind the drink machines so you don't clog up the bathroom just to wash your hands. They really did think of everything.... Yummilicious Factor = A

A friend of ours brought us here when we went to visit them in San Diego. From what I've heard there is ALWAYS a line wrapped around the building of this place. We got there at about 3:30 on a wednesday afternoon and walked right in, now wait at all. It's not your typical resturaunt. You walk in, look at the menu hanging on the wall, then walk up to the register and order. They had a pretty good variety from hamburgers, chicken, salads, and ribs. I originally was going to order the turkey burger but that "eh, what the hell, were at a BBQ place" so I got the the baby back ribs and chickless (chickless meaning boneless skinless) dinner combo with a baked potatoe (which right after I ordered I saw an order of a macoroni salad came out and I wished I had gotten that instead). After you order we paid right then and they gave us a buzzer and cups for our drinks. We sat ourselves at a table outside, and the food came out FAST! The service was great! The food was cooked perfectly. The ribs were fall off the bone tender, and the sauce was great. I would've prefered the chicken to be slightly more tender but it was nothing to complain about, it was still delicous! I would return to this place, but I would not wait in some insane line that wraps around the building.

Hands down the best BBQ that I have ever had! The wait can be long but it's well worth it. After waiting in line you order your food and find a table as fast as you can or on the weekend am employee saved us a table. I suggest you not wait around for your food. Sometimes there might be an open table on the outside patio area. They give you a remote control that vibrates and lets you know that your order is now ready . *Know what you want to order before you get up to the cash register otherwise you'll be holding up the line and you don't want to do that! Food: Ê Ê Baby back ribs+2 sides- The baby back ribs are of course smaller and don't have too much meat on the bones. Excellent flavor though and very soft. $19.95 Ê Ê Beefy ribs+2 sides- These ribs are my absolute favorite! Excellent flavor and the meat just falls off the bone. Also there is much more meat on each bone versus the baby back ribs. I highly suggest this dish! $19.95. Ê Ê Half BBQ chicken+2 sides- good texture, but some pieces can be dry, but put the BBQ sauce on it and it's so good. $9.95. Ê Ê BBQ Broham (pulled pork sandwich)- The pulled pork has great flavor and come with coleslaw on it. Very reasonable at only 6.95. Ê Ê Colossal onion rings- These are such huge onion rings. Great batter which turns golden brown and piping hot. Nice crunch, but the batter is thick so the inside stays a little soft. It tastes amazing when you dip it in either the BBQ sauce or ranch. Two thumbs up! This is an absolute must if you come here. $5.95. If you're in the area I highly recommend this place for lunch or even dinner. It's great food and a great experience.

You see mostly young people here or entire families for a reason. It's almost always a long wait, and you COULD cook something just as good at home, but if you are overworked (family) or can't cook (lots of young adults) than this restaurant is the equivalent of awesome home cookin'. Don't get me wrong. The food here is actually fantastic. The service, once they have your order, is quick and friendly. The portions are very filling for around $12-16 per plate which will give you entree plus sides, also can get entrees or sandwiches/burgers for less. Its not the price that is dismaying, cause you get the value for your food, but the long wait during evening is a bit much. Expect to wait 30min to 90 minutes before getting there. Overall: Basically you should plan your whole evening around going here, stand in line with your friends and joke around, cause its going to be a wait. But once you sit down and grub it is one of San Diego's finest BBQ restaurants that is worth a try. 3/5 because of the wait, and although their BBQ sauce is great, you can buy it yourself and grill at home for less.

This place was AWESOME. ÊI had long heard about the greatness of Phil's BBQ from my SD friends, but... words cannot describe the heavenly deliciousness. Came here after a night of celebration for P's birthday. ÊWe got there around 2pm and thank goodness there was barely a line at all. ÊBarely a line = line out the first part of the store only and nothing beyond that. ÊDuring our wait, we were offered free lemonade samples, which made the wait much better. I got the half rack dinner plate with baby back ribs. ÊOMG. Best BBQ I had in my life. ÊI mean, the portion doesn't sound too big with 6-7 ribs, but it's definitely enough for a hungry person. Can't wait to go back for a second time!

I love Phil's!!!! Whenever I'm in SD this is the place I go. The BBQ sauce is a bit much so I usually get in on the side and dip my meat in there. I don't like it when my sauce consumes my sides. :) But the meat if very tender and flavorful. The portion is large and you get your money's worth. I'm in love with their onion rings. They're huge and when you bite into one you get a good amount of onion and batter. It is really good and they're not too doughy or Êtoo much onion. I really like coleslaw and the macaroni salad as my sides. I usually take people to Phil's when they visit SD.

The line is daunting, but the food is worth the wait! We got there a little after 5 pm and the line was already wrapped around the restaurant and past other businesses. It moved at a good pace though, and I like that it felt like an amusement park attraction. There's a sign to let you know when you're 21 minutes from the front and a place to take photos. It turned out to be quite the roller coaster of emotions deciding what to order. I blame it on the extensive menu + long line + low blood sugar. Luckily a staff member started passing out free onion rings. It lifted our spirits and helped us finalize our order (it also convinced us to add onion rings). We made it to the counter after an hour. I ordered the full rack of baby back ribs with sides, one beef rib, and a small onion rings to share with one other person. It cost around $30 and was more than enough food. Everything was delicious! Both the pork and beef were very tender and flavorful. I wish they had a variety of bbq sauce, like sweet or spicy, etc but theirs is decent. For the sides I liked the fries because they reminded me of the ones at In N Out, and splurging on the onion rings was the right thing to do.

So I have been hearing about Phil's BBQ for years, and being someone with only an amateur appreciation for meat, I was always like "eh, how good could it be?" Oh my WOW. How naive I was. We tried to drive to Phil's for lunch, but ended up being stuck in traffic for a bajillion hours (thank you Rock and Roll marathon and random Sea World detour), so we called in an order and brought our Phil's to the beach, which ended up being an awesome decision. We found a random bench to put the food on, and could literally see the looks of envy on everyone's faces as they passed by. We had both the baby back ribs and the beefy ribs, and both were super yummy. It is seriously impossible to eat the ribs without ending up with sauce all over your face hands, but when you stop caring about the random smear of sauce across your cheek, that's when you know it's good. My friend and I attempted to split a beefy rib, and at first, we tried to be dainty and cut it like civilized people, but a plastic knife was no match for the really beefy beefy rib, so we ended up having one person hold the rib while the other used her teeth to rip off pieces of meat. It was totally barbaric and completely out of character, but I loved it in an "omg this is so awesome I don't even care how bizarre this must look" kind of way. The baby back ribs were my favorite because they were so so so tender. And having extra containers of sauce definitely helps. The sides were all really yummy too-- yay potato salad and cole slaw! tl;dr: Mmm, wanna lick the sauce off. (And it's not even my birthday?)

Drove almost 2 hours from Orange County just to try this place. I've previously tried the Phils at San Marcos and didn't like it much but gave this one a try. Pros - Get a full rack of ribs, the meat is pretty tasty - Get Onion Rings - The fries are good because they are not salty! Cons - The wait can be 40 minutes or longer - Not that big of a fan of the Phils sauce on the ribs, it's a bit too sweet for my taste

When I think of San Diego I always think of PHIL'S BBQ! I had to come back because those ribs were delicious. The bf and I had to wait for about 20-30 minutes which wasn't bad compared to an hour wait or more. However, it was hard to get the waiters attention to clean the table because they were very busy. We got the beefy ribs (5) which was A LOT OF FOOD. Next time we'll just get 3, but we had plenty of left overs. The meat is good, but lacked on flavor because they didn't have a rub on top just sauce, but the meat was still good itself. It goes great with the beans and french fries. I got a half rack of ribs and I really enjoyed it with my corn on the cobb and coleslaw. I've never been to Texas or the south to try the real deal, but this is as good as it gets for me. Wash it all down with some pepsi and I'm a happy camper.

Be patient in line... it's worth the wait. OR go to the bar and find an open seat, no waiting. Phil's is always on my to-do list when I'm in San Diego. There isn't much BBQ places in Hawaii. I think the closest thing we have is Tony Roma's, so so sad. It's a fun place to go with friends, you'll have a lot of time to chit chat while you're in line. This place is that good, when I think of BBQ, I crave Phil's. The line usually wraps around the building. One cool thing is that there's a webcam on their website, http://www.philsbbq.net. Once you're past the webcam, there's a beverage cart for all kinds of refreshments. Keep your cool when you order. You'll probably be starved by the time you're at the counter. I usually get a full rack of the baby back ribs and a sandwich. The baby back ribs are so tender, talk about fall off the bone! The sauce is perfect... sweet, tangy, and a little spicy. I'll take the sandwich leftovers home, for tomorrow's lunch. Phil's is my standard for BBQ. I'd recommend it to everyone!

Went here this past Sunday and waited in line just under two hours. ÊExpected to wait long considering it was Father's day. This was my second attempt at coming here. ÊFirst attempt was sometime last year on a Friday evening, but saw how ridiculous the line was and decided not to fall in line. ÊThis time, I didn't really have a choice. ÊMy cousin kept ranting and raving how good this place was and wanted to take us here. ÊBy reading a lot of the 5 star reviews, I had really high expectations. I ordered the full baby back rib dinner, with a loaded baked potato and macaroni salad. ÊI have no complaints about the food whatsoever. ÊThe ribs fell right off the bone, the sauce was really tangy and could really taste the vinegar. ÊIt was definitely delicious. ÊThe sides were also good, but nothing spectacular. ÊThis meal definitely did not blow my mind and it's sad to say that it didn't meet my high expectations, but the prices were very reasonable. Fan of the food, but not a fan of the hype. ÊIn my honest opinion, long lines create hype, which skews peoples perception of what is really "the best". ÊI saw a lot of people say these are "THE BEST RIBS I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE." or "IT LIVES UP TO THE HYPE." ÊI completely disagree. ÊEither those people have never had other ribs before or they are just justifying the fact that they waited in a long line to say they had the best ribs ever. ÊI can honestly say that I have had better, but you can't really complain about the price. I would definitely recommend this place to someone that is visiting San Diego and has a few hours to kill and doesn't mind waiting in long lines. ÊI would definitely go back but only if we were driving past it and there was no line, which would probably be on a weekday afternoon. ÊOtherwise, ÊI had my experience. ÊGood food, but would not wait in a ridiculously long line for it again. ÊKudos for the friendly staff and great service.

Meat falls off the bone so fast, I barely need to dirty my hands.. I can just pick at it with my fork. Baby back ribs are my fave. Pulled pork sammy was good too, but I prefer the ribs. I'd say it's definitely worth a 45 minute wait.. longer though.. I'm not too sure. Depends on how hungry you are :p A must-try for out of towners. Despite how daunting the line looks, it isn't too hard to find a table once you order so don't fret about that. As far as the sides go, I stick to the oh-so-sweet beans and mac salad... love both of them I think I could eat a bowl of each even without the ribs. Not a big fan of the onion rings here, but whatever floats your boat.

Very good BBQ; light on smoke, but very tender with a good char. The sauce is a well balanced tangy/spicy/sweet creation that doesn't overpower the meat. Sides are overall average, but the exception are the amazing onion rings. Don't mistake these for those pre-fab types; these hand dipped beauties are quite possibly the best onion rings anywhere.

I swear I called in my order less than 10 minutes prior to getting there. Strike one: Girl answers, asked for my number, *silence on her end* but I hear someone repeating someone's order, 619.... what was the number again? WTH?! (mind you I was not driving, and enunciated my number slowly (there are a lot of 8s)) Made my way to the to go line, what's up with people who are in the other line being in the way. EXCUSE ME, don't block the to-go line. Strike 2: Anyway, made my way inside and told the girl my name, and then she asked for my number, and then asked if it was under another name. No... She takes a new order. Get the buzzer, wait, *buzz* ask for ranch, "next time it's 50 cents" Um ok. I would have paid the 50 cents. Is their ranch made in house? Just curious... Would not wait longer than 20 minutes if you're eating there. Stingy when it comes to the BBQ sauce for to go orders. I like to make my own take on "carne asada fries" but with phil's bbq: meat + fries + ranch = fatty, but good. :) They have Ballast Point Pale Ale on tap. Still good stuff, but not OMGaaahmouthgasm good. BRISKET, make it happen! *drum roll* Strike 3: HAIR IN THE COLE SLAW! I think i'd be less disgusted if it were a bug.

This place is AMAZING. The staff is friendly, the food is intensely flavorful, and the prices for what you get are really fantastic. I think I paid $17 for a BIG rack of ribs with potato salad and cole slaw. And when I say it was BIG, I mean it! My husband almost never meets a plate he can't finish - We ended up taking half of the ribs home. My only complaint about this place is the wait - definitely go right when they open, or else you get to stand in a line that stretches around the building and around the neighboring businesses. But you can see why, right? Soooo delicious! We're definitely going back.

Came here on Sunday Father's day for my birthday. My friends waited for two hours around two o'clock to get inside. tip. if you want to eat at the bar... I believe you can just go straight in and wait for a seat.. Anyways we ended up eating at the bar to watch the NBA Finals... I first ordered the Onion rings.. Straight Up best onion rings ever!!! They are likely chewy and crunchy at the same time. The ranch dipping sauce is good. My dinner was half baby back ribs and potatoes fully loaded.. Baby back was really good.. Êthe meat is super moise like it falls off the bone. The back potato was hugh wrapped in foil with butter and sour cream. For dessert Rob gave us a whoopie pie.. Which is a car shaped circle sandwich with filling in the middle. Price: 13.99 for half rack and side. onion rings 5.00 for a large. drinks= 20 a person. wait: line was around the side and toward the back..Nice is the workers are super fast and they even give out lemonaide. I hear its super worth it.. but if your hella hungry then eat somewhere else cuz the line is long. Will come back

Here I sit in the middle of one of the biggest BBQ states, Texas and crave Phil's BBQ. In three years here in the Dallas area I have only found one place that even has good ribs, and I gotta tell ya, it ain't nothing like Phil's. There is just something about the moist beef on the ribs and the BBQ sauce on the side that is like no place else; and let's not forget that wonderful fried onion ring that comes with every order and because it's so good you just gotta have a full order of them with your food. Miss Phil's and hope to get back to San Diego soon to try the Santee location, where I grew up.

This place is the bomb!!!!!! At least for me, it's the best BBQ I've ever eaten. A must eat for anyone visiting San Diego. The line is ridiculous. No matter what time of the day, there will be a line and you'll spend some time salivating on what you are going to devour when you get your order. A couple awesome tips: Get takeout. It's much, much faster than waiting in line. Or, be a creepy person and hawk around the bar area until a seat opens up. Trust me, it's better than waiting in the long line. I usually get the best of both pork ribs and chicken. It's a good size if you alone are hungry, or for 2 to share. I also get a caesar salad. This caesar salad needed more dressing, but overall, the greens were good. Parking is ok. Just ok. The lot is fair, but it's full from the Phil's and Red Lobster crowd. The actual spots are small, so I wouldn't bring a nice car there.

Some of the best BBQ I've ever had, and this coming from a guy who's redneck relatives tow homemade 50 gallon drum bbq grills and a Êtrailer full of meat product to our family reunions in the South. Thought the beef ribs were better than the baby back and the tri tip sandwich was right up there with the beef ribs. Tri tip was smokey, beef ribs juicy and savory, baby back were tender and slightly spicy. Mac salad was awesome and under rated, onion rings were just tempura battered and over rated imo worth every minute of the hour long wait...

First off, this place is an automatic GO TO THIS PLACE. Why? well read below This was my first visit because i was around the area, but let me take you on my experience. This place was true about the wait time, was in line about 1 hour and a half to two hours, but do not be discourage by the long line! Keep on reading! This place does not have servers or waiters, but has clean up individuals. Food at this place is I would say......AN EXPLOSION of flavor, you just keep going. I had only enough money in my pocket for a BBQ Broham (Pulled Pork Sandwich). Man the portion was huge it was only 7 dollars or so, but they gave me like a tray filled with pulled pork between two buns that it was spilling out. I came on this visit with my friend from UCSD, they got ribs, but they shared their ribs, which was an automatic fall off the bone, which is what you want in BBQ. Their sides are huge portions too so you will not go hungry leaving this place. The sides I had that my friends shared was potato salad, macaroni salad, and (sweet?) baked beans, and some Onion Rings, and finally Fries. All of this was so good, except the baked beans I didn't know they were sweet, I am not a sweets person so it caught me off guard, but I had to get accustomed to the taste, but it was great. Overall this place is a great experience and worth the wait does not disappoint would keep coming back here if I could.

Everyone always heard the saying,"If it doesn't get all over the place, it doesn't belong in your face." -Carl's Jr. Over a year and a half ago, I bookmarked this place on Yelp for so long and ended up only staying near Downtown San Diego every time I was in the area. Definitely regretted it, and on top of that I used to pass by there so many times without noticing this restaurant. Epic fail on my part. Anyways, we got there twenty minutes right after they opened, which was awesome, since we were on the road for about an hour and a half. Exiting the car, you can already smell the sweet aroma of BBQ, and my stomach was rumbling. We had to wait in line for about twenty to twenty five minutes as you may notice from the pictures. The menu was already located outside, well a couple of them, because once you stepped in there, there will be a line of cashiers to place your order. So be ready to order before you get to the front of the line. (Makes the line go quicker) What we ordered was the following: 1. Best of both (2 beefy ribs and 1/4 BBQ chicken)-The beefy ribs was my favorite at this restaurant! Fell off the bones, tender, tore apart easily and the BBQ sauce was not overwhelming. This tasted like beef jerky, not rough and tough to pull out your teeth, this was made so perfectly that I wish my tummy could have devoured more! The BBQ chicken was tender and not dry...surprised because it was breast meat! This was actually pretty good. 2. Full rack of baby back ribs-Fell off the bones! Not one of the ribs was dry. They were tender and tore apart so easily that it was remarkable. The sauce on the ribs was good; however, I would suggest not to get BBQ sauce on the side...it was tangy and left a bad after taste. I like bold, sweet, and spicy BBQ sauce like Lucille's Smokehouse BBQ. 3. Macaroni salad-This was my least favorite, tasted weird and tangy. Something in there needs to be taken out, because I would have liked this side if it didn't have that tangy taste to it. 4. Coleslaw-Not a lot of mayo, which is a big plus. The vegetables was nice and crispy. 5. Corn on the cob-White corn=Sweet...Enough said. Ok, maybe I had to put Tapatio because I love spicy foods...bias I know... 6. Colossal onion rings (Large, separate order)-Super crispy and huge! Omg! This could have been a meal for itself...Couldn't even finish half of it. The batter on these bad boys was made just right. I didn't even have a soggy onion ring! The ranch dip was light and it definitely went very well with the onion rings. Each entree that is listed above (#1 and #2) came with 2 small sides or a large side. Those sides above was what we chose to try. (So fellow Yelpers, try other sides and review them please! Thank you!) Also, we noticed the fries looked limpy from another persons table, so I wouldn't recommend getting that. After your done ordering, you get a taser looking buzzer. Guess what? Another line was formed just to find a table...The line wasn't too bad, just about two to five minutes, only because there was a lot of large parties that wouldn't leave. BUZZ BUZZ! TIME TO EAT! Nom Nom!! Like I said on the first quote, it got messy haha thankfully we had our bibs and a whole roll of napkins like Boiling Crab. (Those who want to be civil, like myself...you can get plates and utensils). Unlimited drinks for $2 more dollars. Suggestion, try the Crystal Light! Mmm!! Service here was quick and excellent. Very attentive and sweet. They didn't make you feel like you were being rushed. The manager helped me bring the food to the table. Definitely give the staff five stars. =) Overall, I would definitely recommend coming here! Note: If you don't like something that you may have ordered, speak up before you start Yelping Phil's BBQ. That is why I had to take a picture of the menu outside, because I was definitely ready to Yelp, if I didn't like something...forgot to tell them about the macaroni salad...too full. (I find this to be a very smart tactic to make sure customer satisfaction is reached) Now, do you understand how they earned to be one of the top ten restaurants in the US?

It's really hyped up. But I can understand why. Maybe I've never been to a spectacular ribs place, but within my memory, this is probably the best place for ribs that I have ever been to. Every time I go back home to SD, this is a top priority place for me to go out and enjoy with my friends. Pretty long wait typically, especially on weekend nights, but hasn't surpass forty minutes for the times I've been there. The way they manage operations is spectacular, as they serve a huge amount of people daily. The wait is worth it though. I definitely recommend the Beefy Ribs, or Baby Back. I've heard great things for their El Toro, the tri-tip sandwich. Pretty much any side on the menu is delicious, but their fries and coleslaw is my go-to. The sauce might be overpowering at times, but you can order the sauce on the side, which is what I'll probably do my future trips here. I wish they had a combo of the baby-back and beefy ribs, that would be my only negative point. Try the Beefy Ribs with Chicken combo, it's actually a really great deal. Onion Rings are also delicious here as well. Don't want to wait? Phone-in with a to-go order, and it'll take you ten minutes to receive your food. A great option.

I could rate Phil's 20 stars if I ultimately could. Hands down it's just that good and the best part about the meal was that no 2 dishes tasted the same which is a rare find. We showed up at roughly 11:15 (they open at 11) and the line was already wrapping around the corner(s), but it's only a testament to what you're getting. I have a hard time reading about how some don't like to wait or the line is long (yada yada). Sorry the world doesn't cater to you and ONLY you. Honestly the line moves fast and people seem to be in and out like an elementary school cafeteria. For a place that does on average 5000 customers in a day I'd say the odds are on their side with the whole crowd management. The menu is actually quite affordable and after actually seeing the portion size nothing price wise is a miss. The wife and I decided to split (yeah that's such an oxymoron here) the beefy rib dinner and the El Toro (tri tip sandwich). We selected the coleslaw and macaroni salad as our sides for the rib dinner which certainly added to the overall value. The ribs are tender as h-e double hockey sticks and yes I did the fork test even quite a while after it was first brought up (every time the meat fell right off the bone leaving it skinned bare. The tri tip had a mouth watering smokey taste to it and by far the best I have had to date. The sauce has a rootin' tootin' kick to it, but by no means does it overpower of leave you needing a drink. The coleslaw and macaroni salad were great as well and even rivals my mother's which has stood the test of time for 20+ years (I'm glad she never yelps) ha-ha. They were not heavy as it tends to be when you add the mayo, etc. to them which solidifies why they do consistently have the 5 ratings! I don't give those to many places, but Phil knows his stuff and from the staff to the steer it was just a perfect culinary experience overall.

I we to school in the mid west. The bbq is good but it isn't so great that I would wait that long. My boyfriend says in the San Fernando valley, Dr. hoglie wogglies doesn't fall too short of Phils. Phils is still a little better but not for the wait. Here is a tip. If you aren't going in a big crowd, go to the bar area, it is first come first serve. We found two seats right away and didn't have to wait the 2 hours. We made it in and out in 45 minutes and had time to go see old town after dinner. We felt sorry for the people who were waiting in line. If you don't mind ghetto style just call in for take out, get a bunch of napkins and eat it in your car if you want to try this experience and can't afford to wait. Good BBQ but its not EPIC like in these reviews.

The BBQ here is GREAT! Ranks up there with the Texas BBQ I've had previously. ÊOnce you enter the place the smell hits you Immediately and especially after waiting for so long in line, it's super enticing. We ordered a round of baby back ribs, beefy ribs and onion rings with all the small sides. Definitely get the baby back ribs... fall off the bone, juicy and amazing. Beefy ribs with the BBQ sauce is amazing with huge portions and huge flavor. We also got hooked up with an additional side since the food a bit longer than expected. Props to Chris who helped us when we were asking about our food. Anytime in SD, Phil's is a must go spot.

The BBQ is great! The wait will be long (we waited ~1 hour to be seated) but they have an efficient system for taking orders and seating parties so it makes everything flow seamlessly. The ribs are amazingly tender and the sides are all pretty good. The only thing that was sub-par was their onion rings. Someone forgot to season the batter or SOMETHING because they were BLAND as heck. My friend later called me a noob for not getting take out, but I think you gotta eat there at least once for the experience.

Believe the hype. Phil's BBQ has all that Western barbecue kitsch, has a line clear around the corner, and yet I can't help but start drooling when I think of their succulent ribs. Came here around 7PM on a Friday night and had about a 60 minute wait. However, once you're in the door it takes less than 10 minutes to order your food, take a seat, and pig out on a tasty bbq meal. The boyfriend and I decided to split two dinners-- a full rack of beef ribs (5 large bones) and a full rack of baby back pork ribs (about 10-12 bones). This came with a full order of fresh cut fries, an ear of corn, and a small side of cole slaw. Since we were famished, we ordered a small onion ring on the side, too. SO MUCH FOOD. At only $52, this could have easily fed 3-4 people...! Great value on very good food. The ribs fell off the bone, were moist, and saucy. I'm not terribly crazy about their dry-rub, but their sauce is sweet and thick. All the sides were great, but it really is all about the meat here. The beef was good, but I think the baby backs were a little better. I will need to come back to try their tri-tip sandwich that my friends keep talking about. Phil's easily gets a solid 4 stars in my book, but it's their insanely efficient and friendly staff that bump the experience up to 5 stars. There was this one server named Zach who was seriously the human version of a hummingbird. Incredibly fast, checked in about 10 times during our visit, and grabbed anything and everything we needed from waters, extra bbq and ranch sauce, to-go containers, and even bringing up our food. He was even sweet enough to offer coffee and make sure that we were all set. I dine out 3-5 times a week and I have been to many fine dining establishments where the servers don't even give you the time of day, so this was quite a pleasant treat. Don't let the long line scare you away. Phil's is definitely worth waiting for at least once-- oh, and they LOVE Yelpers, too.

This place is like Disneyland. Long lines, a sign that tells you how much longer you have to wait, and pure happiness waiting at the end. The line will be long, but they're very efficient once you order. I think we got all our food within a few minutes. And the food lasted about half that time. The photo machine's fun to play with while you wait - there's one near the door entrance. Baby back ribs are great - so are all the sides I tried. Potato salad was great, coleslaw was crisp. Don't get me wrong, the food was great - hands down the best BBQ I've have in California. However, being the holiday weekend, it took over an hour to get to order. It's good to go to, but you won't see my returning. Unless the line magically disappears.

My #375 Review has to go to Phil's BBQ!! Okay, you hear about Phil's BBQ, You wonder about Phil's BBQ. People talk about driving far for Phil's BBQ and you say "what is the BIG deal about Phi's BBQ?!" My friends would always ask me when I tell them about a restaurant, "Is it really good? is it like PROMISING?!" ÊWith Phil's BBQ I would say 100% with a BIG smile on my face YES this place is PROMISING!!!!! let's GO!! So.... WTF are you waiting for?! GO TO PHIL'S BBQ! Make any excuse you can to drive there and GET SOME! Here are the reasons why: 1. TOTALLY worth the wait! 2. FALL off the bones Ribs When you bite into it, it's like GET IN MY BELLY!!! They are known for their ribs, so order RIBS! 3. LARGE Quantity and great for sharing (normal people okay! Not you bottomless pit stomach people, you might want your own meal) LOL! 4. Pretty cheap compared to other Rib places! $20 for a full rack of baby back ribs INCLUDING sides! 5. Food comes out QUICCKKK We waited about 5 minutes! 6. BOMBBBBB ASSS ONION RINGS! Seriously, order it! You won't be disappointed! great for sharing!! 7. If your meal comes with either 2 small sides or 1 large and you want to order Fries, make sure you order a SMALL size of Fries, it's practically the same size as the large or even more.. LOL TRUST LOL 8. Customer Service - GREATTT! Very helpful and genuine workers! They don't get guaranteed tip so make sure you tip them before you leave!! Our Server Corey was great! 9. Better than Lucille's BBQ in my opinion! Don't get me wrong. I love Lucilles! but Phil's BBQ will still have a bigger spot in my heart. Notes: 1. You pay before you sit down. 2. if you have a large group and get close to the front of the line, a worker will tell you 1 person from the group has to sit down and save your table. Make sure you have that 1 person ready! 3. Tip is not included so remember to tip them before you leave! 4. you get a buzzer after you pay and pick up your own food 5. Didn't like the pulled pork sandwich or tri-tip. just get the ribs! That's what they are known for! 6. Get ready for FOOD COMA! Side notes: Our Server Corey was great! I think you deserve a raise! He came by, asked us if some of us are sharing and brought out extra plates and utensils! One couple part of our group ordered last and it took a bit for the food to come out so Corey actually went to get their food for them and served it to us! He also came back many times to make sure everything was okay and if we need more sauce. Brought wet wipes when we were almost done and always came back with a smile! Now, every time I go to SD, I make sure I stop by and have lunch/dinner at Phils! A SD trip is not the same without it!

LOVE the food, HATE the line. Rather drive to the San Marcos location or Call In/Take Out (though eating it at home is not the same). I know I should be writing a review on their BBQ stuff, but I think there are enough reviews on that already. All pretty accurate. So I will just comment on the CORN. Ha! Add butter and creole seasoning and my meal is complete. DELICIOUS! :)

TERRIBLE. They let solicitors harrass you in the line (which is also always ridiculously long). And these solicitors aren't even trying to steal your money for a good cause. Arts for the youth. Seriously? We have kids starving all over the world and they consider this a "good cause.". Anyway the food is good, but it no way worth the 45 minute wait and greasy salesmen trying to steal your money. Shame on you Phil's, and no I'm not going to "talk to one of our BBQrew before leaving a review" so you can try and control what's supposed to be a honest place of discussion. My friend has a policy to never wait in line for food to then wait for food, and she's definitely right with respect to this place.

Great BBQ. The prices are a bit steep but I feel their worth it. The only downside is the line can be ridiculous, and personally don't think it's worth it when the line is that crazy. But if you ever get a chance to go when the line is short it's definitely worth checking out.

Expect long lines and don't be scared of it. It'll move along and you'll most likely still be deciding what to order up until when you get to the cash register anyway, lol. I come here for the BABY BACK RIBS. They're always tender, wet, and so freakin good! You'll think that a half rack for yourself will be enough but it usually isn't and if it too much, you can have your leftovers in 2 hours so WHY NOT? Go for the full rack and you won't regret it. Beef ribs: they're bigger than your face and that's for sure. I'm not a fan of these. They're usually really dry and I always get pieces of the meat stuck in-between my teeth. Chicken: I'll skip on this. They give you big pieces but it's so dry and there's never enough bbq sauce to go around so I never get to finish my chicken. such a waste. Sides: Fries - they're usually pretty inconsistent. I've had some really great fries there before and some really bad ones. When they get it right, it's usually really good and I just can't stop eating them. Macaroni Salad - I always have to get this. Has just the right amount of mayo so you don't feel gross after eating 4 spoonfuls of it. Cole Slaw - am I the only one who thinks KFC still has the best cole slaw?? This is a must stop if you're in the San Diego area.

Not impressed. There is always a line around the block, so we went in once. The place was SO loud and crowded I felt like I was at a rave. It's really dirty...there's meat all over the floor. Also, you can just buy the BBQ sauce yourself at the counter....why wait in that crazy long line and eat while screaming conversations at each other? PS. I like trader joes bbq sauce way better.

This is so good even my vegetarian wife likes to go here! (for the fries and corn-on-the-cob). Personally I go with a boneless chicken breasts and baby back ribs combo, the best of both, plus a healthy serving of fries.

As seems to be the consensus, Phil's is worth the line. Every time I brave it, I recall a nugget of wisdom a Dove Chocolate wrapper once imparted to me: "The anticipation is half the pleasure." And I appreciate sweet, sweet Phil's that much more. Everyone goes to Phil's. It's crazy famous and there's a line that goes around the building into the parking lot, which is the sole barrier between the restaurant and one of the less polished parts of San Diego. The food is awesome, the staff is great, and blah blah blah. If you'd like to see what the prices are like and what the menu looks like, you may as well look around the page because it's easy to find. Rather than tell you what you probably know from reading the reviews around me, I'll simply go over what I like to get. Every time I hanker for some barbecue, I go down to Phil's with a partner and we split two things: the Broham pulled pork and El Toro tri-tip sandwiches. This is accompanied by some combination of coleslaw, potato salad, and/or macaroni salad. We split them down the middle and distribute, then tear in. Each bite of pork and beef is as juicy as the last, and I have a happy tummy. Don't sweat the wait and share with friends. These are the only pieces of advice I will give as you can't go wrong with whatever it is that you order.

Phil's BBQ was just okay. Now before you start throwing BBQ sauce at me and calling me crazy, I'd just like to say that while I can see why people like this place, people just overhype the food way too much. Upon arrival, we were not too surprised to see that the line had extended way past the entrance of the restaurant, and looked more like a line to a Six Flag's roller coaster ride rather than to a BBQ joint. The staff was totally cool, and were passing out free samples of their famous onion rings, which was a great way to keep the hungry people in line happy. I wish I could gush over the food like most people here, but to be honest, I didn't fall in love at first bite. The baby back ribs were tender, but there were some pieces that were sort of dry and grainy. The sauce was pretty tasty--sweet and tangy, just the way I like it. But as for the actual meat, it was fall-off-the-bone but I had a hard time finishing up certain pieces. For my side dishes, I also got the macaroni salad and the corn. Sorry to say, but I liked the sides better than the actual ribs. The macaroni salad was small, but it was delicious and refreshing. The corn was sweet, but tasted even better after I brushed on some butter and sprinkled on some cajun seasoning. You can thank me for the suggestion next time you try this! Even though you'll most likely be met with long lines every time you come here, the line has a tendency to move fast, and there is plenty of room to accomodate all the famished patrons. I don't know if this would be my first choice of restaurants to dine at next time I visit SD, but if I'm ever craving BBQ, I'd give this place another shot.

1) the lines are LONG. out the door long. there's even a "starting here wait time is 30 min" sign that gives the whole place a very amusement park touristy attraction feeling to it all. You can call in or order to-go for much faster service, though; we ordered enough food for a family of 9 and got it all in 15 min. 2) pretty slim veggie options. no fish; there is a veggie burger, though. you can get it bbq style w/ an onion ring or with lettuce & tomatoes. 3) the onion rings come in a child's sized shoe box so one box is definitely enough. Also, if you're ordering to go, start eating them in the car because onion rings just have to be eaten hot.

Wanted to check out what all the hype is about and totally worth it! Didn't mind waiting in line for ~30 mins on a Saturday night.. The best BBQ chicken I have ever had, same goes for the Onion rings and Coleslaw. Reasonably priced! Casssual attire..What more can you ask for? Also ÊI like the strict rules they had- no table holding etc, hate it when people do that Great service! Will definitely go again. Thanks Yelp!

YAY! Phil's Bbq!! I am not a huge fan of bbq at all, but oh man does Phil's hit the spot! :) The ribs are amazing! Super mouthwatering.The sides are awesome! I loveeee the potato salad. Service is great here! Super friendly. Go during lunch time to try to beat the dinner rush if you're craving ribs! The line gets pretty crazy sometimes. But it's totally worth the wait! This is definitely a place to go eat if you're not from San Diego!

I was never a fan of BBQ and that whole ordeal all because of a ruined store bought ribs I got somewhere. But I decided to give the whole bbq thing another shot. And not just any kind of bbq, but Phil's BBQ. Go big or go home right? This place is unbelievably packed I'm pretty sure everyday. Noon is when it starts picking and towards the PM time it gets really packed. The line would literally rap around the corner of the building where you could see people eating outside hah. But don't get me wrong peoples! The food they had to offer was pretty damn amazing. Not your average beef/baby back ribs or bbq sandwiches. These meals come in pretty sizable portions. And the quality I would say is pretty high up there if you love meat! If you're hungry I recommend the full beef rib dinner which isnt too bad for around $20. Something light like a sandwich I would recommend either the Broham or the El Toro. Every bite of those bad boys are delicious. And let me tell you about the sides they got, well, one in particular that I personally love, their Onion Rings. Not just any ordinary onion rings. They call these bad boys Colossal Onion Rings haha. Comparable in size to doughnuts maybe :). But hey with that dip that comes with it I think ranch or something - oh man heaven. Let me tell you after going there the first time. I am now a huge fan of BBQ! Oh and their sauce? Man you just gotta go like next time anyone's visiting Socal SD! Check it out! It's worth the wait! Looking for a place to binge on food this is up there.

I could go to Phil's at least once a week. ÊThe food is awesome no matter what you order. ÊI'm a sandwich guy, so that's usually what I get. ÊThe onion rings are beasts!! Took the fam here over the holidays and my little sis ate more than I had ever seen her eat before. ÊCheck Phil's out. ÊThe line may be intimidating, but if you're in good company the time will pass before you know it. ÊYou can also check their website live stream to see how long the line currently is.

Are you kidding me, Phil's?! I'll be sitting in my office typing away like a good little worker monkey when I find myself fantasizing about their pork ribs slathered in that mouth-watering BBQ sauce. That's when I have to hold back the tears because I'm MILES away from this amazing establishment. If you haven't gone, seriously... SERIOUSLY: go!

I love Phil's BBQ! Sometimes it's better to call in and order to go, it's always busy and the line sometimes go around the building, BUT WELL WORTH THE WAIT, if your willing. It has a medium sized bar area with tv's that's great for sports events, some might even consider it small though. The dining/eating area seems like a good old fashioned country club with wood accents everywhere, it's got that southern vibe with a nice and cool atmosphere regardless of all the hustle and bustle. The people are great and the girls are cute! Sometimes you can catch Phil workin' with his workers and that's dedication coming from an owner. Service is quick and easy. *Food: The menu is easy and not overwhelming...it only gets overwhelming when you can't decide what to get. I'm always getting the boneless chick-less dinner, BBQ broham and the el toro, I love it so much that I would marry it! It's so good i'm startin' to sweat just thinkin about it *sigh*...so sexy! The chicken is sweet and juicy, BBQ'd to perfection, it has the right amount of juiciness and tenderness. The BBQ sauce is sweet with a hint of hickery, it's not so much smokey but full of just heavenly flavor from Phil's rub (which you can also purchase a jar of). The El toro is very soft and succulent, it practically melts in your mouth, the same goes for the BBQ Broham. The meat is so tender that it just melts in your mouth...just like M&M's but SOFTER! There are no words to really describe how good phil's BBQ, that might be overstated but you just have to try it out because it's just awesomely good...to me at least...and some others. With that being said, I haven't tried other BBQ places to go on but Phil's BBQ is definitely up there. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because of it's over-crowdedness and no drive through, but that's just me. It's just so good that I would want it now and not later whenever I crave for Phil's BBQ, it's so good that it makes me very impatient, but I guess i'm just picky about things. If you visit San Diego you gotta try Phil's BBQ, it's kinda like a San Diego type of deal. Go with a group, friend or by yourself, either way, it's a win.

I'm always getting the 5 bone beef dinner with fries and macaroni salad; you cannot go wrong with that! By the way, my wife and I always share that and have left-overs, unless you are a big eater, you might want to get the 3 bone version. The ambiance is great, the service is fast too. The only downside is the line! Unless it is you or a group of 4 and no bigger, you can cut to the front and go to the bar section.

I would give 3.75 Stars to be exact, but I'll round up for them. The first time I went to Phil's was probably 8 years ago at their old location, and I didn't think it lived up to the hype so I never went back. Fast forward to Memorial Day Weekend 2012, and I decided to give it another try since people STILL raved about it and I stayed close by. Bottom Line: It IS pretty good, but I wouldn't stand in that huge line for it, nor would I travel a huge distance to get it. ÊI would definitely recommend the to-go route, which took less than 10 minutes. If you're a BBQ aficionado and only appreciate true slow smoked BBQ, however, then you WILL be disappointed. My impressions: 1) To Go Service was excellent, fast, efficient. ÊThey did forget to give me my sides, but they corrected that quickly. ÊThe line attendant was friendly. 2) Full Rack of Baby Back Ribs w/ sides: I slow smoke BBQ as a hobby, so I typically expect a smoke ring and more robust smoke flavor. ÊI believe Phil's ribs are finished over wood, so there is some smokiness but it's hit or miss depending where you bite! ÊThe sauce is tangy and flavorful, which I think is what most people enjoy about the ribs. ÊThey're very tender, but I usually prefer a little more bite to the meat. ÊI give the ribs 3.5 stars, and I would prefer Lucille's BBQ ribs over these (if you wanted to compare commercial ribs). Ê I got the macaroni salad and cole slaw with it. ÊThe macaroni salad was very good I thought, and the cole slaw was your standard run of the mill slaw. 3) Pulled Pork Sandwich: this was actually pretty good! ÊSurprisingly there was a lot of smoke flavor in the sandwich, and it was HUGE. ÊI was most pleasantly surprised by this.

4.5 stars and over 3800 reviews...you do the math! I'm not one to enjoy waiting for anything, but it's BBQ baby back ribs and it's 4.5 stars out of over 3800 reviews!!!! Top ten in America!! After weighting the pros and cons of waiting, from one foodie to another, you just know you must be crazy to pass up this opportunity!!! I waited. 1 hour and 15 minutes long. That's a lot better than their usual 2 hour wait. The line wrapped around the restaurant! It must be that good right? We were starving after a long day at Seaworld, but we had to have food that was going to put that cherry on top of our perfect day. And a cherry on top this place was! I'll cut to the chase because with all these reviews telling you the same thing I'm going to tell you, then you gotta convince yourself to check it out after the 4th review you've read. Dinner for two: $30.00-Get the full rack with the two sides and add their famous onion rings on the side. Small size. That should be MORE than enough for two if your appetite isn't huge. If its not enough, ask the awesomely nice waiters if you can order extra. They'll let you order again without having to stand outside in the long line again. All I can say is it was AMAZING! The ribs were tender and just separated from the bone just as easy as a one night stand. It was sinfully delicious, and if I could, I'd get it pregnant or sew my rear end shut so we'd never part. (I ordered another full rack to take home since I couldn't do either one of those options)

Yelp has let me and my family down on these reviews..... The hour wait wouldn't have been a problem if the food was worth it. Everyone in our party agreed the Meat was SOOOO DRY that we almost choked. The pulled pork sandwich must have been cooked four days prior to serving it to the table. There were hard pieces of pork in the sandwich that could have been used a weapon. All of their meat must be cooked days in advance than reheated to a crisp to be able to keep up with their OVERHYPED demand. Think about it people their kitchen isn't big enought to be cooking the food fresh to keep up with the demand. Oh and if you think you can just douse your DRY meat in some BBQ sauce....Not going to happen unless you bring your mortgage payment with you to buy some more sauce! One last thing worth mentioning the STAFF is the rudest bunch of employees you have ever encountered, and if Bon QUI QUI is the one who is monitering the line you better stay in line, don't even move to go pee, cause she will ask you "WHO YOU WIT"? "WHERE U GOIN" "I OWN DIS PLACE" Ê So if you are dumb enough to eat at PHILS bring your own sauce, pee at home before you leave, and know how to perform the hemlich manouver, for when your friends CHOKE on the dry meat!

Does this place need another 5 star review? ÊBasically the best baby back ribs you can have in southern California. ÊThe line is sometimes unreasonably long. Ê You should order in advance and pick it up. ÊAnd take it home. ÊIt'll still be just as good. ÊOr you can just go to the bar, and there is bar seating that usually takes about 15 minutes to get. One last tip, just get the baby back ribs and some sides. ÊDon't get their beef ribs. ÊDon't get their chicken, even though you like bbq chicken, even if you feel like eating some chicken that day.

So I finally had Phil's BBQ and felt that it was needed especially since I reviewed two of the best BBQ's in LA. (JayBees and Bludsoe's) and having tried their bbq I can finally make what i believe is an unbiased opinion. Phil's beef ribs was amazing!!! beats JayBees and Bludsoe's hands down. For beef rib ive never had anything so soft and tender. As for the rest I think Jaybees is still better. Their sauce isnt as good as Jaybees and their sides were not as good. However their onion rings were amazing!!! When i finished my meal, I was walking out and saw their pulled pork sandwich and as full as i was it made my mouth water and my jaws drop!!! why didnt i order one of those!?! will come back and try their sandwiches. Overall this is one of the best BBQ's and it definitely deserves a 5 star!!!

after a morning/afternoon at seaworld, the boyfriend and i worked up a real appetite and decided to try the much talked about phils bbq. got there around 3:30 and there was no line. well, that's a lie. there was a group of five infront of us but compared to all the other reviews i've read, i can't complain. i got the half rack ribs with coleslaw and baked beans. i rarely ever eat beans a) because they fill you up b) they make you tut, unless that's just a rumor c) just don't like them. but wow, phils made me not want to share them. coleslaw was equally as good. the bbq ribs...fall of the bone deliciousness. the boyfriend got the bbq chicken all white because he's a health freak and didn't forgo our diet like i did on our vacation. but that was also delicious. i thought it'd be dry but not at all. we ended up having half the chicken left over for dinner that night plus a little but bit of our our sides. overall, i think if i had to wait for 3 hours, i would just order from the to-go line and eat on the steps.

Phil's has amazing baby back ribs and beefy ribs. The staff here is also really friendly as well. If you come on a friday night or during the weekend, this place tends to get really packed. Don't be surprised if you have to wait in line for over an hour. But, if you go before the lunch rush, before 11:30ish, the line is pretty short. This place is, by far, my favorite place for ribs. I even brought my parents here before as well and they loved it too! The meat is really tender and flavorful. Their portions are pretty big as well!

There is a reason Phil's is a Top 10 restaurant. ÊEXCELLENT food, BEST service, and every detail is thought of in their restaurant (I visited the Point Loma location). ÊI could go on and on, but here are the highlights: WHAT I LOVED: Ê- The bathroom. ÊSeriously. ÊCleanest bathroom and little touches that really make you feel like your hands are READY for some down'n'dirty eatin (minus the dirt!) - including arm handles on the doors so you aren't washing hands and then grabbing a filthy knob. ÊWIN. Ê- The beans, ribs, and macaroni salad. ÊI am NOT a mac salad gal myself, but this was perfect goop to pasta ratio (very light on the goop) and TASTY. Ê- The TRI TIP - OH GAWD THE TRI TIP!

Seriously, this place is flipping amazing. I had my first taste 4 years ago when I visited my friends down in San Diego and to this day, I still crave it every time I think of barbeque (once a week usually). I have no problems waiting in line, however long, as long as I can get my ribs here. The baby back ribs are to die for. The meat is flavorful, juicy, and tender, and it falls off easily. Surprisingly enough, the beefy ribs are just as well made. I usually think of bigger ribs as tougher and harder to eat, but nope, these are freakishly amazing too. Personally, I think they drench on the barbeque sauce too much so I just ask for it on the side. I love the sauce but too much can overpower the flavor of the meat. When I'm leaving, I buy a giant bottle of the sauce and bring it back home to norcal to share with family. For the sides, I'd recommend the sweet baked beans and the macaroni salad. Both are great compliments to the meat! Just writing this review is making me crave Phil's all over again....please open one in the Bay Area!!

Reviewer.... #40-- O.O... #4066 What can I say that hasnt already been mentioned 4,065 times? I do drive two hours, 120 miles, across over 100 BBQ restaurants to go to Phil's BBQ. Yes, despite the 1 hour wait, 1.5 hour wait, 2 hour wait, I still continue to stand in line for this BBQ. "WHY?!?!?!?!?" You demand to ask, shaking me back and forth. BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE BEST GOSH DARN HEAVENLY BABY BACK RIBS EVERRRR!!!!!!!! WHAT IN THE WORLD DO THEY DO TO IT?!?! I have no idea. But their baby back ribs are succulent, juicy, and topped with the most flavorful barbecue sauce in the entire state of California. The pricing is JUST right, not too expensive and not too cheap. You can get their dinner combo where you choose the different amount of racks and then you can choose two sides or one large side. You walk up to the cashier, order, pay, take a seat, wait for the ringing machine to vibrate, walk up to the counter, get your plate of heaven, then... DIG IN. Yes, their baby back ribs are delicious but everything else is not as great to be honest. NEVER.... NEVER... come during dinner time... NEVER... NEVER ... come during weekends. Lines are literally always 1-2 hours. I got smart after the first two times and came here on a weekday at 11am. There was still a 30 minute wait, BUT its way better than 1-2 hours. Parking is easy peasy. Never had trouble because they have an entire parking lot for it. Staff is great. They are very welcoming, enthusiastic, and friendly.

I came to this restaurant during my trip to San Diego. I thought this place was mediocre and a bit overrated. I stood in line for a good 30 minutes; which was anticipated from hearsay. We were served free samples of onion rings while standing in line - kudos for that. I tried their ribs and it didn't have that 'smokey' taste that I expected. ÊI couldn't tell if the ribs were actually smoked in the smoker because frankly they tasted baked. The side dishes were good - cole slaw and corn.

I might be the last person in all of San Diego to learn of this place. ÊI was driving down Sports Arena Blvd to go to Home Depot when I noticed the crazy long line going into this place. ÊWith that kind of line, it has to be good right? ÊPlus there was an advertisement saying they were recognized as top 10 in the US. So a few weeks later, we went at 11am. ÊThere was already a long line but luckily we managed to get in another line for eating at the bar - there's also a shorter line for people taking food to go. Ê We got the ribless meal with cole slaw and beans. ÊFor the price, you get lots of really good food. ÊBut it's just good, not great. ÊThe best bbq is still found in the South, not the west.

When you reach the point where it says "Approximate wait time from this point is 21 minutes & 14 seconds", expect to wait longer than that. I still wonder why 14 seconds? If you go with a party of equal or greater than 5, it is highly likely you are able to get a table as soon as you pass that "21 minutes & 14 seconds" point. If you go with just another person, after you order at the counter, you need to wait for another 10-15 minutes or so. So big group gets the priority here!

ONE WORD -- LEGIT!!!! Ever since I've been back from SD, I can't stop thinking about Phil's because there's really no other place that can compare in LA. Because there's not a single complaint on my end (there was no wait because we arrived moments before the lunch rush hit!), Phil's get a shiny star from me for being top-notch at its price. I had the half chicken meal with 2 small sides (or you could opt for 1 large side) for less than $10 after taxes. The meat was tender and the flavoring was perfect (not too sweet, not too tangy). Small sides include fries, baked beans, cole slaw, potato salad, macaroni salad. Large sides included baked potato, corn-on-the-cob, veggies, and larger portions of the small sides. Since my friend ordered a potato salad and fries, I had the fries and macaroni salad. They aren't lying when they said the sides were small, but they complimented the chicken VERY well. I couldn't stop stabbing my fork everywhere while I gorged on the chicken. The fries may be a little plain, but dip it in extra BBQ sauce and you're good to go! It seems as though my friend enjoyed his rib dinner as well because he demolished it! As for the experience, you walk in, admire the liveliness of the place, get in line while you stare at the menu on the wall, make a decision, walk up to one of the multiple cashiers, pay for your food (and possibly leave a tip in one of their jars with hilarious messages written across it like 'booze money'), take a seat, and wait as your food is delivered to you! Friendly and fast service, and they even thank you as you leave right before they clean up the table for the next party with super fast speed. Oh, and if it gets messy, there's a sink right next to the soda machines. Don't be afraid to dig in, but make sure you sanitize your hand first! I will absolutely be back.

The baby back ribs are exactly like everybody says: melt in your mouth, fall off the bone, tender, delicious, and juicy.

OK I admit it's GOOD. ÊBut not wait in line for 2 hours good. ÊI came here last summer after my friend's graduation and was met with a 30 minute line. ÊNot bad, there were a bunch of us and we were chilling so not a big deal. ÊI probably wouldn't wait 30 minutes again for it though. ÊNor would I wait what I could only imagine to be a 2 hour wait, which was what we saw as we left. ÊThe line wrapped around the corner, alongside the restaurant, all the way to the other side of the parking lot. ÊRidiculous. But back to the food.

Tonight I ordered a half rack of baby back ribs, along side corn on the cob and onion rings. Going to go back and try the tri-tip sandwich since that's starred on Man Vs. Food. :) My friends also ordered ribs and sides like fries, potato salad, cole slaw, and macaroni salad. This place can be a bit pricey, but they're big on their portion sizes and you'll definitely leave with a full stomach. Also, even though the wait time in line takes forever, the staff makes an effort to keep all of their customers happy. I really appreciated the staff for making friendly conversation with me.

Baby back ribs tickler Barbecue broham Barbecue chicken and beef ribs combo For the baby back ribs, the meat was just falling off the bones and was so tender. I loved the sauce, which had just the right amount of spiciness to it. And, the coleslaw was really good. I would definitely come back here the next time I'm in San Diego!!!

You ever think that a certain kind of food doesn't taste that great but everyone raves about it? Then you all of a sudden try it somewhere and then you find yourself strangely in love or obsessed with it? That is my experience with ribs at Phil's BBQ. FOOD: AMAZING. Ribs were underwhelming anywhere else I've had them and I never understood it. I didn't even care much for bbq sauce either. Then I came here and wow. Just wow. Their ribs are exactly what ribs should taste like. Everyone should follow their example. Every place that makes ribs should be like Plankton from Spongebob and try to steal the secret recipe. Beef Ribs, Pork Ribs, it's all great! Their Potato Salad was good, but not great. Their French Fries were sooooo frickin' good when dipped with the bbq sauce. I didn't realize that I liked bbq sauce until I couldn't stop dipping my Fries in them. The Onion Rings are gigantic and pretty good too. I'm pretty damn sure that the food they serve here is the stuff they serve in heaven. It's simply, divine. Oh, except for the Healthy Boneless Chicken thing...I think they're called Skinless Chicklets or something (it's been a while, I forget). Those are just whatever, I could have done without those. ATMOSPHERE: It's a loud place as it's very crowded and reminds me of a sports bar. It might be one, not sure. My group sat kinda in the corner in a different room away from the crowd. SERVICE: I don't recall seeing any waitresses or waiters. I think you just line up to order your food, you pick it up, and go find your seat. Everything you need is around you or at a station where you get your drinks. Overall, I hate that this place is 2 hours away from me. I hate that I've only been here once. I hate that the wait can be really really long (though it didn't feel that long that day as I was with good people). I can't wait to come back though! It haunts my dreams and whenever brings up San Diego, I IMMEDIATELY think of this place. It's like, pretty much the reason why I would even go down there.

Can't complain about Phil's. I always over eat when I come here because every plate has large proportions, can't complain though. Good thing about this place is that you can eat healthy too. Try the Chicken breast with a side of steamed veggies. Service is also great. If you are planning in Êmaking a trip here, make sure you are patient to wait in line. Definitely give yourself about 1hr if you are going there for your lunch break, as most of the time there's a long line. Well worth the trip.

I just realized this was my 3rd review. -.- But anywho, I ordered take out this time since I knew the line was going to be LOOOOONNNGGGG (saturday night). I phoned in my order and I was told to come ASAP because even the pick up line was around 30 minutes. I left asap, but ended up waiting FOREVER! We saw a pick up order sitting on a counter for a while... so finally decided to ask if that was ours. Turned out it was :( and it has been sitting there for a long long time. But luckily (!!), Phil (maybe? manager?) saved our night!!! He totally sympathized with us and apologized for the mishap. He then told the kitchen to re-do our order again and guaranteed us it would be under 5 minutes. Voila!! And it happened. =) GREAT food, EXTRAORDINARY service!!! I'd give Phil's 6 stars if I could :) :)

This place is overrated, food quality I'd give it 3 star, but for the service and food portion I'll give it 5 star. ADVICE? the food portion is really HUGE!!! a full rack meal with 2 potato sides can really feed up 2 ppl..no kidding, THINK CAREFULLY before you order lol!!! I was suggesting to get different items and share with my friend so we can try everything, but my friend was being selfish and say he'll eat up all his full rack of baby back ribs..so we ended up both getting the full rack of baby back ribs..at the end..we both couldn't finish half of our plate n he regretted: why did we order so much food? (we also ordered a 1/4 BBQ chicken and a small size onion rings) This feels like a BBQ fast food place because the foods come really fast, when we finished ordering our food and when my friend walked to our table, the buzzer buzzed already, our foods were already ready!! Êfor the food portion, price, speed..simply amazing. :) Not the best baby back ribs I ever had, their "baby" are pretty huge and meaty but doesn't taste that "baby", what m I talking about? it didn't feel like I'm eating baby back ribs, more like child back ribs, but it's all good, it's better than barely having any meat on the rib. The sides: ÊPotato salad turns out good after I sprinkle some cajun seasoning, but be careful don't sprinkle too much/hard they are pretty salty. Onion Rings: Êdon't know what's the deal with the rings, they are just huge that's it....yes they are good but I can imagine each of those ring contains maybe 150-250calroies. Ê What I dislike: sauce!! Their sauce are way too tangy and overwhelming..way too much that it overcome the taste of the meat, I had to use my fork to get rid of the excessive sauce on the ribs. ÊI wish if they could have different flavors of BBQ sauce to go with, like Lucille's. ÊI think Lucille's beats Phil's on the sauce selections, I like Lucille's BBQ sauce and sweet/hot BBQ sauce, they are much less tangy than Phil's sauce and the hot BBQ sauce adds spicy to the ribs. What I would suggest them to improve on: 1. sauces - more selections would be nice. 2. wings!!!! BBQ wings is a must for a BBQ restaurant. Next time I think I'd rather order by phone and just go pickup instead of waiting 30min+ in the line. ÊBut overall, good experiences!!

I practically made a trip down to San Diego just for Phil's. I've made plenty of trips down to SD back in college when a lot of my friends went to UCSD. Those fools never sought to enlighten me about Phil's, we practically ate mexican every meal and I love my carne asada fries as much as the next, but COME ON. They aren't my friends anymore starting this moment. In an effort not to wait in a long line I placed a to go order. It was raining the day I went and also at an off hour, and still there was a decent sized line. A testament to how popular this joint is. Food was prepped and ready to go pretty much when I arrived. Objects of desire ordered: Full rack of ribs: They were indeed fall off the bone. The sauce was perfect. Quite honestly it might be the best ribs I've ever had. I'm still a bit shocked that despite all the hype, it lived up to it. This is rare, very. Chicken: Juicy, but compared to the flavor in the ribs the chicken seemed a bit ordinary. Not comparing this is definitely very delectable. Onion Rings: Thick and nicely battered. Good junky compliment. SUMMARY: Major hype and lived up to it, which is beyond rare.

I came here on a wednesday night I believe and it was PACKED. But the line was very quick and I got my food right away. I got ribs and fries because I believe Phil's is known for that but I was a bit disappointed. I didn't want phils to be one of those overly hyped places that don't have much to show for but it was. The ribs were okay and the fries was okay, but for a widely known restaurant, okay food is not what I was expecting. Come here if you want to have the experience but its not worth a second trip.

Phil's ribs were great and lived up to their reputation. I thought they could have served the meats with far less sauce. Truly great BBQ shouldn't need much extra sauce or it looks like it's being used as crutch. Still super good though and would go back for sure.

A different experience is in store for you. The long lines move surprisingly quick. You order your food while standing in line, pay for it, then pick up when your number is called. The self-service was unexpected. Waite staff moves fluently around the restaurant, but is only concerned with making sure tables are ready for the next guests. Onion Rings were great as were the fries. The "ribs" were dry, tuff and untasty., may have been an off day or maybe they weren't fresh. Totally unexpected, as this is their signature dish. Other members of our party got burgers or chicken and were very satisfied. Confusion at the soda bar was a little scary, they should add a second soda bar. Have turned down 2 invites to dine here again. May try it again.

This place is amazing! Great food, great vibes, great people, and all around a great place to eat! ÊI came here with a big group, and we happen to come on a busy night [there was a performer next door at the sports arena], but the line was surprisingly fast for how long it was; it was no more than 20 minutes tops. ÊAfter we all ordered, we were surrounded by amazing .. what would you call them .. servers? ÊWe were tended well to, and I was surprised since this isn't the type of place where you have a server per table. ÊAll the staff were extremely nice; not a single one looked like they were not having fun doing what they do. The food, which should be the main focus, was delicious! I highly recommend the beefy ribs [tender meat that practically melts off the bone with their signature bbq sauce]. I can't wait until the next time I come!

It never ceases to amaze me what people in san Diego consider good Bbq. ÊI'm from Kansas city and know what great Bbq is. Kc Bbq downtown should be shut down. Phils is a joke. It wouldn't last two seconds in kc. I read several reviews and people say oh wow this is better than tony romas and famous daves. Hahhaa of course it is those are chain spots. Now the meat is crap but the sauce is pretty good. If you are savvy at all try a cherry Bbq sauce then theirs its the same base sauce. Sides are good and they are not stingy at all. If you want good Bbq go on http://smokehousebbq.com and order it you'll get it faster than standing in that line. Of course it received the top 10 of 11 on yelp. Put a top of the line taco shop in kc and it will be the same. Phils isn't better than huffmans. Period

Since I am indecisive, being LITERALLY surrounded by menus during my 20 minutes wait was super helpful! Ambiance: Large, fast, friendly,family oriented, large parties, huge facility, order&pay. Service: Although we had to wait 20 minutes to order our food, the food came out very fast (in about 10 minutes our buzzer lighted up) and it wasn't very difficult to find a seating. Also, the waiters were all very friendly and helpful. Taste: DELICIOUS. Some of the sides were disappointing, but I came here for BBQ ribs and they delivered. "Beefy Ribs and Chicken Dinner" (2 bones and 1/4 lb chicken with 2 sides)- $12.45 For the sides, we chose potato salad and coleslaw. The beefy rib is huge and full of so much meat. However, the texture is definitely tougher and you really need to bite off the meat. ÊThe beefy rib is not as tender but it has much more smokier flavor. The chicken was simply terrible because it was very dry. I'll definitely ask for the dark meat next time. "Full Rib Dinner" (10-12 baby back ribs with 2 small sides)- $18.95 We chose macaroni salad and french fries This was simply amazing. The meat ripped and fell right off the bones. The meat was tender and full of delicious flavors. It tasted like heaven! The french fries were disappointing since I heard so much good stuff about it. The macaroni salad was a favorite as well. Beefy rib vs. Baby back rib Verdict: The beefy rib is definitely very manly and tough. I would prefer the baby back rib because it is so tender and easy to eat Price: Fair Overall: I love Phil's BBQ. I actually went to Phil's again 3 days later but this time in their second location in San Marcos. There was absolutely no wait, the food came out a little slower, but the french fries were excellent and the quality was better. Lastly, the hand-washing-station is BRILLIANT. ÊRight outside the bathroom was a huge a stainless steal sink to wash your dirty hands! PS. To check if it is a busy night, simply go onto their website and click the LIVE WEBCAM to see how long the line is!

I've lived in San Diego for the majority of my life but my dislike of crowds prevented me from trying Phil's BBQ. Ê After reading several of the less-than-5-stars reviews, I can understand their complaints. ÊHowever, I am a member of the 5-star-crowd and I wil explain why: Upon arrival, there was an estimated 21 minute wait to order. ÊBig deal, I've waited longer at other places. ÊBesides, standing in line gives the illusion of progress, rather than standing around waiting to hear your name called. Ê Once at the ordering counter, we quickly placed an order as we had 21 minutes to decide. ÊMy boyfriend ordered the beefy ribs and chicken dinner, while I foolishly ordered a pulled pork sandwich because I thought it would be small. ÊHA. HA. HA. Seating is a free-for-all, and I have a feeling that arriving closer to the traditional lunch hour would be quite frustrating. ÊHowever, we came a bit before noon so we quickly found a table. ÊI've seen come critical remarks about the soda fountain, calling it confusing. ÊAll I have to say is if you're confused over walking up to a soda fountain and serving yourself, then Welcome to America, I hope you enjoy your stay here. Ê So, so far we have encountered an ordering and seating system more akin to fast food than restaurant fare. ÊIf that turns you off, then by all means pass up Phil's. ÊThere is no table service, and no-frills. ÊDo I care? ÊNo. ÊI just paid $6.95 for the World's Largest and Most Delicious Pulled Pork Sandwich, and all I can think about is "THIS IS DELICIOUS". Ê I have had a variety of beef ribs in my life and I typically go for the baby back because they're easier for me to eat. ÊNot the beefy ribs here. ÊMy boyfriend handed me a rib to try and the meat fell off the bone and into my mouth. ÊHoly smokes, that was juicy, tender, AND tasty! ÊI would likely order that for myself on my next visit to Phil's. ÊI also had a taste of the chicken breast which was a bit dry but still good. ÊBut come on, chicken? ÊPlease pass the ribs. Ê As for the sides, we split a large order of onion rings (big mistake, a small would have been better for two) and my boyfriend ate his whole corn on the cob with his dinner. ÊThe onion rings are excellent and I miss them already. Ê So yes, and excellent meal and I do believe the food is a good value for the price. ÊBest barbecue I've had in San Diego and I am looking forward to more!

OK, so before you become shocked about this review, please know that I am a Texas girl. And in Texas, we have some mean barbecue. It's not that I don't like Phil's. I do. I like getting the BBQ Broham. But, their sides just don't uphold to standards. The potato salad is bland and disappointing. And the beans, are just mediocre at best. The true purpose of barbecue is to mix everything together, thus the quality of sides are as important to me as the meat for an overall barbecue experience.

I'm not the biggest fan of barbeque...but I am a big fan of Phil's BBQ. =) ÊOrder the baby back ribs and battered onion rings. ÊYou will be in food heaven. =) This was my favorite out of our "Man vs. Food" stops - and apparently, all of San Diego knows about Phil's BBQ. ÊThis place is very organized and has a high turnover of customers. ÊWe've been a couple of times, and no matter what time you go, it will be crowded or there's a line. ÊIn fact, we came on a rainy day right at 11am (when they open) and there was a line about 15 people deep...then after we got in, the restaurant filled up quickly. I recommend ribs - I personally prefer the baby back ribs but the beef ribs are delicious as well. ÊThe meat is really tender and falls off the bone. ÊI also prefer to have my sauce on the side, with just a dry rub on my ribs. ÊWhether you like it smothered in sauce or dry, the ribs are just good. ÊI've also had the BBQ chicken which was ok. ÊI think I need to try the tri-tip but honestly, all I want to eat here are ribs because they're the best I've tried so far. ÊThe sides seem ok...I really love the corn on the cob though. ÊIt's really fresh and prepared perfectly here. ÊThe best appetizer/side though are the onion rings!! ÊGet an order to share with friends - there's a lot but you'll finish them all I bet. ÊI love battered onion rings over the breaded ones - they are really good here! The staff here is super friendly, everything runs efficiently and I love me an organized restaurant! ÊThis is definitely one of the places we always want to eat at when we are in San Diego. =)

Went here recently and had almost everything they offer. ÊOverall, it is very good, but some things were great, while others were so so. ÊDefinitely not the best meal on the entire western US, or one of the 10 best restaurants in the US, or any of the other ludicrous superlatives that have been lavished on it. ÊIt IS, however, very good BBQ. The baby back ribs were tasty..they had a nice smoky flavor with the sauce which is tangy and sweet. ÊThe beef sandwich was also very good...the beef was sliced into small pieces and they had a very good meaty, sweet flavor, and it was very generous. ÊThe sandwich had a ton of meat falling out of it. ÊThe pulled pork sandwich was also very good, and similar to the beef sandwich. ÊNice texture and consistency, a ton of meat, and a good compliment to the sauce. ÊThe "famous" onion rings are pretty damn good also. ÊThey have a very good onion taste to them, unlike some other rings that you cannot even tell have onion in them. ÊThe battering is thick and delicious as well. The baked beans were pretty mediocre...they tasted like a can of cheap beans. ÊThe vegetables were also pretty sorry...they just tasted like plain vegetables, no seasoning or anything. ÊThe chicken tickler, which is basically just hunks of bbq breast meat with sauce were ok, but not that great. ÊThey are a little dry, which you might not notice since they are slathered with sauce, but that does not change the fact that they are otherwise a rather large and thick hunk of somewhat dry breast meat. Overall, it was very good. ÊNothing was throw away gross or anything, although some parts were less than stellar. ÊThe fact that you are guaranteed a semi long wait to sit down also knocks it down a bit. ÊWe waited 1 hour to order and sit down while standing in line. ÊHonestly, as I said, this lowers my rating a bit, because while it is definitely very good BBQ, it is not worth standing in line for an hour. ÊAlso, the inside is pretty disorganized, with some staff telling you to find your own table, others are telling you they will get you one, and being told not to take this table or that one for whatever reason. ÊThere is a take out line, which supposedly takes like 10 minutes, which is a better option if you want to take it home and eat it.

So after moving here I found it difficult to find a good BBQ joint. Phil's was recommended to me so naturally I checked it out. Not too bad. Very big portions. The two times I have been the meat has been too overcooked and dry for my taste. I think the reason Phil's has such a following though is because of their BBQ sauce. The sauce is delicious! If possible I would recommend going between "normal" meal hours because this place attracts a good amount of people and a line usually wraps around the building.

FAMOUS FOR: - Onion Rings (9/10) - Baby Back Ribs: Meat (8/10) - Sauce (6/10) I ALSO TRIED - BBQ Chicken: Meat (5/10) - Pulled Pork (No Sauce) (3/10) - Baked Beans (7/10) - Macaroni Salad (4/10) Took a trip to San Diego, so the first thing I check to see is if Guy Fieri's been here. He has, but the few places he went to didn't look very appetizing, except maybe the seafood place. So, since Flavortown failed me, I asked Yelp what the most popular place is in San Diego. I'm looking for a place with 500+ reviews, and if I'm lucky, I can find a place with 1,000. I come across this place and I see there are almost 4,000 reviews! I've never seen a place that came close to that, so for sure, I had to go! Now, even though I've been eating BBQ forever, I've only come to know about the different styles within the last couple years. I've come to the conclusion that I'm more of a Texas style - dry rub. When it comes to pork, I want to taste the meat. Sauce is good in its own regard, but only if it's done right. I like KC style sauces - more sweet and smokey flavors. So, Phil's...is neither. :/ ONION RINGS The thing I read in all reviews is how awesome their onion rings are and how crunchy they were (for me, crunchy = Valhalla). When I saw their pictures on the TV screen I noticed they were beer battered, which made me a little sad. We got them anyway, but already I was disappointed...but that was before I tried them. They were the crunchiest beer battered onion rings I've ever had. I think they actually battered them twice, because while it had the flakiness of a beer batter, it had almost the full crunch of a traditional batter. They were ginormous too. Very very tasty and dipped in ranch, you almost lose all self control! I would definitely order these again. It is still a beer batter, so it lost a little there. It could've been even crunchier with a more liberal application of the traditional batter. BABY BACK RIBS And here we are...the reason for Phil's existence. I got the "Best of Both" with baby back ribs and chicken plus 2 sides. The ribs are incredibly meaty, and a half rack is enough to fill you up, if you get the 2 sides. The ribs have a strange flavor, but it really works. Normally the meat is completely saturated with smoke flavor. Now, I really do love that, but strangely Phil's ribs have a very light smoke flavor and on top of that, it doesn't occupy the whole rib. It's almost layered in taste. During a bite of the rib, the light smoke flavor slowly fades in, gives you a taste, and slowly fades out. It's really weird, but, believe it or not, was kinda fun! While the ribs had excellent, and I mean really excellent, flavor, it was a little lacking in seasoning, but not enough to lose your marbles over. I suppose that's why the sauce comes into play... THE SAUCE Like I said, I like Kansas City sauce, sweet and smoky BBQ. I don't like Carolina style AT ALL! Phil's sauce is a mix. A lot of people like it, because they like the little tangy and sour taste, but not me. If I had to guess, it was 35% sweet, 65% tangy. It was a little too sour/tangy for my taste, and every time I had a piece of meat that needed some sauce, I actually had to think twice as to whether or not that 35% sweetness was worth it. I'm not saying it's bad, it's just not for me. BBQ CHICKEN The chicken was downright boring. It was just a tad dry, but I think it's what most people consider "average." I like my chicken almost greasy, but this chicken didn't do it for me. The flavor was also very boring. No flavor, and only a little seasoning. If this was smoked or grilled, I couldn't tell. With the sauce that I wasn't too much of a fan of, I really didn't want to do anything with this chicken. PULLED PORK I asked if they had a small sample of pulled pork, no sauce, but they didn't. It only comes in the Pulled Pork Sandwich with BBQ sauce. She did give me a small sample, though in a cup, which I was very appreciative of. After trying BBQ in Nashville and Houston, I found that I'm a big pulled pork (dry rub only) junkie. That being said, 0 other places than those 2 actually gave me pulled pork that I liked. This is another one of those failures. The pork was pretty dry, and at the same time completely, and utterly, flavorless AND seasonless! For their sake, I'm glad they don't serve this by itself! BAKED BEANS It's almost like Bush's can Baked Beans, but there was some other strange flavor in there, maybe a hint of ginger? I don't know what it was, but it was sort of a lateral move. It didn't add anything special, it just made it a little different. There's nothing wrong with their baked beans, it's just nothing special. MACARONI SALAD This was pretty bad. I'm not a fan of mac salad to begin with, but this was exceptionally bad. There was hardly any flavor in the salad. I suppose by being flavorless, it substituted for the lack of bread with this meal, but whatever. AS GOOD AS IT GETS? No. It's not bad, but nothing compelsMeToReturn.

What is there to say about Phil's that hasn't been said in 3800+ reviews...? Nothing. But I'll try anyways. First things first, I don't like bbq...I don't like bbq sauce and I don't really even like meat. ÊSo going to Phil's was a really big stretch for me. ÊI waited in line (in the rain) for about an hour with a friend to order our food, so by the time I got there I was expecting A LOT. Ê I ordered the combo with the beef ribs and bbq chicken with fries and baked beans. Good lord, it was amazing. As I said before, I don't like bbq sauce, but the bbq sauce was amazing. ÊThe beef ribs were literally falling off the bone and they were so tender and moist and they come with sooooooo much meat. ÊAs for the bbq chicken, contrary to some other reviews, I loved it. ÊI didn't think it was dry at all, it was honestly delicious. ÊFries were great as were the baked beans. Ê The atmosphere was comfortable and inviting and the service was great too, everyone was so friendly. ÊI have nothing but good things to say about Phil's and I recommend it to everyone, I can't wait to go back to San Diego so I can stop here

I have been coming here for years for my BBQ fix. Ê I came here for takeout during the first week of April 2012 and had a great experience. ÊAs usual the onion rings were to die for. ÊI had a pulled pork sandwich and coleslaw (on the side). ÊMy only gripe is that the bun of my sandwich was a bit tough. Ê I have to state that it was not heated once at home. ÊThey provide extra sauce and ranch dressing which is awesome.

One of the best food experiences of my life. We came on Sunday night to celebrate my birthday - there was a huge line out the door so we ate at the bar. The bartenders were incredibly friendly and welcoming - it felt like a home away from home. Hubby and I shared small order of onion rings & we both loved our sides - I had baked potato and my loverboy had corn on the cob. The baby back ribs were to.die. for. Anyone who can't give this place 5 stars needs to become vegetarian as this was a meat lover's paradise. Besides the wonderfully friendly staff - we loved the hand washing station!!! :)

Who would have thought I would fall in love with this place?! I'm not a fan of bbq sauce, but their food was delicious that I didn't mind! I had so many people talk about this place and how good it was, I wasn't expecting the hype to be Spot On! The prices were comparable to any other BBQ restaurant. I've tried all their meats, from the baby backs, chicken, to the beefy ribs (which I recommend to any meat lover! -- never had anything like it!) It was very flavorful and the meat just fell off the bone! Their sides are pretty good as well. My favorite is the onion rings. It had a thick crunchy batter and the rings were huge! The staff was very friendly and helpful. Overall, this is the best BBQ place I've been to. Definitely well worth the drive since I'm from Orange County. Would recommend to anyone and everyone who loves food! The only downfall is the wait (which is normally wrapped round the building -- maybe 1 hr to 1.5 hrs at the 2nd door), but it is absolutely worth the wait!

Popular in San Diego? - No doubt. San Diegans love this place. Real BBQ? - Real BBQ is about smoke, low temps & long cooking times. Phil's "grills" their ribs & chicken. San Diego calls this BBQ, but in reality it doesn't compare. Since Coop's rolled into town, they have lowered my rating of Phil's. Came here a few days ago & I was just disappointed. Don't get me wrong, it was OK & everyone in my party of 10 raved about it, but it just wasn't the real stuff. Coop's BBQ'd meats is about the smoke & the meat. It doesn't need sauce, but if you want to sauce it you're welcome to it. For San Diego, Phil's is the bomb & their overall rating & reviews demonstrates that. I'm fine with that. People like the taste of what Phil's puts out. ÊI'm just selfishly hoping that the neighborhood Coop's is in will keep the crowds away so I won't have to deal with long lines & waits.

I finally ate here. It was awesome, but with all the epic reviews and my friends fawning over it, I was a little underwhelmed. Maybe I had too high of expectations. The line wasn't too long, at about 7:30 on a Wednesday night, we waited maybe 20 minutes from getting in line to ordering. Our food did come out super fast though, boyfriend barely sat down before his food was ready. He got his usual, the baby back rib tickler and the broham (yeah, both). If you don't know, the tickler comes with fries, slaw, and two onion rings, no substitutions. It's quite a bit of food and boyfriend always loves it. The fries are really good, especially dipped in barbecue sauce instead of catsup. He got a "fry" that was basically a chunk of potato about as big as my wrist and it was hilarious. The broham is a pulled pork sandwich that has cole slaw on it. Pro tip: ask for the slaw on the side and you'll get more. I got a small caesar salad to start (not the best I've had but really big for being a $4 "small". I got the "Chick-less" dinner, which consists of chunks of white meat chicken in the barbecue sauce, along with either 2 small sides or one large. I got 7 large chunks of chicken and a baked potato with sour cream and cheese. I was not expecting the cheese to be a slice of Kraft cheese, but it was. That was weird. Potatoes are potatoes, but this one wasn't too dry or anything. The chicken was really good, not dry, nice and flavorful, but the sauce left something to be desired for me. It was good, don't get me wrong, but it was SO tangy that after a few pieces, my tongue was sick of it. And I LOVE sour, tart, tangy candies and foods. This was kind of a turn off. Overall, it was good, and I'm glad I finally ate here, but it wasn't anywhere near as mind-blowingly good as yelp and Man v. Food led me to believe.

We are still a fan and drove over a hundred miles to eat at Phil's BBq. Unfortunately this time they poured bbq sauce over our baby back ribs and killed the taste. Sorry, but we still ate them and all but not as great as last time. The service also was not as good clearing the tables but maybe they had new staff.

Hmm...3822 reviews!! ÊI guess mine will be #3823. ÊOverall, I'd give it a 4.5 stars, rounded up to 5. ÊThe 0.5 stars deduction is because they don't serve brisket or sausage nor do they give you extra BBQ sauce (you have to purchase extra sauce). Phil's BBQ is kinda like a Disneyland ride. ÊYou wait in line for a long time until you finally reach the end with all the cashiers. ÊIt's an order and then sit down type of BBQ place, sorta like Rudy's BBQ in Texas. ÊHowever, you don't get your order right away as they give you pagers and page you when your order is ready for pick-up. ÊLine is definitely long. ÊWe waited about 1 1/2 hours until we finally reached the end. The line on the right is for sit-down while the line on the left is for take out. ÊThe cool thing was there was a very friendly lady who works at Phil's BBQ giving out small samples of their AMAZING onion rings. So the free sample worked and we ordered a large order of onion rings (which was way more than enough) for $5.95. ÊIt's delicious!! ÊIt's definitely a heavy batter on the rings, and oily, and probably really bad for you. ÊBut it's sooo good! ÊAwesome crunch to their onion rings. BBQ wise - definitely get the baby back ribs!!! ÊThere was actually a lot of meat on the bone and it was so tender and almost fall of the bone! ÊI got my sauce on the side but hubby said he liked it with the sauce on the meat. ÊYou can actually choose to have your sauce on your BBQ or on the side. ÊHubby and friend liked the beef ribs more than the baby back ribs but my friend and I liked the baby back more than the beef ribs. ÊThe beef ribs were cut in a different way, in that you get more meat on one side of the bone, if that makes any sense. ÊIt looked smaller than the beef ribs we get at Wood Ranch BBQ but hubby said they are the same size, they just cut it differently, so that one person can get a lot of meat. Their menu is pretty simple. ÊBBQ baby back ribs, beef ribs, chicken, combo - ribs and chicken, and sandwiches - like pulled pork sandwiches. ÊTheir combos come with 2 small sides (like fries, baked beans, macaroni salad, etc.) or 1 large side (things like steamed veggies or corn, etc.). Ê Price wise it's about an average of $12.95 + up. After you order, you can sit down and find a table. ÊDon't sit next to the window if you don't want strangers looking at your BBQ. ;) ÊWhich we were guilty of doing. Êhaha. Cool things about this place: ÊYou can also get bibs for those who tend to be really messy with BBQ. ÊAnd they have a sink station in the back so you can wash your hands after all that messiness. Hubby is from Texas so he knows good BBQ. ÊHe said Phil's is probably his favorite (outside of Texas). ÊEven more so than Lucille's! ÊAlthough, Lucille's has better sides (like their apple butter biscuits, mac and cheese, etc.) and BBQ chicken. ÊHubby said his BBQ chicken from Phil's was a little too dry. BBQ comparisons: Meat tenderness: ÊPhil's BBQ Sides: ÊLucille's Meat selection: ÊLucille's Price: ÊPhil's BBQ Sauce: Êboth pretty good If you're in the SD area, definitely a must try at least once!

Between two people, we got a full baby back rib dinner (which comes with 2 small sides -- we got fries and the potato salad) and a 1/4 dark meat chicken. A full dinner is about 10-12 ribs while a half dinner is 6-7. For what we got, we weren't that stuffed. I got a Stella, and for a small little girl, I wasn't full to the brim. For the portion size, the pricing is pretty good. I wouldn't recommend the potato salad, although I've never been a fan of potato salad. Overall, the ribs were pretty tasty, but nothing memorable. I stand by Lucille's BBQ and their apple butter.

That's right 1 star. Why, mainly it's my fault, I don't like spicy food and Phils BBQ sauce is fire. The meat is good and the flavor of the sauce is good too but in about 20 seconds you'll be able to blow fire like a dragon! Secondly, I think anyone willing to stand in the 5 person deep, 200 foot line to eat is crazy, it's just not worth that kind of wait in my opinion. I realize that those who make up that massive spectical of a line everyday most definitely disagree with my review. I prefer Famous Dave's on the sole bases of a 6 sauce selection. ÊFellow super tasters beware.

OK, I know people love this place, and I have to admit there are really good things here. But overall, I think it's a little overhyped. I've come here a bunch of times when I was basically living in SD and the food is consistent, but not consistently amazing which it's supposed to be! Things I've tried: Chickless: Basically the chicken without any bones. Maybe because it's off the bones, that it becomes dry, but really? THAT SHOULDN'T HAPPEN! Flavor wise, it's good because of the sauce, but it's super dry and just alright. Ribless: (do you sense a pattern here? I don't like dealing with bones...heh heh) the ribs just off the bones. This unlike the chickless was still juicy, just not as juicy as the regular ribs. Flavor wise, it's good and tender, but nothing special. I do appreciate them taking the ribs off the bones for me. Pork Ribs: These are really good. They're super good and tender. One of the best to be honest, but not enough to redeem the chicken. Beef Ribs: THESE THINGS ARE HUGE!! I still like the pork ribs better, but these things are ginormous! Still full of flavor and definitely for those of you who are super hungry. Sides: They're alright. Nothing really special. Overall, I don't know if the lines are worth the food that you get. I mean I've waited a near an 1.5 hours a couple of times...I will not deny though that the ribs are delicious...maybe take them to go....

Best barbecue I have had, ever, in my entire life. I am so lucky to be a San Diego-ite. If you live in San Diego and haven't heard of Phil's BBQ, you are either a vegetarian, or living in a cave at Cowles Mountain. This place is meat-centric, so don't take your vegan, vegetarian, raw food diet, or neo-hippie health nut friends here. This place is one of those places where you go to eat MEAT, like a neanderthal, off the bone, dripping with sauce messy, and filled with char-grilled satisfaction. If you are on a date with someone who is fancy and/or shmancy, dressed up, wearing nice clothing, going to a club afterward, or aren't going to be near some exfoliating hand soap later, you might want to check something else out for the evening. You are going to get messy, and your companion should be on board with that. Also, just my own advice: if they aren't, then you should find a new companion anyway. So, from my own experience... the beef ribs are a must. They are fall-off-the-bone tender and taste so delicious they would make a modern-day Siddhartha give up his quest just to mack down on some ribs. Eating these ribs has given me my own definition of nirvana... a full rack makes an excellent meal in itself. The pulled pork sandwich is awesome, the brisket sandwich is awesome... The Pork ribs are fall off the bone and delicious, and the chicken is... well, the chicken is the only thing that isn't really EXCELLENT, but it is really good. Dip it in some extra BBQ sauce on the side followed by some ranch and you will have an excellent time. Basically, the entrees themselves are amazing, and you can't go wrong... but I would say avoid the chicken by itself if you want to have a well-rounded meal. If you want chicken, get the half and half (half chicken half pork rack or half chicken and 2 beef bones) so that you can get the best of both worlds. So, there's always a caveat even with a 5 star rating... and in this case it is the sides, which aren't all that awesome. However, the sides are basically just empty vessels in which to transport more barbecue sauce or their awesome ranch dressing into your mouth. I usually avoid them, because the protein here is what's really on display... If you want a nice side with a little carbs, add an order of onion rings and ranch and you will be happier than wasting your time with their corn or fries. Or just fill up on meat! You wont be disappointed. And then there's the location, which is by far fine... there is plenty of room inside, they have an event center for large parties... but the only glaring issue I have with Phil's is the line. Call me a hipster, but I used to like Phil's before it was everyone's go-to spot and the line was only ever 30 minutes long at the most. Now, everyone and their mother loves Phil's, so getting in can take up to a 2 hour wait in a line that wraps around the building during peak hours... which isn't very conducive to hunger abatement. In fact, standing in line for 2 hours while waiting to eat, smelling the freshly fired meat wafting around, could be enough to go on a hunger-induced rampage. However, there are several ways to avoid this line. I will let you in on a few age-old secrets that work for me every time. Firstly, why eat there? go get it to go, and take it home. You avoid the seating line and go straight to the front, they fire the food as soon as you get there so it is still piping hot, throw it under a blanket or in a heat bag you stole from your last shift at Domino's Pizza and you have the same experience at home where you can eat like a fatass and then take a nice long guilty shower afterward to reminisce upon your poor eating decisions and exfoliate the barbecue sauce that somehow seeped into your pores. Secondly if you must eat there, just come during non-peak hours (make your dinner plans for 5pm or 8pm, and your line will be significantly shorter.) Last, but not least... and this is key... find a friend with a birthday and have them sign up for the Phil's newsletter to get a front of the line pass for the week of their birthday! If you have multiple friends who like Phil's and a birthday to celebrate in every month, you can skip the line once a month! I cannot tell you how satisfying it is to walk past hundreds of hungry people in line waving your front of the line pass and whispering under your breath "look at these suckers waiting in line, muahahaha." Yes, this could be the reason to stay in touch with that awkward kid from high school with the only birthday you know of in September ;) Anyway, lines aside, the food is worth the wait, and while the prices are a bit high, but the food quality makes it more than worth the price as well. The sides are overpriced, but just skip them... There's always room for more meat!

Let me just say there is a 2 hour wait line for a reason!!! The food is amazing! It doesn't really matter what day or time you come in, you will be waiting in line, but it is well worth it!

I'm probably like a tear drop in an ocean of compliments for this place, so I'll keep this short. Dress Code: dress comfortably because this food will lay you out. The good: Erry'thang. More specifically, the baby back ribs and a bunch of corn. Can you make this at home? YES. Will you? NO. Let the pros slow cook that meat to juicy tenderness for your lazy southern comfort food loving butt. Trying to eat light, get the pulled pork sandwich. Its the baby back ribs minus the bones. I don't think I'll order that because I like to get my hands dirty. The bad: Êpopularity precipitates lengthy lines. I'm really digging deep to find something bad to say. r/sm

5 stars because my boyfriend loved it and said, "It tasted like sweet baby jesus gave birth in my mouth!" whatever that means...but he really really liked it. Took him here on a date and I myself am not a meat eater so I thought it was just ok, ordered chicken breast and yes it was good but wasn't overly the top amazing. Boyfriend had baby back ribs and said it came right off the bone and was super soft. Said it was the best barbeque sauce he's ever had. I suggest getting the onion rings and sharing! If you're not a big eater try sharing a split plate with someone like half ribs/half chicken etc. I didn't see that on the menu and just ordered 1 plate for myself and couldn't finish. This place gets super packed so come early. I came both times right when they opened at about 11:30-11:40 and only had to wait about 10 minutes. After that the line goes around the building. So if you don't like waiting, come early. The wait staff is very friendly and helpful. You seat yourself so you don't really have a waiter but the people who go around always ask if you want any napkins or wet naps and if you need more sauce etc.

Whooooaa Nelly! *place EYES back into socket and pushes JAW back up* OMG, Black Friday in March?! Nope, just your typical line into Phil's BBQ. ÊYes, I can finally say I witnessed and fell victim to this legendary spot. Yelp Top 10 of 2011 in USA, btw. As if I'm going to wait, Ha. ÊSince the GF and I were starvin' like marvin', we opted for the Phone-In Take Out. HIGHLIGHTS + If you are not up to waiting, call it in! There's a separate line for that! Find a menu via onsite or online before placing order over phone. + Phone-In line: Moves pretty quick. ÊThey will holler at you when ready. ÊApprox 15-25 minutes total. + Dine-In line: wrapped around the building, cannot speak to this experience. FOOD + We ordered the "Best of Both" Baby Back Rib and Chicken Dinner: 4 bones and 1/4 Chicken. ÊMouthwatering, tender, fall off the bone pork. ÊJuicy, succulent chicken! *$12.95* + Sides: Macaroni Salad and French Fries: Probably some of the best mac salad I've ever eaten. ÊFries had a potato fresh taste to them! *included with the Best of Both combo* + BBQ Broham: Probably the best toasted buns on a pulled-pork I've ever devoured! ÊThe pork was tender and tasty, went well with the creamy Coleslaw! This sandwich was huge and will easily fill you up! *$6.95* Quality + Low Pricing = Worth it! Despite the wait.

Phil's has the BEST bbq around. Im sorry Lucille's, but Phil's just kicked your ass. I ordered the beefy rib and chick-less dinner, which comes with either 2 small sides or 1 large side. I got about 2 beefy ribs and 3 large chunks of chicken. For the price you pay (about $13) it's definitely worth it. For the side dishes I got the coleslaw and potato salad and was pleasantly satisfied with both. The coleslaw didn't have too much mayo or that buttermilk stuff. Lastly, the bbq sauce is freaking finger lickin' gooood. I licked my ribs clean. Also, I guess Phils is in the TOP 10 BBQ places in the USA! GO PHILS!

This place deserves all 5 stars!! Yesterday was my first time there and I have to say, this place is AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS and the service from ALL the staff was very very great, super attentive! I very much recommend this place for anyone who enjoys BBQ. The ribs are fall off the bone AND tasty, the tri tip sandwich just melts in your mouth, the potato salad is made w red potatoes (my fav) which gives it a way better taste, & the onion rings are A MUST have!! I will make sure to come back when I'm in San Diego, from LA. Folks, please don't be scared of the line, (like i was at first) I almost left as i looked for parking, it's huge but trust me it's worth the wait!!

Came back again recently. As always the bbq is quite enjoyable. I notice they do slather the pork ribs with quite a bit of sauce. I think the sauce really pulls their bbq together. We got a half rib pork dinner w/ two small sides for $13.95, 1 beverage (w/ refills) for $1.99, and an El Toro for $6.95. Then add on tax. While the El Toro (sandwich) was featured on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives, the meat was pretty chewy, veering on the touch side. It had the same bbq sauce all over it. Overall, I would stick with the pork ribs and sides.

Re: the El Toro- barbecue trip-tip sandwich. Granted the sandwich is awesome- however let's get one fact straight. I dispute the fact, as quoted again this morning in the UT, Phil did not invent Tri-Tip BBQ between bread. Anyone who's ever been to the California Central Coast- Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, Paso Robles, and the epicenter of it Santa Maria, knows that Tri-Tip barbecue has been going on since the early 1950's. On any given day you can find wood fired barbecues outside of restaurants and even grocery stores selling this classic sandwich. I was blown away when Adam Richman (who's research team should have checked out the fact) claimed that Phil was the first to think of putting tri-tip between bread. No matter how good it is, that's just not true! Just saying, Santa Maria style barbecue tri-tip sandwiches have been around since before Phil's BBQ was a charcoal gleam in his eye. Congratulations Kudos on winning best sandwich on west coast

I first have to say that I normally dislike bbq. And pork. That flew out the window at Phil's, because I ate so much delicious bbq pulled pork, I could barely stand! My friend and I shared the pulled pork sammich and the tri-tip sammich. I honestly can't say which was better - probably the combination of multiple meats and bbq sauce! We topped that off with onion rings and baked beans (go big or go home, right?) Both delicious. I think their ranch should also get a special shout out - oh hey girl, you tasted delicious on my onion ring. Wednesday night at 9:30 the place was packed, but from arrival to food was only about 15 minutes - so this is definitely a good time to go! I kind of wish I were going again today......

I just don't get the hype. ÊI think my problem with Phil's BBQ is that there isn't an option with the sauces they offer. ÊSo you either love it or you don't. ÊGeorge Carlin once mocked advertisements for convincing the public they can use the unnatural words "tangy" and "zesty" to describe foods stating that those are not real words and I agree with the man, God rest his soul. ÊBut for some reason those are the only two words I could come up with to describe Phil's sauce. ÊNow, given the meat has to be some of the most beautifully tenderized meat I've ever enjoyed off a rib bone, but the sauce just killed it for me. ÊNo denying the quality of their meat and preparation is top notch, but the sharp flavor of sweetness was the card to blame for toppling the house. Ê The same goes for the onion rings and fries. ÊThe quality of the food and the preparation can't get any better. ÊYou know you're biting into the best onion ring when the entire onion doesn't slither out of the batter from your first bite like a snake shedding its skin. ÊIt stays put with every bite. ÊBut where's the flavor? ÊWhere's the party? ÊIt's like the douchebag who shows up to the kegger without the keg. ÊYou're glad you found the spot but now the failure of one dude who's sole responsibility was to bring the party to life makes you settle for a single bottleneck waiting back at home after the long, head down drive. Ê Phil's substance quality is nonpareil. ÊI agree with the rest of top raters on that. ÊIf there were sauce options like spicy, smokey, tangy (oh wait, they got that covered) and so forth I imagine they would do that well as it does appear they do take tremendous pride in their production. ÊBut I still don't get the hype.

What can I say about Phil's Bbq but if I could give them more than 5 stars I would!!! ÊI have being going to Phil's since they 1st opened in Hillcrest years ago and had to wait hours in the small place. ÊAnd when they opened the bigger location, I was little scared there food quality was going to go down but they sure and thankfully dissapointed me. ÊIt got even better than the original and at 1st I thought how are they going to fill such a huge place compared to the original, and wow I was surprised!!! ÊService all I can say is that all restaurants should learn from Phil's bbq's service. ÊYou do have to wait sometimes up to an hor and a half, but Êthe moment you walk in into the restaurant, everybody smiles at you as if you were in Disneyland and once you sit down after ordering your food, you only wait about 15 minutes more before they have it ready for you. ÊAmazing system!!! ÊNow about the food, all I can say is that you have to go down there and just try it. ÊMy order for me and my girlfriend is always one single Beef Rib (which I believe everybody has to try) and a full dinner of the baby backs with fries and do not leave without getting there famous Onion Rings!!! ÊIf you do not feel like waiting on line, just do pick up at take it home 8-) ÊThank you Phil for never letting me down and knowing what Excellent Food and Service really is!!!

I am from the South and I grew up on some authentic bbq and I must say this spot is hands down the best bbq joint I ever been too. Before today it was a close call between Famous Dave's, Lucille's, & Texas Roadhouse. ÊAfter my first visit, I know have a #1 bbq joint. The long line and wait is the only down fall but it is totally worth the experience. Ê It even has an area in line where you can take photos and print them out from the store. ÊAlso, there is a little stand where you can buy beer and wine. Ê I had the best of both order with baby back ribs and chickless (white meat), and 1 small order of coleslaw and 1 small order of potato salad. ÊThe baby back ribs literally was my favorite. The meet was really juicy, fell right off the bone and the bbq sauce was Flavor Flaverful. Ê Since there are only 2 of this food chain, I highly recommend this place if you want REAL bbq for friendly service, great price, and big portions.

I'm going to keep this review short because I don't want you to waste anymore time trying to think about whether to go. Just go. Get the baby back ribs, half-rack, full-rack whatever you're feeling, just go. My personal favorite sides are the french fries and beans but i can say in full confidence, that anything that comes out of the kitchen here is bound to taste delicious. I'm pretty sure if they lathered that amazing bbq sauce on a dirty rag it would still taste good. Meat falls off the bone, sauce has the perfect touch of zesty sweetness, service is GREAT, nothing can ever go wrong here. Oh, except the wait. The time always varies but even if I have to wait over an hour, I will always make sure to get my Phil's BBQ fix whenever I'm in San Diego.

I love going to Phil's BBQ! This place is soooo good. Really great service, they employees all do their work well. The food is amazing and really reasonably priced. My favorite is the BBQ Broham. I get a side of the 'sweet baked beans' and get the coleslaw on the side. There is so much meat that I usually take the extra home and have it on some bread for lunch the next day. And for only 6.95 its such a great deal. I'm pretty sure everyone in SD has tasted this goodness. If you are visiting SD from out of town, make sure you come here for at least one meal! The line can get really long, but it's work the wait.

Been here a few times. TRICK TO BEAT LINES - Call it in from your cell phone in your car. It'll be ready for pickup in 10-15 minutes. That way you beat everyone who stood outside waiting. It worked for me... Meat wasn't that great to me... but then again, I frequent Texas BBQ often in the year, so I shouldn't compare Texas BBQ to San Diego BBQ... Phil's meat is what I expect San Diego BBQ to taste like... Their sauce and sides were good though. Didn't like potato salad too much because of the red potatoes used. I would suggest Jones Brothers off Logan and Euclid for better Meat. Get the meat their and come back and pick up the sides you phone called and ordered from Phil's

ZERO STARS!!! As far as the BBQ goes, it's good. Not great. Certainly not great enough to wait for over an hour in line! Really! Oh yeah, and before you say, "Dude, go somewhere else then!", you have to remember that this is one of only a couple of decent rib joints in San Diego proper. With that said, I'll sum up my review this way. Get a bigger joint or risk eventually losing all your customers to the perception that you have to wait an hour to eat. Believe me, my family and I can live without eating ribs!

Food-6/5 I never get sick of the food here and it always exceeds my expectations! ÊThe baby-back ribs & beef ribs are out of this world delicious! ÊThe meat just slides right off the bone, and they're covered w/ the most delicious BBQ sauce I've ever had. ÊYou can also taste the smokey-ness of the meats. ÊEating here makes me feel like Fred Flinstone when he eats those huge dinosaur meats at the drive-in lol. Grab an order of the onion rings too. ÊEasily the best onion rings I've ever had. ÊGrab a side of ranch w/ it too (hey, we both know you're not gonna eat healthy today). ÊFries here are standard but the ranch is really good here and compliments the fries. Ê They also have a delicious orange-wheat beer which isn't too heavy, and it really compliments the meal well. ÊThe pitcher is cheap too!! $15 for a pitcher. Service/Ambiance - 5/5. ÊService is great, the servers will restock on supplies & stuff when your eating. ÊI also really like the bathrooms/cleaning stations here. Tips: -Come here REALLY early or expect a long wait time; usually I show up at 4-5PM and we can just walk right in. ÊIf you show up during peak hours then you might have to wait a really long time (I'm super anal about my wait times so I try to help people out yelpers the best I can).

I love Phil's. I can't say enough about how great this place is. Whenever I am in the SD area I make sure to go here at least once or like my last trip, I made it there three times. The beef ribs are fantastic. I typically order either the tri tip sandwich and 2 beef ribs or the pulled pork and 2 beef ribs. I have tried the sides bit I am there for meat so forget the beans and replace them with ribs. The only thing I would like is a bit less sauce on the sandwiches. Its a must visit place in San Diego. Also I recommend calling in a to go order and just taking it down to the beach to eat, unless you like waiting in line.

I'm no BBQ snob. I don't know which BBQ spot in San Diego is the most authentic. ÊI don't know whether "proper" meat is smoked, sauced, rubbed, brined, or some combination thereof. Ê However, what I *do* know is that Phil's is delicious. Ê Actually, Phil's is HEAVEN. Ê Phil's beef ribs? ÊHEAVEN. Ê Phil's BBQ chicken? ÊHEAVEN. Ê Phil's baked beans? ÊHEAVEN. Phil's onion rings? ÊHEAVEN. Phil's cole slaw? ÊBliss. I also know that Phil's "tickler" lunches -- all under $7 each -- are the BEST lunch deal in San Diego. ÊThese platters are enough to feed two people and still have fries leftover for the next day. If you go to Phil's for a weekday lunch, there's no line either. ÊLeave the weekend crowds and hour-long waits for the suckers and tourists. It may no longer be cool to be addicted to Phil's, but I remain loyal. ÊRemember: the first step is *admitting* that you have a problem.

OMG I thought I new what good BBQ and ribs were until I came to eat here. I used to think Famous Dave's or Tony Romas made some good ribs, but now I will never go back to those places. I have had the baby backs and the beef ribs and both are 5 star excellent! I also love their potato salad and macaroni salad and if you are in the mood for onion rings they make some giant ones here. Pair that with a pint of Windansea local brewed beer and it makes for one dang good meal. I recommend this place to everyone I know Quick Tip: If you have a small party or group, you can usually find a place in the bar to sit and dont have to wait in line and can still order all of the same items.

Reason I'm giving Phil's only 3 stars is due to how sad their side order portions are. Are you kidding me? I ordered full slab with what was supposed to include a large side and what I got was 2 individual sides. I think these folks have made so much money and have so many fans that they pay no attention to anything ele but the ribs. My advice? Order the ribs and skip the sides!

Yes, Phil's is San Diego's most popular BBQ joint. It's simply amazing. The Point Loma location has lines out the door and wrapped around the corner with wait times around 45 minutes. Thankfully, their second location has opened in San Marcos and I don't have to drive the 30 minutes that I used to for some Phil's. I love the baby-back ribs here, when something is this good, you can't help but get it time after time again. The full rib dinner is good to split between two, at least for my standards, but I honestly don't eat that much. The BBQ sauce has the perfect amount of smoky tang. Out of all the sides, the mac salad is my favorite. The service is quick and friendly. You should leave there with no complaints and fully satisfied.

I've been dying to try this place, and it did not disappoint! I came with a big group of friends after we had all gone to the San Diego zoo together. The line was pretty long, and my boyfriend tried to get us to go somewhere else once he saw that line. Thank goodness no one wanted to listen to him! The line wrapped around the restaurant but it actually went by pretty quickly. They have a camera out there to take a picture of your group while you wait to kill more time. And once you get in to order, the food comes out super quick. I think my food was ready like 3 minutes after I got my beeper ?! The boyfriend got the baby back ribs dinner while I got the beefy ribs dinner, so we could try both. Personally, I liked the baby back ribs better. All of my friends swore on the baby back ribs. I should've listened. They were exactly what I imagined for mouthwatering, delicious, and tender ribs. The beefy ribs were still good and tender cooked in the same sauce but it was chewier and those things were big! I like eating ribs with my hands and boy you can't eat these with your hands! Unless you wanna look like a caveman... I didn't even finish one whole beefy rib! We had massive leftovers. For sides, I got the baked beans and macaroni salad and the boyfriend got cole slaw and potato salad. I especially loved the cole slaw. It was so light but crunchy. My fork kept moving towards the boyfriend's plate the whole time we were there. The potato salad was also really good and had big chunks of potato but wasn't too heavy. Macaroni salad was good as always. The baked beans were nothing super amazing but still good, your typical baked beans if you've ever tried from anywhere else. But the best thing was probably the onion rings! They were gigantic but SO SO good. You must definitely order these if you ever come. Perfect amount of crispy batter! Definitely the only place I would wait in a crazy line for. The food is that good and service is great too. Everyone who works there is super friendly and attentive to your needs! And you'll have enough leftovers for another feast the next day. Make sure to ask for extra BBQ sauce!

COUSIN'S BACHELOR WEEKEND: PART I - PHIL'S BBQ On Cinco de Mayo weekend I went to San Diego for my cousin's bachelor party. I wouldn't normally write eatery reviews on Yelp but since we were coming from the San Francisco Bay Area and the amount of money we plan to spend in San Diego I felt it was important to put my two cents in. This was the first eatery stop. It was on a Friday. We originally were supposed to have dinner here but at the last minute decided to have lunch here instead. Before I decided to place an order for myself my cousin decided to place an order for the whole group. He ordered two full baby back rib dinners. The two sides were fries and coleslaw. The ribs were moist and tasty and the two sides were pretty good (personally I'm not a sides type of guy as I would rather focus on the main item in this case the ribs). However one of our friends ordered the beef ribs. And it's rare to find a place that not only serves pork baby back ribs but also beef ribs. As they were eating their beef ribs and stating how those ribs were really good I was about to go back in line to order the beef ribs for myself. Not only was the line long (the start of the line was outside) but I was already full from the baby back ribs and the two sides. Looking back I wish I ordered the beef ribs. My ratings are based on what I ate. Had I ordered the beef ribs my ratings would at least be one star higher. That's too bad because I don't know when I will head back to San Diego.

Even better then everyone says it is. ÊThe ribs here were more tender and flavorful then anything i've had, and my family's from Texas! Ê We came here after the Holiday Bowl at the Q after my Cal team lost to the hated Texas Longhorns. ÊI wanted sympathy ribs, and they sure turned my night around. You know a place is good when all around you are happy Texans, especially since bbq is all they really have going on over there. ÊI brought some pulled pork sandwiches back for my friends. ÊInstant hero. I can tell that this place queues up pretty fast, judging from the Disneyland style line set ups they have going on, but if the meat is this good all the time, I can't think of anything better to get rid of the bitter taste of defeat.

Whoaaa there...What's the big deal? When I first moved to SD, everyone I knew was like, "OMIGAHH, have you been to PHIL'S? OHMIGAHH you HAVE to go! OHMIGAHH it's SO GOOD!". OHMIGAH, OK, let me help you put your eyes back into your head. Lord, Jesus. I wasn't happy to hear about the long wait, but my friends kept telling me, "It's going to be worth it.". Ok, it better be. Lucky for them (and me), I didn't have to wait in the line, since we found a place in the bar area. First come, first served. Ta-dow, how you like me now? The 3 of us seated ourselves along the countertops facing the window to the outdoor seating area. Pretty soon, a friendly, personable server came by to take our drink orders. We ordered 3 beers and they were brought back to us promptly. Now it was Êtime to order our food. I ordered what was called "The Best of Both", which included Baby Back Ribs and BBQ'd Chicken and choice of 2 small sides or 1 large side. I went with Baked Beans and Potato Salad. The plate was reasonably priced at about $12. *DRINK*TALK*DRINK* Then before we knew it... FOODS HEA! OHMIGAHH IS IT GUUUD OR WHATT? Yeah, it was good. But *#$Tf*#y@*(^#$ GOOD? No. Not even. Now, don't get me wrong, I love me some BBQ ribs. I truly do. But I am confused. What's with all the OHMIGAHHs? Friends, please help me understand.

Phil's BBQ is the best place to get ribs in San Diego! The pork ribs are extremely tender and pretty much fall off the bone. ÊThe sides that come with the dinners are pretty much standard. ÊThey also serve massive, crispy onion rings with actual cooked onions inside but you have to order them separately. ÊThe main focus, however, has got to be the beefy ribs. ÊThese behemoth ribs are cooked to perfection (don't worry if you have bad teeth) and are in hefty proportions. ÊWith the sauce that they slather on top, these ribs are truly a sight and taste unparalleled by any other bbq place in the area. ÊAlso, if ribs are a little pricey for you, they have alternatives like the pulled pork sandwiches that are just as delicious but a little more affordable. The only downside to Phils is the long wait. ÊI've been there several times and each time I had to wait around an hour (even at 3:00 p.m.) to sit down but the wait is well worth it!!! ÊIf you don't like to wait, there is a line for phone-orders (to-go) which is much shorter. ÊBut if this is your first time at Phil's, I would recommend standing in line to enjoy the buzzing atmosphere of the restaurant as the service is extremely friendly and attentive from providing paper towels, extra bbq sauce, to even a friendly joke or two. Ê It really is an amazing restaurant and is definitely a MUST GO if you are visiting San Diego!

Went there at 3 PM on a Sunday afternoon and suprised to see the line went around the corner at such an odd time - apparently they're giving away free food, althoug our local friend said that the line was usually that long during lunch or dinner hours. She told us to order to-go instead and voila - the line is very short compared to the dine-in line. Ordered the beef ribs and onion rings - the ribs were huge, well seasoned while the sauce compliment the seasoning. Onion rings were also big and went very well with the ranch sauce provided.

Wow. Hands down the best bbq I have ever had. What made this experience even more interesting was that we went on a Friday night and the wait was barely 15 minutes!!! We were stunned, but once we got inside it was still packed. My friend ( a girl) and I split the ~20 full dinner. We got the babyback ribs along with 2 macaroni salads. At first I was iffy on sharing the food, but we could not even finish it! My other friend got the beef ribs (which I got to try and it was better than the babyback ribs) and he can usually eat a lot but he could not finish it either. The must get are the tempura'd onion rings. The best onion rings I have ever tasted!

Jeez this place has a lot of reviews. And yes, I sheeped my way there on my last SD adventure with K and we bought it take out to take back home to eat. We went around 3:00 and there was no wait. It was also a Tuesday so.... However, I have to admit, however weird it was to have signs telling you the wait time, a line of cashiers with the organization of a Disney themepark ride, bbq that can still taste fabulous and fall off the bone amazing after a two hour drive home is really good bbq. I was surprised at how small the menu is: basically chicken, baby back ribs and beef ribs but man, they make up variety with concentrated quality. Finger freakin' lickin' good. We spent $45 getting all three kinds of meat and they were all worth it. I can't wait to come back- but I'm still scared of how long my in dining experience may take. Those signs are scary...

OHHHHH EMMMMM GEEEE! I've known about Phil's BBQ for quite some time - thanks to Yelp, but was always turned off by how long the lines were... Plus, I didn't think it could be THAT amazing since I've had authentic bbq in the real 'South' before... not just South CA. I decided to give this place a shot after re-reading the reviews about a to go line... and just so I could say I've tried it before. Boy oh boy, am I glad I did! We went on a Sunday afternoon and saw that the line wrapped around the building. They even had markers like at amusement parks stating how long the wait time is at a given spot in line. The to go line is on the left side and only had 1 party ahead of us. We were in and out with our food in less than 10 minutes and decided to enjoy it at a nearby park. The ribs were cooked to perfection and easily fell off the bone. Although half a rack of ribs and 2 sides is enough for 2 people to share... in retrospect, I regret not getting my own meal! All in all, a MUST TRY to anywhere remotely close to the area!

As usual the line was long, but only waited for 20-25 min. ÊI had ordered the Quarter rib dinner with small Mac and beans. Jessica at the counter was very helpful and I loved her enthusiasm . Asked me if it was my first time and she explained briefly in how it worked at phils, which I Êreally appreciated. A real Êhometown country ranch and warm setting. There is a separate bar area conplete with bar tables. My friends and I Êactually sat outside, which was great because there were heaters as well. A breezy day when we went. The food was..... and you all are going to bust me for this.... it was okay. The BBQ sauce was a little too sweet. Meat perfectly cooked, juicy and tender. But with all that being said.... it was still okay. I had a difficult time thinking about how to critique this place because there is so much hype about the food. I really truly was honest and open to Phil's with high expectations, but it wasn't enough to take make me go crazy for this place. Apologies to SD, but this place is only a 3 star for me. I really have had tastier BBQ. If anything, when I do come back which I know I will in the future, I will revisit my review and it possibly maybe different.

Phil's is the most over-hyped place in San Diego. ÊThe food is ok, but it's not great. ÊPrices are low. ÊAnd it's always really, really busy. Ê Their sauce is way too sweet and has too much liquid smoke. ÊThe pulled pork is decent but a bit too dry. ÊBeef ribs are pretty good.

There's kind of no point in writing a review for somewhere like Phils. But I guess here goes just because it's the San Diegan thing to do. Phils is delicious. Expect a long line out the door and around the restaurant. Expect there to be no parking. And expect the food to be finger licking good. I recommend the baby back ribs with macaroni salad and french fries. But.. honestly I think you can get anything here and it would be satisfying.

So i drove from fullerton to san diego (1.5 hour drive) to try this place. Got there around 5 and waited in like for about 30 mins. My girlfriend ordered the chicken and ribs and i got the one with white meat and ribs. The sign outside said it would take about 15 mins but my order came out 5 mins after i ordered it. It was strange but as soon as i took a bite of my white meat chicken, the unthinkable happened....it was DRY!!!! unbelievable... The ribs and the sides were alright. would've tasted better if it weren't for my damn dry Êchicken. I would come here again if im around san diego area

Quick Tip: Call in. Get food to-go. Eat in your car, or preferably, right outside - to make the people waiting in line jealous. The pork ribs were disappointing and small. However, the BEEFY RIBS were gigantic and amazing. The sauce is deliciously tangy, especially with their natural cut fries. The Beefy Ribs are the size of my face, and you will seriously be stuffed after eating 2 ribs. SO GOOD! Next time, I'll have to save room for the whoopie pie.

I guess living in South Carolina has made me unable to fully appreciate this place. Wasn't worth the wait, in my opinion. Fries were stale, bbq sauce left something to be desired, the onion rings were just plain gross, and no self-respecting bbq establishment worth its salt leaves corn bread and mac and cheese off the menu. On a positive note, the baby back ribs were great and would've been over the top if the bbq sauce was better.

The. Best. Meal. Of our entire. USA. Trip. Very rarely am I compelled to wish for more than five stars, but I was completely overwhelmed by my instantaneous love for this place. And that's not even influenced by bias, as there's a huge sign outside shouting 'Thank You Yelpers!' Well, Yelp has helped make this place one of the Top 10 Restaurants in the whole of the USA, but it never needed our aid in this. Phil's RULES. My fianc and I were looking for things to do for the rest of our holiday around San Diego, Portland and Seattle. Yeah, we wanted to do cultural things, and yup, we wanted to be cool... but we also realised something. We're greedy gluttons and we facking well love food. So what did we do? We Wikipedia'd all the episodes of Man V Food to see where our dear friend Adam had headed in all of the cities we were visiting to eat ridiculous things. Right away we made a mental note to check out Voodoo Doughnuts in Portland, but there were nearer things to attend to. Phil's BBQ in San Diego. The tri-tip sandwich. We headed out to what kind of looked like an industrial estate - the area couldn't be further removed from Little Italy where we were staying or Gaslamp, as rather than nestled amongst little boutiques and indie restaurants, it's out there near Target, In N Out and a whole bunch of other chains. Considering where it is, the fact that it was stuffed to the gills on a weekday, early afternoon, was a sign and a half. And it knows its audience. A mat outside known as a Tweet Spot? A fun photo booth? The word barbecue painted all over the beams in many different languages, dialects and slangs? Gosh, this place is fun. The ordering system is spot on too. You're greeted by a friendly host who talks you through what to do. Go up to the counter where uniformed experts are hard at work, place your food order, take your cups for soft drinks and find yourself a seat. Anywhere you like. You'll be given a pager and you'll squeal with excitement when it beeps, because this is food worth waiting for. The tri-tip sandwich on a keiser roll is an all-round winner. The bread is soft with a delicately crisp outer crust, the BBQ sauce is everything it promises to be and more... sweet, tangy, rich and deep, and the meat. Oh, the meat. Soft as butter, tender and yielding, and quite simply some of the best beef I've ever had. We shared this alongside what we thought would be a little taster dish - the chicken tickler, which actually came with four generously portioned hunks of juicy chicken, marinated and barbecued to perfection with more of that superb sauce, perfect fries and colossal onion rings that live up to the name. I made my onion rings last the whole meal, they were that good. Even the coleslaw is worth shouting about! I know I'm filling this whole review with hyperbole, but I genuinely think Phil's is worth Êgoing back to San Diego for. Last night I watched a documentary about a sushi genius where I learned that three Michelin stars are awarded to a place you think it's worth visiting a country for. Well, perhaps Michelin is a wee bit posh for a BBQ joint, but I'd give Phil's the award. Utterly epic.

So everyone keeps telling me that I did not order correctly here. Apparently getting bbq chicken at a bbq restaurant is wrong wrong wrong. I wanted chicken, so sue me! Yeah my bbq chicken was not the best. The sauce was great. Very sweet and tangy. The skin was nice and crispy. The dark meat was moist, but the white meat was dry. Half my dish was great, and half was not. I had one of my friends pork ribs and it was fantastic! The meat was soft and just fell off the bone. Afterwards I wanted to return my chicken and get the ribs. They were just that good. I definitely made a mistake. I am not gonna get the chicken here again. If I get to come back I will know better next time. Note: If you come right when they open, which is the perfect time for lunch, you can avoid the long lines.

For me Phil's is one of those places where I can only go when I'm craving ribs, but when I am actually craving them... words cannot explain how delicious the ribs are. I always order the baby back rib dinner with macaroni salad and fries. SO GOOD. I've tried their chicken tickler once too but honestly I would just stick with the ribs because that's what they're famous for. Also, something that might be good to note is that if you come in a party of two, skip the line and just head to the left side where there's a bar and try to find seating cuz sometimes the wait can be really long. A must come if you've never been!

I love the atmosphere here, and Phil's is definitely the best BBQ in San Diego, but I really do think the food is overrated. I've been here a million times. I've had take-out. I've been to birthday parties. Heck, my friends have even rented out the side room! But every time I eat here, I just think to myself that it's so not worth the hype... it's not bad, it's just not worth the hype (nor the 2-hour long, wait in the rain Disneyland-esque lines!!). The baby back ribs are aiight. The meat isn't especially tender and though it falls off the bone, it always seems a little bit dry. As for the sides, other than the potato salad, nothing has been too memorable. I will say that the chicken is pretty dang good though! Juicy and flavorful-- just wish I had discovered it sooner! What is outstanding is the service! The staff is so wonderful and friendly and I fondly remember one of the servers planting a juicy wet kiss on my friend for his birthday... twice! In the end, the food is not bad, and I have many good memories attached to this place (watching Lakes games, pounding on the tables like savages, circling like vultures looking for a table, countless celebrations, late-night post-finals binge fests), so 3 shiny stars for Phil's BBQ!

So good it'll make you wanna punch a puppy in the face!! This place is always packed during meal times because its that good. But don't get discouraged. The line may be around the corner but the line moves pretty quick and its worth it!!!! I've never had a bad experience here and to be honest I can't get enough of it. They might not have a huge selection, but everything they serve is on point! Things to try -tri tip sandwich -best of both worlds (BEEFY RIBS and CHICKLESS) -cole slaw -eat at the bar The ribs are second to none here. Not sure how they BBQ it but the meat falls off the bone like it had no business being there in the first place!!!! If you get the beefy ribs, the meat will literally slide right off if you pick it up from the bone. Its a nice simple menu with the "meat and potatoes" of any good BBQ menu. Its all seasoned and marinated perfectly and then its painted on with more of Phil's specialty bbq sauce. Its a very casual atmosphere and you go find any open table after you order (the staff is good about helping people find open seats). Paper towels at the table so you know its party! Their BBQ sauce is DELICIOUS so I dip whatever I can in them. Portions are heavy and hearty. I'm not a huge fan of cole slaw, but the one here is soooo good. It's not too drenched in the dressing or whatever. Chicken here is also very good because its not dry at all. There is also a bar in the back which is a fun place to eat. Bar is decent with the most popular beers on tap. Bartenders are real cool and you can eat at the bar too! Plenty of tvs everywhere so its a great place to watch a game and get your grub on! I can not rave about this place enough!!!! I am no longer in San Diego and miss this place like an old friend. Cannot wait to go back!!! (I don't usually use exclamation points, but when I do, its for Phil's!)

This place is crazy busy from opening to closing and after tasting the food, I see why! The line to be seated was all the way around the building at 4PM on a Thursday! The pulled pork sandwich was the best I've ever had. I don't like cole slaw, but even with it being on the sandwich, it didn't make me like it any less. The sauce is out of this world! I'm not a huge onion ring fan, but I was to I had to try Phil's. They were also the bomb! Generously beer battered and less greasy than most, they were the perfect compliment to the sandwich. We called in our order but it was still so busy that they gave us a pager and we waited 20 minutes because everything is made to order. The prices are ridiculously low too: $7 for the sandwich which had enough meat for 3 sandwiches! I live 2 hours away and visited while we were on vacation, but I would seriously consider driving down just for another meal at Phil's.

Been going to phils ever since it opened at the old location off of washington and this place is even more packed!... probably 10 times more crowded now! i still remember the days when we could call in our order then pop in and grab a seat after we paid. They soon caught on and were smart to expand into their existing location and their newer San Marcos location. Awesome baby back ribs, awesome boneless ribs, awesome pulled pork sandwich, awesome beef ribs, awesome bbq chicken, awesome baked beans, awesome corn on the cob, awesome tri tip sandwich, the most awesome onion rings! Even their French fries are pretty darn good all drenched in the leftover Phil's BBQ sauce.... Mmmmm makes my mouth water just writing all this. Did i mention this place is freaking awesome!

I've heard a LOT of good things about Phil's and when I was down in SD I KNEW I had to go! We got here a little before 12 noon on Friday and the wait was only about 7 min before we got to order. I've heard stories of people waiting 1.5 hours for this place and I was glad the line was short! The beefy ribs are so juicy! The chicken was also juicy and not dry like other places so that was awesome! The onion rings had a tasty batter! The dinner meals with either 2 small sides or 1 large side is the way to go at this place. My chicken dinner came on top of a large pile of french fries! Everything was slathered in yummy BBQ sauce! After you order you grab your own seats and the pager lights up when your food is ready. Then get ready for some messy grubbing! The only thing I have to mention is that the bathroom closest to the entrance on the left when you enter only has one stall, but there's a large sink outside if you just need to wash your hands. There are also additional restrooms on the other side of the building if somehow the person in the bathroom takes FOREVER...

My friend Katherine Y. and I met up with a couple of our college friends here for lunch on a Thursday at 1pm. There was hardly a line everyone talks about but we ordered and were seated within 10 minutes :) My friend and I split the order of half rack ribs with cole slaw and macaroni salad for sides. The ribs were really tender and the meat came off the bone easily. The sauce on the ribs was flavorful and the sides were really good, especially the macaroni salad. The waiters checked on us frequently and were very friendly. Now I can see why this place was voted for top ten best restaurants in the U.S. because of their delicious food, fast service and an overall great atmosphere :) I would come again to Phil's if there was pretty much no wait in line lol

You're not living life if you haven't tried Phil's. The beefy ribs here are massive! I'm usually full after 2 of those monsters. The half rack of baby back ribs is a lot easier to finish and just as much if not more fall-off-the-bone goodness. I've also had the pulled pork sandwich here (as seen on Man vs. Food) which can be a bit on the saucy or not-saucy-enough side depending on how you like it. Personally, I think the sauce can get a bit much sometimes, but hey, it's BBQ sauce. You could smother a tire with that stuff and I'd eat it. I will say one of the disappointments here are the sides. I find the coleslaw to be very bland. A bit more vinegar and sugar would really spruce that dish up. Likewise, the macaroni salad is also pretty dull. I don't know if their beans are made there, but they taste like baked beans you could get out of any can at your local grocery store. They're still good, just nothing out of this world. The onion rings on the other hand are a different story - HUGE and deep fried onion goodness in all its glory! Chances are there will be a line when you get there, but if you're a virgin to Phil's and love BBQ you have to try it. Ask any local for the best place for BBQ and they'll simply tell you "Phil's".

This place does not need another review to tell you how amazing it is but I'm going to give you one anyway. Phil's blows Lucille's bbq out of the water, and that my friends is an understatement! I made a clear mistake of showing up on a Saturday night, and the line was insane to say the least. ÊMy boyfriend left me standing in line to go wander around and discovered their bar area where seating was a free for all. ÊSo instead of standing in that ridiculous line, we stayed on the prowl for seating at the bar. ÊA friendly gentleman named Rey helped take our order while we were standing there so by the time we found seats, our food was ready. We ordered the half chicken, ribs, potato salad, macaroni salad, onion rings and baked beans. ÊThe meat was practically falling off the bone, the sweet and sourness of the bbq sauce was just right and not overwhelming. ÊThe potato/macaroni salad was creamy with big chunks of potatoes and incredibly flavorful. ÊI am not a big fan of beans but Phil's baked beans...my god, GAME CHANGER. ÊThe onion rings were crispy and stayed in tact when I bit into it. ÊI hate when I take a bite of an onion ring and the entire onion gets stripped out. ÊAll of this amazingness that made us both want to unbutton our jeans only cost $22! TWENTY TWO DOLLARS FOR BBQ SENT FROM HEAVEN FOR TWO!? Thats the cost of one meal at Lucille's. The service was impeccable. ÊEveryone was polite, drink refills were not a problem, and Rey went above and beyond. GIVE THIS MAN A RAISE!! ÊLots of parking, clean bathrooms, and full bar was also a plus! ÊSo worth the two hour drive!!

This has to be one of the best bbq places I have ever been to. Their ribs are amazing! They fall right off the bone and aren't fatty at all. The bbq sauce is also amazing. Lastly, I enjoy the onion rings! They are great dipped in ranch and bbq sauce. There is usually a big wait here so come early or come late to miss the lines!

Phil is the man I go to when I need a good porkin'. ÊTrust me, all girls need to get porked every now and again. The way his sauced up meat just slides down my throat is heaven. ÊI can tell by the he way he thrusts his meat all over my grill, this ain't his first rodeo. This is the place I come when I need a man to nourish me and fill my mouth and belly with his protein. ÊThis is always the place I come. Oh yea, and the BBQ is good too. ÊI like the baby back ribs and once in a long while I will crave the Broham sandwich. The sides could use some work.

This place is DAMN good! ÊKinda just stumbled upon it on our San Diego vacation. ÊWe didn't see the long line til after we parked the car. At first, we weren't sure if we were up for a wait, but the line moved surprisingly fast. ÊAs we got closer up, we noticed that there was a bar area. ÊWe were told that we could sit in there with the kids, as they don't serve hard alcohol..just beer and wine. So we got to go right in, cutting about ten minutes of our wait time. We ordered a large order of the onion rings and two of the large baby back rib dinners to split between the two adults and two kids. ÊIf I had to do it over, I would probably skip the onion rings cause they were a tiny too greasy for my taste, but, they were big and fried to perfection. The ribs were AMAZING. The coleslaw was pretty good. The atmosphere was fun! I would recommend this place in a heartbeat. ÊNo wonder it's voted one of the top restaurants on YELP. Go here!

Phil's, I love you. Really. I have eaten BBQ all over the US, tiny joints and big famous restaurants. I have my favorites but Phil's is perfect EVERY time. I haven't had a bad meal yet. I love the sauce. I love the sauce so much that I buy bottles and use it at home when I'm broke and need a Phil's fix (my meats are never as good but hey, I'm SUPER happy that they sell their bottled sauces and rub). The price is great too, I hate when places gauge you on their bottled sauces. The wait, yes, expect to wait a long time if you show up at like 6:30 on a Friday night. This is why I come on off days or a little earlier/later dinner. I've never waited longer than 45 minutes. The onion ring samples while waiting suck you in. They are delicious, crispy, good onion to batter ratio. Once you get in and up to the counter, order, and grab a seat, you get your food pretty fast. One time I was in, I ordered, grabbed a drink, and just as I sat down at the table the buzzer went off. awesome. I always get the baby back ribs. Tender, delicious, coated in sauce. Side of fries, coleslaw. The coleslaw is so tasty and crisp and a good palate cleanser when you're in sauce overload mode. The chicken is pretty good too, and I also like the corn on the cob. I already commented on the o rings, they're GREAT. If you're a light eater don't get a full size meal unless you like leftovers because you are guaranteed to have some. The portions are MORE than generous. You will make a mess and you will get sauce on you somewhere, so be sure to take advantage of the paper towels and hand sinks. Most of the staff is awesome, friendly and helpful. And try a whoopie pie. Most people forget, I grab one to go sometimes. Tasty!

Oh Phils! With so many glowing reviews is mine necessary? Probably not. The pulled pork was one of my personal favorites.Tender, lean, delicious. Served on a home made bun with coleslaw, well it is some serious lip smacking perfection! Ê There is a reason there is a line out the door here. But I took some of my trusted yelpers advice and i bypassed the line went in the side door straight to the bar, where conveniently there was seating and a Charger game on! Double score! I only wish they had a spicier sauce I like some heat with my meat! The bone on chicken Êwas better than the boneless. It was super tender and juicy with great smokey flavor. The tenders were on the overcooked side. I have to admit I am not a huge rib fan but I really enjoyed Phils. I did not care for the soupy beans. I like the peppery flavor but there were hardly any bean and a lot of sauce. The coleslaw was mediocre in my opinion. Overall Phils is the best barbecue I have had in awhile.

Hands down the best BBQ Rib place in California. They have full/half dinner sizes of ribs that come with two sides (cole slaw and fries for me) that are delicious as well. The Rib melts in your mouth and sauce is very flavorful and tangy sweet. Only bad thing is that the wait can get more than an hr but the food covers it. I sometimes go to San Diego from LA just to eat at this place. Solid 5 stars.

I think its sort of cheating that there's a sign that tells customers to contact the the "bbqrew" before you start yelping. ÊWe went with 5 people. We hot there at 12 on Saturday, just in time before it hot busy. We stood in line for about 10 minutes. Then went to order our food and searched for our own table. We Ordered 2 full baby back ribs, and 2 big beef ribs and one-fourth chicken. Sides we got baked beans, potato salad, macaroni salad,cole slaw, corn on the cob, and large onion rings. Baby backs were delicious. Fall off the bone, melts in your mouth. Bbq sauce is good not sweet more of a tIangy sauce they put. Beef rib was huge and delicious. Chicken was ok was a little too dry. ÊThe sides weren't impressive. Macaroni salad is well....macaroni salad.. baked beans kind of watery, potato salad had crisp red potato chunks, Cole slaw tasted like shredded cabbage not much flavor. Onion rings were awesome, nice batter and big juicy rings. Best I've ever had.. I give this place a 4 because didn't like having yo find our own seats.. we found a table and they told us we couldn't sit at the booth because it was for parties of 6 so we found a table outside. And sides weren't great.But if judging strictly on bbq it would be a 5.

These are the best ribs I have put in my mouth at a restaurant. The beefy ribs are the best and they are fall off the bone delicious. They are covered with a tangy sauce that adds a special flavor. The ribs are not the only good things they offer. I love getting their beer battered onion rings, which are huge. They also have amazing Macaroni Salad that everyone should try at one point. The only problem is that there might be a line especially on weekends so plan ahead by looking at the phil's cam on their website. Overall its great food and a great atmosphere.

I absolutely love this place. ÊIt has the BEST BBQ in San Diego, hands down! ÊThe ribs are absolutely amazing and I always have to order them. The is always a crazy line to get in at night but definitely worth the wait. ÊIf you want to skip the line, I recommend going in the afternoon. ÊAnd if you get there at night and the line is crazy long, just call your order in and jump right to the head of the line to pick it up and bring it home. If you place an order for pick-up, be sure to ask for extra BBQ sauce since they tend to skimp a bit on it for their to-go orders.

I love good barbecue and over the years I've seen restaurants come and go with most not leaving much of an impression on me or my taste buds. ÊAnd then I found Phil's BBQ! ÊAlthough I think I prefer their first location and it's homey atmosphere, I can live with the larger, more distant place they're in now. ÊGetting to Phil's takes a bit of time from where I am, but if you know how to get to the old Sports Arena you'll have no trouble finding this restaurant. ÊI've always dined during the lunch/late afternoon period, and it's always busy, so it might be wise to plan ahead if you're up against time constraints. ÊI've not ever waited more than 10 minutes for my food to be ready, but sometimes finding someplace to sit down and eat it is a bit of a challenge. ÊHowever, in addition to the very large sit-down dining area, Phil's has a moderately sized, full-service bar just inside and to the left of the front door, and this is where I choose to have my lunch on most occasions. ÊIt's got all of same 'accessories' as the main dining area, a I kind of enjoy sitting where I don't have to yell to be heard and don't have to constantly dodge other diners and they come and go. ÊHaving easy access to my favorite beer or cocktail only adds to the pleasant experience. Depending on what your idea of real barbecue is, Phil's may be on your list of favorites or at the very least, a great alternative to the usual burger routine. ÊThe food is freshly prepared to order, and the prices won't send you to the poor house. ÊThe same applies to the bar menu - drinks are reasonably priced, in my opinion.... especially considering Phil's location and it's proximity to the beach and sports complex. ÊLocals and tourists mingle quite nicely at Phil's, and I can certainly understand why. ÊI give this family-owned establishment two thumbs up and look forward to many more happy dining experiences.

Excellent BBQ and large portions! Got a half rib of baby back ribs ($11.25) and a small macaroni salad ($1.50) to share with one other person. Neither of us were starving, so this turned out to be a perfect amount of food. It would probably be enough for one hungry person to eat and have some leftovers, but the full baby back ribs would definitely be enough for two to share! The baby back ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender, sweet and wonderfully tangy. Great macaroni salad - but be forewarned, it's very peppery. The onion rings are HUGE! I don't even know how they manage to get that much batter on them, or where they find such big onions, for that matter. The fries were OK, but tasted much better with some creole salt and ketchup. Also tried a bite of the BBQ Broham sandwich, and while the meat was yummy, this was also VERY peppery. Lucky for me, I didn't have to wait in the hour-long line. Came with a group of 25 people and the staff at Phil's was soo friendly and accommodating. We were seated outside on the patio, and the server offered to grab us extra BBQ sauce and ranch. While I had a great experience and felt the food did live up to the hype, I don't think I would do the whole 2 hours in line thing for it either... Try to come here right when it opens!

Went for a late lunch on a Friday. People waiting in line out into the parking lot. Wow, must be great. Line moved reasonably quickly. Order at counter and wait for your food at a table. So far so good. Ordered caesar salad (below average but people aren't coming here for the salad), onion rings (really greasy and heavy and tasteless), half chicken dinner with macaroni and potato salad (chicken was dry, salads uninspiring), baby back rib plate with baked beans and coleslaw (ribs were exceptional, sides were dull and unremarkable). Not awful, but not worth waiting in line for for sure. I don't see what the fuss is about. Must be really lousy BBQ in San Diego if this is rated so high.

Yes. Baby back ribs done right. I'm not a ribs kinda girl, but when I crave it, I only crave Phil's. So from the 3,500+ reviews, you probably already know everything you want to know about Phil's. At 4.5 stars, there's not much else I can add. The meat falls off the bone and tastes as tender as you would assume it to be - it's smokey and piping hot. SO GOOD. The BBQ sauce doesn't overwhelm it either. Yummy! I'm also a fan of their macaroni salad... creamy, but not too much. Onion rings are good but too much to add on; I'd rather save my stomach space for the ribs. GOOD price for what you get! As for the line - it may be long, but it goes by quickly. Though, the second time I've ever tried Phil's, I discovered it's all about timing - there are short periods of time where Phil's has NO line (RIGHT between 11:30-12 ish)... just a tip. Phil's is a must-try. It IS as good as it gets.

Finally! Phil's BBQ. Everytime I was invited to go to SD and try this place, it never worked out. I finally tried this place for the first time over the weekend and it was some goooood stuff. It wasn't fun driving here since Cirque du Soleil was playing at the sports arena right down the street. It took forever to get through that traffic! Once we got there, we found parking and a seat at the bar immediately. No waiting! Isn't that amazing? I've heard about nothing but the wait and beef ribs in the past. Anyway, I started off with an Orange Wit which is basically a hoppier version of Blue Moon. Yum. $4.50 for a beer? I wish we could have stayed longer. The beef ribs are huge and delicious but a little too heavy for me. Joe and I shared a full beef rib dinner with baked beans and potato salad for the sides. The baked beans were too sweet with the sweetness of the bbq sauce but the potato salad was bomb. Oh yeah, and we ordered small onion rings. THE ONION RINGS ARE GOOD! I don't even like onions, but they were delicious. My girlfriend got the tritip sandwich which was also very delicious. I would totally get the sandwich for lunch. My experience was awesome because I didn't have to wait. Would I have waited over an hour to eat here? Mmm maybe, maybe not. Regardless, the food is great, service is excellent, and I recommend everyone else who doesn't mind a wait to try Phil's at least once.

If you've been in San Diego for more than a week and if you have a car, there is no excuse not to eat at Phil's. It really is the best bbq in the country (and I lived a year in Dallas so I can make that statement somewhat legitimately). This is the ONLY restaurant I will (gladly) wait in line for more than an hour.

I was contacted within 20 minutes by the management to address my previous negative review. My family and I were compensated for our poor service. I was hesitant to go back but my mom wanted Phil's for Mother's day, which was 3 months after my complaint. I was pleasantly surprised that they kept their word and treated us well. Special shout out to manager Jorge and busser Zach. Zach was not aware that we were special customers but he busted his butt waiting on us and all of the tables around him. In all of the years I have been coming to Phil's I have never seen a guy with that much hustle. Food was excellent as usual. That one bad experience was just a fluke.

TWO HOUR WAIT on a Saturday evening. Really?? The waiting sucked but I was entertained by my friends who couldn't stop talking. Haha! I love them. It made the TWO HOUR WAIT not so long. The smell of the smokey goodness in the air does not help hunger pains though. After the wait, we finally got to the front of the line and got two cans of coconut beer. MMMmmmm it was like I was make in Oahu sipping coconut beer in the only Irish bar in China Town. We ordered and went to our table to wait for our food. As soon as I picked up the food from the front counter I regretted ordering so much food. Well maybe not since I had the left overs the next day. I ordered 4 beef ribs with coleslaw and fries. Make sure you get extra bbq sauce to go with your BBQ. It's a must!! The beef ribs were so huge!! You can rip off the meat with Êyour fingers so easily... The meat is so tender and delicious. The coleslaw is good and the fries are good as well. Try dipping the fires in the bbq sauce its yummy!!! Overall the BBQ is very delicious but the TWO HOUR wait is not. It's up to you if you wanna wait that long for BBQ. Try it at least once!

Where should I begin on how bad the food was here. The one star was for the glass of wine I had that was good. Whenever you see places featured on food network or travel channel it can be hit or miss this was a miss. I cannot believe I waited 20 min for tasteless BBQ. I had the baby back and chickless combo with fries and coleslaw. The fries and slaw were nothing special. The chicken breast was dry and overlooked with no seasoning. The ribs tasted like they came out of an oven. Neither meat had any smokey BBQ flavor. The sauce reminded me of open pit out of a bottle. I would never come back here again. I have had better ribs at Applebees.

I'll list the review starting from the beginning to end. The parking is god awful, but I'll blame the Swap meet for that. Next, I waited 2 hours in line so I was anticipating Êsome good BBQ. The "greeter" said "Hi" to me and just looked away, so I was a little confused and just walked to the nearest cashier. I saw one table available and went for it though it had some of the dirty mess from the previous group that sat there. I just assumed someone forgot to clean it but I didn't care for it too much. What really annoyed me was that not once did the guy come to our table, he just ignored us all together. But I'll get to that later. My order of pork ribs came in and they were burnt to a crisp. At first I asked if I could get ribs that weren't to burnt, but was told from a friend that if I asked I could replace them. They replaced the ribs with more burnt ribs with no sauce, I was just confused. I asked the guy walking around providing napkins for people for some extra sauce as my ribs were a little dry (I had to go out of my way to get his attention by running up to him). I never got the bbq sauce, so I went up to the front to get some sauce. Not surprisingly the guy never brought the bbq sauce. I wasn't sure what he was getting paid for. In summary, after hearing how great this place is, what I experienced was poor service, dry/burnt food. ****EDIT**** Came here a 2nd time and had a completely different experience, the busser (Zach) was probably one the busiest workers I have ever seen. He made sure we had plates/forks even if I didn't ask for it and continued to check in once and a while.Right when I finished my food it was off my table instantly. The baby back ribs were delish, the meat falls right off the bone. This is the phil's bbq ive heard fondly of. I recommend it.

Definitely a must-eat restaurant if you're visiting the area! There's a reason why the line wraps around the restaurant even at 1pm on a weekday; their famous baby back ribs attract people from all over the area and keep people from san diego going back for more. after waiting in line for a while (we had to wait for about an hour one time when it was really busy,) you get to choose which dinner option you get to go with- personally, i adore the baby back ribs, and i enjoy the coleslaw and macaroni very much. Sure, it's a little expensive at around $20 per person, but your stomach will be fulfilled beyond its wildest dreams and your taste buds will thank you for the delicious meal. If you haven't been there already and you go to UCSD like me, you should definitely pay phil's a visit before you leave!

I was recently in San Diego for the National BBQ Association Conference and everyone was saying how good Phil's BBQ was. ÊI came on my own on the Friday night and the line was pretty long (that's a good sign). ÊI ordered the ribs and brisket and they were delicious! ÊVery tender and tasty! Ê The atmosphere here was great. ÊVery festive and friendly. ÊThere were a mix of families, college students, business people and what looked like guys night out. Parking was easy and food was delicious!

GET THE BABY BACK RIBS! This place lives up to all the hype! The baby back ribs are fall off the bone, finger lickin' good! The slaw and onion rings are my favorite sides. The wait is like waiting in line for Space Mountain at Disneyland in the middle of summer; long and boring but entirely worth it!! Just go here.

Yep, I'm going to do it...I'm going to jump on the bandwagon and give this place five stars. Ê:) The food is smoky and sweet and spicy and there's a LOT of it. ÊPeople are constantly checking on you to make sure you have enough sauce or ranch for your COLOSSAL onion rings or drinks and these people don't get tips. ÊThe customer service here is genuine and beyond anything I've experienced in YEARS, let alone in California. Yes, there's a wait. ÊWe waited two hours. ÊBut it was so completely worth it. ÊIf you don't want to wait that long go to the San Marcos location, but I'm glad we didn't leave. ÊAnd I miss good bbq. ÊI had the tri-tip, onion rings, and a sangria.

This place was a hit long before it was featured on Man Vs Food. ÊREALLY GOOD BBQ! ÊBeef ribs, baby back ribs, soft tender, smoky, and the sauce has just the right zing to it. Ê The lines are always really long, Around the corner long; so i've never eaten at the restaurant. ÊThe best thing to do is to call in a take out order. ÊWhen picking up your order, you should know there are 2 lines, one for eating in and another for pick up. ÊWhich line to stand in? ÊJust remember what Beyonce told you, "To the Left, To the Left!" If you insist on eating there, consider off hours, brunch, early dinner, check the website they have a web cam so you can judge the wait time (which for some reason PL location doesn't Êseem to load on my computer) also note that they are closed on Mondays. ÊYou can also find the sauce at Costco.

As a somewhat jaded but open minded LA\OC " Q " fan who talks food with other snootier foodies from wla and lower sfv it wasn't looking good for Phil's BBQ of San Diego folks. ÊObviously, you can see from my rating I drank the koolaid ! To really appreciate Phils you have to wait in the ridiculously long line where people talk to each other, veterans and newbies alike. They even have a Phils cam where you can email and print a logo'd photo of you in line (5.00 charge). You need to get your fingers covered with their tangy bbq sauce while eating a Beefy Beef Rib with your hands while you keep reaching for the paper towel roller. You have to keep refilling your drinks from the fountain and wash up at the hand washing station in the back. ÊThe bus service is also amazing if you need anything cleared or brought to your table. Love the condiments especially the cajun seasoning which I poured on everything. As crowded as it was the table spacing was so good I never never " felt " the other patrons. In short they are a bbq place that pays impeccable attention to details and guests needs, Phils is the Disneyland of BBQ. Another reviewer mentioned Lucille's and that fine establishment came to mind as well. The fun factor is just not there maybe its their higher pricing and upselling but just doesn't feel as downhome. Get the Beefy ribs or baby backs, cole slaw is excellent, chicken is good but we really weren't there for that. ÊFrench fries and corn on the cobb are also above average too. Prices are very reasonable !

I just had the best Beef BBQ Ribs I've ever had. ÊLet's be clear, I grew up in Houston Texas (Home of the Annual Texas BBQ Cook-off), and as much as it pains me to say that the best BBQ Ribs to be found are in California, that is the truth! As for the rest, all the food was really good, and the restaurant has a great feel to it. ÊThe only thing that made me think about giving Phil's a 4 star rating (as opposed to 5 stars) is that the line was ridiculous! ÊAfter about 10 minutes I had moved maybe 10 feet so I pulled out my cell phone and placed my order to go, and walked in to the "Orders To Go" counter. ÊIt only took a few minutes and I was out the door with my meal. ÊThe only other issue I had was that they didn't give me any to-go utensils, and since I'm staying at a hotel, that was a bit of an issue. So, bottom line, if you don't mind waiting in a long line, or if you are good with getting it to go, then go to Phil's and get the absolute best beef ribs you will ever have the pleasure to taste..!!!

Honestly think this place is A-OK. The meat is good but I'm not a big BBQ person, maybe that's why I don't believe it's worth the wait (Sunday around 1:00pm we waited 2 hours!!) However, the food is consistent and definitely more of a tourist-y spot than anything else. They're also opening a new location in San Marcos. I wonder what business will be like up there since they will be competing against Famous Dave's...

I usually don't have high standards for BBQ places. They all seem the same to me... decent food, but nothing that would really entice me back. That said, I would go back to Phil's. I normally don't care much for BBQ chicken (most places are too dry and overcooked). This one was amazing! Perfectly juicy and tender. I took one bite and wished that I had just gotten the chicken instead of the beef ribs too. Speaking of those, they were HUGE! The meat was tasty, a little tough for my liking. They also need to give you a better knife for those, the generic restaurant knife just wasn't working. I had a bite of the babe back ribs from my friend and they were very tasty too. I would have preferred those instead of the beef. You can get the sauce on the side, which I like so my food isn't overly doused with sauce. I got the steamed veggies as a side, those were disappointing... more like blanched veggies. You order from the register and grab a table, then go up and grab your food. That makes the service relatively fast. I didn't have a problem getting a table, but I could see how it would be difficult during rush meal hours. Overall, a fun place for a casual afternoon lunch.

I wrote this review after going to eat there. ÊThen I get a YELP email telling me the review was not within their guidelines and the review was dropped. Ê 1) I went there, waited in line. 2) I ate the food, couldn't believe the dreck they call food. ÊSALTY KRAP. 3) I came home wrote what I thought. ÊMy simple and sincere observations. So I will re-post the same review, because this is the honest truth! Ê What you read below us the orig post from early Jan. So ya like the place? Ask to see their BBQ. They won't show you because THEY DON'T HAVE ONE. Ribs in convection ovens and them flopped on a burger grill and burnt. Cover with "sauce" and..... True BBQ is described as meat, slow-cooked, using wood smoke to add flavor. There is equipment designed just for this type of cooking. Barbecuing is not grilling. Grilling is cooking over direct heat, usually a hot fire for a short time. Barbecuing is cooking by using indirect heat or low-level direct radiant heat at lower temperatures and longer cooking times. The distinction between barbecuing and grilling is the heat level and the intensity of the radiant heat. It is the smoke from the burning wood that gives barbecue its unique and delicious flavor. San Diego has so many wonderful restaurants, some even prepare BBQ. Sadly not this one. Don't waste the time waiting in line for food you can make better on your gas grill at home.

Meat lovers rejoice! ÊI am not a meat lover, but I do occasionally enjoy some ribs! Came here for dinner and the line was very, VERY long. ÊHowever, it actually moved pretty quickly. ÊThe three of us ordered half a chicken with steamed veggies, beef, and baby back ribs. ÊThe ribs were so delicious.. the meat fell cleanly off the bone and it was so juicy.. they were definitely the star of the night. ÊChicken was good too, but it wasn't completely far off from the usual roast chicken you can get at Costco (which I enjoy, occasionally).

3500 reviews and a four 1/2 star average and I'll admit I was thinking curiousity probably killed the cat, but whenever I see ratings like that I feel a strange compulsion to go and find out. Here the question was, is this place really that good, or is the Pink's of the San Diego culinary world? The answer is somewhere in between. First impressions weren't that promising, everything about this place screams middle of the road chain. It was disappointing there wasn't more charm or ambience. It's really not hard to decide what to try, practically every review clearly states baby back ribs, bbq chicken and onion rings. I'm intrigued that the reviews are so consistently high, not because the food isn't good but because this is actually not the most popular style of barbecue. Generally it seems most people prefer or expect the smoky style of Texas but this is closer to the sweet and mildly spicy Kansas City barbeque. On the positive side, I can see why this is so insanely popular. Like most good chains they've developed a memorable and tasty formula for their food that is likely quite addicting after a few meals here. The onion rings really stood out, they really are quite a delight. About as good a version as you're likely to find. The chicken was also a standout, moist and tender, it's really quite good. On the flip side, the sides were adequate at best. Corn on the cob was tasteless and mostly inedible, cole slaw was average. The baby back ribs were good, but certainly not even close to the best I've had. The masses obviously disagree but then I wouldn't wait in line for this or any other food, but I also woudn't have a tizzy if someone made me eat here again. It's not the greatest barbecue ever, sorry fans (although it could conceivably be the best in San Diego as there doesn't seem to be much competition), but it's pretty good all told. Four stars feels a little generous to me, but it's certainly better than a three so I'll round up. Best Plates: BBQ Chicken, Baby Back Ribs, Onion Rings Palate: Mainstream Food - B+ overall (bbq only A-) Ambience - B- Service - A Value - A

Process of my meal: Stand in line in excitement. Hear so much about the amazing ribs. Sit down finally with ribs in front of you. Bite into ribs.. Expect ribs to be the best ribs of your entire life. Let down...... I can honestly say that eating the baby back ribs was a big disappointment. I got the Baby Back Rib teaser and the best part of the meal was the onion rings! Those I still craveee to this day. Surely not as special as everyone assumes it to be. Go in with no expectations and low hopes. Maybe then you can leave satisfied.

Good god. SO GOOD! You won't get good bbq unless you come here. The line is long so make sure you come early or go online and see how long the line is. They have their own parking lot so not too bad. I usually order it to go since the line is shorter and the wait to eat this delicious bbq isn't that long. I recommend the baby back ribs and potato salad. But honestly, whatever meat you get, it doesn't matter cause the spices and sauces are just good. Would suggest each person ordering a bit and sharing cause it is a LOT of food.

This place sucks. This is my first time to Phil's BBQ, for sure it's my last time. I heard about it long time ago, and checked reviews on yelp. I was pretty anticipating. I have stopped by Phil's many Êtimes before, 2 times it was closed, other times there were too many people waiting. This time I persuaded my friends waited with my for an hour, just for the FAME. Thanks for my friend paid the dinner, now I'm really sorry for your money. The food; To be fair, meat is ok. Baby back ribs are pretty soft and juicy. But all meat were burned Êto black. All of us don't like the sauce flavor; it is just average, not worth waiting for an hour. Also, to us, the worst thing is all ribs are same flavor. Is there only one sauce? I don't wanna be mean, maybe just because I prefer Asian taste too much, it's hard to me to accept American flavor (But I do like Phil's neighbor a lot) . If you have same problem to eat Asian food, just ignore me.

well worth the wait. drove quite a way from the sd safari park just to eat here. luckily we were anticipating the line so came while we werent as hungry so by the time we got our food, we were ready to eat! the portions are ginormous which is great for sharing. shared a half rack of baby back ribs and 2 sides with a friend. also an order of large onion rings for the table. at the end, we were alll stuffed with leftovers! - baby back ribs - falling off the bone good and that bbq sauce they use is awesome. - french fries - easy side right? but something about the freshness of the potato just made it that much better... fries + meat = delish - mac salad - very light and a nice addition to a fried meal - onion rings - ginormous rings of oil goodness. while it wasn't totally oily, it did sit heavy after 3 rings or so - sangria - a bit too sweet for my taste esp with the flavorful and oily food.. should've opted for a soda or lemonade. i'd come again but the wait is a deterrent. perhaps i'll just go to the bar and order there.

Wow... the line wraps around the restaurant during dinner time. People weren't kidding about the line. But it moves fairly quickly. We started off at the back door but got to the counter to order in about 30 minutes of waiting. It was nice of the restaurant to send someone with a tray of hot onion rings for people waiting outside in the line. I got the tickler and the husband got the quarter rib dinner. The ribs were tender and moist, and the sauce was thick and tangy. I like tangy. The potato salad and cole slaw salads were good too. If the lines are too long for your liking, you may want to try the bar. You might have to hover behind people to nab a seat. We tried this for 2 minutes, but it got too stressful, so we decided to suck it up and wait in line, which wasn't all that bad.

I've been to Phil's quite a few times in my life and I always stick to ribs. ÊThey're fantastic. ÊBut this last visit changed my life forever.

Fell in love with BBQ and Ribs after coming here for the first time last year. The wait made me so anxious but it was worth every second. Once we got in, you order in the front, get your number and find a table to seat yourselves at. So it's kinda like a fast-food joint but no worries, take your time. You waited sooo long for it! Ordered the half baby back rib dinner order which was about $13.25 roughly. Now I wish we had gotten the full rib dinner for $18.95. Came with 2 sides and we got the potato salad and french fries. Along with that, we had ordered the El Toro sandwich that consisted of char-grilled deli sliced tri-trip topped with bbq sauce. And of course, a small order of the colossal onion rings. BABY BACK RIBS 5/5 - mouth-watering, tender, flavorful, juicy. basically an orgasm in your mouth, no joke. It's that yummy!! EL TORO 1/5 - The deli/sammich was so burnt and not tasty at all :( and not a big fan of tri-tip. I don't know why we even ordered it or even listened to the girl who recommended it. BLEH horrible taste she has! ONION RINGS 4/5 - HUGE! Realllllllllly oily/greasy. But yummy in my tummy. Couldn't finish it though :( All in all, a good experience, oh and they have bibs for you! Hehe. I needed one 'cause I'm a messy eater. Will I come back again? OF COURSE! I just need to find time to trek down there :( damnit, why must it be so far away! Someone recommend me a bbq place that is much closer to my home in the 626 area please! But I doubt there is one that lives up to Phil's expectations.

My friend and I shared a full rack of pork ribs dinner with a side of macaroni salad and a side of coleslaw. They were fall of the bone tender and so finger-licking good (yes, we ate with our hands!) I really like both the pork ribs and the beef ribs, but I'd say the pork ribs are something you can't eat too much of, where as the beef ribs you can keep eating and eating even past being full. Ê Onion rings were humongous and perfectly deep fried. OH, so worth the 1 hour and 40 minute wait. The sign lies though, we waited 35 minutes-ish past the 21 minute sign. o well.

Came here on a Saturday afternoon, around 1:30pm after a day of hiking nearby. Hungry as shit, I wanted to eat!! And then I saw the line... WTF IT WRAPS AROUND THE BUILDING?? But my buddies tell me that what I saw wasn't that bad. I had waited for an hour, and the nice lady by the cash register was telling us how later that night it would actually be close to a 2 hour wait. PHEW The set up and ish gets a 3.5 or so, but this rating isn't for that. BABY BACK RIBS. These 3 words say enough. My first time here, and I had high ass expectations because of all the reviews and the word of mouth. Boy, my expectations were met. Split a full rack with a friend, had some fries, onion rings, macaroni salad, and POTATO SALAD. Definitely well worth the wait. I could've chowed down some more, but I knew major food coma would arise from me, AGAIN AS USUAL. With that being said, I'm sure the previous couple thousands of reviews speak for themselves.

Let me start off by saying that I am not a big meat eater, much less an eater of meat that is still on the bone (weirds me out with all the fat and tendons stuck on it). Anyway, the line was longer than I had patience for, but how can thousands of people lead me astray? They're smart to have menus everywhere so the process is more expedited when you finally reach the register. I personally ordered the half rack of baby back ribs with macaroni salad and baked beans for my sides. The sauce is pretty good and I could taste the spices, but it was a bit too tangy for me. Sides were ok, beans were a little on the mushy side but well seasoned. Onion rings were well battered and fried. I tried a few bites of my boyfriend's beef rib and found that I liked it better than the baby back. We both stuffed ourselves silly from the sheer amount of food, but I have no desire to eat that much meat in one sitting ever again!

My first impression was, "The long lines are so expected that they have signs directing you to the entrance!" Your bang for the buck in San Diego. You want good quality meat, you got it. You want variety, you got it. You want flavorful, rich barbecue sauce, you got it. You want hearty sides, you got it. You want crispy hot onion rings, and original beans with your ribs, you got it. You want huge portions that will make you fall into a food-coma afterwards, you got it. All of it together at a family friendly style restaurant, and you'll be back to do it all over again. The lasting impression? "Short and simple, git your fingers dirty and leave happy."

First time finally trying the world famous Phil's BBQ. ÊAs always this place had a line going out the door towards the parking lot. ÊWhen there's that many people there you have to consider Phil's must be doing something right. ÊLuckily for me I came late and the party I met already was inside and had ordered me a plate. ÊAs I got in the place was packed. ÊI had a dish of what appeared to be 3 short ribs and a side of fries with coleslaw. ÊThe ribs themselves were tasty...not overly burnt but cooked right with some tangy bbq sauce. ÊThe fries had a smoky flavor to them too. ÊThe coleslaw is what you'd expect it to be.

I like it saucey! That's right! Pour all that sauce over those ribs, (chicken) breast and thighs. Yum and delish. And those onion rings- oh my word they are goooddd. Now I'm just salivating over eating some more of Phil's! You literally have to wait to get in this place. However, don't fret over that long line you see because it goes by quick. AND when I came here (on a Thursday night), they passed out free French fries that were mighty crispy and delicious while we waited. And yanno all that sauce I wrote about?

So while the service is great, there is one pattern I am curious about and want to share with you. So, I went to Phil's BBQ yesterday with my boyfriend and when you sit at the bar, a bartender will take your order, put it in, and hand you a buzzer. When the buzzer goes off, you, the customer, are expected to go get your own food. Well, yesterday, my boyfriend and I noticed that one of the bartenders brought the food to the couple next to us. Last time we had gone to Phil's, the same thing happened, but the couple was a little older. When we had asked the bartender why some people have their food brought to them while others didn't, he said, "it depends on how busy we are." Um.. okay, but they're usually just busy all the time. While we were sitting there and time passed, it's not like the busy-ness changed. There was a pattern that we both found peculiar. Either it was a mere coincidence or not, but both times the couples were Caucasian. I'm usually not one to think that people are using preferential treatment based on race, but in this situation, I can't help but think that it my be so. Like I said, though, it could just be a coincidence, so I'm not complaining here. In fact, I was thinking maybe they have an "upon request" policy or something, which would be great, and if that's the case, I want in on it. Either way, I'm curious to know what is going on here. Help me out and drop some wisdom, if you can.

DEFINITELY believe the hype for this place. This is as good as bbq gets in california. yes the wait Êtypically is 1-2 hours depending on what time you arrive but its so worth it. It was my first time here and when i saw the line, i was really considering going somewhere else. The long line is really intimidating...BUT because of a suggestion that it will be worth it, i decided to stay and ended up waiting a little over 2 hours. Heres what i tried: -Baby back ribs (yes. the meat really did fall off the bone!!) -onion rings (one of the best onion rings i've tried, but eating more than 2 or 3 can make you a little tired of them. i had a group of 4 and we ordered the large size and couldn't finish half of it! the portion is very big so be carefll) -macaroni salad (definately get this as a side. this was one of my favorites) -Fries (other favorite side) -potato salad (this was ok) -coleslaw ( i liked this as well) I heard from a person who works here that their tri tip sandwhich is also very good so i am going to try that next time i am here. overall, i found myself craving Phils the next day and even now.PLEASE open a location in the OC!!

Nothing compares to Phil's for BBQ, best BBQ west of the Mississippi. Period. I would have taken off a star due to the long wait, but it seems they are trying to fix that by opening another locationi in Santee. ÊPure BBQ awesomeness, enough said!

More like 3.5 stars. I went on Sunday but line was crazy so returned on memorial day for lunch. Still there was wait but it wasn't bad. We waited about 30 mins. (Compared to some reviewers wait time of 3 hrs... whole lot better) ÊOrdered full baby back rib dinner and onion rings. Proportionally... it was 75% side 25% main (ribs) Just way too much fries!! I think it should be opposite! Rib was really saucy but meat was juicy. I just wasn't that impressed with meal thus don't get what the rave is about. It's worth a visit but not worth waiting, especially if you were to wait more than 30 mins.

If you haven't been here then you are truly missing out of some amazing, juicy, heart-attack bringing, finger-licking good food. Phills is a great place to get a huge portion of food at a reasonable price. My favorite is the 5 bone beefy rib dinner. I normally share it with a friend since it comes with a large side. For $20 it's totally worth it. The staff here is sooooo nice. They are very quick to keep your table clean and are always making jokes with customers. I highly recommend coming here but keep in mind it is a lot of meat so if you want to stay alive for a few more years I would recommend only coming here twice a month

At this point in it's Yelp career, posting a review seems pretty frivolous. ÊWhat with nearly 4000 reviews and making Yelp's top 10 of 2011. ÊBut, whatever, I felt the need to post about the best BBQ place I have found to date. ÊThe food was absolutely delicious, however, with it's popularity, acquiring it can be a bit of a chore. I don't recommend trying to eat it there on location. ÊChances are you will be in a lengthy line for well over 30 minutes. ÊWhen you do finally get in, you will be subjected to a crowded arena filled with lots of noise. ÊCall ahead and you can walk right past the snaking line and straight up to the counter. ÊBeing BBQ, everything has been cooking for hours upon hours before the thought of BBQ had even crossed your mind, so getting your food even if you order take out right there is exceptionally fast. Phil's BBQ is absolutely delicious, and so are the sides. ÊAvoid the french fries though, but, nearly everything else was divine. ÊHands down the best BBQ restaurant I have come across. ÊClearly I'm not alone in this, but, I still highly recommend it. ÊJust order take out!

I used to love Phil's until the last two times my beef ribs were really, really dry. ÊIt seems their quality has went down over time. ÊAll I can say is the wait is not worth the dry beef ribs I received in the end. ÊTheir french fries are still good though? ÊThere are other BBQ options like Coop's Western Texas BBQ or Bull's Smokin' BBQ where you do not have to wait hours in line for an overly hyped establishment. ÊWorth the wait for BBQ you can get somewhere else? On your own discretion.

We use to like Phil's but lately, the services is way too slow and not worth it. There are other good restaurants in the area. On Friday we attempted to try it again. We stood under the porch for over an hour. We did not move a single step at one point for almost 1/2 an hour on Friday 4/13. It was too ridiculous and in no way worth the wait. They only had 3 registers open (we could see through the windows) so the line was literally at a stand still forever because one cashier was busy helping to go customers, which only left two cashiers to help everyone else. They had so many open tables. Literally, in the corner by the window there were three open tables together (2 booths and the table next to the booths) as well as other open tables all over the restaurant. It made no sense to have such slow service early evening on a Friday, other than to say, bad,bad service. When we arrived, we started out by the purchase photos camera on their porch and an hour later we had hardly moved. We finally made our way to the location where the photos come out and that is when everything just stopped and we stood there forever, until I finally said, this is ridiculous. Everyone in front of us was complaining and some wanted to leave but they had a group that could not make up their mind what to do. Ê We finally left after about an hour and 20 minutes to go enjoy a very delicious steak in PB, with no long line to deal with. I was so glad we left. Maybe move to a bigger location, open another location in a near by community or open more registers. I don't know what the solution is but what I do know is this place is not worth that kind of a long wait, especially when the line is short. Again, it had nothing to do with the line being long, it was way too slow, due to poor service. Sorry, your Êfood is not worth that long of a wait so you get one star from me.

Phil invited us back to try again. We went straight to the front of the line and were treated like royalty. Best experience we've had there. We've gone twice more since then. Both times were excellent experiences; though, the royalty treatment disappears when you're not under the spotlight, of course. :) I still call Phil's BBQ my favorite restaurant and recommend it to practically everyone I meet.

Wow, Phil's BBQ must be doing something right with over 3000+ reviews! I came here after my friend recommended it, and I'm so glad that I got to try Phil's BBQ. ÊWe were warned that it can get super busy with long lines, so we came at around 3pm for an early dinner. ÊThere was definitely no line for the cashier, but the place was definitely packed! After looking at the menu, I shared a full rack of ribs and fries. ÊWe had to pay and then look for a table. ÊThere was probably at least 60 tables inside, and most of them were filled with happy customers eating bbq food. ÊI was glad that we were able to find an empty table at 3pm. We had to wait about 15 minutes before our food buzzer went off. ÊThe full rack of baby back ribs was slathered in bbq sauce. ÊThere was a huge mound of crispy fries next to it. ÊThe baby back ribs was super moist and delicious. ÊI loved how the meat fell right off the bone. ÊThe fries were cooked perfectly, too. ÊIt was a bit crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I liked how Phil's bbq offers bibs for their customers. ÊI noticed a few people wearing them, too. ÊIts very convenient that they have sinks right outside the bathroom, so customers can wash their messy hands. Overall, I'd definitely come back to Phil's BBQ!

Top 10 restaurants in the USA? The best bbq in SD? The best bbq, ever? After hearing all these claims from friends, I had to try Phil's when I was in SD this weekend and I must say, they weren't kidding! We waited for about an hour in line, but this was to be expected and I was willing to wait if the food was as good as people say. ÊYou could even order a beer from the beer stand and cool yourself down while waiting in line. It feels like waiting in line for a ride in Disneyland; long, but worth it. My favorite are the beef ribs... so tender and juicy! ÊThe portions are huge! We ordered the dinner portion, which came with 5 ribs and either 2 small sides or 1 large. ÊWe also had the pork ribs, which was also very delicious! ÊAdd sides of macaroni salad and it's a filling meal! I tried the bbq chicken despite some suggestions saying that it can be passed, and sure enough, they were right. ÊYou could pass on the bbq chicken, as it was a little sour for my taste. ÊNot bad, but maybe it's because the ribs are so good, the chicken couldn't compare. Don't forget to grab your bibs before sitting down and getting your hands dirty.

Phil's BBQ is just too good. ÊI would never choose to go out to eat BBQ until I came here for the first time a few years ago. ÊThe wait is super long, but it is definitely worth it! ÊI usually order the baby back rib tickler which comes with a couple ribs, 2 onion rings, slaw, and fries. ÊThe sauce is so delicious and the meat falls off the bone. ÊIt is so much food, I usually have leftovers to take home for dinner! This is a great place to bring out of town friends. ÊYou have plenty of time to catch up while you are waiting in line. It is also a great place to go with big groups because everyone orders and pays separately! Just be sure that your entire group is there before ordering and being seated, because there are no saving seats Also, the service here is amazing. ÊStaff is everywhere and ready to help. If you are in a hurry but still want Phil's you can call in your order and pick it up in a separate phone order and to-go line! ÊThis is the best bet if you want quick food during crowded dining times.

Went here for the 86th time or so this Saturday. Pretty awesome experience as usual. Now they have beers in the waiting line, which is good because a dad can bomb 2 beers before you get through the line and into the family area (where I dont think beer is allowed, if it is, then let me know.) Food was good, and the waiter was real nice, he actually brought me some silverware, and I thought this was a self server kind of place. Overall, its always a pleasure to eat at Phils. I would come here more often, but I am fat, and I need to lose weight, sorry Phils.

This is the best in San Diego. We are from Kansas City, so we know good bbq. The ribs are falling off the bone and the onion rings are perfect! I take my family here when they come to visit! The only downfall is you could stand in line for 40 min, but in the end it's worth it!

If you are going to eat there then definitely get the pulled pork...it is amazing and you can definitely taste that it was smoked for quite a while. Although, I was very disappointed with the baby back ribs because it lacks the smokey flavor, it is more on the tangy side and I'm not too fond of that. However, the meat is tender and the people who work there are always happy & pleasant...A BIG PLUS! The sides are mediocre and the baked beans lack umami, coleslaw needs more flavor, and fries should have the option for some type of seasoning. Expect to stand in line for at least 45 minutes during meal times. If you are short on time, call it in and pick it up...much faster that way. ÊOverall, I would only dine here for pulled pork.

Seriously, after eating slabs of ribs from Phil's BBQ, I questioned why I ever was a vegetarian. Ê It's that good. ÊThere are only a handful of places I would say is worth enduring a 20+ minute wait, and Phil's BBQ is definitely on that list. Ê My favorite was the beefy ribs. ÊI think they were better than the baby back, but I'm not a huge fan of pork so I'm a bit biased. ÊThe meat is soooo tender and moist, and it literally falls off the bone and melts in your mouth. ÊThe barbecue sauce is the perfect trifecta of sweet, smokey, and tangy - I honestly don't think I've tasted better bbq sauce. ÊThe chicken was also juicy and delicious. Ê Prices are very reasonable for the quality and quantity of food that you get. ÊI love getting The Best of Both which includes either beefy or baby back ribs, chicken and sides for less than 13 bucks. ÊEnough food for you and a friend, but if they're a good friend, they'd get their own and let you have it all to yourself. Ê Tip: ÊTo avoid that long line, call in your order ahead of time and get your food to-go.

2nd time coming here. LOVED the macaroni salad from the first time. Friendly service. The staff was always smiling, not in a creepy fashion either! LOVED arriving there and not having to wait in a long line. Our order came very quickly as well! This is not my favorite ribs place. It fell off the bone but that's all it did. The sauce was too tangy for me. The ribs weren't grilled so that it formed a crispy exterior as well. Go to Lucille's or Cecil's for those kinds of ribs with AMAZING sauce. But on to the side dishes... cole slaw was bomb esp when paired with ribs. It was light but crunchy. So good. Macaroni salad was good as always.. I have no idea what they put in there but I saw some eggs and onions. No wonder I always get onion breath after eating this :( Beware of that if you're on a first date.. bc by the 3rd or 4th date onion breath shouldn't really matter as much.. right? haha OH their fries were so good as well! They gave A LOT... about 3/4 a plate full and the plates are huge! And again, service as amazing. We had 25 girls and they accommodated all of us, bringing us extra chairs and wetnaps + plastic bags after we ate :) I'll def hit this up again if i'm ever in SD.

Wow is this place good if you are feeling like eating at a great BBQ place. As many people have been saying over and over again, there is ALWAYS a line at this place. I honestly think it's worth the wait since the anticipation is worth it. I ordered the 3 bbq beef ribs dinner plate with a side of potato salad and fries. My only regret was getting all starch in my sides, which filled me up almost immediately. The portions are HUGE as I was sadly only able to finish two ribs. I'm not sure what they put into their bbq sauce but all I can say is that it tasted amazing. They cook the ribs in a way where it brings out the smokiness of the meat perfectly. For sure I will be back here again the next time I go down to San Diego. I guess good mexican food isn't the only thing that's great in this city after all.

Other than the line being very long. I liked the food but what made it great was the server. He was on the move constantly. I did find out that he only received tips from the table and not from the jar at the front. The ribs were decent not to saucy which was a bummer. They did have a sink to wash up that was not in the bathroom. The onion rings were good big and crisp and did not slide out when I took a bite.

For openers, they cheat. They cheat, but it is good. Used to be when San Diego called we'd go to K.C. Barbecue down on Market Street; the food wasn't great but it was, after all, the restaurant/bar where a lot of the scenes from Top Gun were shot. ÊIt has since burned and, in search of barbecue, we were pointed towards Phil's. Phil's is a local phenomenon in a city in a state not known for barbecue. A phenomenon in that the former hole-in-the-wall restaurant now is many times its former self and serving up to 3,000 folks on a weekend day. But it's not barbecue! Ê What Phil's serves is very tasty Êribs and chicken (and presumably other items we did not try) that are subjected to their great rub, baked, slapped on the grill, coated with sauce and then grilled again, caramelizing the sauce giving the meat a nice char and a good flavor - but it's not barbecue. Barbecue, by definition, is meat low temperature slow cooked over hickory, oak, maybe apple or mesquite... Êthen maybe slathered in sauce and finished over an open grill flame. If your criteria is whether it tastes good, then Phil's is your place. If you're a purist who wants to see the smoke ring and taste the wood flavor (most barbecuers use hickory), Phil's is not for you. For the record, their food does Êis fairly priced, the people are super friendly and yes the lines can wrap around the building - manager Jorge Garcia said the wait weekends can hit two hours. Ê If you go, their baby back ribs are excellent, ditto the chicken... no one in our group tried their gigantic beef ribs or the pulled pork Êsandwich. The fries were hand cut and good, onion rings had hard outer crust and great if that's your choice, the baked beans, slaw and ear of corn all very good. It's good, but for the purists amongst us, it . Baking meat, rubbing it with spices and then sauceing, is not barbecue - despite what the sign says.. Four Stars.

Yelped this place weeks before a family trip to SoCal. My 3 sons are big BBQ fans. We had a fantastic meal. Wait outside was an hour but we were not in a rush and this was a must stop for us after we also saw it on Êman vs food. Baby backs, pork shoulder sandwiches, everything smothered in Phil's signature sweet and vinegary sauce. Great stuff. And I got some good local beers from the bar which were perfect with this cuisine. Big sign in front read "more than 1,000 5 star yelp ratings". That's not bragging when the place is this good.

This BBQ place is one of the best places in California for baby back ribs!!! I took my boyfriend here for the first time a few months ago. He enjoyed it!!!

Really San Diego? This is the best BBQ in the city? It's decent. I don't think you'll ever get a bad meal here, but really it's an average BBQ place. I hate to write negative feedback or talk trash, but this isn't remotely close to the reviews it's been getting. It's been around for awhile and people love it, but honestly I believe people are settling because there are hardly any BBQ spots in SD. I'll stop in from time to time to make sure I'm not crazy and the stars weren't aligned on my visits here, but I believe Phil's could step their game up a bit to deserve the stellar reviews they've been receiving. I've had bbq in quite a bit of places around the country, and I'm definitely no bbq expert, this is run of the mill. There's not one item that stands out here. I've had much better bbq in places that aren't even know for their bbq. I can't believe there hasn't been people from Texas, Kansas or the Carolinas coming to SD and capitalizing on the lack of bbq yet. If you're craving bbq and don't want to travel out of the city, go here.

awwwwwwwww yaa! once upon a time, I used to be a carnivore. Then it dawned on me, cows are nice. so are chickens. why eat them? broccoli and carrots and avocados...those were the real villains, so I became a vegetarian to make sure that I eat as much of them as possible before they eat others. anyway. this was hands down the best american bbq I have had ever. The ribs the ribs the ribs. RIBS RIBS RIBS just fall off the bone and into your mouth. Sauce or no sauce, side of corn or mashed potatoes or even both! food tastes home cooked and with the amount of business this place gets it is UNBELIEVABLE how great the food consistently is.

I'm not sure if we went on a bad night or what went wrong : ( Perhaps it is over hyped. I had warnings from a couple of friends that it wasn't that amazing. But of course with 4.5 stars and over 3 thousand reviews, who could turn away?! We waited for almost an hour before we got our seats. Line moved, so it wasn't too bad.. There's heat lamps along the way to recharge and also seats :) We got 3.5 racks of ribs and 3 pulled pork sandwiches for 6 people in all. The ribs at the first bite was really good. I mean DELICIOUS! I think it was a combination of me being hungry and the fact that anything hot was good. But after the 2nd rib I was soon over it. It was drenched in sauce and it wasn't that great. The pork sandwiches were just okay. I mean it was dry and didn't have so much flavor to it. But the onion rings were good. I give them that :) The corn on the cob was yummy too! I don't think I can wait that long for mediocore food.. when I can make it myself. OPEN INVITE~!! :p

A bit pricey but DEFF worth the price. I usually always get the half and half. Half chicken and half beefy ribs. the beefy ribs are sooooo good. I usually cant finish it. What's great about it is that even for leftovers, the ribs are still amazing. The down part of this place----it leaves you craving for more! And of course, there's the notorious wait in line. But obviously, well deserved. It's hard however standing in line watching and smelling the delicious flavors. Yet somehow I always find myself back in line. :)

President's Day Weekend. Trip from OC to SD. Saturday. Prime time. Dinner. LOOOONNNGGGGESTTT wait of my life. My friends and I waited about 2 HOURS. From the sign that said approximately "21minutes and 14 seconds", it literally was over 45 minutes (I timed it with my phone) The man and I spilt a full baby back ribs with two sides (fries and macaroni salad), a red velvet whoopie pie, and one drink for about $27. Food came out fast and it was hot. The racks of ribs: The meat was tender and soft. However, little meat on each rib, and it was mostly burnt to black on the edges. I don't like my food scorched. The BBQ sauce made up for the taste of the burntness. You have to ask for the BBQ sauce up front when you're picking up your food. I was expecting a lot more BAM! to my food. Side: fries were decent. I added the creole seasoning to make them more tasty. The macaroni salad was really good. The noodles looks like huge macaronis cut into smaller rings. The salad wasn't overly drench with mayo- Big Plus. Whoopie pie: REALLY GOOD! tasted like red velvet. Frosting in the middle was great, not too sweet, not to sour. I think it was the best out of all the food. Overall: Food was decent. Dessert was great. Line was way tooooooo long. I guess everyone thinks that the food is great because they wait so long that ANYTHING taste yummy when you're starving. I really thought i would get blown away from all the hype, but I didn't. Yes, we did get a LOT of food for the price, but it didn't make it worth standing in line for so long. Maybe we came at the wrong time and the food wasn't as tasty because of all the people they had to serve. I don't know if i would give it another go.

This place is great by all means, but does not warrant the five stars that everyone seems to be giving it. When I finished my meal, although I was satisfied, I didn't leave wanting more. As for the positives, I ordered the baby back ribs which were good. They were a little oversauced for my tastes. The side dishes were also pretty good. I didn't care for the machine like atmosphere however. It was like a giant factory of overweight people.

Overrated. Why do people like to HYPE up places? Man...gets my blood boiling especially when it's about food, BBQ ribs for all that matter. Anyways, I don't understand what the hype is about with this place. The sauce is good but I had better; it's called Kraft. Jk. But on a serious note, this is mediocre BBQ at its best. I mean, they don't even offer cornbread or greens! You call yourself a BBQ joint with NO cornbread or greens? Service was super duper awesome though. That's really all I can give them.

2/26/2012....... Today after walking around the Swap Meet, I was treated to lunch at Phil's. We got there twenty minutes after they opened and didn't wait too long to order and be seated. I had the BBQ Broham Sandwich and a side of baked beans and the food was DELICIOUS....and the portions were HUGE!!! The only reason I didn't give Phil's a Five Star Rating is because two different items myself and another person in my group wanted, would have delayed our party of sixes' entire meals an additional twenty plus minutes; so we ordered items that were not on the "time delay menu". The atmosphere was great, and the both we had for our party of six sat us all very well. I recommend Phil's BBQ to anyone who loves BBQ.

Yumm. When I lived in SD, my roommates and I would go visit Phil's whenever we were bored. It was all gooood until I realized that all that yummy bbq and onion rings will catch up with you real fast in your stomach and thighs. I don't like bbq- the sauce and getting messy- but this is so worth it. The meat just falls right off and you really have to get the onion rings or your meal is just incomplete. The pig is definately much better than their cow ribs. I just don't like how long the lines have become.

Let me start by saying that I'm almost leaning towards a five star review, but I feel like I will need to go once more to really make that jump. The lines are long; I think we waited about 45 minutes. ÊThey did have a beer stand outside near the door, so that's a plus. ÊA little alcohol will always make line standing more enjoyable. When we finally got up to the counter to order, we went with a full rack of baby back ribs, the broham sandwich, and an order of onion rings. ÊThe baby back ribs were SO MEATY and tender. ÊThey fell right off the bone. ÊThe BBQ sauce they use is really tasty as well. Ê The onion rings, to die for! ÊThey're really big and fried perfectly. ÊThe kind that you bite and you DO NOT end up with the Êwhole onion in your mouth. My least favorite item (hence the 4 stars) was the broham. ÊMaybe we were too full from the ribs, or maybe they were having an off day, but the pork was a little on the dry side. ÊI prefer my meat more "wet." All in all, great food and great restaurant feel. ÊThey do a good job of keeping customers happy and the restaurant clean, even with the high traffic.

This place is simply delicious! Definitely worth a visit if you're in SD! The line may look long, but it moves faster than you'll expect. We stood in line where it said "20 minutes from here" and it was a very accurate wait time. It's actually not that long because you'll be pondering what to get on the menu, and by the time you've decided, it's your turn to order! Between 2 people, we wanted to get the full rack meal and extra ribs, but we decided to just get the full rack meal. ÊI'm glad we didn't order the extra ribs, because the meal was pretty big! To be honest, the ribs weren't as tender as I expected, but the sauce, oh the sauce... very delicious. I should have bought a bottle of the sauce. We didn't finish the fries or potato salad, it was a huge portion. If you're eating with more than 2 people, I would suggest order the full rack +extra ribs. The sides in the full meal is enough to feed 3-4 people.

A line worth the wait. Got the baby back rib tickler and it was perfect. Not too much not too little. The heaters weren't working in the enclosed patio so that was a bumber since it was late and chilly. But I thoroughly enjoyed and appreciated the hand washing trough next to the soda machines. Wish they had more desserts. All in all it's a must try while in SD.

Loong lines, even we arrived at around 430pm it took 1.5 hours to get seated. They are nice enough to offer iced water and onion rings during the wait which helps ease the pain of waiting. We had all three meats: baby back ribs, beef ribs, and chicken , as well as cole slaw, potato salad, and fries. Can't handle the onion ring as there are too much food even thought I'm a big fan of it. Portions are big. Just one dish is probably enough for two people while I have waited for so long its better to get more just so I can take home and eat one more time, lol. I like the beef rib the best, it's beefy and tasty. Baby back ribs are good, while not like crazy good or something. Like their sauce as it's not too overpowering. Chicken is just normal chicken, nothing special while their chicken breast is quite tendor and juicy. I would say leave the stomach for beef or baby back rib. I like the red skin chunky potato salad. Cole slaw is good, while cole slaw is cole slaw. Fries are good, while quite normal as well. Service is super friendly. They help me find a table when we were looking around for one. Is it good? Yes. Worth the 1-2 hours wait? Maybe. Yes if you are not busy and crave for BBQ on any given day.

I can't believe I haven't written a review yet for my fave BBQ! My goodness, first of all I'm gonna let you in on my secret, its hush hush ok. Why are you waiting in line? Head over to the bar people! First come first served. I have waited in line like twice. Everytime I just head to the bar and grab a seat. While you are at it, grab a sangria, yumm. Nothing like meat and sugar. This place is for big appetites, but you can get a nibble if you order the nibbler plate. The perfect size for a "smaller" appetite (its still a lot of food). All in all, awesome BBQ and great service!

Not much I can say that hasn't been mentioned but Phil's is freakin' great. A very well oiled machine with some of the best customer service and wait staff I have seen. ÊYes, the line can be atrocious so you may want to plan your day around Phil's and not the other way around. ÊWeekdays are always your best bet either before or after the lunch rush and on weekends?

ÊOnion rings are good, Baby Backs are delightful.....hell.....just get everything. ÊAs some of said, and I would agree it's not authentic BBQ but lets not split hairs here. ÊThey could cook all their meals on a Foreman grill and I couldn't care less. ÊJust great food and with great prices and great service. Go Phil!!

Oh boy...I think I am the last person to review this place....For those of you who live in SD or are longtime residents your mind is probably already set...but for visitors this review is for you.... Atmosphere - Typical BBQ joint. ÊPlease note that unless you eat in the bar you place your order at the counter (a la McD's) and they call/buzz you up when ready for pick up. ÊThey do have errand boys running around to assist you with some stuff but the drinks and food are self-service. ÊThere is no table seating so your best bet is to have someone order and someone stalk...yes STALK cuz it's usually packed...a table. ÊThe bar has TV's and a U shaped bar to sit at. ÊThey also have outdoor seating now and beer as you wait...nice bonus. Food/Beverage - For those of you who have ever eaten BBQ outside of SoCal, Food Trucks or BBQ Fairs the sauce here will taste tangier to you. ÊIf you don't like that well then you are SOL baby cuz they only have 1 flavor. ÊFor those that enjoy a more honey, hickory, spicy, etc sauce...do not come here. ÊAlso, no serious BBQ place would not have beef brisket on their menu...c'mon man. ÊTheir sides also leave a little to be desired. ÊThat being said I do like the quality of their ribs (both), pork and chicken...so for me it boils down to the sauce...which isn't awful...but I feel I could get better at Ralph's. Cost - Now the cost for the food isn't too bad at all for all of the (misplaced) hype. ÊYou can get out for $30 (for 2) if you sit on cattle seating side....since there is no need for tip...sit in the bar and add 20%. Ê Summary - For visitors I STRONGLY recommend you not make this a priority for your trip or you most likely will be disappointed ...not to mention waste 3 hours in SD where we all know there are MUCH better things to do than stand in line. ÊIt is an inexpensive decent place to grab a meal if you can get in and out fast...but I drive by this place daily and I can count on one hand how many times there hasn't been a line around the corner. ÊShit if people would look around they'd see that Bull's Smokin BBQ is 2 miles away with no wait and better selection..although pricier. BONUS BONUS BONUS Sneak in the back and stalk a seat or two in the bar...you will get your eat on faster. ÊOr you can call in your order and be in and out in 5 minutes....it's not like the ambiance is the selling feature or part of the "Phil's experience."

I've been going to Phil's for years - even back when they were located at their old location. ÊUnfortunately, I've been disappointed the past few times I've ordered take-out from Phil's. ÊIt used to be handsdown my favorite place to get ribs but lately I've been getting dry ribs with hardly any sauce and stale tasting fries. ÊMy most recent take-out experience there, my ribs were cold and super dry and I don't live far enough to justify them getting that cold that fast!!! ÊI for sure will not be taking any of my out of town family or friends to this place anymore. ÊToo bad!

It probably deserves a four, but for all the hype and the wait, it gets a 3. The food... ÊI love ribs, I love BBQ, I love meat in general, but... this place just does it well. ÊNot great, not amazing, not even "really good". ÊPerhaps the fact that I'm from the midwest ruins my expectations, but a lot of decent neighborhood joints in the midwest have better ribs. ÊSadly, the best part would be the sauce, which sort of masks the BBQ in general (hence why dry rub is so hard to pull off). ÊREALLY good BBQ should be falling off the bones with smoked in flavor, and maybe a wet rub if you like sauces (which I also enjoy). ÊSo... I'm sticking to an "A-OK' on this. The ridiculous wait... I just don't understand it. ÊPerhaps it's the lack of BBQ places around, but I can't believe the wait that's out there. ÊFor mediocre BBQ I wouldn't wait in that line. ÊThough I guess with the fact that I could grab drinks in the line it'd both make the waiting better, and perhaps hinder my judgement once I got in? Overall... A-OK since it's decent ribs, but if I'm around the area, there are so many other good places to go.

Everything is the BOOOOOOOOOOMB DIGGITY! I love this place! I think the staff is so friendly and their food is so delish! I always have their pulled pork sandwich with a side of fries and ranch dipping sauce. It's such a great combo. I have my tangy, salty, and...ranch haha My boyfriend gets pork ribs or beef ribs. I prefer the pork, but the beef is still really good and they're humongous! This place is worth the wait in my opinion. I would definitely stop in when you're craving some BBQ and you don't have a grill.

Phil's BBQ is to authentic BBQ as Taco Bell is to authentic Mexican food. Phil's needs to lay off the fake smoke flavoring and try actually smoking their ribs with a decent dry rub and not swamp their ribs with sauce to make up for the lack of flavor. I am from the south where BBQ is a staple, and this is a pathetic excuse for BBQ. If Phil's were to ever enter their BBQ at Memphis in May, they would be laughed out of town. If you want real BBQ, try Felix's BBQ with Soul.

This place is SO GOOD! We drive from downtown to this restaurant for lunch on occasion it's that good. I personally like the beef over the pork or chicken but everyone likes something different. Also when you go, be sure you get extra sauce, they give you a lot but trust me, you will need more! The side are good, coleslaw and backed beans are my favorite. I am a fan of get-it-yourself when it comes to drinks, silverware, plates, to-go boxes, etc. so if you liked to get wined and dined this is not the place for you. The only thing that keeps me from giving it five stars is the wait, it's out the door and around the block if you don't get there soon after opening or in off-peak eating hours. While they have a pretty efficient system for handling the crowds and even a "mini bar" in the patio area to belly up to while you wait, it can still be frustrating.

Wasn't a BBQ fan until this place came into my life! I use to hate BBQ things because I just didn't like the taste of it, but this place is BOMB. BOMB enough for me and my friends to order it to go and eat on the sidewalk or inside the car because the wait was too long to eat inside. Which is a good tip for all you eager eaters! If you don't want in the long line, best bet is for you to order it to go and just eat it elsewhere! It's most likely busy more than half the time so expect to wait! The french fries are also really deliciously seasoned too, and hot sauce goes so well with everything. Customer Service is always great, and nothings going to stop me from coming back in the future. :) Recommendations: Best of Both Worlds

My fervor for this place has subsided. The food is AMAZING, but everything else that goes along with it is annoying and just not worth it anymore. Here's why: 1) THE LINE: Every time I drive by there is a HUGE line around the corner, plan on waiting a long time. No thanks. 2) THE SEATING: the "open seating" arrangement is frustrating. People fighting and arguing over tables. You have to stalk people with empty plates and then throw elbows to get their seat. 3) THE BAR: I used to sit in the bar to avoid the chaos, but now they have all these new rules (e.g. you can only buy food if you are sitting at the bar, but I see people shark tables and have one person sit at the bar and order food for everyone). This place needs to expand or open another location in San Diego, it has become too popular and frenzied. Food (5 stars) + Atmosphere (1 star) = 3 stars.

Thursday night 9PM - 20 minute wait in the cold. Huge list of menu items outside, good. Its nice to have something to read while you wait and there is no excuse for not knowing exactly what you want when you get to the counter. First employee contact: welcoming and informative. The director of human traffic told us exactly what to do and where to go in a very pleasant manner. The counter experience: once again very friendly. The cashier took our order, took our money and gave us our buzzer. Looking for a table? Good luck. The other half wanted us to pass on the one nearest to us in a high volume area, so we went into the heated and covered outside seating section. We knew it was going to be busy so no surprise there was little seating to be had. What was surprising was the number of empty tables outside that had not yet been cleared off. So back we went to the table right by the counter (just in time, some scallywags were about to purloin it!!). Our buzzer buzzed and my other half went to get our food. Mine: Êthe full rib dinner(baby back) with 1 huge coleslaw side. Hers: half rib dinner with two sides of fries and sweet beans. The sides were huge. My coleslaw was so big I had to get a box to go. Coleslaw to go? Yes, it was that good. The other half praised her fries and beans. Upon inquiring about the meat portion of her meal she replied "the ribs are good but I don't absolutely love them". Love? Ribs?? Who LOVES ribs???. I do. They were delicious. And no, it is not just the sauce (even though that was exceptionally tasty). The meat was succulent and tender almost falling off the bone. I finished the whole rack and had to stop myself from licking my fingers. I was seriously tempted to get some to go just so I could have them for breakfast. Overall it was a great experience for a reasonable price. We spent $40 for the two of us including tax but not tip. The service staff and food were both excellent and my only minor complaint was the number of empty tables left uncleared for over 5 minutes. But hey, this is a very busy place with a very high turnover and for good reason. The food is superb.

My favorite is the Beef Rib dinner. These things are HUGE and DELICIOUS. The Baby Back Ribs were ok for me, but I would come here everyday for the beef-- if I could afford it. It's expensive for a college student like me; but with the portions they give out, it could probably feed me for days. :D Also, It's worth trying at least once. I hated bbq sauce until I tasted Phil's. Their Êsauce isn't too overpowering, and I actually wanted more of it.

Got half a rack of ribs, the pulled pork sandwich, and three sides for $28. Pretty cheap! The sauce the ribs was sooo yummy and they came right off the bone. It came with a LOT of fries. The pulled pork sandwich needed the sauce it came with. The macaroni salad was okay. The beans were pretty good. Definitely get the ribs!!! Luckily we beat the rush, when we arrived we were at the "20 minutes to the front" spot in line. I wasn't too happy about waiting that long but when we sat down the line was wrapped around the side so I guess I'm glad we got there early!

Can't beat the portions and they have the best ribs in town. The line is a bit long (wait times for dinner around 7pm are consistently 25-30 minutes) but once you're inside, you order and grab whatever table is open. They have a rack of paper towels on each table to try and keep you clean but it's impossible to eat their ribs politely (and if you can, you're not really enjoying the rib.. or life). I will definitely keep coming back.

My roommates had a trip to SD and when they returned they could not stop raving about how good Phil's ribs were. Then, I noticed EVERYONE were raving about this place so I decided to check this place out myself. The line wrapped around the place and I assumed it would take an hr or two but my boyfriend and I waited a little over 30 minutes (the line moved super fast). When we got in we ordered: Half Baby Back Rib Dinner w/ cole slaw and baked beans, small onion ring, and BBQ Broham sandwich. ALLL THREE OF WHAT WE ORDERED WERE AMAZING. I now understood the numerous ribs. The price is amazing, the food is amazing. I absolutely love how everything is set up. Everything is ready for you and if you end up not finishing your food then the to-go box and bags are by the utensils for you to take home. I can't wait to go back to SD to have Phil's again.

3.5 stars If it'll be your first time here - just go, you won't hate it :) Errrrrrr...sorry but I can't agree with the majority here. ÊHowever (really BIG however), I can see why one might enjoy this place. ÊIt's inexpensive. The meat IS very tender and you get huge-A-mongo portions! ÊAt 5'1" and 110 I shouldn't have ordered the Beefy Rib dinner (3 bones) as I did. ÊI probably should have gone for the 'tickler' which is a much smaller size but enough to get you nice and full. The sauce is super tangy which I personally don't care for and they douse the stuff all over. ÊThe service was great. ÊWe had a nice guy named Luis bussing our table who seemed to love his job. ÊI can really appreciate that after having had my share of bad customer service (particularly in the Point Loma area). Oh, and yes, the line - it moves quickly, so NBD. Bottom line: I prefer my BBQ to have a sweeter taste which Phil's did not. But if you haven't tried it - gooooo!!! ÊYou might just fall in love...

Not exactly five star quality ribs. ÊOr maybe this place has been hyped up too much. ÊOn a recent trip to San Diego, Erin L, Matt P, Jenni H, Robert H, and I decided to try out Phil's BBQ. ÊWe tried to get there around 5pm to beat the dinnertime crowd. ÊHowever we failed miserable. I blame this on Matt P and his poor navigational/planning skills. Anyway, we arrived to Phil's a little after 6pm. ÊThe line was ridiculous. ÊIt wrapped around two walls of the restaurant. ÊInstead, we decided to order to go. Ê We had a rack of rib, half a chicken, coleslaw, and baked beans. ÊThe ribs were good. ÊThey weren't too sweet. ÊAnd there were no hard or chewy pieces. ÊI liked their chicken because it was very moist. ÊThe side dishes were pretty average. ÊAnd you don't really get a lot when you order a large or small size. Ê I would not wait in line to eat here. ÊThe dining area inside is dark. ÊAnd it's a cafeteria style setting. ÊThis is more of a takeout kind of place. ÊTakeout service is quick. ÊAnd you still get all the good food that Phil's BBQ has to offer. You can also sit at the bar and order from there. ÊYou avoid the lines. ÊAnd, you get to drink alcohol with your BBQ. :)

Since my Mom "discovered" unlimited texting, she texts me more than she used to call. ÊHere's her latest text. She has this annoying habit of using caps when she thinks it's an important message: PHIL'S ÊBBQ ÊLNCH SAT GO I have always enjoyed the food from Phil's. ÊI always call ahead for pick up. The ribs are delicious. ÊI enjoy the beef ribs more than the pork. ÊThere's more meat,tender,fall off the bone,delicious,dripping flavorful fatty meat... I also love the sauce, which I always order on the side. I love sweets. The side dishes are not that spectacular, coleslaw,corn,beans,onion rings, not the greatest,but edible.

Mmmm... this is some tasty BBQ. When you get to Phil's, there are two lines. The carry-out line and the dine-in line. Obviously, the dine-in line is significantly longer. But, it does go by quick. Grab your ticket number and wait patiently for your order to be called. One of the things I do appreciate about Phil's are the plethora of hand washing stations throughout the restaurant so that you don't have to walk to the bathroom to clean off the tangy BBQ sauce. BTW Phil's uses a sweet and slightly spicy sauce for their BBQ. It's a bit closer to Carolina BBQ than Texas BBQ. Personally, I'm not a fan of the rub they use for their ribs, but to each his or her own. As for parking, yes, it's quite a madhouse to find parking. You'll know you're getting close, because of the overflow of cars onto the street.

Phil's never fails. Except maybe when it's super busy, you get there at 7pm, and you have to wait basically an hour to get your food. BUT besides that, win. I always get the Baby Back Ribs Tickler since I'm not a boss and basically incapable of eating more than that anyway. My guy friends love this place because they can eat a ridiculous amount of saucy meat, get it all over their face, and no one takes a second glance. It can get a little pricey for the more substantial meals but you can always take what you don't finish home in a "quitter box" ;) BBQ meats + fries/onion rings/whatever sides you prefer + a pitcher of beer = good times with friends every time. Also, sweet sink to wash your hands of all grubbiness on the way out. Plus.

With all of the hype surrounding Phil's, my road tripping comrades and I concluded that we had to make our way here for dinner on a recent day trip. Ê We showed up at 6 on a Saturday evening. ÊBig mistake. ÊThe line out the door wrapped a good 50 yards around the entire length of the building that Phil's occupies. ÊAfter speaking to a local in line, we were informed we'd have about a 45 minute to hour wait, and was supposedly worth every minute of it. ÊWaiting an hour or so just to get seated wasn't in our schedule, so we placed our orders to go and they were ready within 10 minutes! ÊHad we waited in line, we would have just been seated by the time that we were able to get some drinks at a nearby CVS and finished feasting on our meal at a nearby park. Now on to the eats. ÊWe ordered 2 orders of the pork ribs and the barbecue chicken. ÊThe ribs were good. ÊNot too tough and slathered with a good amount of sweet sauce. ÊI'd recommend these to any rib lover. ÊThe chicken was tasty too. ÊThe barbecue on the bird wasn't nearly as good as the taste of the ribs, but the meat itself was cooked to perfection. Sides included beans, coleslaw, and a baked potato. Ê I think this place is a little over hyped, but the food was good and very affordable. ÊWould I come back? ÊYes. ÊWould I wait an eternity in line for it? ÊNot so much.

Yum, yum, yum. Just remembering my rib tickler (I prefer beef) makes me happy. ÊThe rib tickler is the perfect amount of food: 1 hearty beef rib, generous helping of french fries, coleslaw and a couple of delightful onion rings. My only two gripes are the insanely long lines to eat in-house and sometimes the beef rib can be a lot more bone than meat.

I decided to try this place because it was on Man vs Food. ÊWe were standing in line, and to my surprise, Adam Richman was right next to me. ÊHe was there shooting for his new show "Best Sandwich in America". ÊPhil's "El Toro" sandwich was being featured for it, so I had to try it. ÊTheir BBQ sauce was outstanding as well as their potato salad and the sandwich itself. ÊIf you watch the show, my daughter is the little girl that they close up on who is holding a sign.

Before Phil's was featured on the travel channel, I was going here. ÊBam! I am happy to guide anyone to this restaurant as their starting point to San Diego's culinary experience! The sauce and everything on the menu is tasty and has a unique taste that identifies their BBQ... The wait is a killer and the reason why I haven't gone back. If I was to judge this place as a west coast BBQ joint I would give it five stars due to the fact we don't have too many establishments the can delivery like the East Coast or Down south. ÊBut compared to any other BBQ joint this place lacks so much flavor and service. The menu prices are way too much for what you order and less could be said for the food portions that do shrink with the uneasy ordering style. Service on a busy night is non-existent.

Alright, I haven't eaten at many BBQ places, but I remember leaving this place incredibly happy and ready to KTFO. My best friend Brighton took me here right as I arrived from the airport. Apparently Phil's BBQ is widely known to the one of the best restaurants San Diego has to offer. We shared the Full Beef Rib Dinner. This entree comes with 5 bones and 2 sides. We picked coleslaw and fries for our sides. The fries here are so delicious (I like my fries regular sized, not thick and mushy). I felt like they were cooked perfectly. I didn't eat the coleslaw because I'm not a fan of mayo but Brighton seemed to love it. The beef ribs were AMAZING. They were even better because I put a crapload of hot sauce on them. If I didn't have such tasty hot sauce, I don't think I would have enjoyed the ribs as much. I barely had 2 bones and I was already really full. I took my leftovers home and ate when I was drunk later on that night. Just as delicious!! The service here was good too. I went at 11AM right when they opened, so it wasn't really crowded at all. The girl taking our order was really nice and gave me a lot of great recommendations. Our food was under $25 and we both left really satisfied. I definitely am missing Phil's BBQ already!

The last thing this place needs is another review--- but WOW...the ribs here were so damn good I couldn't not write about them. Here are my thoughts: --the line is long but moves fast. It's worth it to wait and sit inside because the atmosphere makes it better; i'm convinced that this food just wouldn't taste as good if I ate it at home --you MUST try the ribs. The chicken is good too, but nothing compares to the ribs --the baked beans are also delish!!! I was in Texas a few months ago for a wedding, and no TX bbq I went to even remotely compared to Phil's. I'm not even a big meat eater but these ribs will have me going back frequently.

I HAVE BEEN WANTING GOOD BBQ SO BAD! The "tickler" is the perfect size for me. It doesn't tickle my stomach, it makes me full and satiated. The price was no more than about $7 for it. Oh my goodness. I love this place. It's also super convenient for groups because you don't have to split the tab at the end since you pay for yourself individually at the beginning. Now that's pretty darn efficient! Also, even though you have to order your food standing up and pick up your food when it's ready, the service is still stellar! There's always someone there to help out and make sure you have everything you need. AMAZING!

Decent price for the amount of food you're getting and can possibly feed 2 people if you aren't a heavy eater 7.

Okay, so I judged my 4-star rating off one visit, and that was at the San Marcos location. Sorry for my serious miscalculation. THIS PLACE IS A WELL-DESERVED 5 STARS !!  Since my last review, I've frequented this place about 3 more times (will be more in the coming months, hehe)! This place has theeeeeee best fall-off-the-bone lip smackin' finger lickin' baby back ribs EVER. But, I'm sure you knew that judging by all the other 4 and 5 star reviews! The BBQ sauce is tangy and slightly spicy! I loveeeee it! Every time I come here with my friends, I always watch their reactions after their first bite into the ribs, and not once did I ever get a bad reaction. They all had foodgasm faces, both subtle and not-so-subtle..hahaha.Also, the half side of fries are more than enough for 2 very hungry people, haha. Their fries are superrrrr good, tooo! Crispy and tasty to perfection! And their service,.. their service is PHENOMENAL, just like their ribs! All the workers have smiles on their faces, and they're always so upbeat and helpful! There's this girl that usually mans the lines, and I guess she recognized me after 2 visits, haha :x What can I say, their ribs keep me coming back here!! She recognized me again while I was in their 45 minute line today, and she stopped to give me a smile and hug :) aww! They also passed out french fries while you wait :D hahaha, and you can help yourself to some lemon-water (it actually tastes like lemonade more than water... hahaha). While we were still waiting in line, another one of the workers saw us hungrily waiting, and when we got into the restaurant, he recognized us, talked with us a bit, and then asked "the wait wasn't that bad, right?" We said it was a long wait :( and I jokingly said that he could compensate our wait with an extra side of fries. Well, he offered three of us free drinks instead! :) Even better!! After we ordered our stuff, he came over and asked which drinks we wanted, then gave us glasses of Sangria (which tasted exceptional) on the house :)!! That's what I call exceptional service!!! Everyone that worked here was all smiles and all the people that were eating here were all smiles, too :D! Phil's, I'm gonna be seeing you for the many months to come ^_~ OHHH and btw guys, if you don't mind sitting in the bar, I was told that you can just skip the line and order/seat yourself at the bar area (if seating is open there)! I remember seeing a few booths in the bar area, too! :D enjoy~

I know the food is great that is why I took senior blind mom there for lunch today. ÊOur bank is across the street at Point Loma CU. As we entered the door the people in front of Êus said please go in front of them to the front of the line. ÊI was wanting to take a look at the menu behind the counter when Êthe hostess said have either of you ever been here before and I replayed I have about a year ago have the rules changed? ÊShe said that I was over the line at the door and should be behind it. I said don't make us go to Wendy's and she said if you go over the line again you will go to Wendy's .

So Phil's does get a lot of press and other BBQ places are often compared to them. I have been eating here for years and have had the luxury of eating at some fine BBQ places all over the United States. I give Phil's 4 Stars overall for the reasons as follows. They are very consistent if food quality regardless of the day or times I have eaten here. Phil's has a pretty decent selection of menu items and the prices are very reasonable. I would say they best things on the menu are their baby back ribs and onion rings. I guess the biggest contention from my friends who have tried Phil's is their BBQ sauce. You either love it or hate it. It has a tangy taste that I must admit is different then any other place I have had the pleasure of dining at. BTW, they also sell it at Costco and in the restaurant. I usually get the Baby back or Chick Tickler. They come with french fries (I rate the fries average), 2 onion rings and coleslaw. All for less than 7 bucks. This alone is a very good portion size and most people will be full if they ate the entire meal. I also like the BBQ Broham (Pulled Pork Sandwich) seasoned and char-grilled, on a bed of Cole Slaw topped with BBQ sauce, Rib-less Dinner (chunks of pork shoulder seasoned and BBQ sauce) and the Beefy Rib & Chick-less Dinner (2 Bones with chunks of white breast meat chicken seasoned & BBQ'd). A cool option they have is a 1 Bone Sampler Beef rib for only $3.95. I prefer babybacks over beef ribs, but sometimes I get the hanker for a hunk of beef and don't want to order a full or half rack. I get the 1 Bone Sample with a pulled pork sandwich and it really hits the spot! The colossal onion ring (small $3.95/large $5.95) rock! They go down perfect with ranch dressing and are not real greasy like some other onion rings you get at other BBQ joints. The batter is awesome and I can almost down a small order by myself. Get one of the ticklers and they give you 2 with your meal. Other menu items include burgers (only tried them once and they were lean and had good flavor, but don't compare to top burger spots in SD (see my other reviews), El Toro (char-grilled deli sliced tri-tip topped with BBQ sauce), BBQ Turkey Burger, BBQ Chicken Breast and a BBQ Garden Veggie Burger. They also have a few different salads, but that's not why you come here. GET THE RIBS! Depending on the day and time, be prepared to stand in line for up to 2 hours. I recommend getting there right when they open at 11am on Saturday/Sundays. They are closed on Mondays as well as a couple of weeks around Xmas. I eat here a lot on weeknights and rarely stand in line on the non-summer months. An added bonus is they also have Fresca on the fountain drink dispenser! You can get seated right away if there are seats available in the bar area and you can always call in your order and pick it up. Just a word of caution, DO NOT call in your order and then eat it at the restaurant. They will come up to your table and other customers will probably give you an ear full. Since moving to this location form Mission Hills, they have a huge banquet room in the same little business area where the restaurant is located. Oh yeah, they do cater, but the couple times I have the catered food, it was not as good as the fresh offerings served at the restaurant. So, the baby back ribs are REALLY tender and melt in your mouth. The onion rings are awesome and the coleslaw has a nice flavor as well. The lines can be long and sometimes the parking sucks. Not the biggest selection of side orders and they do not offer different types of BBQ sauces like many other fine BBQ establishment. Prices are decent and the line moves pretty quick. Great service at the ordering counter (no waiters or waitresses) and with the people who work in the dining areas. Plenty of outdoor seating. If you like traditional sweet or smokey BBQ sauce, you may not like the tanginess of Phil's sauce. I say nothing ventured, nothing gained!

This is my favorite BBQ place of all time. I've been to quite a few BBQ places in the west, but Phil's is by far the best. The line scared me at first, but it was definitely worth the wait. You also just have to be smart about it, like anything. Obviously if you go around dinner time on a Friday or Saturday, there is going to be a HUGE wait. But, duh people! Its common sense! The baby back ribs are delicious. The corn on the cob is sweet and the homemade onion rings rock. Oh and the customer service is awesome too! I don't live in San Diego, but I will be driving back soon to get some Phil's.

This place has some down right finger lickin PHENOMENAL bbq. As the most highly rated restaurant in San Diego, a line wrapping around the building, and a pig on their website that oinks when you squeeze it, I expected nothing less! Definitely not your regular sit-down restaurant. You begin by standing in an endless line, salivating through the glass at the people eating inside, passed several giant menus and a beer stand (in case you want to make your time in line that much more enjoyable), you then order at the register, grab your fountain drink, a table and pick up your food when your buzzer goes off. Then the time comes to devour the ooey gooey fresh and MEATY baby back ribs. You could drink these ribs with a straw they're SO tender! Although.. I don't recommend it. It is marinated in both dry rub and wet marinade, topped with bbq sauce that is then caramelized, then topped with more sauce! I also had the beef ribs that were good but I'm not a huge fan of beef ribs in general. The peppery and creamy macaroni salad is GREAT. Oh, Phil's BBQ - Won't you open a location in Orange County?

Ahh #800! ÊWhat better place to review than a BBQ spot that DEFIES THE BOUNDARIES OF DELICIOUSNESS d^_^b My homie (yet another first lol) and I arrived in the late afternoon off peak hours and were lucky enough to endure a mere 15-20 minute wait. ÊBefore I even get to the food, I must point out the unexpectedly stellar service here. ÊOne of the staff, Tammie, greeted us while we were in line and as soon as I mentioned that I was visiting from NorCal, she whisked me off for a quick tour of the kitchen! ÊI got a run-through of the area and upon commenting on how good the onion rings looked, she immediately nabbed one for me from one of the cooks. ÊFreaking. ÊLegit. ÊLater on, our server, Marlon, introduced himself and said he'd be taking care of us throughout our meal. ÊFor a place where you order food up front and pick it up yourself, it was a seriously pleasant surprise that added further to the legitness. Now for the good stuff ;) Baby Back Ribs - very good in terms of tenderness and flavor, but it paled in comparison to the... BEEFY RIBS - AMAZING! ÊIt was loaded with meaty, fatty goodness infused with smokey notes and covered in tangy, spicy BBQ sauce. ÊEven just one bone is almost a meal and a half in and of itself. El Toro - Adam Richman wasn't kidding about how good this is! ÊThe tri-tip had such a deep, smokey flavor to it just like its beefy cousin and each saucy bite was a mouthgasm. ÊAt only $7 too, this stands as one of the best sandwiches I've had to date. Colossal Onion Rings - normally I'm not much of a fan, but these were damn good! ÊThe rings themselves were cut nice and thick and the batter was hot and super crispy. ÊErnie F. would go to town on these haha. By the end, I felt like one lardy tub and you know what? ÊIt was TOTALLY WORTH IT =D ÊAnd as a final note of advice to echo what some others have said, come during off peak hours or call in advance and order to go if you want to avoid a crazy long line.

Absolutely delicious, though not entirely worth the often too long wait. My favorites are the beef rib dinner, baby back ribs, cole slaw, and macaroni salad. The onion rings are on point but an order, even a small, is often too much due to the amount of accompanying grease. A 3-rib dinner is often enough to guarantee leftovers for breakfast and lunch the next day. In my experience, the chicken was often dry and unmemorable compared to the beef and pork entrees. The prices are extremely reasonable for what you get and the service is always very attentive. Great spot to take guests and wow them.

What is the ultimate test of good BBQ? IS it how the meat is so tender it falls off the bone? Is it in the sauce itself, or how it incorporates all the slow-cooked smoky goodness. No my friends, the ultimate test that distinguishes good BBQ from GREAT BBQ is that when you have GREAT BBQ you will lick and suck on your finger to get that very last bit of flavor and not think twice about where that finger has been. I found myself in this exact predicament the first time I came to Phil's. It is a good thing that we are no longer primates and Êeat with our feet because the way I was going at it, I would have probably been branded as having a shrimpin fetish. The BBQ was so good, I wanted to down the sauce in shotglasses. ÊI couldn't even pause long enough to remember if I had washed my hands or not. ÊDid I use the bathroom? Did I scratch that itch in between my toes or in the nether regions? ÊWho cares?!?! Just keep it comin and don't stop. ÊIn hindsight I think that I had washed my hands otherwise my wife would have shot a look of horror my way. After I was all done, I looked like the fat dude from the Twin Peaks movie who got lipstick smeared all over his face from makin out with Laura (Wow, where did that come from? What kind of BBQ makes me think about David Lynch movies?). Don't let my four star rating fool you - it is really good and probably the best bbq on the Pacific Coast. ÊI only reserve the 5 stars for the best bbq that I have ever had - and in that case I put the leftover bones in my bed so I could sleep with its aromatherapy. Forget the San Diego Zoo and Shamu. ÊPhil's is the area attraction for me.

Won a trip to San Diego in Feb. we weren't even looking for this place but ended up stumbling upon this place & come to find out it's been on Man Vs. Food, cool huh? The line was out the door but their staff keeps it moving & they are very friendly with how busy they are. They seem to enjoy where they work. Wow, am I the only one reviewing this place that didn't eat the baby back ribs? Sheesh. I ordered half a BBQ chicken & skipped on the beans. The servings are GINORMOUS! So make sure you're hungry when you go here. The food was super yummy! I'd go there again if I ever visit San Diego again.

I don't know what I can say which hasn't already been said. Amazing amazing amazing. Ê The line was about 45 minutes but once you're in, you pick up your food and go to it. HUGE portions. ÊReview of what we got: beef ribs: the meat slides off the bone and there's about 1/3 pound of meat per rib. tender and so damn good it's not right. pulled pork sandwich: not as good as the beef ribs but for $6.50 I can't recall a better/bigger sandwich I've gotten. Comes with cole slaw which I normally don't like, but actually finished. Baked Beans: The other Êside I"ve never liked. This was different. I don't know if they're soaked in honey or what, but very sweet. Onion Rings: awesome, and lots of them. Potato Salad: I am a big fan of potato salad and this was very good. ÊNot too creamy either, which I would like, but given you're already eating tons of meat and onions rings, it's nice to have something that's not completely bad for you. All in all, I would highly recommnend this place. ÊI Êhear Bludso's in LA/Long Beach is supposed to be somewhat comparably but not as good. PS Does Yelp really have a selection under ambience for "hipster crowd"?

The only reason I cannot give it 5 stars is because its unbearable to eat at this place. ÊI only order it to go now, and luckily I live nearby. ÊIf you have to come from far and eat in the restaurant, be prepared to stand in line for over an hour. ÊBrutal. ÊBut, the food is obviously top-shelf if so many people are willing to wait that long. ÊIf you can do to-go, its a win-win. ÊNo hassle with the mob and you still get your bomb grub.

The BBQ quality here is exceptional! I enjoy the dynamic vibe Phil's has to offer. It's fun, energetic, and the workers are extremely friendly. Of course, the line is the biggest issue, so I suggest going during off-hours. But when is that really? The place is perfect for groups cause they have a grip of flat screens around. They always play sports, so it's a perfect place for sports fans. I had their Baby Back Ribs Tickler for $6.75. It comes with 3 bones, a side of coleslaw, 2 huge onion rings and freshly cut fries. Honestly, it's the perfect size for one person, hungry or not. The BBQ sauce is to die for, the ribs are so tender and easy to eat. Don't forget to wear your bib with the pocket right side up (it'll help catch the food that falls over). I'm a fan of coleslaw so that's pretty good too. They have the Chick[en] Tickler too, but it's not as good as the ribs. Why would you even go to Phil's BBQ just to order chicken? Who does that? The last time I went, I ordered the BBQ Broham for $6.95, which is a sandwich with shredded pork, coleslaw and BBQ sauce. I ordered this only cause it looked so good when I quickly glanced at someone else's plate. However, when my food came I was surprised that it didn't come with a side order. (insert sad face) But the good thing about it is that they fill that sandwich UP! I actually had to eat the pork that fell out of the sandwich with a fork. EAT DAT POKE WITH A FOKE. But I will admit that it was definitely tiresome to be eating a sandwich filled with meat and meat, and, uhh, oh right more meat. I even had to mooch some fries off my sister's tickler just cause I was dying for something else other than meat. I will add, that they got these cool "sanitary door opener" in the bathrooms! Now you don't have to touch the door handle right after washing your hands! (Fyi, I don't touch the door handle. I use a paper towel. Don't yo mama teach you anything?)

First time at San Diego and first time at Phil's BBQ. I told my cousin that the wait better be worth it because I was STARVING!!! The wait wasn't as bad as I thought because my cousins were telling me that they had to wait like hours but we only had to wait about 45min. We ordered the Beefy Rib dinners which comes with two sides and one order of onion rings. While we were in line there were some workers coming by to say hello and make sure that the people weren't freezing in line. I expected Phil's to be like a sit down restaurant but it was more like order, get your food and sit down somewhere unless you had really big party then they let you reserve the table. The beef ribs were DELICIOUS!!!! OMG.... they were HUGE!! It came with five ribs, first I thought five ribs weren't going to do anything but after two...I was going to die. The sides that I got were the cole slaw and the fries and I ordered a side of caesar salad because I thought I would need fiber to flush it down.. (TMI sorry haha) I had to deduct a star for the caesar salad because it was WAYYY TOOO GARLIC-YYY I mean I like garlic but this tasted like PURE RAW GARLIC...omg no. hahahaha I had to keep drinking water to talk to my cousins. haha The tables all had sauces, hot sauces, salt, pepper, and this creole powder that I had no idea what it was but then found out it went really well with the fries. So when I think about ribs I always think of pork so I wasn't very "interested" but when I heard it were beef ribs I got EXCITED! It was juicy and big, it wasn't as fatty as I expected. The BBQ sauce wasn't too over powering so you had the beef meaty taste! The BBQ sauce kind of tasted spicy to me but I might have slathered the creole sauce all over but definitely it was good..and it was hard to admit but it was worth the wait. haha They have a hand washing station so you don't have to use those little hand wipes to wipe all the sauce off your hands. It is the only Êrib place that I ever tried but it was definitely delicious! I would come back but it's sooo farr :( I HAVE LEFT OVERS YAY! hahaha (is that gross?)

Okay, I'm not sure what all the hype is about... but I think Phil's is overrated. I WISH I could give a 3.5 stars, because it's not a 3 but not a 4 either. I'm glad I came here right when it opened so I didn't have to wait in line for hours because in all honesty, I don't think it's worth it to have to wait THAT long. I'm not gonna lie, the ribs are good... but I don't see anything special from Lucille's? The portions are big and the sides are good, but again.. I don't see anything super special! :( Also, I don't like the fact that you have to order and pay first then you get your food. What if you want more? Then you have to go back and wait in line?! Haha.

Tickler? ÊReally? ÊThis was more like a side splittin' guffaw! Phil's Baby Back Rib Tickler...3 Baby Back Ribs, 2 Onion Rings, Slaw and Fresh Cut Fries. ÊSounds like a decent size portion unlike the rest of the menu right?. ÊSo why is it when it came out my stomach suddenly felt like the size of a pea? ÊI tackled the ribs first and didn't even need to gnaw it off the bones as it fell right off. ÊIn between bites I had fork fulls of creamy crunchy slaw and I snuck a french fry in here and there. ÊI was doing pretty good but forgot the 2 steroidal onion rings. ÊI managed to fit one in before finally calling it quits, leaving a mound of fries and the boney remains of my ribs. Damn that was good!

I'll add one more review to the thousands already here. Phil's is phabulous. Really enjoyed the huge plate of baby back ribs, macaroni salad, and beans. The sauce, slathered thickly on the meat was light, tangy, and had just the right pepper kick. If you want, they will serve it on the side. The meat had just the right tug off the bone with enough of a hold to stay until you pulled it away from your mouth. They cook em over an open pit, resulting in a nice little bit of char and a slow cooked tendness. The whoopee pie to finish was also excellent and too big for one sitting. Phils was worth the 20 minute line (you wouldn't think twice about the same wait if there were not a line). I'd really love to go back and try the tri tip sandwich, but alas I'm 1800 miles away! No matter what though, Phil's is on my list any time I'm in san Diego. By the way, the state of California would like you to know that charcoal might cause cancer. But who wants to live longer without BBQ?

Typically if I had built up this amazing rib joint in my mind from all the people raving and claiming how amazing this place is I would probably give this place a 4. However this place unfortunately does not live up to the hype or the wait. I came on a Tuesday night adn the wait was seroiusly 35 min.. RIDICULOUS. Ribwise.. this place is probably one of the best places place i've gone to, given i'm not obsessed with ribs in the first place. The place is clean and a great place to have dinner. Portions are huge and the meat almost falls off the bone. The one thing I wish they worked on were the sides. They were all very mediocre. Nothing stood out to me. The coleslaw macaroni salad fries were all not very good. I'll probably come back to bring guests but overall I am not wowed by my experience.

I've heard rave reviews of this place so I had to go try it when i was down in SD. When they said the wait is long, they were not exaggerating. The line stretched from inside to all the way around the building and past other stores. Luckily we went into the take out line. Got in and out in about 15 minutes. Fuck yeah. Now onto the good part: - Ribs were amazing. Fall off the bone? We ate the bone -- it was that good. - Onion rings were huge as expected. Tasty but a little burnt on the outside. Just a tad. No biggie. - Baked beans. Legitttt. Never knew i could love baked beans so much. - Macaroni salad was not good tho. Too sweet. - Beef brisket sandwich - good but not as good as i was hoping. It was a little on the dry side. But they do pack that bish with a ton of meat. Side note: we ate our food on the side walk rite next to the parking lot. Most ghetto dinner ever but also one of the most delicious. I miss you Phil...whoever you are. Keep making your delicious BBQ!

Probably can't say anything that hasn't been said about Phil's before but I would just like to spazz about how great this place is! I come all the way out from LA just because I'm craving Phil's BBQ...and I bring all my friends! They're always skeptical because of the long wait that can take anywhere up to an hour or two during dinner hours. It's crazy but so worth it. The meat is so tender and falls right off the bones. You can't go wrong ordering anything here. My favorite sides are the coleslaw and the bake beans! yum yum yum. It's worth every penny. This should be a tourist destination! They even have the Phil's cam live online which is pretty cool. I also enjoy the people there. Last time I went I was talking to the lady who was controlling the line. She was talking about the QVC channel and still made it funny somehow. The atmosphere is always busy and you can see how much everyone is enjoying their food because everyone leaves their inhibitions at home and pigs out eating with their hands...well at least I do any ways. I feel so at home at Phil's!

I figured with so many reviews, I should definitely try Phil's before I leave town... so when I got called off from work tonight, I said now's as good a time as any. : ) I decided to call in my order and take it home (since I'm not a fan of sitting in a busy restaurant by myself). I went with the Baby Back Rib & Chicken Dinner Combo with fries & macaroni salad as my sides. I was glad that there was a separate line for phone order pickups. It took me 2 minutes to pick up my order. After 10 minutes drive home, I dove in to the deliciousness. The ribs were yummy as promised. The meat falls off the bones and melts in the mouth. The sauce was good, but as others have mentioned, I could use a little more of a spicy kick. The chicken was also not bad. It made my poor kitty salivate and beg while I dined. The macaroni salad was okay. The fries, unfortunately, did not survive the 10 minute drive home. They were lukewarm and soggy. Maybe they'll be better reheated?

This place is the best BBQ in San Diego that I know of. I've tried a lot of places around town and none of them compare to the prices and quality here at Phil's. Nothing but raves and rants about how good the food is here and the onion rings always make me drool just thinking about them. However, I don't here as often as I have the craving since sometimes the line can take an hour during dinner time. They really should open a Phil's somewhere else in the San Diego metropolitan area to ease the wait on those lines. One thing I learned is never drink soda while eating Phil's BBQ because you ruin the taste of the BBQ sauce. Their BBQ sauce is so intensely sweet, tangy and spicy that it would be a sin to add sugary sweet syrup like beverage while eating that sauce. A beer or water is the only thing my mouth will consider drinking while inside. Ê Also, they have a decent selection of taps that are mostly local micros.

Eat It or Beat It? **EAT IT!!** Took a trip down to SD with the family... and one of the main reasons was Phil's BBQ! What can I say... it sure as hell did not disappoint! Sure, there's a line... EXPECT a line, but it's so worth the wait! The prices are very very reasonable... anything and everything is priced under $20 and the meat quality was out of this world! A lot of the times, sketchy prices means sketchy meat... but Phil's quality is superb! How do I know? With a nice pull with your teeth, it comes right off the bone... CLEANLY! whoofff.... so good, so delicious, so juicy, full of flavor, a lil' of that charred meat... hot damn, I'd take a special trip to SD for this anyday! However, one small downfall are the sides... it's nothing really out of the ordinary, however, their red potatoes are pretty amazing compared to the rest of the sides. Nevertheless, the price, portion, and quality of BBQ overlooks the sub-par sides. CONCLUSION: 5 STARS, 5 STARS.... 5 STARS... It is a must try anytime you happen to be in the area! I guarantee Phil's BBQ will not disappoint! Order the combo items... it's a lot of food but no one ever complains about leftovers! :P EAT IT EAT IT EAT IT! All the way!

I have to agree with Forrest D. Phil's BBQ may be the best in San Diego, but as a native Texan, there are a few things I'm looking for in my BBQ. - The quantity of the sauce: It's gotta be great BBQ sauce- more on that later. And the meat has to either be smothered in sauce or there needs to be an extra side of sauce. And there's none of this business of charging extra for more sauce. The meat was "smothered" (so they claimed), but it was not. Not by my standards at least. - The taste of the sauce: I like my sauce a little tangy and a little sweet. This sauce was super vinegar-y, which is fine, but the look and the taste reminded me of a hot and sour sauce at a Chinese restaurant. - The meat: The sign of great BBQ for me isn't just the ribs/brisket/pulled pork, but also how tender they can make white meat chicken. The white meat (I'm not talking the chickless, but the actual bone-in) was not tender. It was more on the dry side, and it wasn't seasoned past the skin. And without additional sauce, this made the white meat hard to continue eating. The ribs on the other hand were fine. - The sides: We got the cole slaw and the baked beans. I'm used to BBQ baked beans. This was more soupy- it looked like lentil soup. The taste was interesting- I can't quite describe it, but I'm guessing it's not made with their BBQ sauce. The cole slaw was pretty good, probably better than some other slaws I've had. I do have to say that Phil's is super clean considering all the eating with the hands and sauce-smearing that's going on. They also have a hand washing station. And the service was awesome. Our order taker was super sweet, and the employees checked on us maybe three times during our meal. When we came at 12:30 on a Saturday, there wasn't a wait! We probably just got lucky. Don't get me wrong. The food was good. It just wasn't the best I've ever had. But I guess 3000+ beg to differ.

When I told my friends from UCSD during my recent visit back there that I hadn't been to Phil's yet, they immediately started screaming. How could I have attended UCSD for 4 years and never been to Phil's?? Even friends from Vancouver have been there. This place is internationally famous! I guess the stories of the lines always prevented me from wandering over there. But I was only in San Diego for a few days on this visit, which was my first visit back in 2 years. I decided it was worth waiting in line to see if this place was worth the hype. It was. I went for lunch on Sunday and only had to wait about 20 minutes, which isn't bad considering that's the typical wait at any good restaurant for dinner. There's a menu outside for newbies to analyze while waiting in line. You pay first at the booth and then get seated. If you have a large party the staff will kidnap, I mean, take one person to a table to save it for you. We got a nice booth table for my group of 7 and our orders came relatively quickly. I shared a half rack of baby back ribs with steamed veggies and stole some fries and an onion ring from others. I expected the steamed veggies to be overcooked and gross, but they were actually lightly steamed and still crunchy and quite good! I was impressed...it certainly made me feel less bad about eating ribs. The sauce is definitely the secret, it has a sort of tangy flavor that really makes the meat more delicious. And you can buy bottles of the BBQ sauce to go home. They also sell this sauce at the San Diego Costco! Now I regret not having gone in college. It's worth it.

Came here many times while I was in school down in SD. I have to say, definitely the best bbq I've ever had...the only thing I took a star off for was the price of the food, $20 for half bbq baby back ribs and a drink?! Definitely tried to stay clear of the place because I would have been an even more broke college student! Friendly staff, never had a complaint about them. Pretty quick line, even though it wraps around the building. There have been times where I've had to wait at least 45 minutes to just get to the doors, but after that the food comes out pretty quick.

ÊHowever, we were meeting friends and had to do the wait. ÊOne hour later, we ordered our food. ÊI truly do not understand why people wait this long for quite ordinary food.

So Phil's is insanely well known. ÊMy friends from Norcal (at least 400 miles away) came down and wanted to eat Phil's...insane. I've been here a few times and been very satisfied every single time. ÊI've always gone with some friends so the wait in line isn't too big of a deal. ÊI suggest going with some company 'cause the line is pretty long!

ÊBBQ places in general (at least from my experience) don't do chicken well. ÊAnd Phil's chicken isn't that great. ÊIt's not as dry as a desert, but it's not as moist as it could be. ÊBUT, then again you're going to a BBQ place so why would you get chicken anyways... Every single time I've gotten the baby back ribs. ÊThat's the way to go! Sorry guys, just not as big of a fan of the beef ribs. ÊI don't think the beef ribs compare to the baby back. The baby back ribs are insanely tender and succulent. ÊFalls right off the bone. ÊSo goood! The sauce is really good too. Sweet, spicy, tangy, mmm... And the sides are huge and filling. It's always impressive when someone can finish a full rack and all the sides. Big eaters are definitely welcomed at Phil's! Got to go back, it's been quite a while...

I recommended my friends to come here on Sunday, 3/18/2012, since they were visiting out of town and wanted to know a restaurant they just have to go to in San Diego. I love this place because it's a locally owned restaurant with a cozy but modern cabin feel to it, amazing service, and delicious food. It's one of my go to places in San Diego for BBQ. Notes for first timers: 1. It's better to come here before or way after normal lunch or dinner hours mainly because the line gets long. It goes pretty fast so don't get intimidated but it will wrap around and they even tell you a wait time (it's a sign at the corner of the building). If you're not sure how busy it is, take a peek at their live feed camera on their website. It's on only during business hours, but it'll give you an idea of how long it would take to be able to order. 2. Seating is generally not an issue. They will find a seat for you especially if you come in a large group. Just make sure to have someone sit there while everyone waits in line and orders so you don't lose your seat. 3. Everything is self service except for the cleanup. There is a station for plates, silverware, wet wipes, toothpicks, and bibs. A paper towel roll is located on the table and I would recommend grabbing one or two before you dig in because the ribs are going to make you want to dig in with both hands. 4. You can ask the pickup counter for extra BBQ sauce. 5. If you have a small party and the line is long, check the bar for seats. You can order food and eat there without waiting in line. First off, for the amount you get, it's a great deal. My friend and I split a full rack of baby back ribs with fries and coleslaw. This is my favorite mix mainly because the fresh cut fries are piled on high and the coleslaw adds a nice change in taste and texture in comparison to the ribs. The slightly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside fries are generally only good fresh, but aren't as crispy as I would like it. This time coleslaw came a bit thicker (I'm thinking a bit more mayo) this time and I wasn't a huge fan of it, but this could be an inconsistency. Although the sauce was a bit off, the coleslaw had nice crisp shreds of green and red cabbage and carrots with a nice flavor to it. The pork ribs are fall off the bone delicious and the BBQ sauce is finger licking good. Other notes about the food/sides: My friend liked the BBQ Broham (pulled pork) sandwich, but I never tried this myself. The beef ribs are tasty and big but a bit chewy. I've tried the chicken twice and both times it has come out dry. The beans come with a bit too much liquid and the flavor is just "okay". The corn is an entire corn, deliciously sweet, and piping hot. The onion rings are good, but rather oily and they tend to skimp on how many they give you (especially in comparison to the fries). I can't remember an exact description of the taste, but the potato salad and the macaroni salad are both good. I remember those two were my favorites for a while. I haven't had the sangria in a while, but I remember it was good. Overall, this is a great locally owned place to get BBQ in San Diego (I'm not going to compare it to any other county). The service is friendly and fast and the food is delicious and usually consistent. No complaints other than the overwhelming desire to bum rush to the front of the line to get to the food faster!

I feel like this place is what doozer buildings are to the Fraggles. ÊIt is addictive BBQ. ÊThe line is long, the prices are reasonable and the food is amazing. ÊI usually order the ribs with the chicken. ÊIt is so much food but not too much that I have to wear sweatpants to eat there. ÊI am overall not a huge BBQ fan but this place is heaven on a bone. ÊJust know you will have to wait, but it will be worth every minute unlike the circus circus buffet (or hometown buffet...or any buffet)

What can I say about Phils, they have the BEST ribs I have ever eaten at a resturant in my life! They are always consistent and always crazy delicious! The interior is what you would expect from a bbq joint and it does get busy quick on the weekends so I would recommend going early or be ready to wait in line for a while. I will always go to Phils to get my BBQ and it will probably get worse once they open their next location in Santee!

OMG! ÊPhil's BBQ has the best baby back ribs. ÊTheir BBQ sauce was sweet, not tart at all. ÊIt's just the way I like my BBQ sauces. ÊThe meat was tender and slid right off the bones. ÊIt was just perfect. ÊI had a chicken and baby back rib plate to share with my daughter. ÊWe could chose two sides so we chose fries and mac salad. ÊMy daughter loves mac salad, but she didn't prefer it. ÊBut Phil's is not known for their mac salads, it's known for their BBQ and the ribs, she loved it. ÊAn added bonus was the cajun spice seasoning for the fries. ÊIt was a right addition. ÊIf you are ever in San Diego, stop by Phil's BBQ. ÊTrust me, you'll have a great meal. ÊFinger-licking good meal.

I first was introduced to Phil's a little over 2 years ago and it is now my favorite BBQ joint down in Socal. I live in the bay area, which is already about 8 hours away, and on this visit to Phil's, I was actually visiting my best friend in Loma Linda who is also from Hawaii. Little did I know they opened a Phil's closer than the Point Luma one which was about 2 hours away! How disappointed I was coming to find this out along the way... -_- First off, I am honestly not sure when the line around the restaurant begins, BUT if you have internet near you and possibly a laptop (not sure if the software will be read on a phone), go to their website before heading down. They have a link called "BBQueue Cam." This link leads to you a live feed of the restaurant along with real time estimates of the wait along the areas AROUND the building. I would say my best friend and I waited about 20 to 30 minutes for lunch during the week of spring break. The staff was very nice. Because it was my best friend's first time here, she didn't know what to order. The lady at the door entrance greeting customers gladly helped us with that though. During this particular visit, I believe there was a Cubs game going on, and they had several flat screens playing it especially on the bar side of the restaurant. So I can tell this is a popular place for sports fans as well as foodies. Now to the good stuff, the FOOD! The baby back ribs are really good here! When you bite onto the meat, it falls right off the bone. So I ordered a a full baby back rib dinner with potato salad and sweet baked beans along with a side of onion rings. My mom alway told me that I ate with my eyes because I was definitely overwhelmed by the amount of food I ordered. The potato salad had a lot of flavor, but the sweet baked beans was a surprise to me. I have never tried it nor do I like beans on any occasion, but I was proven wrong. It was actually really good possibly because they were so sweet.

My review for Phil's BBQ has been long overdue. I've made the 1 hour 40 minute trip down to San Diego 6 times in the past year, 2 times specifically to eat at Phil's. The meat on the ribs comes right off the bone; the pulled pork in the BBQ Broham is juicy and not dry; the fries, slaw, & macaroni salad are must tries; and and the employees are ridiculously friendly. Long wait time, but for good reason. Chicken is dry, but can be cured with more BBQ sauce! I love Phil's! Still contemplating whether or not you should try this place out? Just read the other 3,520+ reviews...

What can I add that the other 3,500 reviews haven't? Look, we went there in a deer-headlights-in-the-eyes, out-ot-towner starvation fog. We weren't expecting much. I mean, think about it, how many times in your life have you heard, "This place has the best ribs!," and you go there and you're like, "Meh." Right? Right. This place has the best ribs. No, really. Incredible. The sides, the sauce, the.... yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm just repeating the previous 3,500 reviews, aren't I? So let me offer this to any newcomers: The place is, like, CRAZY BUSY, and when you come around to the entrance there's a line about two hundred people long and you'll think you're NEVER gonna get it. But, believe it or not, that line actually moves pretty fast and before you know it you'll be sitting down. Somehow they move an extraordinary amount of people through without you ever feeling hurried. I think it's because, if you break the menu down, they don't really have a lot of different foods on offer. It makes getting you your meal, and you moving along, that much easier. But really, the ribs are SPECTACULAR. We took the extras home and attacked 'em cold the next day like a pack of wild dogs. It've been scary if it hadn't been so DELICIOUS.

My all-time favorite restaurant in San Diego. Phil's should have a frequent customer discount card or something because I come here that often. While Phil's was closed for renovations, I went through the most intense cravings that led me to drive to the San Marcos location. I usually get the beef ribs, although their pork ribs are amazingly tender too. I love the barbeque sauce that are slaughtered all over those ribs and I like to dip my french fries into them. For sides, I have tried the french fries, coleslaw, and the corn and all were very tasty. When I venture to other items on the menu, I like to order the broham sandwich, which I prefer to the el toro. I want to try the chicken too, but I always feel myself being pulled towards those tantalizing ribs! Instead of waiting for the insanely long lines, call in your order ahead of time, go up to the shorter "phone-order" line, and pick up your order in less than ten minutes. Then eat everything and prepare to be induced in a very satisfying food coma.

Was in San Diego on business & a friend who lives locally suggested Phil's. Don't be dissuaded by the line waiting to get in, the wait is worth it. You know a BBQ place is on the right track when they have paper towels rolls on each table. I had the pulled pork sandwich, potato salad & a small order of onior rings (tip: two people can share the small order, it's huge). My only suggestion is to add corn bread to the menu.

You know that feeling when you go to eat with a group of friends and are yapping away and then finally the food comes and you all suddenly become eerily and strangely silent? And then one of your friends even starts crying and you know EXACTLY the reason why everyone isn't talking and crying? Yeah. You know what I'm talking about. And then you actually, for the first time in your life, don't mind the long line because of how much it enhances that moment when you feel that vibration. Yeah. You know what vibration im talking about. Yep, exactly.

For all those people in the Las Vegas vicinity: Phil's is in line to open a location sometime in the near future. Sing praises of Hallelujah, and pass the napkins! What this means to you: No more over priced, overly sweet BBQ! There shall be COMPETITION. Actually, Phil's is so heads and shoulders above any BBQ in Vegas there will BE NO competition. And the Phil's I went to, twice ( Hey, I was only there for two and a half days ), was everything I look for in great BBQ. It has generous portions of great tasting dishes for a reasonable price. Not easy to accomplish all three. So if Phil's does what it does best. Vegas will gain a BBQ winner. At this Phil's, I went once when it was just opening and once when it was a madhouse. And I hate lines! But remembering the juicy goodness, the mouth watering spicy pieces of BBQ wonder made me venture forth and actually not mind the snaking line. Even the sides are great here. The onion rings are fat and stay together when you bite them. The fries where simple and done just crispy right. The slaw is a good counter pause to the tangy BBQ sauce. The sandwiches are these heaping mountains of meaty heaven. The chicken is plump and tasty. And the Pork and Beef are the penultimate BBQ meats. Go baby backs or go home. This is a Nirvana of Fats and Meats and Sauce. But can they keep the prices down in Vegas? Rent is high and location could be a problem. Can they keep the right atmosphere? Outdoor seating may be problematic. Can they keep the same caliber of food? Vegas is smack dab in hellish desert. This all remains to be seen. I hope they do it and do it right. Otherwise, every chance I get to be in the San Diego area. I'm going to Phil's. As often as I can.

Who waited in line for 1 hour 30 mins in line? ÊOhhh.. me! ÊThe wait time to get seated felt longer than it did when I waited in line for the new Nintendo Wii when it first came out! ÊMaybe the hunger kicking after 30 mins of waiting and the aroma of the BBQ in the air made it a killer wait. Ê I was in San Diego for my annual 2 or 3 Chargers game a year and since I discovered Yelp early this year II found this comfortable place!

I highly recommend this BBQ joint if you are in the San Diego Area. Anywhere near the beaches or Sports Arena. Really good BBQ spot. It's actually on my top 3 places to eat BBQ. And is the best in San Diego! When I lived in San Diego I would eat here at least once a week. The bar seating is the best place to sit. Lots of TV's. When it's really busy, the bar is a key place to eat. They take your order at the bar so you really don't have to wait in line. I always get the same thing when I eat here. I get the Rib Tickler & the El Toro. The Rib Tickler consists of 3 baby backs & 1 large onion ring. The ribs are tender & savory. The onion ring is crunchy and really good with the buttermilk sauce (ask for it). The El Toro is my favorite item there. It's a tri-tip sandwich on a bun. The beef is really tender & not fatty at all. They put plenty of BBQ sauce on it & a lot of meat. There's so much meat on the El Toro that there's enough to eat with a fork when the sandwich is done. The BBQ sauce tastes really good too. Sweet and savory & has a unique flavor. They sell it in the restaurant. Although, I've also seen it for sale at the local Costco at a better price.

Not sure where to start! Lines are long, so anytime you show up, expect to wait. Not a problem though, I knew to expect that. What I didn't expect was the place being packed like a sardine can. Not a lot of room to move around, horrible to maneuver a small/compact stroller and rude people in a rush to get their to go orders out the door. I would hate to see the chaos if there was an emergency evacuation. Now the food. I ordered the brisket sandwich, a side order of fries and the pork ribs/ boneless chicken plate with steamed veggies and sauce on the side. -The brisket was an odd shade of red. Not smoke ring red, but something artificial. Most people have sauce on their sandwich, so maybe they don't notice. Looks like the brisket was soaked in some kind of color/flavor solution. The smokey flavor I expect from brisket was sadly missing. The meat was shaved thin and tender, but it didn't have that meaty, smokey flavor I enjoy in a good brisket. -The chicken was really difficult to cut with the knives they provided. It was rubbery! It didn't have much flavor and I couldn't stomach the texture and spit it out. -The veggies on the side were supposed to be steamed, hardly. I wouldn't even call them blanched. The broccoli and cauliflower were tough and the carrots were just as bad. Zucchini and yellow squash were decent, not too crunchy, but not soggy either. -The fries were soggy and needed to be heavily doused with malt vinegar to make them edible by my kids. -The pork ribs were the only redeeming part of the whole meal. They were tender, fall off the bone and flavorful. With sauce on the side, I was able to control the amount of tang I wanted. And yes their sauce is TANGY! It would be great if they had bottles of extra sauce on the tables though. While in line, the humane society was doing a March promo with a dog they have at the center. The dog was gentle and they even asked for pictures of my friends son and the dog. Even if I wasn't impressed with the food, I was impressed with the passion Phil has for man's best friend and I enjoyed seeing that first hand. I'll be willing to go back and give Phil's a second chance, but I'm not hopeful.

This place sucks! Ê I called beforehand since I saw that veggie burgers take at least 15 minutes to make on their online menu. ÊThe guy who I talked to couldn't take my order beforehand because he said the grills weren't fired up yet (I called like 10 minutes before they actually opened) but that it would be only like 10 minutes of a wait for the veggie burger. Ê When we got there there was already a line but it did move quickly, you are treated like cattle, a lady sitting on a stool letting you know when you can move from the line to the cash registers to order. ÊWhen I got to the cash register I placed my veggie burger order and she said it would be "at least 20 minutes" I told her I called ahead of time and she said well I don't know why they would tell you it would only take 10 minutes. ÊCustomer service sucks here. ÊPlus why would it take 20 minutes to make a damn veggie burger? ÊWe ended up leaving and going to eat somewhere else.

Hmm..trying to figure out what the hype is all about. ÊThe food here is good, but it's not worth the wait in line (the line moves faster than you think...it took about 30 minutes to get our food). ÊTip: if it's your bday, you can cut the line (we had a bday person, but didn't know that!) Ate here for a snack so ordered a "tickler," which is basically a small combo: 2 onion rings, 5 babyback ribs, coleslaw, fries. ÊAlso had a bite of friend's pulled pork sandwich. ÊI thought the pulled pork sandwich was too saucy, but it's pretty decent. ÊThe babyback ribs are very tender (liked it more than the pulled pork), but the bbq sauce was too thick & sweet for my taste. (I'm comparing it to Texas style bbq, which is more of my preference). ÊOnion rings were too greasy, yet not even crunchy. ÊSlaw was decent and fries would have been better if they were hot (similar tasting and style to in & out fries). Overall, food is ok...if you like thick, sweet bbq sauce then you will love Phil's...but if you like the lighter, tangier sauce style of Texas (like me), then u will think this place is overhyped.

Wow, where to begin. I guess I'll start off with the atmosphere. This place is your classic BBQ restaurant, with that classic look, some nice blues playing in the background, and everyone grubbin' down on some great BBQ without a worry of getting dirty. It cannot get any better than this as far as atmosphere goes. However, this is the part that least concerns me, since I'm all about the food and service, so I'll move on. The wait. Not much too say about this, except that if you go to the San Diego location, expect to wait more than 20 minutes if you're going around dinner time. However, the San Marcos location is never crowded, and it's closer to me, so I usually always go there. Next, the service. Both this location and the San Marcos location have AWESOME service. First, when you enter, the host at the front is always friendly and makes conversation, asks you if it is your first time, and then sends you up to a register. Then the cashier, who is also very friendly (who isn't here?), takes your order and gives you a pager so you can pick up your food when it's ready. Don't worry, if you order many plates, they will help bring it to you! Lastly, I'd just like to mention that Phil's gives all of their employees the authority to handle everything in almost all cases. That's why everyone is so happy here. They always come up to you while you're eating and ask you if you need anything - more BBQ (which is WARM by the way!), Ranch (yes this is free if you ask for it after you order), and will even refill your drink for you! Overall, the service is excellent and I can't complain. Now, the price. I have to say, Phil's prices are extremely cheap for the portions they give you. A Sandwich is $6.95, but mind you, it is piled high with meat, and practically a moat of meat around the sandwich. I will talk about the food later on, save the best for last :). Overall, the prices are very fair and affordable. You can expect to spend from $5 to $20 for a dinner, but the latter being only if you're a huge eater. I'm a huge eater and can go home stuffed for $10 of food! Now, the best of all. The food! I need to say right off the bat that the Broham is absolutely delicious! It is a pulled pork sandwich made from pork shoulder that is extremely tender and practically melts in your mouth. It's drenched in BBQ, put in a toasted bun, and topped with coleslaw (I always get this on the side), all for $6.95! This and large fries (which is $2.25 and serves 5, but 1 if you're me :) ) is around $10 and fills me up for sure! I have tried mostly everything here, including both types of ribs, the chicken, and the tri-tip, and while all are GREAT, nothing can compare to the flavor of the Broham. Not to mention the generous portions of everything. Lastly, their BBQ sauce is the best I have ever tried. Words can't describe it. It has a hint of spiciness, it's very sweet, and after debate with many of my friends, we are certain their is a hint of apple/cinnamon in this. I swear, we can taste it! Other things I enjoy are the onion rings (I normally hate onion rings) because they are huge which means more batter! Also the fries + the BBQ sauce is just awesome. The only thing is, Phil's doesn't have a food challenge! I wish they did, because I feel like it would attract even more people! They were already on Man Vs. Food, but not for a food challenge. Oh well, one can only hope! Overall, Phil's deserves the 5 stars and I am pleased that it made the top restaurants of 2011. Special shout out to Jessica S. at the San Marcos location for excellent service :)

Phil's BBQ is a San Diego Tradition and hot spot for all tourists because it is the best BBQ ever!!! ÊIt is always a difficult decision on what to order because everything is so darn delicious. ÊI think my favorite item are the ribs with a side of onion rings and coleslaw! The line is so completely long and ridiculous all summer long.

I'm not mad at Phil - whoever he is. ...The deal here is the tang in the sauce. The sauce is tangy to the 15th power. It's on some Tony Roma's ish. The baby back ribs I had were fully cooked and then quick fire-grilled I'm guessing. They slather on the sauce and the next thing you know ol Phil's a millionaire! Go here.

Whenever I visit home I make an effort to get over here. Been here many times and haven't had one bad experience, they consistently make my baby back ribs + sides taste amazing. The line at this place can get pretty long at peak hours, but can't hold that against the restaurant. It's also a seat yourself sort of deal which surprisingly enough has worked out every time even on packed days. They'll help you out if your group is larger than normal. The workers are polite and very helpful, especially when your buzzer rings and you don't have enough hands to carry all those tasty plates. Oh yeah.. and it was featured on Man V. Food.

I was pleasantly surprised by this place. I ordered the boneless ribs with macaroni salad and baked beans. Really great. The ribs were very tender and tasty, some, however, were a little dry but most of what was on my plate was great. ÊThe onion rings were soft and buttery with just the right amount of crunch. We waited in a line that moved surprisingly fast and the food was done in 10 minutes. It was our first time there and the staff was very welcoming and helpful.

I can't sing the praises of this place enough. I'm not a huge BBQ fan, so it better be good or I will be disappointed. If beef ribs are on the menu, you know that's what I'm ordering. It's what I grew up eating at home and I love them. These were fall of the bone delicious! The meat was tender and seasoned perfectly. We also tried the BBQ beans, potato salad and onion rings. Everything was great. The sides weren't my favorite, but they were still pretty good. I'll be getting the corn on the cobb next time I'm in town, but I'll definitely be back. This place gets packed (duh) so timing is everything. We got here just before the line got long around 5:30 on a Friday evening. There isn't much to be said that thousands of other people haven't said before me, but this place is no joke. Definitely lives up to the hype and worth every penny, although they are very reasonably priced and centrally located. YUM!

Good and Tasty BBQ I would do take out and never wait in that line. The line was out into the parking lot and around the building. Amazing, that you can walk right to the front (left side)and get your BBQ in about 5 minutes and eat wherever, or wait for like an hour and eat inside, kinda silly. Get the Pork Ribs, I felt they were much better than the burnt beef ribs. Also were more tender and less fatty. The chicken was very good. Even the sides were really nice. Good corn in December? You bet.. Veggies Good. Small menu but they seem to do it right. More sauce options would also be good. Next time in San Diego we will try some other BBQ joints.

I was a bit skeptical about this place initially. ÊI've been to some of Man vs Food spots and have been very disappointed. ÊSo with great reviews and all this hype, it had a lot to live up to. ÊAnd of course, I had mentally prepared for a 1hr+ wait, wondering how my 3 nieces and nephews would cope. When I walked in, I was pleasantly surprised to see how efficient and clean this place was. ÊYou line up, order your food and find a seat. ÊWe ordered 2 full racks of baby back ribs with side orders that were the size of full plates. ÊThe ribs were served in about 5-10 min. Ê These ribs were smoky, tender with a sauce that was not too sweet nor overwhelming. ÊIt's so finger licking good that they installed a sanitary door opener in the restroom! ÊI am so impressed, I wish they would have this at every restaurant. Ê(see pic) There's also a bar where you can get beer on tap. The staff constantly came over to check up on us to see if we needed anything and how everything tasted. Great food, friendly smiling staff, clean, fast and painless. ÊBring your kids and other people's kids, it's going to be a hit. Ê I just wish there was one in the OC. ÊI still dream of these ribs so I Êshall make another hour drive soon to make it a reality.

Phil's BBQ is simply excellent all around. ÊI have been here over 30 times and tried just about every food item except for the salad. Ê Everything is delicious... Last night my wife and I went to Phil's and had our usual, a 3 beefy rib plate with corn a 1/2 chicken plate with slaw and beans, sangria for the lady, and a couple beers for me, all for under $40. ÊThe food was delicious. ÊThe sides were good, the chicken was juicy, and my teeth were tearing through the ribs with ease. ÊThe BBQ sauce is mouthwatering good and complements the different meats. Perhaps the best thing about Phil's is the service. ÊIt can only be defined as exceptional. ÊThe staff is friendly, polite, and they will do everything they can to make you happy while you are there. The one problem with Phil's is the crowds, but this is a problem that any great restaurant will have. ÊIf you're worried about a crowd, check their web cam before you go (and enjoy the squeaking pig on their website), or go a little early/late for dinner and you'll be fine. ÊCan't do that? ÊThen phone in an order to go. Overall, Phil's is an outstanding BBQ. ÊNow, I've heard people say that Ê"Phil's isn't as good as my favorite place in (Texas or KC or etc)" ÊWhile that might be true, it is hardly helpful or relevant to a BBQ discussion about San Diego. Ê 4 star food 5 star service

3,000+ San Diegans, plus Food Network, can't be wrong: Phil cooks up some amaaaazing BBQ. First off, I'm ridiculously picky about BBQ sauce. Phil's has it down: spicy, a little sweet, laced with vinegar. It's perfect. Then they slather it on perfectly smoked meat: their pulled pork, in particular, is succulent and tender and delicious. Their brisket is hit-or-miss, but when it's good it's pretty much the best thing in San Diego. Folks, there's a reason the line wraps around the entire strip mall. It's literally THAT GOOD. However, if you live nearby and don't want to wait, they allow call-ahead take out orders. And then you get to go straight to the head of the line. Which, honestly, makes it worth five stars right there.

After the disaster meal I had at Smokin Bulls BBQ, we needed to have our faith in BBQ renewed, so we went to Phil's. We waited outside in a line for about 10 minutes...Whhhhhaaaaaa waaaaaaaa!!! People waiting!! Hahahaha, there's a reason for that! We chatted with people in line who were also looking forward to their meal. We have been going to Phil's since they were on Goldfinch, and we waited in a line there!! Good things don't change, or, you hope they don't. Once inside, we ordered a Pork Rib Tickler and a Beef Rib meal....for a total of less than what we paid for at Smokin' Bulls. Our meal arrived in just minutes. The pork ribs were just the way I like them. Moist, flavorful and covered in Phil's tangy BBQ sauce. I ate my onion rings first, with some Ranch dressing, then the ribs, with the fries. The beef ribs were delicious and huge. In all, another fantastic meal at Phil's. Phil's still is my favorite BBQ place in San Diego.

Let's be honest for a minute here... I have been known to harp about Vegan this, Vegan that... but as human's we have evolved into meat eating creatures... If your working out at all.. Meat is a must. Beans dont cut it for protein. Nevermind how friggin tastey it is. I never understood how a man could forego bacon for any reason anyway. Im working in the area & I'm back in town for the long haul it seems. Phil's has always been good. Stopped in before visiting friends & I got the baked beans with the ribs. The friggin sauce is grub. Soppin it up with a biscuit. Corn on the cob.. Yup...Beer's good. Too bad they dont make a BBQ sauce flavored beer. Probably the best BBQ in town. Check it out.. No need to call Phil for an appointment, drop in & git you some... Oh, try not to wear a white T shirt...

It was my first time ever going/eating there and it was very good. ÊYou just have to accept the fact that you'll be waiting in line between 20-40 minutes. ÊI used to get scared of those long lines outside, but really, it's not too bad. Ê The overall atmosphere is pretty cool. ÊWe actually ended up cutting the line and eating in the bar area so we got a waiter (I believe you order your own food, pick it up, and find a table if you're in the general area). ÊThe waiter was very nice and the food was quick to get to our table. ÊI think they prepare so much food in advance that they literally just take what you want and put it on a plate so the wait time is about five minutes. The overall food was good. ÊWas it as great as I thought and as everyone had hyped? ÊNot really. ÊIt was just chicken and baby back ribs with barbecue sauce. ÊI think everyone just enjoys the overall experience, which, I enjoyed, too, so it gets a four.

I'm not too partial to BBQ but damn, this place has good BBQ. Their BBQ sauce was one of the best I think I've ever had - sweet but not too sweet, smokey but not too smokey and just a HINT of tang. The full rack of ribs fell off the bone with meat so tender you barely have to chew it - cooked to perfection. Their sides not to mention were phenomenal as well. I really liked their coleslaw which contrasted nicely with the incredibly savory meat. It was also nice that they had rolls of paper towels everywhere for easy clean up and take-out containers located at a spot easy for anyone to grab and go. A great family restaurant or a chill hangout to kick it with your buddies.

This is the highest rated place in San Diego and one of the highest rated in the nation. Don't be too intimidated by the line- ours was to the parking lot and we were ordering in 40 minutes and food comes flying out of their well oiled kitchen. Come on off hours if you can. When we were leaving (near closing) there wasn't much of a line. Still, I thought the food was worth the wait. Yes, it's fall off the bone and I expected that of the baby back ribs, but shocked that the beef ribs are too. I have never had a beef rib that was so skillfully cooked to a crispy char on the outside and tender meat inside. The dual textures was awesome! Even most other awarded BBQ places fall short on beef ribs and I never bother to order them at most places. We also had the chicken which was also pretty decent. Potato salad, macaroni salad and baked beans were solid with the beans being the star (coming from someone who isn't a bean person). They only have one type of sauce and I liked it but it's rather tangy so keep that in mind if you're a sweet sauce type person. I love sauce variety so next time I would bring myself some sweet sauce and a spicy one. Service is friendly. The prices are very reasonable (we got a 2 beef rib/ 4th chicken combo- Ê$12.45 and half baby back combo- $13.25) for a lot of food. We could not finish the food and took the rest back to our hotel for late night snack eats. If you haven't ever liked beef ribs, this may be the place to try it and see if it changes your mind. It's definitely the star for me. I now believe in the hype!

OMG This was love at first sight! I visited San Diego the first time by myself and I came here for lunch with a really good buddy. I asked him to take me to his favorite place to eat in the SD. He drove me to this joint where parking is not impossible to find but the lines were ridiculous! It was a Thursday around 2pm time and the line wrapped around the restaurant. BUT the line moves pretty fast. The servers and the staff were so nice, the lady that took my order kindly summarize the menu and recommended something that was delicious and inexpensive. I chose the babyback ribs OF COURSE! The ribs were not completely off the bone, but tender enough for you to bite into. The fries and the coleslaw completed the meal with the perfect blend of crisp and crunch. I have to definitely visit this place again. I think everyone from socal knows this joint. BUT Norcal, you must try! You will not be disappointed. I think the babyback ribs will be a safe choice! But I am sure if you ask the staff they can recommend with something delicious as well.

It's very simple, just eat at Phil's. If you go for lunch get the El Toro, best bang for your buck. Any time you want a full meal the ribs are amazing, but I honestly can't go without their chicken. BEEFY RIBS AND CHICKLESS DINNER PLEASE! You'll get much more meat from the 20 cent difference of the beefy ribs over the baby back. If you don't like beef ribs this tip isn't going to help you out though haha. If you've never been to Phil's and are in San Diego often, you cannot miss out on this joint!

If you have never had BBQ before or if you are seasoned veteran, this place has the MOST amazing baby back ribs ever! ÊMy husband is from Texas, so BBQ is not a new thing for us. ÊI have to say the best compliment to Phil's is that we rate ALL baby back ribs to theirs. ÊTexas doesn't beat them. So onto why I only gave four stars. ÊThe line is ALWAYS long. ÊIf I had a line that long, all the time, I would get the hint that I needed to either expand, which they can't because the parking is so slim as it is and they share a lot, or build a second establishment, because obviously it would have business. ÊIt also SUPER loud there all the time. ÊI mean always. ÊI have two kids and one on the way, so I'm not all about waiting in a line. The way they do things work really well though. ÊYou walk up the restaurant, stand in line, a nice person takes your really long order, because you absolutely have to get the onion rings. ÊI mean it... ÊThen you find a table, yourself. ÊRemember to go get your own plates, forks, napkin and drink. ÊThey also have bibs, wippees and paper towels. ÊSuch a great idea. ÊYou wait till your number is called or your buzzer rings and you go get your food. Ê The bussers that run around are super nice and if it's your birthday (which we came for my hubby's a few years ago) they will hide a cake, cut it up and come sing with your family. ÊThe bussers are really amazing actually and unlike some places, seriously deserve a tip for all the stuff they do while you are there. Ê Lucille's is pretty good, but it doesn't beat Phil's any day of the week. Ê PS. ÊIf you don't like pepper in the beans, don't get theirs.

http://www.yelp.com/biz_É Seriously. I don't even like bbq, but i had to come here. I just had to get a taste of those ribs that make people wait in crazy lines. Luckily, even on a saturday lunch time, the line was oddly short and only waited about 15 minutes. Craig R even caught me on the webcam going in! http://www.yelp.com/biz_É Since we JUST HAD BRUNCH literally about 30 min before coming here, we had just enough room to share a big platter of food. My friend Ken C had a huge smile on his face, so he must have liked the ribs alot. Dude on the other hand had mixed feelings on these ribs (he was more impressed by the sanitary handle on the restroom doors!), but both of them agreed that adding the magic spices made them even better. If bbq sauce in general didn't make me feel nauseous , i wouldve eaten more- those ribs were mighty tasty. The fries i could do without, and sadly, i could do with out the mighty onion rings too. The batter was too thick for my liking.potato salad was awesome. But man was i excited when i saw this. http://www.yelp.com/biz_É I'm a sweet tea addict and i wish i had one of these at my office.

I brought a couple friends here on a rainy Sunday night. As usual, the the line was long so I thought either people don't cook on Sundays or Phil's BBQ is just too irresistible. I reassured them that their patience will be paid off in no time. Plus, this is an iconic and integral part of San Diego just like California burritos. By the way, the last time I was here, it was not an enjoyable experience. A compilation of bad service, loud crowds, cold and dry food at Phil's was unacceptable. I was hoping Phil's would reclaim its top spot as the best BBQ restaurant. I ordered the 3 bone beef dinner with fries and sweet baked beans AND the BBQ Broham sandwich. Go big or go home right? The giant beef ribs were cooked to perfection! The charred ribs were glazed with Phil's BBQ sauce and it was absolutely amazing! The meat was so tender that you can pull it right off the bone with just the tips of your teeth. DROOL! Now, I will reserve this paragraph just for the BBQ Broham sandwich. I'm not a fan of pulled pork but I was drawn to this sandwich for some reason or another. I kept reading the small print over and over, "seasoned and char-grilled, on a bed of Cole Slaw topped with BBQ sauce". BOY! I could have never been so right! In between the buns was a generous portion of pulled pork and a bed of of Cole Slaw. The smokey BBQ flavor paired well with the sweet slaw. I became a believer tonight and I will jump on the Phil's BBQ bandwagon. Just too irresistible! I will come back here rain or shine and get a complete fix for my cravings.

5.3.1. Five napkins. Three Wet naps. One bib. These are all the things that I needed to eat this amazing meal. We had heard about the wait at Phil's but decided to risk it anyway because we were dying to try it! We went at about 430 on a Friday and the wait was only about 20 minutes. Which according to everyone was awesome. Once inside, you are asked to order your food first then go find a place to sit. If you have a larger party, some people can order and the rest can go sit. I ordered the El Toro sandwich (Tri-tip & BBQ sauce) and my bf got The Best of Both (Chicken & Baby back ribs). On most meals you can either get two small sides or one large side. He decided to get the basked beans and french fries. Our food was ready relatively quickly and once I saw our plates I knew that we were in for the best BBQ of our liiiives. And I was right. The meat Êwas spilling out of my sandwich and literally filled the whole plate. Usually when theres high quantity there is low quality but this was CERTAINLY not the case at Phil's! The tri-trip was gahdamn perfect. And don't get me started on the BBQ sauce....SO GOOD. It was the perfect blend of spicy and sweet. I managed to sneak a few bites of my bf's meal as well...and his plate was just as good! There was more than enough fries and baked beans! Two people could easily share them! (which we did!) Do yourself a favor and ask them to add their sauce to your sides. I'm not sure if it's free (I didn't notice it until after =/) but it will be worth it! We accidentally ended up with "BBQ fries" and I was so glad we did!! Bottom line: Phil's is the best BBQ I've ever had! They serve you quality food at a more-than-reasonable price! Between this and the Hash House, San Diego sure was good to us. :)

Phil's BBQ... the Legend, the Hype, the Truth? Was down in San Diego for a convention and had to try this place out. ÊI figure, over 3k+ review with the average 4.5 stars rating couldn't be wrong right? ÊWell... not to sound snobby or even un-educated in the subject of BBQology, my thoughts on this experience was only well.....fair. ÊYes... you read it correctly... fair... but before you lynch mob me with pitch forks, please hear me out... Let's start from the beginning... Line out the door! ÊMadness! ÊOut the building, around the front, wrapped around the sides, a total BLACK FRIDAY feel to it! ÊHow crazy is this? ÊTalked to the friendly cashier inside and she said that it's like this on a daily basis... WOW! ÊPhil's loyal legion of BBQ devourers on the move! ÊThat's a great sight to see in this horrible economy. Since we were in the subject of talking to the cashier, overall the service was top notch. ÊStarting from the nice phone call and awesome help by one of the cashiers/operators, going in for a pick up and ordering on spot was definitely the way to go. ÊThe friendliness definitely shows and it seems like despite the chaos at Phil's, everyone seem to be having a good time working there servicing all these patrons. ÊOh, and the wait time was much less than stated... I was told 10-15 minutes for pick up but it was more like 7 minutes...GREAT! Dcor was decent... It's a BBQ joint what do you expect? ÊLocation is nice with ample amount of parking but based on the look of things doesn't matter if Phil's owns the nearby Sports Arena (I'm assuming?) ÊThat will still fill up with ease. Food... oh oh... here is where I'm gonna get hammered by the loyal legion army of Phil's. Êgot 2 things on this trip because I wanted to sample the favorites... Broham! ÊHuge pull pork sandwich! ÊDecent flavor but it was much too dry for me... ÊPerhaps the meat is more lean than expected and the sauce was lightly drizzled? Ê(I actually liked the fact there isn't so much of the sauce but the pull pork gotta have some fat to make it juicy!) ÊBut for under $8 bucks it's definitely a great deal! Pork Rib tickler: ÊSmaller version of the regular pork ribs, tender off the bone delicious! ÊBUT......... Tender off the bone is to be expected from any famous BBQ joint so that is a required criteria. ÊThe sauce however, was much too tangy for me to handle because I'm so used to the sweetened version locally. ÊIf the sauce was less tangy and kept the light sweetness, I can see it being amazing. Sides: ÊOnion rings was ok but I definitely like the fact it was freshly fried, and the cole slaw wasn't mushy and was very delicious! Ê So why did I give it a 4 star despite my worries about getting mobbed by the fans? ÊWell... too many 4.5s really made me feel bad... the service and overall experience was definitely but the food definitely not worth "my wait" for over an hour. ÊHere are the breakdowns. ÊService: 5 Ê Location: 4 Ê Dcor Ambience: 4 Ê Food: 3 Ê Average = 4. Would I come back? ÊYes... if the line is much shorter and bearable.... But if you are a visitor like me, do have to check this place out! ÊThe scene there will amaze you!

Love. The baby back ribs are sooo tender, melt in your mouth! The bbq sauce is perfect. Not too sweet, not too strong & salty. They serve the biggest onion rings you've ever seen! I went on a Sunday around 530pm & waited about 20 minutes. By 6pm, the line was around the corner of the building! It is definitely worth it though! I recommend splitting the baby back rib plate with fries, beans, & a side of onion rings with someone else (or two). We did not even finish it all, but I tried & kept eating...still stuffed 2 days later lol!

I have found my favorite place to eat BBQ. The only disappointment to me is that I have not been there as soon. Phil's BBQ in San Diego, California is best hands down from their finger licking ribs, to their over the top filling tri- tip . It is delicious!! Ever since I was a child I spent my vacation with my family in SD. To get to the downtown Gaslamp District, I would pass this BBQ spot. The line would wrap around the building just to get inside. Last year my mother demanded that we must investigate the hype of this Phil's BBQ. We arrive in the late lunch period of time before dinner and we recognized there is still a crowd outside the build just to eat with markings on the wall posting: 10 Minutes and 45 Seconds from this Point. Although the wait is long, it is definitely well worth it. I have a huge problem with most BBQ I have eaten do to this fact the inside of it is usually dry. If it is moist, the smell of BBQ does not exist in the taste. It turns normally out as false advertisement. I ordered the El Toro which is the tri-tip Sandwich with an order of colossal onion rings. As well I had tried some of the ribs. I sit and at my table hungry and ready for the big anticipation. It was delicious. No, more than delicious, it lived up to all my expectations in BBQ. From the smokiness, and the hickory taste of BBQ going straight through, it is the best juiciest BBQ I have eaten. The colossal onion rings were huge and super addicting. I could of probably eaten them on my own because they were so huge. This place a 5 out of 5 stars to me due to the fact I never had better BBQ. If your in San Diego I highly recommend to go to Phil's BBQ. It is a well worthy food coma you deserve.

It was my first time at the restaurant and it will be the last. I brought my Family of 5 after ordering we walked around looking for seating which there was none for a group of 5 except the large booths. Those booths had a sign reserving for 6+ or outside in the cold. When we attempted to seat at the only table that would accommodate us, we were told we could not sit there as they had a large party waiting in line. Really a party waiting in line rated a table while my family and I were told we could sit outside or add a chair in the isle. This was explained to us by the Manager that this was their policy so if someone has a family of 5 we need to eat outside in 60 degree weather or block the isle way or we could get a refund and leave. On top of that our order was mixed up and we had to go back up to get the side my son had ordered. That will be the last $85 you company will see from us and I will be writing my review on Yelp as well. The Manager and sitting staff were rude and not accommodating to us but yet accommodate a larger group who was still in line. I wrote a comment on their website which the General Manager called me a few minutes ago trying to give us a free meal with priority seating. As if I wanted to go back and make some other family have to wait because we now have priority seating for one meal. He tried to say their policy is "First come First serve" unless your a party of 5 because they don't have seating for 5. It boils down to the larger parties will order more so they must have a seat before they even order their food. The food was OK not horrible but not fantastic either, but after being treated like that I guess I should call the local Fire Department and let them know that Phil's is blocking isle ways with customers because they only have 5 people.

I came here twice...one of the best BBQ places I've been to. ÊHowever, I had a few issues with the place and thought i should give you guys fair warning. The minor issues: the line is usually pretty long and the wait for food seems just as long if you're starving but is worth it for the food The major issues: A pitcher of sangria is $20 while a glass is $5. ÊI ordered a pitcher but for some reason the bartender didn't hear me and proceeded to fill 2 glasses with sangria. ÊWhen I corrected her as she was filling up the second cup, she shrugged and poured the glass and a half into a pitcher, filled it with another scoop of ice and handed me the pitcher. WHAAT?! ÊSo I just paid $20 for something that should've cost me $7.50 (equivalent to a glass and a half of sangria). ÊI'm not sure if this was a good or bad thing as the sangria tasted horrible as well. Moral of the story: DONT ORDER THE SANGRIA and if you must...ORDER BY THE GLASS.

Best BBQ in California, hands down. Be prepared to wait in line for a while if you go at peak hours, otherwise try going between 2 and 4 to avoid a line, or get take out. The beef ribs, Chicken, Mac salad, and woopie pies. Can't beat them.

This place is really famous for their bbq in san diego, but I don't think it is 4 or 5 star worthy. I do like their ribs here, but I have to say that I have had better bbq elsewhere. But the sauce they use for their ribs is delicious, so it is worth coming here for that. A side note, there is usually a really long line, so if you want to save time, you can call in your order ahead of time and just pick it up to go instead. I have done that on occasion because I hate waiting in line!

Totally turned off by the long line (which wrapped around the side of the restaurant), I noticed the super SHORT LINE for To-Go/Phone Orders. They said that it would take only 15 mins, so of course the BF and I got in line. Full Rib Dinner (10-12 ribs) $18.95 w/ 2 small sides (macaroni salad, cole slaw)- the sauce has a nice kick to it. the ribs are cooked to perfection, and definitely fell off the bone. the sides were pretty normal, and nothing spectacular. Half BBQ Chicken $6.96- also had the same sauce. i was afraid the chicken would be dry, but it also cooked to perfection. Small Onion Rings $3.95- for the small size, it was a lot more than i expected. BEST onion rings i've had so far. The place was PACKED on a Saturday night. So either arrive early, phone in, or order to-go. Definitely worth visiting if coming to San Diego. Scratch that...it's a MANDATORY visit.

Its ok. The BB ribs were really good, almost worth the wait. The sides were mediocre. The staff was great. The salad was awful. I know, thats what I get for ordering salad at a BBQ place. The bbq sauce was.a little spicy for my taste, but still good, only one flavor sauce. Regular fountain drinks, nothing that you cant get at McDonald or Jack in the Box. Overall, not worth the hype or wait. Famous Dave is a lot better.

I HATE standing in line like cattle for anything! I definitely don't want to do it for dinner. That being said, the food is VERY good for BBQ in California. A couple of ways to avoid the line, eat at the bar the other order it to go. The prices are reasonable obviously by the size of the lines. ÊGive yourself and your party 45 minutes to get from the back of the line to where you order. You won't be disappointed. Cheers!

When you come to Phil's you are automatically greeted with a long line wrapping around the building, no matter what time of the day you come. It is not a fast moving line. Actually very slow. You can expect to wait in line for an hour or even longer. There are many places where you can decide what you would like to get before hand, which is great because you definitely have enough time to decide for those who are indecisive like me. We choose the baby back rib dinner with fries and beans. When I went to order the girl was extremely friendly and helpful. All of the staff was very friendly and went out of their way to make it a good experience. Pretty soon after we ordered our food was ready. The ribs had a lot of sauce on them and there was a large portion of fries served as well. One thing I did not like it that the ribs had many spots that were charred or blackened. Those pieces ruined it for me. Also the sauce was not very appetizing either. I don't want to sound rude but I have had better BBQ ribs at Chili's. All of the people I was with also agreed. I honestly don't think the hour wait is worth it. I guess maybe so you can have the experience and really know what the ribs are like. I most definitely won't be going back there again. It's almost like going skydiving, you do it once so you can have the experience but you most likely won't do it again, that is how I feel about Phil's. I would rather have Chili's than the ribs here. I don't think they are horrible but did not appeal to me or the group I was with. It was a little disappointing especially after waiting in a line for more than an hour.

Amazing Barbecue! Let me add to the list of commendations for Phil's. I am originally from NY, and have had barbecue in Georgia and Kentucky- neither of which match up to Phil's. Great barbecue, ok fries and gigantic onion rings. Prices aren't phenomenal, but its not super expensive. Store can get crowded- you definitely don't want to eat in, but pickup is fairly quick, and they seem to have a good method. Also, Ask for extra sauce.

Great BBQ at a affordable prices. What's not to love except for the wait which is typically 30 mins average. Opt for To Go and you'll let your grub without long queues and within 5 mins of ordering. Full baby back rib dinner at $20 and change after tax is the best deal for me.

I felt the need to yelp this place because, though it's good bbq, fellow san diegans... there is BETTER bbq in SD! Don't get me wrong... I'm not knockin' on this place. It's just not all that it's hyped up to be. Coop's BBQ in Lemon Grove... THAT is some good bbq. You know a bbq place is good when they serve it to you by the pound on butcher paper! Phil's BBQ is good food. Good Service. It's just not worth the (sometimes) hour long wait.

ÊThey slice the meat really thin and I like that and the bbq sauce is good. ÊOnion rings were bomb diggity. ÊThey really don't have any desserts. ÊI think my beef with it (no pun intended) is that the line was really long, it cost us 80 bucks for 4 people and then we had to find our own table and get our own drinks.

You know that BBQ restaurant of your dreams that you'd never thought you'd find? Yea, well Phil's is definitely "the one"... I've never had BBQ that was so tender, moist, well-seasoned, and perfectly crispy in my life! I've been to my fair share of BBQ places, but this one is definitely the best. Instead of merely serving bland meat smothered in BBQ sauce, they actually serve generous portions of flavorful meat with plenty of their signature smoky sauce. My bf and I ordered the beefy ribs, as well as the baby back (pork) ribs. Both were phenomenal, but we both liked the beefy ribs better, simply because the ribs are ENORMOUS and they come with soooo much meat! I highly recommend getting their ribs. After all, they are award-winning! The sides are good, but not phenomenal. The corn on the cob is sweet, but pretty standard. The french fries are really delicious, but they lack the saltiness that I usually love...and they do start to get a bit mushy after awhile. I can't speak much for the coleslaw, since I'm just not much of a 'slaw eater, but my bf seemed to enjoy it. The atmosphere of this place is downright comfy and homey! Even though I've never been to Texas before, I'd imagine it to be like this joint. Unfortunately, their lines do get super long, so you might find yourself waiting for awhile, although it does give you plenty of time to figure out what to order. They have lots of seating room, so finding a table isn't too challenging. I love me some BBQ...especially Phil's! :)

Bf and I decided to come down to SD for a mini vacay and one of my to-do list is to come to Phil's because of all the yelp reviews. We got here around 6:30pm today and the line wasn't too bad looking. I think there's about 15 ppl or so passed the 21-min mark. My bf didn't want to wait so we phone in our order in the car, waited about 5 mins, and walked into the restaurant. I think the whole process from waiting in line to getting our food only took about max 10 mins. We ordered the full baby back ribs dinner w/ sweet baked beans and macaroni salad and beefy rib tickler just we can have a variety since it's our first and probably our last visit. I do agree there's plenty of meat on the beef rib, but we still prefer the pork ribs. I think you'll like the beef if you're into stew beef. It has a similar texture. Now for the sauce, as some yelpers, it is on the tangy side. We prefer if they tone it down one notch, but we got used to it after awhile. The meat wasn't completely fall off the bone, but didn't need much effort to get the meat off. As for the sides, we liked the macaroni salad and the beans. We didn't think much of the cole slaw. At first I thought it was because it got kind of warm due to the fact they packed it with the hot food, but after eating more of it, there just wasn't anything special about it. The fries wasn't good. First off, it was under the beef rib, so they got smashed. Secondly, with the bbq sauce and any juices made them soft. However, I have a feeling the fries weren't crispy to begin with. We score three onion rings with the tickler and they're pretty good. The batter was light, crunchy and a bit sweet. Good combo. It's hard to find good bbq these days and I think Phil's is one of the good ones. However, the rub on the ribs has too much salt (it's been about three hours since I ate and I'm still thirsty!)

I'm probably one of the last locals to try the place out. ÊI honestly don't know why it took me so long to have me a piece of Phil's. ÊMaybe because I'm not such a big fan of all things BBQ. ÊHaha. Ê Anyway, I was so excited to eat dinner here but when we got there the line was super duper long and we were super duper hungry so we opted for some take out. ÊI know it's not getting that whole Phil's BBQ experience but I'm sure I'll eat inside... one day. The order came out pretty fast. ÊProbably a 10-15MIN. wait compared to an hour of waiting in line. ÊI'm sure we would still be waiting in line even after driving back home to Scripps and finishing our meal in the comfort of our own home. On to the food: Êof course we ordered the full dinner of baby back ribs, the rib-less dinner, the full beef rib dinner, and the half chicken dinner. ÊSounds like a lot huh!? ÊApparently not for our family. ÊWe pretty much demolished everything on our plates besides the chicken. ÊI think we ordered too much!? ÊHmm.. the baby back ribs were so f*cking good but everything else was just okay. ÊMaybe because I'm not a fan of bbq beef rib or bbq chicken. I used to not like BBQ as much but Phil's made me a believer and I'll be back for some more yo.

THEY ARE CLOSED ON MONDAYS. just a warning. There is ALWAYS a wait. But if you have internet access, you could try and see the live video of the line. But just a heads up, the line will usually go around the corner. If your group considers the option to buy and eat somewhere else, there is a much less of a wait ordering to go! Personally, I am not a meat person. I will eat the occasionally chicken, fish, and seafood but I'm not going to be the one to announce my craving for ribs, because I probably won't ever haha. Ê A lot of my friends come to San Diego just for Phil's in mind so who am I to change their minds. I've always wanted to try their veggie burger and although a little ironic ordering the veggie burger at a rib joint - it was pretty good! The girl that i ordered from responded to my order a little taken aback as I wasn't ordering a half rack or full rack of ribs but she told me that she just had a veggie burger for lunch and it's one of her favorites on the menu. I can believe that. With an onion ring and what i think is some rice in the patty, it's pretty scrumptious. (SO. If you are a vegetarian and your group of friends want to go to Phil's - give the veggie burger a try!) Phil's BBQ sauce is now at Costco. They are expanding!

Absolutely amazing place that's worth the 45+ minute long wait. I'm amazed I haven't heard of this place before but when me and gf went to go to Sea world for the first time, we followed my friend Jason's Joseph's advice and stopped by here. Everyone stands in line, no reservations. Amazing, succulent BBQ. I had the BBQ full rack and ate the whole thing while downing 4 beers. All the sides were perfect. I had cole slaw and macaroni salad. What to expect: 1) Park in expansive strip mall style parking. 2) Stand in line. 3) Wait. 4) Get hungry. 5) Order at counter-- then someone will seat you and you eat. We got lucky waiting in line because they had an opening at the bar if we had a party of 5 or more. I was with my GF so we formed an ad-hoc group with 3 friendly san diego natives and a telecommunications engineer from Qualcomm who was originally from South africa. We all bonded over the most delicious BBQ ever. I actually found the bar experience great because we didn't order at the counter-- we actually had a waitress take our order. ÊShe must have expected us to be an adhoc group because she offered right away to split our checks. I estimate we were able to get in about 20 minutes earlier than what we would have and the booth seating was nice! Beer selection is surprisingly good, with some surprising items such as sangria and apple cider. The staff are very well organized, and seemed to be in full communication with each other at all times. We were told to come in from the side entrance and we thought it was a bit dodgy but as soon as we walked in the door the staff was there to seat us. This is a very well run restaurant, with delicious food. A must visit place if you are in San Diego.

I just ate here for the first time on a chilly Tuesday night. My boyfriend and I waited in line to order for about 30 minutes, but that was fine considering how long it took us to decide what we wanted. The waiting caused much anticipation; I want my ribs!!!!! Finally we placed our order and were left to scavenge for a seat. The latter is the reason I bumped off a star. I hate having to fight for a place to sit. Lurking by a occupied table that you think may become available is not a fun experience for either party. However, the ribs were amazing! My boyfriend and I ordered beef ribs and baby back. I preferred the beef over the pork but not by much. They both had fantastic flavor and texture. Furthermore, the service was great too! The employees were so nice and accommodating even in the midst of crowds of hungry people. I can't wait to be back in San Diego so I can eat here again!!

You can't say anything that hasn't already been covered here by other faithful customers of Phil's BBQ. Take it from me, this is the best place ever to get ribs in SD. All my friends from out of town that come visit me, this is usually the first place I take them to. Before they leave it's a guarantee that they will ask to eat here again before getting on the place. I don't know what texas bbq taste like but to me this would fit the name well.

I have been here twice so far and loved it both times. The first time I had Phil's was through the take-out. I was working for a judge and the whole chambers had Phil's for lunch. You know that if the Judge likes a restaurant, then it has to be good. Twice I have gotten the baby back rib tickler with the 3 baby back ribs, fries, onion rings, and coleslaw. With the price being under $7, it is such a great deal. I am not a big meat eater but those ribs are unforgettable. I appreciate how the meat just falls off the bone, especially when I am in my work clothes and don't want to eat like a total pig. The coleslaw is well-balanced but not the best version out there. The second time I went to Phil's, I brought my boyfriend and we dined-in. We went on a Thursday at 12:30pm, prime lunch time. I guess we had to wait about 10 mins in line and another 10 mins for our food. Not too bad of a wait time. I loved the Creole spice on the table for the french fries. It made them so much better than just your typical fries. Also, had some of the broham, which was delicious and incredibly hard to eat. Then, two days later a friend came over to hangout and brought, you guessed it, Phil's with him for his dinner. He shared his full rack of beef ribs and they were sooo good. Definitely a Phil's fan.

This place is good...really good. I love BBQ...and I'm picky with BBQ...and this place is BOMB BBQ. It's one of the best places I've ever been and that's saying something because I'm comparing it to Tennessee and Texas and they KNOW BBQ. Phil also knows BBQ. He's fluent in ribs and sauce. -- Fall off the bone tender...smokey bbqed goodness. Oh man, my mouth is watering...how embarrassing. Phil's is definitely a place you have to try. Yeah the lines are long, but you won't regret it. The meat is outstanding...the sauce is outstanding...the sides are outstanding. This place is fantastic! (oh and they have a great selection of beer on tap) Let the 1500+ reviews and average 4.5 stars speak for themselves...this place WINS!

I have lived in San Diego 20 years and finally went to try Phil's today. ÊI have always been scared off by the mile long line but we had friends here from out of town who had heard about it and wanted to give it a shot. We stood outside for only about 30 minutes and this was at 1:30pm on a Sunday afternoon. ÊNot too bad for a weekend I guess. Once you get inside you place your order at a counter and they give you a pager to come pick it up when ready. ÊTook about 15 minutes to get the food which was reasonably priced. ÊI think my husband and I spent $30 and we bought a lot of sides to try them out. I ordered the 1/2 chicken meal and my husband got the veggie burger. ÊAs for the chicken it was tasty and tender. Êthe sauce is high on vinegar and a bit spicy. ÊIt honestly didn't agree with my guts and i have been fighting with it ever since. ÊMy husband's veggie burger was a disappointment since it had nothing on it except sauce and a onion ring. ÊThe fries were basic french fries, nothing special, the macaroni salad was tasty and they peppery cole slaw was good. ÊI was not a fan of the baked beans which tasted nothing like the bbq sauce and were really mushy. ÊConsistency of refried beans. ÊThe onions rings were pretty amazing. Service was great. ÊPeople at the front counter were funny and chatty and the guys busing the tables were very eager to help with anything. Ê All in all it was a good experience but I personally won't get going back. ÊFor us it is not worth the line since the veggie burger was kinda gross and the sauce jacked up my stomach.

Oooh boy, Phil's is great. The meat is so delicious, tender and fall of the bone. And the sauces... good stuff! I honestly can't say much about the service because I'm always busy stuffing myself when I'm here and then food coma'ing right after. But I do know the service is efficient and great for all the people they get! Anti-hype? Psh, drop it and eat here (wear stretchy pants and loose shirts)

I wanted to give Phil's 5 stars, but their fries and onion rings aren't the greatest. ÊTheir BBQ IS however extremely good. ÊBeen there twice with big groups and surprisingly we got tables pretty quickly both times (at around 1pm). ÊThey're reasonably priced and the sauce is really good....not the best I've ever had, there's no spiciness, but really good. ÊI love the TriTip Sandwich and the pulled pork was great too. ÊThe guys I go with usually get the ribs and they love them. ÊThere are no reservations and usually a big line, but the line goes quickly and there's surprisingly lots of seating. ÊIf you're thinking about trying it, think no more and go! ÊYou won't be disappointed.

I missed the infamous line, and thank goodness I did since I was really hungry anyway. ÊI split a pork ribs plate with my boyfriend. ÊThe plate also consisted of beans and macaroni salad. ÊI added a salad just because I wanted to balance my meal (and I looked like a vegetarian being this was right in front of my face). ÊI loved the taste of the ribs. ÊThey were easy to pull and the meat was really tender. ÊThe beans had a lot of flavor. ÊI only had two bites from it and my boyfriend ate the rest. ÊSad face for me. ÊThe macaroni salad was good, and salad is salad, so I overall enjoyed the plate. ÊI did try my friend's chicken (hehe, he ordered chicken), and it was just the white meat. ÊNothing special. ÊSo yes, get the baby back ribs. ÊNext time I may just have to order onion rings, too.

It was completely by accident that Jamie W. and I ended up at Phil's BBQ this past weekend when we took a quick getaway to San Diego. We were looking for an early dinner before getting ourselves to the airport. Jamie had a hankering for barbecue, and I just happened to notice the number of check-ins at Phil's. When I read the glowing reviews, I was sold. But we were rather disheartened to see the long line that extended around the shopping center sidewalk. Jamie immediately asked the middle-aged woman in front of us whether the wait was worth it to which she replied, "Oh si, si, si !" Then her husband and hyperactive brat with his Nintendo showed up. Fifty-five minutes later, we were finally able to order at the counter. I went for the $13.25 Half Rib Dinner, a half-dozen baby back ribs ladled liberally with their barbecue sauce and accompanied by corn on the cob (see photo). Jamie ordered the $6.95 BBQ Broham, which is a pulled pork sandwich piled high with Cole slaw and topped with barbecue sauce (see photo). Both were delicious, hearty amounts of finger-licking, family-style food that certainly should have satisfied the husky likes of us. But no, we needed to have the $5.95 large order of the Colossal Onion Rings, a house specialty that lived up their ballyhooed reputation - crunchy-crispy, huge and tasty with the cup of ranch dressing on the side (see photo). And to delude us into thinking we should eat something healthier, we shared the $5.95 Caesar Salad which was thick with their housemade dressing (see photo). It is quite an efficient operation they have here where you pick up your food when your buzzer goes off. If you order more food than your two arms can carry, then you get a helper that follows you like a sherpa. The line didn't let up all the time we were there, and the waitress would come by every couple of minutes to see if everything was OK. In other words, she's waiting for us to get our butts out of the booth, so another starving group of diners can gorge on their ribs. Like us, you'll be going through a lot of hand-sanitizing wipes to get the sauce from under your fingernails. Good stuff and yep, worth the wait. FOOD - 4 stars...famous BBQ lives up its local reputation AMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...big place with plenty of seating, but that line still wraps around the building SERVICE - 3.5 stars...they're attentive for sure TOTAL - 4 stars...be patient and bring an appetite...and a Kindle

Best Barbeque in San Diego, hands down! There is a reason that there is always a line around the building. Now I don't want to repeat what everyone's already said about its deliciousness, so I'll just give you guys some pointers: -If you're by yourself or with your significant other, you can skip the line and head straight to the bar. If you find a spot, take it, and you can order right away. -Closed on Mondays, so don't even bother. -If you go on Friday, or any weekday, go before rush hour. If you go from 2-4, you're in pretty good shape, otherwise expect to wait in a 45 minute line! -Call in your order and pick up in 20 minutes if you're in the mood for ribs but not in the mood for the wait.

I thought that the food would be to die for after seeing the great reviews and the long line to get in. Was I wrong. After waiting for about 30 minutes just to say we have a call in order... The food was not good at all. ÊMy ribs were hot but were burnt!!! Like crispy black!! I thought that was how they were suppose to be until I looked into my boyfriends plate which looked awesome... The only good thing were the sweet baked beans. If this is the best in San Diego, I hate to taste the worst. Maybe i'll have better luck at Coop West Texas... Two stars: one for the decor and another for the cool webcam on the website.

All the reviews are correct, there are no ways to describe this place except for 5 stars. ÊI spent 3 days in San Diego, 6 meals and of those, 2 meals were at Phils because it was so damn good. ÊYes, there is going to be a wait, but if you are patient enough, the wait is worth it, I guarantee it. ÊI waited for about 1 hour the first time I was there, 6 pm on a Thursday and I got there before opening on Saturday, 1045 and there were already people in line. Ê Amazingly tender and tasty ribs, every single side is great, there was nothing bad I had at this restaurant. ÊNormally, I am not a fan of coleslaw and I even loved that, seriously the best coleslaw I've ever had. ÊI loved it so much, I bought their take home spice rub and BBQ sauce for my own ribs that I make at home. This place is amazing, and if you are ever going to San Diego or ever in the area, you must try it.

The further west you go in the United States, the harder it can be to find really great BBQ. ÊFortunately, Phil's bucks that trend. There are a few things I really love about Phil's. ÊWith some BBQ places, if you come at an off-hour, the meat can taste like it's been on the smoker for a little too long. ÊNever at Phil's, always moist, with the perfect amount of flavor. I also like in the middle of the two BBQ camps of dry and wet. ÊI love both...and well at Phil's the BBQ sauce is absolutely top notch. ÊThere's a good chance I could probably eat almost anything if it had Phil's magic BBQ sauce on it. Ê The one thing keeping me from giving Phil's 5 stars is I'd like to see one or two more sides in the way of a corn bread, mac 'n' cheese, or maybe some cheesy grits. ÊSomething along those lines. Ê Otherwise...keep it up Phil's, you guys are awesome.

This place is all around amazing. My boyfriend and I didn't want to sit in traffic one day so we decided to stop off and eat at Phil's BBQ. Even though it was a Wednesday night it was obviously packed, but we still walked straight up to order our food and the lady who took our order was hilarious and was full of great conversation even though we interacted for less than a minute. We couldn't find a table for two, not uncommon so it didn't bother me. The only table we could find in the actual dining room was next to the bathrooms and sinks so we asked someone who worked there by the name of Rafael if we were allowed to sit in the patio dining area (we weren't sure if they were having a large party coming in or something). He told us that we could definitely sit there and with no hesitation scooped our plates up and helped us outside. I felt a little awkward having him carry my dishes since it's not the type of place where they wait on you like that, but it was such a kind gesture to help us. He even brought us extra hand wipes, which are definitely necessary. When it was time for us to get up and get our food Rafael told us to stay seated and brought our food out to us! Again, completely unnecessary, but so kind! He even kept coming back to check on how we were doing and if we needed anything. There are times where I go into actual restaurants with servers who don't give me that type of service! I had the El Toro which is always delicious. Get it with cheese, it just makes the sandwich better. I'm not a fan of onion rings, but the ones at Phil's are so good! All in all, it's amazing food with even better service!

I'm a San Diego native Êand I'm going to commit sacrilege. Phil's BBQ was disappointing. And here's why. Before the tar and feathers roll in, I just want to say that I love BBQ. I LOVE it. I've driven to Compton for it (literally). BBQ is about slow-cooked meat (low and slow baby) so tender that it melts in your mouth, with a complex yet utterly food-orgasmic sauce on the side. BBQ is about the love and care someone puts into their meat -- a kind of love that you can just taste. Now I expected a wait when we got there. Fine. I'm okay for waiting for good food. So to me, that wasn't the issue. We ordered the baby back ribs, beef ribs with sides of macaroni salad, coleslaw and onion rings. The beef ribs were straight up CHARRED. And not delicious charred but tough and dry charred. The charred meat had no taste except for 'burnt'. Ugh. I didn't like chewing through that at all. The baby back ribs were all right but I've had better. They were not melty or tender. They were just over-cooked ribs with sauce slathered all over it. The sauce was not to my liking -- it had a tomato-y taste that clinged to my lips in a way that I was not fond of. I'm all for red sauces, but this red sauce was not my thing. The macaroni salad had so much pepper that my culinary friend Anna, regarded it as "pepper salad." Coleslaw was decent. However the onion rings were the BEST THING I EVER HAD. Oh man, I will go back to Phil's just for the onion rings. Woo, baby those onion rings are GOOD. Perfectly battered and when you take a nice big bite, the batter/onion doesn't move - giving you that perfect bite of onion and beer batter that will satisfy you for days. Never had anything like it. The service was impeccable - 5 stars for their customer service. But the rest? Maybe we had a bad batch of ribs. I mean who can argue with 1,000 5-star reviews? Well San Diego, I'm going to say it. There is better BBQ out there. I love the beach, I love the Chargers, but I think I'm going to get my BBQ elsewhere. Except for the onion rings. I will always come back for those delicious onion rings.

We drove over 100 miles to eat at Phil's! OK, well, we did have some other business in the area, but at the end of that 100+ mile drive nothing sounded better than heading directly over to Phil's for some of their top-reviewed BBQ. We arrived about 12:30 on a Wednesday afternoon. The place was indeed packed (except for the outside seating area, it being an unusually warm day), but there was no line. The smiling hostess explained the beeper system to us and directed us to an open cashier. (I'm not sure if you can tell by the pix, but Phil's is a BIG place, with a row of cashiers taking orders from dozens and dozens of hungry customers. It's clearly a huge community favorite.) Mary went with the BBQ Broham (Pulled Pork Shoulder) for $6.95. "Seasoned and char-grilled, on a bed of cole slaw. Topped with BBQ sauce." She also opted for a "small" serving of the Macaroni Salad for another $1.50. I ordered the Baby Back Rib & Chicken Dinner for $12.25, described as "4 Bones and 1/4 Chicken BBQ'd." This comes with two small sides, and I chose the Sweet Baked Beans and Potato Salad. We found an open table and got our drinks (nice big cups). The food came up and our beeper went off in less than 10 minutes. Mary loved the pork and the macaroni salad. I did take a taste of both and they were indeed delicious! She deemed the cole slaw "good," which is a big concession from her as she thinks only her mother and the Colonel (KFC) know how to make cole slaw just perfect. My baby backs and chicken was fantastic! The meat was all falling-off-the-bone well cooked, but very juicy and flavorful, and slathered all over with Phil's excellent sauce. The beans were very tasty, and I really enjoyed the potato salad. It was really special. I couldn't help but eat it all up! Phil's has clearly discovered the formula for cranking out one delicious meal after another, and their master chefs deliver the goods time after time with yummy consistency. We'll be back, no doubt! Even if we have to drive 100 miles again to do it! I also want to give a shout-out to Aaron for stopping by to chat with us for a while. Great food, great service, great folks, and all topped off with Phil's fantastic BBQ sauce. That's a 5 star experience to me!

Having spent 8 solid years in Texas eating my fair share of BBQ, I've been severely disappointed with the choices of bbq in San Diego. ÊUntil now! ÊWe were going to the Explosions in the Sky concert and happened to drive by Phil's BBQ without even knowing it was there. ÊWe hightailed it over there and found a short line that lasted maybe 10 minutes tops. ÊApparently the line gets ridiculously long. Ê I had the baby back ribs, coleslaw and fries. ÊLOOOOOOVED IT! ÊThe meat practically fell off the bone and was so flavorful and delicious. Everyone there was super friendly and helpful. ÊTheir beer choices on tap were kinda lame - if only the had Shiner beer I'd be giving 5 stars haha!!!

It's hard for me to judge what REAL good ribs are... but if you've tried bad (stuck to the bone, lack of flavor, hard meat), you will be blown away by these ribs. The meat is extremely tender, moist, and falls off the bone easily. It is well worth the wait when you are craving some good ribs.

Went here yesterday to lunch with my coworkers, I went here because two had not been here before even though they have grown up here in San Diego. Phil's claims to be the best BBQ in San Diego, and I believe that it really depends on what you consider BBQ. Personally I don't believe that that Phil's has good long slowly cooked meats in a wooden smoker that imparts particular flavor to said meats; rather I would say that Phil's is a good place to get good ribs. That being said, although the food is not inexpensive the portion sizes dwarf most anywhere else that one can go for lunch, and some of my coworkers complained that they had to much food. Hearing that was more of a praise IMHO. As I had said before this is a Rib place, not a BBQ place, IMHO. I say this because all their meat is slathered in their sauce, thus not allowing the customer to taste the meat. IMHO real BBQ shouldn't need sauce if done properly. Either way, my co-workers enjoyed their first time at Phil's, especially given that there was no long wait for lunch as there normally is for dinner.

My husband and I came here on our vacation to San Diego. ÊYes, we came from Texas...to San Diego...and went to a barbecue place. ÊI wasn't too thrilled about the idea but it was definitely worth it. Ê The line wasn't too long when we went, which was definitely a plus, but if there was a long wait, it wouldn't have been a big deal. ÊWe both got the ribs which were very moist and fell off the bone. ÊWe decided to share an order of onion rings, which was also a good idea. ÊI believe we got the small order and we didn't come close to finishing them...and we're not small people by any means.

I failed bad... I was in San Diego... My friends and I went to Phil's BBQ.. And I didn't order anything cause I was full from a BBQ i went to earlier in the day... So while I didn't order.. My friends did.. And before you think "oh what.. this dumbass waited in that long ass line and didn't eat." I'll assure you, that wasn't the case. lol.. My friends ordered to go. And ordering to go and eating it somewhere else sure beats waiting in that long line. Wait 1 to 2 hours in a line to sit inside and be rushed out. Or call in to go and wait 20 minutes for your food and eat in the bed of a truck or in the parking lot and take your time and enjoy the ribs... You choose which sounds more better. lol. But anyways.. My friend let me try one of the ribs. Tons of flavor and it was very good.. I was almost tempted to order some right when i tried it. The onion rings were pretty damn good too. Sooo... Phil's BBQ, I had a emotional trip back to San Dimas because i didn't get any food. I for SURE gotta make a trip back to San Diego before I start up school again. And next time I'm coming with an empty stomach so I can grub on some RIBS! :D

When a place has 3000 reviews and over 75% of the reviews are 5 star, you know that the restaurant may have something good. After a shitload of traffic on the 5 frwy, I was tired from the 3.5 hr commute from LA. ÊBut Phil's BBQ made my day. ÊI have to admit, though, that it wasn't love at first bite. ÊThe ribs are perfectly smoked and the rib meat disintegrates off the bone....but my problem was that their barbeque sauce is skewed a little toward being sweet and tart. ÊIt has some fruity infusions. ÊI felt like it was missing an edge. But, then I looked on the table and saw that they had some cajun seasoning. ÊAfter sprinking a liberal amount of that on my rib, I involuntarily smiled, my eyes dilated, and I lost track of everything else in the room. ÊThe cajun seasoning adds the kick that is lacking in their bbq sauce. The only drawback is the wait. ÊOn my first visit here, I was lucky to get away with a 15 minute wait. ÊBut the wait was 30-40 mins on my latest visit. ÊI opted, instead, to go with a phone order and I ate the ribs at my hotel. Ê As for side dishes....the onion rings were good, but I thought they were too crispy. ÊI loved the potato salad as it had the perfect blend of spices. ÊIt had dill, but I can't pinpoint what else it had. ÊTheir corn also is great with butter and their cajun spices. Ê Anyway...this place definitely is worth checking out. Ê And for $18, u get a full rack of ribs and two small sides...definitely not a bad deal!

If I could describe the food in one word it be "YUM!" the babyback ribs literally fall right off the bone. The beef ribs are also Really good if I could I'd get both haha. I usually get the half dinners and that always fills me up even if I don't finish the sides. They also have a separate station to wash your hands! Which I think was smart of them. The employees are also super nice. Great service and even greater food. The only thing I don't like about phils is that there also seems to be a bigass line. The wait is horrendous on weekends. Last time I went was on Thursday around 230 so we didn't have to wait too much. Anyway if you're in SD you should definitely drop by.

Alright, where do I begin? Clearly, with 3000+ reviews, Phil's BBQ is definitely one of the best. We were totally unaware of Phil's popularity and having parked towards the back (closer to Red Lobster next door), we did not see the insanely long line that wrapped around the building at 3pm on a Sunday afternoon. We went in towards the side that had immediate access to the bar and a few empty seats. Aha! What a good way to skip that line! We both ordered the Baby back ribs + Chickless dinner with Coleslaw, Macaroni and Baked beans. Well, what else can I say that other reviews haven't already said? It was pretty darn good!!! I had flashbacks of the best BBQ I've ever had (which was in Kansas City) and Phil's came in really close. The baby back ribs were my favorite! Phil's should open more locations (specifically in LA and OC) so that they can give Lucille's a run for their money!

I live right across the street from this place and every time I've tried to go, it's been a ridiculously long ass line. Go for lunch if you want to avoid that.

My first time wasn't all that great but after that I was hooked! ;) I always order the baby back rib tickler which comes with baby back ribs, fries and coleslaw for $6.95. Always satisfying unlike other places where you try something really good, come back to try it again & come to find it wasn't as good as the first time. It's something about their special BBQ sauce that makes it taste awesome. It's so good that Costco is now selling Phil's BBQ sauce in them ketchup looking containers. It doesn't taste exactly the same but it's still bomb.

I prefer it over the El Toro any day. My bf loves the ribs. The order of fries is very large, probably serves two or three people. Onion rings are also great.

First of all, I don't give that many 5 stars. I am also not a big BBQ fan like my husband, but I was very impressed with almost everything here. ÊThe lines are always wrapped around the corner, but that's a good sign for a restaurant. The Broham sandwich is a pulled-pork sandwich topped with coleslaw. ÊThey are not cheap with their meat...the meat is piled high. BBQ sauce is great, they actually have it bottled at Costco. The onion rings are super crunchy, if you eat it there or else it will get soggy if you bring it home. The beef ribs are huge and amazing! This is a must try place if you're visiting San Diego.

The line was preeeeetty long. Average weekend during winter time and the wait was ~45+ minutes. But it was worth it . Ribs were exactly the way I imagine them in my dreams. Soft, tender, peel right away from the bone without being overcooked. Side of macaroni was delicious. Service was good. Go here and you will have 0 regrets.

I love this place... Delicious BBQ, HUGE portions, cheap domestic pitcher/pint deals, and the service is friendly and fast. I dont understand how people can wait in a line for an hour when the bar section is ALWAYS available! My sis and I just went this past saturday and passed atleast 100 people waiting in line. We sat immediately and our food was out in minutes! And- I think the bar side is WAY more fun! Anyway, I definitely recommend this place for all you bbq lovers out there :)

I hate when good restaurants become overrated for me. All my friends' hype and the long line built up so much anticipation for dinner that there was no way that expectations would be met. We only waited for 40 minutes on a Saturday night, so the wait was completely bearable. For three people, we ordered 7 baby back ribs and 3 beef ribs, accompanying them with coleslaw, macaroni salad, and gigantic onion rings. The baby backs were fairly good, I wish they had been warmer when we got them. The beef ribs were just massive, but they were a bit too charred for my taste, and not quite as succulent as I had hoped. The BBQ sauce, though, was not the best experience for me. Phil's sauce Êhas a certain zing to it, stemming from a tangy tomato base that lingers on my lips long after I've eaten my last piece of meat. I guess I'm not as fond of that flavor; it didn't capture my imagination like I thought it would. The onion rings were the best part of the meal. They were massive, they were actually large slices of onion, and the beer batter was so good. The ranch made it so much more unhealthy, but made it so much delicious. Next stop: Bludso's!

This place is overrated. The line is incredibly long, and the food is alright. We waited an hour and 45 minutes for a Saturday dinner. The baby back ribs were overdone in a very salty sauce. The meat itself was overcooked and had no flavor of its own. I was expecting "fall apart tender", but it was mushy! The barbecue chicken and beef ribs however, were a table favorite. The chicken was tender, juicy, and infused with smoky and natural flavors. The beef ribs were the same; meaty and flavorsome. We had french fries, cole slaw, and corn as sides. The french fries were limp and flavorless, and the cole slaw was just bad. The corn however was sweet and juicy! We also had an order of onion rings. These were generously coated in a thick batter that resembled "fish n' chips" batter, and were quite tasty.

Best BBQ on the west coast!! I love their Baby Back Ribs, they are super tender and practically fall off the bone. Their fries are fresh and taste great with some dirty ranch(ranch with lots of Franks Red Hot) There is always a long line but it is well worth the wait! If you are in a hurry you can learn the secret way to sit without standing in line but you'll have to go there to figure it out. If I lived close I would be here weekly!

Good BBQ in San Diego? ÊReally? ÊReally! ÊWent with a couple of friends and was a little apprehensive because I've never heard of San Diego being known for good BBQ. ÊWell Phil's will change your mind. We got there and was greeted by a very long line. ÊNow this must be the norm, because they set you up really well for the wait. ÊThey have TV's and menu boards so you can decide what you want before you get to the counter to order. ÊOnce you're at the front, the service is very friendly and efficient. ÊThe food came quickly and was hot and fresh. ÊI had the combo BBQ chicken and baby back ribs with potato salad and the beans, while my friends had the baby back ribs and fries......lots of fries. ÊThe chicken was good, but not great. ÊUnfortunately, Some parts were a bit dry. ÊThe ribs.....just awesome. ÊGreat smoke flavor, super juicy, and fall off the bone tender. ÊAbsolutely loved it. ÊThe BBQ sauce didn't do it for me, and was a bit too tangy for my preference. ÊThe potato salad was great. ÊGood flavor and perfect texture. ÊThe beans....meh, they were good, but I've had better. ÊAll in all it was a good meal and the service was spot on.

BEST BABY BACK RIBS EVER!!!! If you have never tried it, it is a MUST-TRY if you're in San Diego! The only downside about coming here is the LONG lines out the door. You might even have to wait an hour to get seated. But the good news is, if you come in a large group, they will get tables prepared FOR you so by the time you order, you can sit right away and wait for your food to be ready instead of having to scrounge around for tables. Although it's a large space with many tables, there's so many people that it can be hard to find a place to sit! I came this past weekend with a group of 12 and we DID wait for about an hour, but service was excellent and they had our table prepared on the patio all ready for us by the time we finished ordering. :) So bottom line is... come in a big group! Or at least, don't be afraid to! But if you come in a small group, not to worry if the lines are too long. There's a little minibar set up outside by the door and you can keep yourselves hydrated with their free lemon cucumber infused water. :) Service here is the best! The hostess is very friendly and sweet. We also had an awesome server named Marlin! He accommodated to all our needs and got us everything we wanted. He went above and beyond and our group loved him for that! Marlin, if you're reading this, thank you!! Now on to the most important part: the food! The baby back ribs are the way to go! They have a quarter rack which only comes with 3-4 ribs, and also a half rack, and full rack depending on how much you want to eat. The meat falls right off the bone and the BBQ sauce is to die for! The perfect proportions of tangy, sweet, and spicy. PERFECTION! The platter also comes with either 2 small sides or 1 large side. I love their macaroni salad and their fries aren't bad either. So if you haven't been here yet, bookmark this place now!

Finally! I traveled all the way down from Santa Monica to try this place out after my brother and the yelpers were raving about it. Baby Back Ribs: Amazing, tender, juicy, just enough fat, not dry. Side Dishes: Not bad, it's about average with other places. Bread Bun: If you get this alone its soft and crunchy around the corners and makes an excellent soaking device for the sauce. Parking: Plentiful! Price: Affordable! I didn't think it would be this good! I came ordered a rib and chicken meal with two sides, an extra side of corn, a side of bread, and a soda and it all came out to be around $20 including the tip I left at the front and on my table. Service: One of the friendliest people I've meet. I loved the lady who was helping everyone out on the patio. She was always checking to see if she could refill our drinks, take out plates away, get us any more sauces or napkins, she even got our bips and tied it for us. I'm not sure if you tip there cuz the tip jar was all in the front, but we did it anyway since she was so nice and most of those things were more or less meant for self service. Phil's you did not disappoint! Now I am sitting here sadden that LA doesn't have one close by.

WOW!!! I give them three wow points: 1) I am the 3043rd reviewer (what other places on yelp has over 3k reviews?!!) 2) We arrived around 6:30pm on a Friday night, and the lines wrapped around the store (at least 50 people in line--no exaggeration!) 3) The ribs and onion rings DELICIOUS!! Since we were in a rush and didn't want to do a 4 hour dinner, we decided to do a take out and go back to the apt to eat. In total, the take out took about 30 minutes. My only compliant is we ordered rib that came with the side of "fries," and they put the fries on the bottom of the tray and put ribs on top of the fries. This made the fries all soggy and saucy. Other than that, I would love to come back and get some more ribs!!! :)

Visited on a Friday around 5:00 pm. Very busy, line out the door. Atmosphere fun and very friendly and I really liked the decor. Service was fast, dinning room attendant brought our food which was very nice and I'm perty sure you're suppose to get it yourself. Food was excellent, and the price was very affordable. Only complaint's.....no Tabasco?? You gotta have Tabasco in a rib joint, Tapatio is the standard hot sauce they offer but it isn't fitting with this menu. Our server was nice enough to offer a bottle that some other customers smuggled in. Also, it was raining and I would suggest that they not seat people on the west side on rainy days because of dripping water. I also noticed in the west patio is it was very humid because of the moisture and the heaters. Because of it we requested a different table and were very pleased with the patio area on the east side.

You know it's not normal when you're willing to drive 90 minutes just for BBQ. I've been here about 3 times now and it never fails me. Yeah the wait is 40 minutes but the hype is all worth it in the end. I always get my beef ribs (OH MEAT HEAVEN!) with beans, fries or potato salad. I always struggle to finish it and feel nasty by the end but it's all worth it. The workers are very nice and are always willing to help out. I dont know if anyone else does but I like to leave them a little tip for their help. As much as I'd love for it to expand North because nothing says San Diego better than Phil's BBQ.

I know that Phil's BBQ is a gem because the hype didn't ruin it for me. When people told me that it was the best BBQ ever, it literally turned out to be the best BBQ ever. The meat is tender, juicy, and flavorful. The sides are spot on and the sauce is out of this world. I got beef ribs, which were huge by the way, and the meat was literally fall off the bone (something you dont usually get with beef ribs). Look, I can go on and on about why this place is awesome, but I would lose you somewhere in the midst of all that. So to keep it concise, Phil's BBQ is literally as good as it gets. 5 stars, hands down. Be ready to wait in line though, that line is not kind..

Yes, the BBQ is super tasty. Yes, the portions are huge. Yes, the staff is super friendly. BUT Yes, if you go at any normal mealtime, you will wait in a line around the building. I have had my fair share of BBQ over the years in various states and while Phil's is above average the insane lines are not worth it. But if you must, I'd recommend the Beef Ribs, Onion Rings and getting there an hour and a half prior to when you want to eat. Other sides are nothing special, but who goes to BBQ for coleslaw anyways?

This was my very first time trying Phil's and I had a long, but great, encounter. The talk about the lines had been right. When I arrived, the line was to the parking lot. I would extremely recommend calling in your order. Turns out they don't prepare your food until you arrive, so it is fresh out of the kitchen. There was a separate line for call in orders and there was nobody in that line when I arrived. I was able to go straight to the counter with no wait. I cannot comment on the dine in encounter as my order was to go. But the dining location was large and loud with all of the people there. I ordered the baby back ribs and chicken dinner and it was almost certainly the most tasty BBQ I had ordering from a restaurant. Most restaurant BBQs are dry and have no flavor. The ribs were juicy and flavorful. They gave me a chicken breast and I was afraid it would be dry as sand, however it too was juicy and not overcooked. The cooks at Phil's surely know how to cook BBQ.

After numerous glowing recommendations from friends to try this place out my fiance, a friend & I decided to plan a day trip to San Diego with Phil's as the main reason for going. After having visited the South many-a-time and loving Carolina BBQ, I've been looking for a REAL BBQ joint in SoCal. Sorry, Phil...but Ohio BBQ doesn't compare to real southern BBQ. Everyone knows about the wait & all that, so I'll just cut to the chase. I'll just describe what I got to taste: Baby back ribs - very tender, but the meat alone didn't seem to have as much flavor as I'd hoped without the sauce. My preference of BBQ is the kind where the meat can stand on its own, without being drenched in BBQ sauce...and this was just okay. Not as amazing as everyone says. Its really all about the sauce here (I believe this will be a reoccuring theme). El Toro - tri-tip sandwich. Another of my pet peeves in BBQ. Deli-sliced tri-tip. Lets all that wonderful flavor dry out when you slice it so thin. Again, hidden by the BBQ sauce, but if you find a piece not drowned in BBQ sauce, it just tastes like unseasoned tri-tip meat. Tastes better with the sauce, but again, saucy BBQ is not my preference. Fries - tasted like sliced potatoes with no seasoning. They were really bland. If I'm eating something deep fried, I'd at least wanna have some flavor with my unhealthy. Onion rings - super disappointing. Batter was so thick and had no flavor. It was also super greasy. Couldn't taste the onions & its a damn ONION ring. Onion ring doesn't taste good without the dipping sauce. Again, this food is all about the sauce. The actual food, in my opinion, does not stand up on its own. If I'm eating something deep fried, I'd at least wanna have some flavor with my unhealthy. Cole slaw - bland. Yeah, I know cole slaw is usually pretty bland. My friend who ordered it said, "I wonder if they purposely make the sides really bland so the main dishes taste better" when she tried it. That's just not a good sign. Conclusion: For SoCal, its a pretty top notch BBQ joint. I'm from SoCal, I love SoCal, but BBQ is just something that we don't do as well as some other parts of the country, for sure. Some people love the sauce on BBQ and its all about the sauce to them. That's fine. To each their own. I am the type that loves the taste of the actual BBQ...not BBQ sauce. And I know I could've asked for sauce on the side, but I tasted the meat without the sauce, and it wasn't that good. Its a case where the meat NEEDS the sauce, and that's not great BBQ in my book. None of us finished any items on our plates. Took home lots of leftovers & forgot it in the car. Good BBQ would smell up the car so you couldn't possibly forget it was there. I really wanted to like this place, but it was just average.

Pork rib platter on the wall, tell me who is the most OVER-HYPED BBQ JOINT of them all...? +sound of whooshing and pig squeals+ "Yelper Josh.. trust your instincts, for they do not lie, there is only one restaurant that I spy.. It's name is known throughout the land by hungry woman, child and man.. Phil's is the place of which I speak, and only its HYPE makes it unique!" ...but magical pork rib platter, why is this place hyped-up so much? "It's lines are long, its sauce is lame, and when it comes to smoking meat, its chefs have no game. I see no clear reason for its fame.." I dunno, pork-rib platter.

Really...I don't know what more I can add. The food is delicious. We had beef ribs, baby back ribs, chickless (chunky pieces of chicken breast in BBQ sauce), onion rings (HUGE), french fries, cole slaw, macaroni salad, and Êcorn on the cob (steaming white corn in its husks). All of it was fantastic. Definitely call ahead and order. They will not have your food ready when you arrive. They pack your food as soon as you have paid/arrive. So, the wait is about 15-20 minutes but the food is fresh. Here's where I would take off 1/2 star or so...PLEASE MR. PHIL, add some cornbread, or some sort of other bread to your menu. This girl loves her bread and I was really hankering for some!!!

Came here on a Sunday around 7pm. There was a long ass line forming around the restaurant. The wait was for 2 hours, which my boyfriend and I decided to get it to go since we had a concert to go to at 8pm. We decided to share a Half Rib Dinner with Macaroni Salad and Potato Salad as our sides. We also got extra sauce, but you don't really need it unless you like it extra saucy! The ribs were pretty good and the sides weren't bad as well. I would only come back here if I am in the area, but as for the wait...I would probably just get it to go and eat it somewhere else lol.

ÊIt's decent and I like the outdoor patio seating availability, plus the open sinks to wash and dry your hands after eating ribs is an awesome idea, but it's not as good as it was hyped up to be. We tried the chicken, ribs, onion rings, and more ribs - and all of it was pretty dry. ÊIt's a little overrated. ÊActually a LOT. ÊPeople were telling me, "When you go to San Diego you HAVE TO try Phil's!" ÊWell my friends, I found a better place for BBQ.

The ribs, broham sandwich, fries, onion rings, macaroni salad, and beans. The food came out fast and the service, even though it's self serve, is pretty awesome. They are there to clear everything, get you more sauce, and point out the restrooms to you. I love you Phil's.

This place has exceptional food! If you're looking for some good ol' ribs then this will definitely satisfy your craving. It sure did for my friends and I. We ordered the Baby Back Rib Dinner which included: 12 bones, potato salad, and fries. The ribs are delicious, tender, juicy, and the meat effortlessly falls off the bone. The sides were also great (we loved the potato salad). Last but not least, I strongly believe their popular BBQ sauce is really worth the hype, as it was great paired with everything on our table.. yes, the potato salad too lol. Prices are decent and if you're with a group, even better. ÊService was good, which was slightly surprising considering the large volume of people they had to serve. My only gripe is the line you have to endure before getting into the restaurant. Obviously a lengthy wait is anticipated at any popular place, but the food is worth it.

By far the best BBQ meal you can get in San Diego The mouth watering ribs are bomb. My girlfriend loves the chicken tickler with the baked beans and fries. The prices aren't that bad either $18 for a full rack of baby back ribs and $7 for there famous el torro. If you get here before 3 you shouldn't be waiting no longer than 40-50 mins. If you get here pass 3:30 you better not come hungry your going to be waiting a while. If your a BBQ lover then this is the place for you.

I know, another five star review for Phil's BBQ.... But...I can't deny the deliciousness of everything here. There are so many reviews here I'll just get straight to the point, the colossal onion rings, pork ribs, and macaroni salad are awesome. Only bad thing about this location is that the lines are always pretty long, the San Marcos location isn't nearly as busy if you are closer to there. All in all, you will truly regret not going to Phil's and I will go as far as saying you are not a San Diego native until you have tried it.

I went there not knowing anything about the place. I saw the raging line and decided this place must be good if the line is out the door and around the building. So glad I went. The line moves really fast and there is bar with open seating. I didn't know that until I got to the front of the line but next time I will definitely check that area first. Food was amazing. The best Barbeque in San Diego!!!

I've heard about this place a couple of years ago from some friends. ÊSince I spent most of the day kayaking in the deep sea, I thought it would be nice to reward my self to some great southern BBQ !!!! I even skipped lunch and had to work extra hard on the kayak! Lol Omg! The line was wrapped around the building. I swear 150 people. My friend went inside to the bar area and sat down immediately and he called me to inform me that our bar booth seating was available! Yippy!!!!! No wait for me baby! ÊWe met a local to my right and another to my left. Both dine by themselves and gave us the 411. The lady knew Mr. Phill himself and told us stories about how he started the business. Both were nice people. I'm thankful for meeting nice locals!! We ordered the shredded BBQ pork sandwich topped with cabbage . The best shredded pork ever and they crammed a lot of meat inside the sandwich. We also ordered the Half beef ribs and BBQ chicken and was able to pick a side item with that so we had to order the fries. I sprinkled the fries with this amazing Cajun seasoning that smoked up my killer fries!! It had great flavors to it!!!! Both chicken and beef ribs were tender and grilled to perfection ;)-

Recently went to Phils for the first time. The line wasn't that bad, and they had a guy posted up slanging cold beer outside, which was genius. ÊIt made me completely forget about standing in line. "line? what line? I gots me a cold beer, bishes!" Before I knew it I was knee-deep in BBQ. bbq chicken. bbq ribs. onion rings. fries. mac salad. bbq baked beans. It was very delicious. Tasty, tangy sauce, tender meats... I put in work, like a bawse. If i'm ever on death row and had one last meal request, i'd say "Gimme some Motherf***ing PHILS, bish!" (like.a.bawse)

After two months of living here, I can finally say that I'm a true San Diegan. I remember all the freeways, I know how to get to the airport by heart, but most importantly, I've undergone the initiation that is Phil's BBQ. Long story short, I got the 4 Baby Back Ribs & 1/4 BBQ Chicken Dinner with fries and macaroni salad. All of this after waiting in line for at least half an hour, which is well worth it. Pros: - The setup of the restaurant is very convenient. You order, find a table, and your food is ready in no more than 10 min. No having to deal with waiters, taking orders, etc etc - The ribs fall right off the bone and are extremely tender. - When you order a small serving of fries, it's really more like a super sized McDonalds portion, except much tastier - Macaroni salad is delicious and goes very well to contrast the BBQ Sauce - Very kind staff who are on top of their work Cons: - The BBQ sauce is pretty vinegary, so getting some ranch or just a lot of water cancels it out pretty well. - The chicken is a bit dry, but quite managable - Hard to find a parking spot on a weekend evening To sum it up, it's not THE BEST BBQ I've ever had. That title will always go to my dad. However, it's definitely some of the most tender and juicy meat I've eaten. Worth the 30 min wait? I think so!

Oh, Phil's. I always leave your place in a food coma, barely able to walk... there is so much to say about this joint, but I'll keep it nice and short. Every time I come here they never fail to please, honestly. Although sometimes there's a long wait, I know the reward is way worth it. I always order the best of both worlds, chicken and ribs. OMG they always give me big big big pieces and I TRY TO FINISH IT.... never happens tho :( My stomach never agrees with me after, pooey. I don't think their prices are too over the top, considering I always get big pieces. The staff is very friendly and willing to accommodate your group always. They carry a pretty good selection of beer and beverages. I would def return.

Nomizzle. Please, don't let my 5 star review tell you how awesome Phil's is. Just go and see for yourself. There is a line, that goes out the door and around the corner, and if you don't believe, go online and take a look at their camera for proof(no worries, get it to-go, the line is MUCH MUCH shorter)! Anyways, came down to SD to visit a friend and try Phil's definitely no regrets. Well maybe one, I wish I ordered something with more ribs. I got the pork ribs tickler, which was pretty huge and tasty. Here are my thoughts: -The BBQ sauce had a strong kick and definitely took some time getting used to. -The sides were a bit much for me, I wish I had more ribs instead. But then again, it was a tickler. -The Cajun seasoning was BOMB on the fries. And the coleslaw is pretty tasty and light too! -Apparently the potato salad is not that impressive. I would suggest skipping it. -Please don't table hog until you've ordered. Kthx. -Get in line. Order when you get to the front. Get a beeper. Find a table. Wait for the beeper. Get your food. EAT. :) Btw, they have free cucumber and lemon water outside. Yummy!

Every time I come here it gets better and better! Ê You can always expect to wait in line when you arrive-thats a given- but now there is an outside bar (!!!!), they serve you French fries and other snacks in line and the heat lamps (which I'm not sure if those are new) keep you warm and toasty while you wait. ÊThey want to keep you happy before you enter the door, during your visit and after Êwhich is OK with me. The staff is always friendly, which is impressive because BBQ joints can sometimes attract rowdy unpleasant crowds (I've been witness to it). Ê I don't visit Phils too often because it is a time commitment, but when I do I always have a great time and would recommend this place to anyone looking for good BBQ.

45 plus minutes to stand in line and wait to get inside this amazing BBQ joint.... It doesn't matter if you have to wait 45 minutes in line to eat BBQ at Phil's!!! *in my The Rock from WWE voice*. Everything about Phil's is worth the wait. Plus, if you're lucky, you can skip the line and seat yourself at the bar if there are seats available. The environment is energetic and the staff is so upbeat and funny. Our waiter was very helpful and hilarious. Great place to enjoy some Sunday and Monday night football. I ordered the BBQ ribs with chickless chicken, a side of baked beans and fries, with a super cold Coor's Light. By far the best reins I've ever had in my life! Thick, juicy, and meat falling off the bone with every bite. The chickless chicken was boneless chicken breast smothered with their famous BBQ sauce and was delicious and filling. The baked beans were perfect and the French fries were bomb because I topped them with creole seasoning. The pricing of food ranged from $10-$18 and the appetizers ranged from $4-$8. Phil even sale his signature BBQ sauce in 29.5 oz bottles for only $6. Overall, I am jealous that he hasn't extended his BBQ chain to Las Vegas. I'll even move to San Diego to enjoy this food for my lunch breaks and occasional dinners. This place will definitely grow on you after your first visit and will make you remember it forever if you can't enjoy it anytime you please as the people of San Diego. I'll definitely make another 6 hr drive for this BBQ.

It's hard for any place with this much local hype to live up to it. This place serves good BBQ, at a great price, but I have to say it's not worth the long waits you have to endure to eat it. The lines are absolutely too long for a person like me who gets grumpy when hungry. We arrived on a weeknight for dinner around 7:30 and waited like 45 minutes to get in, most of it past a dubious sign stating 22 minute wait from here. So, if you are a Zen master, or very patient person don't sweat it. You can call in to-go orders, which I think would be a great option for people like me. Factor in the line for a good experience. Don't be to hungry, or have to go pee or anything. Trust me. They do counter service, after they find you a table. Once seated, the food comes pretty quickly. The bar is completely separated, and you have to order your beer separately from there. There is no table service at all The portions are huge, and both the pork and chicken BBQ is really excellent. The sauce is tangy, and the meat is very tender. It's good stuff.

Phil's BBQ was featured on Man vs. Food. Phil's BBQ is the real deal and is a pleasant surprise to find bbq this good outside of the prototypical bbq regions. I saw the El Toro sandwich on Man vs. Food and had to try it for myself. This turned out to not only be one of the best bbq sandwiches I've ever had, but one of the best sandwiches, period. The sauce was unlike any that I've ever had. The taste was a perfect combination of tangy, sweet, and spicy. It tasted like we were mixing the signature characteristics of Kansas City and Carolina bbq into one awesome sauce. I also ordered the onion rings and would rate them as average, nothing too special. Although Phil's is a good sized restaurant, it get's packed. We tried to go for dinner on a Saturday night and were greeted by line that was long enough to discourage us from staying. I went back the next day for lunch and ran into a long line of hungry people waiting for Phil's to open for the day. Phil's serves up some of the best bbq in the country, and therefore earns a five star rating.

Yummmyy!! After a few hours of walking, my friend and I finally worked up an appetite to head over to Phils. I still wasn't hungry perse, but waiting another 45 minutes somewhat helped. The line was long, but surprisingly, it moved kind of fast (relatively so anyway). We placed an order for the best of both - beefy ribs and chickless dinner, and a quarter baby back ribs dinner. For sides, we had steamed veggies, cole slaw, and potato salad. It seemed like a lot of food, but we wanted to sample everything! My question was, why isn't there an option for "best of 3 worlds" that offered chicken, beef ribs, and pork ribs?! After we ordered and found seats, we prepared all our paper towels and put on our bibs shamelessly (boiling crab taught me the necessities!). Our food arrived shortly, and you know what the crazy thing was? We actually almost finished everything! It was so good that it stimulated my hunger even though we were saying there was no way we'd finish it. Yah we're some crazy gals that can eat. Sauce was quite tangy and not too sweet, and the meat was delicious. My favorite was the baby back ribs! The beefy ribs were good too, but not as tender as I expected it to be - but still pretty tender and juicy! I was disappointed with the chicken though. It was kind of dry, so word of advice - stick with the ribs! Sides were decent, potato salad was pretty good, but the others were just okay. Hence, I take back my best of 3 suggestion and say that Phils should just offer the real best of both - the beef and pork ribs. :)

Phil's has this "MUST HAVE" BBQ restaurant business down to a science. From the Êreadily visible menus posted all over the waiting area to the signs announcing the wait from that point to the no-nonsense lady directing you to a cashier, you get the feeling they've had plenty of experience with a daily crush of humanity. But alas, the food here did not merit the excitement. I had the quarter ribs with potato salad and macaroni salad and nothing stood out except the sauce. The sauce is excellent- sweet yet not overwhelmingly so. I'd pick up some of it by itself, but would choose a different meat. The sides were extremely disappointing. The potato salad had a skewed ratio of potato-to-dressing--far too much potato and too little flavor in the dressing. Reminded me of red potatoes at Denny's, except Denny's might've had more flavor. Macaroni salad was also unfortunate- my dining compatriot barely had more than a spoonful and I wouldn't want to try it again. Will I give Phil's another shot? Certainly. It's a bit pricey, but the experience was overall a good one and I liked their extensive drink selection in both alcoholic and nonalcoholic options (although I don't know what they were thinking with using a FUSE dispenser for "southern-style sweet tea." It ain't anything close to that). But I'm not convinced it's even the best BBQ in San Diego.

Why is the meat at the top portion of the ribs missing? If I look inside of the cow...will I see no meat on the top of their ribs? So how did that meat vanish? Ribs are great...but... Top half is bone... Bottom half is a lump of meat... First time here... yaaaay The hostess points me to the counter.. Where there's a whole buncha cashiers.. Not that big a wait... Hell....I don't know what I want... So I had just three very delicious ribs! I ate my beans and ate my friends beans! Cause he didn't like them... I wish I had several tummies... So I could eat a little of this and a little of that.... Nothing like a ride home with the windows open... I don't know what's worse... Smog n exhaust fumes... Or those healthy Phil's BBQ spicey beans after effects... A very special thank you to Lori I from Honolulu, Hawaii who kept recommending this place to me.

I thought all the BBQ was good, but nothing so amazing it was worth standing in line for however long we did. ÊOne thing I did like was the gigantic beef rib. ÊNot a lot of BBQ places have that so it was a nice surprise. ÊThis isn't the fall off the bone ribs that most pork ribs are. ÊThey're chewier and take a little more work to eat, but I love them. ÊThe pulled pork sandwich was overflowing with pulled pork, so you'll definitely leave with a full belly. Overall, it's hard to live up to any hype, but I'm glad I got a chance to try this place.

I wasn't able to finish my food because there was just too much of it. ÊThe BBQ sauce is a good mixture of sweet and tangy and there were condiments to add to the spiciness.

Phil's BBQ: Hi Phil, how's it going? It's been a long time hasn't it? I've heard you've been staying busy. You always seem to be busy (even during odd hours like 4 pm on Sunday afternoon, etc). I guess when everyone knows how wonderful you are, I can't keep you to myself. I know I'm being forward and all, but I love your ribs. Beef ribs or baby back ribs, I don't discriminate. I love them both equally. I can't choose between them and I'm glad you don't make me. And your sides, macaroni and potato salad are my favorites, but you have so much more to offer. I dream about your ribs from time to time and I'm not ashamed to admit it. I know I don't get to visit you as much as I would like, but when I do, I want to see you. I will overcome the longest line and wait over an hour for you (or call in, pick it up and take it to a friend's house instead), you are def worth it. And I appreciate you putting up a live cam on your website to show me how long the line is to get to you. Not many people know this, but it saved me a few times. From the rib dinners to ticklers (never really had anything other than ribs, but why would you?), it doesn't get much better than you. I heard girls were better in the south, but it's hard to imagine anyone better than you. It's like we have a love/hate relationship between us. I love your ribs and hate when I'm done and have to leave knowing that it will be awhile until I get to see you again. Until next time. Love, Chris

If you are visiting San Diego and you are a ravenous BBQ carnivore, Phil's is a must-go. Ê As you can see from the other reviews, there is always a massive line come dinner time, so be sure to take out or get there super early. ÊYou go in, pay for your food at the cash register in the front, and seat yourself. ÊThey give you a buzzer that tells you when your food is ready, and you can get your own utensils, wipes (trust me, you'll need them), and plastic bibs at a nearby counter. ÊSurprisingly efficient! The waiters are very friendly! At my friend's birthday dinner, three of them agreed to sing happy birthday for him (I don't think they usually do that). ÊSpeaking of birthdays, PROTIP: sign up for their newsletter online and you can cut the line with (I think) 4 other people on your birthday! I've been here so many times, and it holds a special place in my heart (where my arteries are presumably getting clogged). The Baby Back Ribs and the Beefy Ribs will never fail you. ÊThe meat is so tender that it basically falls off the bone, and paired with Phil's delicious BBQ Sauce, it is irresistible. ÊThe chicken is alright, but the ribs are what brings people back time and time again. The first time I went here, I ordered the Quarter Rib Dinner of Baby Back Ribs (9.95). Ê4 bones may not sound like much, but add in the 2 small sides, and I couldn't finish the plate! Now I usually get the Baby Back Rib Tickler (6.75). ÊIt comes with 3 bones, 2 onion rings, cole slaw, and fries. ÊIn my opinion, it's a much better value and you get to sample the best of what they have to offer. ÊBut if you're a heartier eater, do not hesitate to order half ribs, or even full ribs! You won't be disappointed. ÊI've got to say though, not a big fan of the onion rings. TIP: There is seasoning on the table. ÊAdd that gratuitously to your fries and you won't regret it. What? Are you a vegetarian? Don't worry, Phil's makes a mean BBQ veggie burger (or so my vegetarian friend says, I've never tried it). Phil's even caters for events! Our club banquet had Phil's catering. Yeah, you're jealous. TL;DR: Come here for yummy BBQ noms that are reasonably priced and generously heaped onto your plate, you won't regret it!

'1 hour, wait-worthy, good ol' BBQ Ribs" BBQ fans must go to Phil's at least once; if not a hundred times. The servings are plentiful. My more normal friends split a full rack between 2 ppl. I, on the other hand, polish off a rack to myself, with a large serving of fries - OH YEAH! The prices are fair, and here is the faire I've had: *Baby back ribs - yes please! Meat falls off the bone. The sauce is layered, with a perfect balance of tang, sweet, smoke and vinegar. *The Toro (Tri-tip sandwich) - good luck eating with your hands. Perfect for mesquite lovers; has a rich smokiness to it *Coleslaw - not my kind of slaw. Really thin slices, and the dressing could use more body *Fries - you really have to try hard to make fries I don't like. These are thicker, bar fries. *Baked beans - I'm not a bean fan (haha), but everyone else seems to like them. To give some descriptors- (minds out of the gutter please) they are firm, fresh tasting with good texture. *Onion rings - tasty. You can actually bite through the rings and the onion doesn't slide out. I really enjoy the batter, it's not too heavy. The small order is enough for 4 ppl. *Potato salad and macaroni salad - not offensive. *Chicken - really? suck it up and get the ribs! *Salad - just order more ribs...

Best BBQ place in San Diego, hands down! ... But then again, I haven't tried too many other BBQ places ... yet. But, I FINALLY tried it after many attempts. Every time I come to San Diego I try to come here, but either they're closed or it's just a personal fail with my friends. So YAY, finally a win. I got to go with my family and it was the bomb-diggity-bomb! I really enjoyed my experience. Here is the sum up. I didn't have to wait in a long line. My food was ready pretty fast. We found a good seat. My freakin' BBQ pork sandwich was amazing. They aren't stingy on the meat; they load up that sandwich like no other. The coleslaw was holycrap GOOD. They have everything you need (like water, HANDWIPES, boxes, etc.) available for you whenever you want/are done. I just went a week ago and I think I'm going again this Sunday. I'm so excited already! (:

Just tried the ever so easy take out option at Phil's. We phoned it in and waited 10 minutes or so. Upon arriving at our humble abode I started to worry about the bread maintaining its freshness and the soggy, sloppy thoughts started to haunt my taste buds. HOLY BAT SH*T BATMAN! Its still good! The onion rings were still crispy and hot. The fries on the other hand steamed a lil' in the box. The Broham maintained its deliciousness and that my friend is effin' take out!!! P.S. Keep in mind...

Here's the trick if you want to grub: GO STRAIGHT TO THE BAR AND SEAT YOURSELF! The wait was long but my bf took me by the hand and led me through the bar door and we just took a seat. The server was there to take our order and we just gotta go pick up the grub ourselves. Easy Beezy. Now... that the wait is over, their baby back ribs are in fact one of the most succulent melt-in-your-mouth POWS I've ever experienced. I love it!! Order it with a Mac Salad! DONT ORDER the pulled pork sandwich... it could not measure up to the ribs at all. It was kind of dry and I've definitely had better pulled pork before so just come here for the famous ribs!

BBQ is the god-king of all American food. I had the pleasure of coming here this weekend with my fatty-licious LA friends and one Austrailian. I had the pleasure of proudly exclaiming that Phil's BBQ was the best BBQ in SoCal and watched as our Austrailian guest's eye's widened when he recieved his tray full of baby back ribs, macaroni salad, and fries. "Why are the small servings in America the size of large servings in Austrailia?" he asked. Because PHILS IS BOMBTASTICALLY AWESOME and gives with tons of food for a reasonable price. The baby back rib rack is sharable between two people - soft, succlent meat with a tangy bbq sauce. ASK FOR EXTRA SAUCE ON THE SIDE - you're going to want more to drizzle your sides with and drip your fries in. I don't know what it's made of and don't care - it's sweet tangy deliciousness that fills your mouth with utter JOY. The choice between beefy ribs and baby back is a personal choice. The baby back ribs are easier to hold and eat. Macaroni salad here is MUST.

So this place does have fall of the bone tender ribs. And yes, the lines are long. I called in the order to take to go since this was my first time here and I didn't want to be disappointed in standing in a 2 hour line. I think calling in was the best idea, you can eat these anywhere. We got the baby back ribs which were super tender. The beefy ribs were surprisingly good and tender. El toro- the tri-tip sandwich wasn't bad either. It has a strong hint of charcoal smoke taste. Onion rings were huge, extra batter coating which was crispy, but a but too much shell for me. Fries were ok. Sides: baked beans, cole slaw and mac salad- the slaw was probably the best tasting, the rest was ok. Overall, if you want the full on experience, I guess you can stand in the line and wait, or come at the right time for a shorter wait?? Calling in was just fine for me. I can't say it's the best I've ever had since I haven't had all the bbq meat in the world just yet, but so far, this is high on my list of bbq goodness.

i definitely believe that this place lives up to its hype. Êwhen me and my friends first arrived the line went around the FUGGIN BUILDING! but you know, we came all the way to SD, so we HAD to try PHILS BBQ!!! we got in line and it actually went by pretty fast. they also gave us samples of their onion rings in line too so that was nice (': waiting in line is a part of the phials bbq experience in my opinion because they have this lil section where you can take pictures and you can look at other ppl eating and see what they get and all that shiz! pretty fun! OH yah! and this place is not one of those sit down and order restaurants! you actually go up to the cashier and place your order then pick it up when your number is called! props to phil for this because this is actually a really efficient way of conducting business if you know what i meannn! k now on to the food! well i wasn't really thaaaaat hungry so i shared a babyback rib dinner, which included a full rack of baby back ribs and 2 sides, with my friend. babyback ribs: like everyone said, it was mouthwatering. super tender and perfectly cooked! definitely recommended! finger lickin' good! macaroni salad: this was also very delicious. complimented the ribs very well and if you like macaroni salad, this will nOT disappoint! cole slaw: DEFINITELY recommend this side!! after eating ribs you need something to cleanse your palate, and this cole slaw is so refreshing and yummy!!! OH YAH AND THERE ONION RINGS ARE THE SHIZ!! THEY ARE HUGE AND BATTERED AND SO YUMMY. way better than jeff's burgers onion rings which are just like basic onion rings.... phil's are large and in charge... k anyways! this place was poppin forreals and if you are a meat lover or rib lover or food lover in general, hit up phils! he will show you a good time!

WHERE: Sports Center Blvd (right by Red Lobster). I know this because gps was giving us a hard time, so we were circling the premises for about 20 minutes! WHEN: 11am-11pm, son! WHY: Ahhh!!! The previous reviews were the truth. ABSOLUTELY UHHHH-MAYYY-ZINNGGG!!! WHAT: Our tour guide/older cousin took my brothers, the youngsters, and I to the destination! GPS wasn't our friend at the time, so we pulled over to ask someone where phil's bbq was- he said it was straight ahead!! We circled and passed it for nearly 20 minutes!! When we parked and got there, I noticed the restaurant was pretty big! The line wrapped around the place like an amusement park ride. Funny thing, when you got to one of the corners of the line, there is a sign above that said "you have 21 minutes & 14 seconds from this point" -HILARIOUS! WHAT WE HAD: (I had to take a bite out of everything that I personally didn't order for myself) -Broham Burger: bbq pulled pork & coleslaw! Amazing!! (Of course, my pick) -Beefy Ribs & chickless dinner: this was my brother's pick. The beefy ribs were BEEFY ALL RIGHT!! I would surely come back for this!! This is my recommendation as a first timer! -Baby Back Ribs & chicken dinner: my other brother's choice. The ribs too, were falling off of the bone!! Another recommendation!! -BBQ Cheeseburger: my younger cousin's choice!! Great choice, the burger was pretty huge!! That definitely got her 100 percent full!! -Onion Rings: perfectly battered & made. Great big rings!! A large plate can feed the table!! -Macaroni salad: This is one of the sides you are able to choose from. I'm pretty picky with my macaroni salad, and this was YUMMY! *NOTE: Remember, if you are a first timer, I undoubtedly recommend the beefy ribs!!! My number 2 pick would be baby back! Also try some macaroni salad & onion rings if you still have space left in that tummy of yours!! Have fun PHILing yourself up with BBQ sauce & quality ribs!! =D

This place sells really good ribs and calls it bbq. Ê Do not go here expecting North Carolina style, Texas style, Kansas City style, or even california style bbq. ÊIt's just ribs smothered in bbq sauce (definitely not memphis style either). ÊThe crowd is thick and diverse. ÊEverybody loves this place.

An uncle from the area suggested for me and the boyfriend to try this place while we were staying in San Diego. It was a Saturday night around 6 pm and the line was past the restaurant. According to the employee who was outside, we came in at a good time as it can go past the restaurant and wind down other stores during the weekends. Our wait took almost two hours. Boyfriend and I split a half dinner of the Beefy Back Back Ribs and their onion rings. Then we each had their El Toro Sandwich, which is their BBQ tri-trip sandwich. The portions were big, so we ended up packing both our sandwiches and onion rings to go. If you like tangy BBQ, that's how the food tastes. It's a place to visit at least once when visiting San Diego.

first time we went to there. BBQ is Sooooo Goood. (baby back rib, cole slow, macaroni salad) why i place only 4 stars. because we waited 1 hour..... even sign said 14min. (outside corner) but when we went to inside, we could find few tables were available. i want them to up-date service. i didn't say i don't want to wait. need quickness. Again,their BBQ is good. if you have a chance, you should go. but you need some extra time, though.

The first thing on my mind after waking up Sunday morning was, "Who's down for Phil's?". ÊSurely, my buddies and I arrived 30 min before the store opened and there was already a line outside, but not a long line.. ÊThe dinner line is far worse cuz I've seen! I like to go all out for these types of rare occasions so I ordered a full rack of baby back ribs with coleslaw and sweet bbq beans all to myself, along with a full order of crispy onion rings with ranch to share with the buddies.. And wow.... The ribs were hands down tasty, had plenty of meat on each bone, and was tender... ÊYou can definitely acknowledge the time put into the food.. ÊWhat more can you ask for? Oh and the amount of sweet/tangy bbq sauce drizzled on the ribs was perfect, just enough so you can taste the flavor of the meat with each bite. ÊAnd yes, ribs were conquered... I paid less attention to finishing my sides but the coleslaw and sweet bbq beans were a great combo with the ribs.. ÊThe crispy onion rings were also good but too oily IMO. ÊRanch was good too. Why are you so far? I want more!

One of the Best and the most Awesome BBQ joint in SoCal! The girls ordered "The Best of Both": Baby Back & Bone-in Chicken (which was only $12.25!) and I had the Beefy Ribs dinner (little fat, extremely tender). We go our order within 10 to 15 mins. Food was definitely cooked to perfection! Smokey, Tangy, and a little bit spicy...SO DELICIOUS!!! Meal comes in a relatively large potion so if you have a small appetite, there's probably gonna be left overs. If you do have left over ribs, wrap them in tin foil and use oven for reheat to keep meat tender. The restaurant staff was very nice and attentive. The line was huge but worth your while!

Stopped at Phil's on my way back from San Diego on a Saturday night. Luckily I went after the dinner rush and only waited 20 mins in line. After my 20 minute wait they announced that the credit card machines were down and they would only take cash. They directed all the cashless people to the ATM where I had to pay $4 in fees to have enough cash for dinner. I wasn't too happy about that. Neither were the many other parties that didn't carry enough cash. I took off a star for that. As for the food. I gave the Broham sandwich a try after reading some yelp reviews. You definitely get a lot of pork for your money. The sandwich is almost impossible to eat with your hands. The BBQ sauce was delicious but without it, the pork would be too dry to eat. I would say that the sandwich is more quantity than quality. The side of baked beans was good but not much better than a can of Bush's baked beans. The restaurant is clean and service is very good. I would come back and try the ribs next time. I probably wouldn't order the Broham sandwich again though.

AS ADVERTISED. I've been here once, and that one time i went I actually drove from Los Angeles to San Diego just to eat this meal. My friend was hyping it up so much I just had to go EAT some ribs. I waited a solid hour during dinner time, as you stand in line you will gaze at the Red Lobster on the other side of the restaurant and you will want to give up and go there. DON'T DO IT. I finally got up to the front and I was so hungry from all the waiting and driving so I ordered a full rack of beef ribs and paired them with macaroni salad and french fries. My friend got a half rack of baby backs and man, they looked so puny next to my big beef ribs. If you go with a big group of guys and you get the baby back ribs and all your friends get the beef ribs, you will feel embarrassed... don't be that guy. The beef ribs were charred just the right amount and very juicy and tasty. The macaroni salad was the perfect compliment to these fine pieces of meat. I had one of the baby back ribs, it wasn't much more tender than the beef ribs, just get the beef ribs, trust me. I eat a lot, and boy did I try to finish that meal... but I'm glad I didn't since it tasted just as good the morning after. Fantastic meal that costs just over $20 (full rack + drink). If you are in San Diego and in the mood for BBQ, just do it.

By far the best BBQ I've ever had. ÊIf they were compared to cars, it'd be the Rolls Royce compared to a Honda. ÊThis place just knows how to make their ribs. Ê First off, let me tell you about how popular it is. ÊIts so well known that there is usually a super long line all of the time. ÊI don't know about weekdays, but for weekends the line is usually 2 hours for both lunch and dinner. ÊBeing someone who's never heard of Phil's BBQ before, I would be thinking these people are stupid for waiting in such a long line for just a piece of meat. ÊBut I bet that once that person try's it, they'd be back for more. ÊDefinitely worth the wait!! Ê Me and my girlfriend arrived for lunch at around 12:30 and there was a huge line. ÊIt was going to be about an hour and a half wait. ÊThere were two couples in front of us and I overheard the worker tell them that the bar is open seating and that there were seats for couples in there. ÊNext thing I notice, both couples found seats inside. ÊWe waited a little longer and then the worker asked for couples of 2 and took us in right away to sit at the bar. ÊI was thinking "OMG this can't get any better". ÊAvoided an almost 2 hour wait. ÊSo if your in a small party of 2, give the bar a try, just as good as a table. Now for the food. ÊI ordered the Beefy ribs and also the Baby back ribs for me and my girlfriend. ÊWe also both got a corn for the side. ÊThose beefy ribs were huge. ÊThis pig must have been taking steroids. ÊFor anyone who comes here they basically need to order the ribs. ÊThey were cooked to perfection. ÊI could taste the BBQ flavor from the ribs and the combo of the sauce just made it explode with flavor in my mouth. ÊThe corn was alright, it was just a plain corn on the cob, but it was good to eat with the meat. Ê Overall, if you don't have the time to read all of this, AMAZING! ÊI would definitely come back here again and I hope they start expanding. ÊCould be a little bit pricy, but worth the wait and the price.

Phil loves Phil's BBQ! The 5 stars isn't just because we share the same name neither. If a restaurant over 500 miles away can continue to force saliva out of my glands then it def deserves 5 stars. And even though there's already a plethora of reviews for this place I still feel the need to add my two cents: 2 minutes = our exact pre-order wait time. Skipped the whole 1-2 hour-wrap-around-the-building-line, ordered, and was eating within 5 minutes. My MO: a full rack of pork ribs sided with fries and coleslaw. #Crack. Tried my friend's beef ribs. #Crack. The sauce itself was #crack; tangy, savory, smokey, zesty, zingy... #LiquidCrack. Our server was on point and even gave us free dessert. Aside from the occasional moan of satisfaction, you could almost hear a needle drop as our group of 9 was in deep concentration, inhaling our food in unison. Not a single soul was disappointed. Walking out of Phil's to see that the same group of people (that were in the very back of the line upon our arrival) STILL haven't ordered = priceless. Our special VIP experience combined with crack food was enough to exceed 5 stars, easily. At last, a place that's hyped accordingly.

Phil's full-rack baby back ribs: look up succulent SUCCULENT: succulent [suhk-yuh-luhnt] -adjective 1. FULL OF JUICE; JUICY. (Phil's ribs are the juiciest, most delicious ribs ever to be consumed by my mouth. the meat is cooked TO PERFECTION so its soft and tender and juicy juicy juicy!!) 2. RICH IN DESIREABLE QUALITIES (the ribs are smothered in delicious bbq sauce that does not overpower the meat, but compliments it perfectly. they also give you extra sauce on the side, if you run out!) 3. AFFORDING NOURISHMENT (the ribs are very nourishing for starving little kids like me. there is a LOT of meat on the bones, unlike some bbq restaurants that only offer you like, the skeleton of an animal. we're not dogs, we dont pay money to chew on bones.) POSSIBLY ONLY DOWNSIDE: the lines get LONG. call in advance if you're to-go-ing, but if you're dining in, bring lots of friends, like the super talkative ones.

Just like the other 3000 reviews, Phil's BBQ is AMAZING. Ê The onion rings are divine. They are so crispy and so delicious. I absolutely love onion rings and these were probably the best I've ever had. I'm salivating just writing this review. I ordered the half rib order dinner of baby back ribs with a side of fries. I thought 6-7 ribs might not have been enough, but they were more than enough and the fries were good and plenty. I'm pretty everyone tried really hard to finish all their food. Portions are def worth the money. I went for lunch; the line was about a 40 min wait, but also def worth it.

400th review goes to Phil's b/c Phil's is bomb. Ê If you're looking for a place to sit down and pick up a quick bite to eat, this is not the place for you. ÊIf you don't mind standing in line to get SD's best BBQ, then you've come to the right place. Ê The food here is simply fantastic. ÊI prefer ordering the beef or baby back rib dinner. ÊThe beef ribs comes with 5 ribs and the baby back ribs with 10-12 bones. ÊBoth choices give you one large side or two small sides. ÊIt's enough to feed 2 people or in my case...my second dinner. ÊPhil's covers any amount of ribs you need, so pick one that suits you. ÊThey really are the best ribs I've ever eaten and I've tasted a lot of ribs. My favorites sides are the fries, coleslaw, onion rings, and baked beans. Ê I have eaten the BBQ chicken here, but I'd rather have slow cooked, fall off the bone, and melt in your mouth ribs. Ê If ribs aren't your bag, then turn to the sammies! ÊThe pulled pork and tri-tip are the way to go. ÊThey give enough meat in those for 2 sammies! ÊI haven't tried the cheeseburger, turkey burger, chicken breast or garden burger, but this is a BBQ place...why would I order those? FYI: ÊPark on the left side of Phil's. ÊThat area is always less busy. ÊTry going during non peak hours. ÊI prefer just ordering take out. ÊTake out is usually faster and you could get your hands dirty in the comfort of your own home.

ÊToday, we went to Phil's at 1:30pm and there was no wait for food or a seat. ÊDon't get me wrong, the place was still crowded but manageable. ÊThis was my first time eating in the main dinning room. (Usually I sit at the bar section to avoid the other hungry barbecue lovers and their barbecue loving kids. ÊPlus BBQ is much better with booze. ÊI had the Broham Êwith Coleslaw on the sandwich itself. ÊMy food took a while but it was worth the wait. ÊThe BBQ sauce is so flavorful that my taste buds tingle - perfect combo or salt, vinegar, and spices. ÊThe meat was moist. ÊThe Bread had a crispy outside but soft inside. Ê(I only wish that the bread was more easily cuttable). ÊThe baked beans were good as always. The french fries are delicious- it comes salt-free which I love, because the potato tastes smooth. ÊWell enough my rambling, Phil's is truly a five star establishment!

There's not much to say but juicy, tender, and absolutely DELICIOUS. The meat falls off the bone, and the bbq sauce is tangy and doesn't overshadow the meat!

When I left at 6:30, the line was 45 minutes long, so COME EARLY!!

The very fact that this place has 4 and half stars as an OVER ALL rating is straight STUPID. RIBS: They sucked, period end of story. ÊI judge my BBQ based on two dishes served at the place, brisket and ribs, and they dropped the mother FN ball on the ribs. Where's the smokey flavor that bbq is supposed to have? ÊWheres that delicious dry rub? The sauce was mediocre, the fries were limp, and on top of that my ribs came out cold. Let's just say that my ribs came out hot, it still wouldn't make up for the lack of flavor, smoke, and care that was supposed to be in the food. Sides: Macaroni salad was average not going to hate. Fries were sorry! limp as hell. I tried something else too but it must not have been worthwhile cause I don't remember what it is. Overall: If you have not grown up eating bbq, If you have not had GOOD bbq then HELL YEAH you will love this place because the prices aren't bad. HOWEVER, if you really love your barbequed meats done the right way, steer clear suckas cause you will come hungry and LEAVE PISSED.

ÊThough it ended with me holding the line while my amigo ran off for a pre-dinner burger, I'm glad I stayed. ÊOne look at the heaping piles of meat laid out in front of me, and I was instantly full. Ê To get the full taste of Phil's, we got the (smaller) half rack of both the beef and pork ribs, and sides of both corn on the cob and onion rings. ÊDid I mention this was post K-Chan's Double-Double? Ê The servings are huge -- five, foot long beef ribs are given in the half order. ÊThe pork ribs aren't much smaller, either. ÊWhile K-Chan liked the beef ribs for their gamey texture and fatty juiciness, I was more partial to the pork ones. ÊI know, leave it to the Jew. ÊBut really, the pork ribs were cooked perfectly with a crispy, almost flaky texture on the outside, and well flavored, fall off the bone meat on the inside. ÊThe sides on the other hand were mediocre -- the corn lacked the crisp flavoring of fresh corn and the onion rings were overly battered -- and took an obvious backseat to the BBQ. Ê So why the three stars and not more? ÊCall me biased, but Phil's BBQ sauce just isn't up to par. ÊThough tangy and flavorful, it lacks the depth and heat of places like Oakland's Everett and Jones. ÊMy NorCal pride runs deeper than K-Chan's stomach.

Shared a full rack baby back ribs dinner with a friend and to my surprised I was pretty satisfied. They do not skimp out on the meat! I heard so many things about this place before coming that I thought it was being overhyped, but Phil's did not let me down! Didn't get to try all the sides, but the fries and the onion rings were perfect compliments to the ribs. If you're in SD anytime, this is one place you should definitely give a try.

The place to go for the best barbecue in San Diego! Meat, meat, glorious meat. We had a ridiculously wonderful experience eating barbecue recommended by both people standing in line and the restaruant staff. Yum! I love this place. We ordered the pork rib dinner and it was pork-tastic! It was cooked to perfection and had all the characteristics of pork ribs you only see on the food network: melt in your mouth tender but not so much that it falls of the bone. The barbecue sauce has just heavenly! We also got the Tri-tip sandwich called El Toro and the pulled pork sandwich called BBQ Broham, Both sandwiches were recommendations from a long term follower who we met while waiting in line. She's was right about the sandwich being a great value! ÊThere was what seemed like a pound of beef layered on top of slaw. It was heaven in a bun! We also got a side of onion rings, baked beans, and macaroni salad upon the recommendation of the cashier. It did not dissapoint! Our experience began as we got out of our car. The smell of barbecue was enticing. As we were seduced into the building, we were shocked to see a line that went out the door around the side of the buliding. It was surprising because we got there at 3:40pm on a Sunday afternoon. It was during a Chargers - Vikings game, no less. Then again, the line wasn't all that suprising given there was over 3,000 Yelp reviews and the place still ranked 4.5 stars. The food must be really good....and it was!!! The line moved rather quickly. Once you get to the counter you place your order and found your own table. We were told that sometimes people hover until they get one. Fortunately, we were able to find a table without any waiting. The servers were also very helpful. There was the person who points you to an available cashier to place your order, then there was the cashier, the bus boys, and the manager. They were all very attentive and friendly. They were also very alert to whether you were a first timer to the restaurant. Rarely do you find a gem of a place where it seems like all the food they serve is really really good. Even, rarer is the place that has staff that seems to be happy to be there and to help you maneuver through the barbecue choices. If you want to have excellent, mouth-watering barbecue, and, a really good dining experience, come to Phil's. You'll be glad you did!

Tasty, but not "real" BBQ. Been to Texas a few times before, and smoke meat at home; so in my mind, BBQ's about the flavor in the meat, not about drenching it in high fructose corn syrup and vinegar and calling it 'BBQ'. 3 stars for phone-in/take-out efficiency, flavorful sauce and crispy/battered onion rings. (Only) 3 stars for meat that is "cooked and slathered in sauce" rather than smoked and flavored, and for the high price for what you get. San Diego, you guys need to venture outa state and taste some "real" BBQ. Really.

It was the BEST BBQ I've ever had!! We went TWICE during our 3 days 2 nights stay in San Diego! Even my old-fashioned-asian parents LOVED the food (I was extremely surprise because they usually only like asian food!!). The line was ALWAYS LONG!!! It was weekdays and rainy and the line was really really long!!! Both times, we waited for about 1 hour to get in!!! Most people like their baby back ribs.. but we actually loved the Beef Ribs better.. and there were LOTS of meat on the ribs!!! I can't wait until my next San Diego visit to go to Phil's.. it's so delicious..I don't mind the long wait!

The food here is definitely really good. The Beef ribs are tender and delicious. The BBQ chicken is awesome. One of the best things about this place is the sauce, the bbq sauce has that classic bbq flavor. Add some tabasco for heat, and its perfect. The only set back about this place, is that is it always crowded. I suggest you call ahead and take it to go....TAKE IT TO GO....CALL AHEAD....It will save you at least an hour...

Phil's BBQ has to be one of the best restaurants I have gone too. I always heard about this place and gave it a try. I was completely blown away. You do stand in line for quiet a while. There's even a sign that says your 20 minutes away from ordering your food by the entrance. I ordered a Beef Rib Dinner. It comes with three (3) ribs and either two (2) small sides or one (1) large side. Decided to go with the 2 small sides and got the fries and macaroni salad. The ribs were huge. Nice and tender. Not really a fan of BBQ sauce. I prefer dry rub. Phil's is a rare exception. The sauce was sweet and it had the right amount of spice. The fries were crispy and the macaroni salad was great. If you are a local to San Diego or just visiting, you have to go to Phil's BBQ.

After trying the Phil's BBQ in San Macros, I thought that maybe my bad experience was just with that location. Maybe this location was better- after all it has an hour long wait. Clearly, it must be good. AHAHAHA, no. The wait just makes me feel like an idiot for waiting so long for food that wasn't that good. Yet again, the sauce was deathly vinegar-y. It's like they're trying to pickle my insides! Luckily, I got the sauce on the side so I didn't have to suffer through it. My Big Sis and I split a Pulled-Pork Sandwich with coleslaw. Holy cr-p....there is enough meat on this sucker to make like 3 good-sized sandwiches?!?! Which would be great...if it wasn't on the dry side. And had some large, tough chunks to chew through. I guess the dry issue could be fixed by pouring their vinegar sauce on it... -_- With a bit of sauce and a heap of coleslaw, the sandwich was okay. Nothing to rave about though. The two-star rating pretty much sums up my Phil's BBQ experience- Meh. I've experienced better. ÊThis place seems to built on a lot of hype and not a lot of results.

After all these reviews, need I say more about how awesome Phil's BBQ is. We arrived in SD around 230pm. Perfect time to come because there wasn't a line and I've heard it gets pretty long (wrapped around the building). Got in and ordered, sat, food was ready in 10mins. their fries are soft on the inside, crispy on the out. Yumm! Colesaw is delish, not drenched with mayo. And the Ribs, woooh....so good!! Enjoy!!

Despite the heavy amount of positive reviews, I personally find the restaurant average. I found that my order of baby back ribs was heavily over-sauced, with the actual meat lacking any of its own flavor. I wish I had more sides to down the ribs with, because after just a few bites, it became almost tedious to eat. What I do recommend, however, is the combination of beef ribs and chicken with a side of corn. In this case, the ribs do have its own flavor and are not dependent on the sauce. The chicken also provides a different texture and flavor, and the corn is juicy and delicious. Unfortunately, everything else did not fit my palate.

Finally...The Top Raw Man... Has come back!.... To San Diego. And, waited 21 minutes and 14 seconds (just to eat at this place). Well I'm not Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson to make such an electrifying statement. But I've finally tried this BBQ spot and overall I must say I'm quite impressed. For $46.00 split between five people (roughly $10.00 each) we got the following: Main Dishes -Full Beef Rib Dinner (with one large side) -Pork Rib (Half Baby Back Potions only) -Colossal Onion Rings -El Toro Sandwich Sides French Fries The El Toro's tri-tip had a nice char. Which also gave out a nice smoky after taste and with Phil's signature BBQ sauce it was superb after every bite. The Pork ribs were a lot smaller than the Beef ribs but it was just as succulent and moist, the meat fell off the bone and it was delicious. The Beef is probably well worth the money out of everything. Large in portion, juicy and moist like the Pork. Reminds me of my favorite spot (Matiki Island Barbeque, Anaheim, CA), just prepared differently and a bit more expensive. With the sauce it takes the flavors to a whole new level, with a bit of tanginess, spice and sweet. The Fries were filler but it was nice and crisp and the Colossal Onion Rings are bigger in portion (as opposed to Umami Burger's pricier and smaller version; various Los Angeles, CA locations) and had a nice deep fried crisp to it. Would a lot of people consider this overhype? Probably, but to me at least it delivered. Pricey? Too an extent, but it's worth trying at least once. Would I ever come back? If I ever get to revisit SD (which wouldn't be for a while again). Cheers, you earned my five stars.

What can I say that hasn't already been said? Yes the wait is freaking ridiculous but even so, people still line up; a testament to the good food right around the corner, like all the way down, then left then allll the way down, right, then right again into the doors, yeah right there! If the average hour and a half wait doesn't whet your appetite, then the pictures of juicy ribs circulating on the flatscreens near the door will. After surviving your journey in a line rivaling the Star Tours grand opening, you will be greeted by a very friendly host who will direct you to the cashier to order. Food portions do not disappoint and are priced very fairly. The most expensive thing on the menu is $20, so get your grub on! Beef Ribs, Pork Ribs, BBQ Chicken, try them all! The sides are awesome! Potato & Macaroni salads definitely win points. Slaw is a bit on the sweet side, but if you like sweet then that's a good thing. Fries aren't as crunchy as they look, so that was kind of disappointing. The BBQ baked beans definitely saved the day though. All kinds of delicious, and the my fellow passengers had hell to pay on the ride back. Oh yeahhh, can you say bean, beans the magical fruit? Bottom line, bomb BBQ & bomb service. Protip: Come early to avoid long waits. Like early early. Like 3 o'clock early.

Because I NEVER enjoyed the taste of bbq sauce, i waited in the hour long line extremely hungry and somewhat angry (honestly) But oh boy it was so worth it because my idea of bbq sauce has been changed! CUE THE VOICES OF ANGELS! the prices are fantastic and the food comes out quickly! My boyfriend and I ordered the full rack of beef ribs. The side of macaroni was absolutely delicious. Our cesar salad was too drenched in cesar dressing but I cant complain. How could i forget the onion rings?! wait, I CANT! Being an onion ring enthusiast, I am always on the search for the perfect onion rings. Phil's wasnt it but it was pretty close. The beef rack's won me over. The meat fell off the bone as I pulled one bone away from the rest. The wait is worth that delicious rack of ribs. What surprised me the most was how the sauce WASNT too sweet! I loved it! It had a great kick and the sauce + the tender meat = the ultimate bbq rib experience.

3 1/2 stars! I've been here twice. ÊI know I ordered the Baby Back Rib Tickler my first time, which had three ribs but I don't have a good recollection of my experience. All I know was I wasn't that impressed. Nothing special really stood out for me. Maybe cause the place was really overhyped for me. I came back a second time a few weeks ago and ordered Baby Back Rib & Chickless Dinner. It included 4 ribs and a few chunks of boneless chicken. The baby back rib was really really tender. The meat kind of just slid off, which I loved! However, I thought they went a little overboard on the BBQ sauce. It was to heavy and overwhelming for me. The chunks of chicken weren't that great either. It was a little dry. I had a side of Macaroni Salad and Fresh Cut Fries. Loved the Macaroni Salad!!! Fresh Cut Fries were good too and portion was huge!! I also had a chance to try the Onion Rings. Yum! Tasted just like Funions!! Oh and I tried a bit of the Beefy Rib, but I don't recommend it. It's not as tender as the Baby Back. I'd come back again but I'd probably just order Baby Back Ribs this time.

IT'S LIKE I DIED AND WENT TO BBQ HEAVEN! This place is totally worth the wait! The line is ridiculous if you come on a weekend but you will not regret it! I ordered the half BBQ chicken half ribs combo with macaroni salad and coleslaw as my sides. Everything was so amazing that I cannot find words to describe it!! The chicken was very tender and basically fell off the bone. The ribs were delicious and worth the mess! I am always looking for the place with the best macaroni salad or coleslaw and Phil's easily won me over with their sides. There was very minimal conversation throughout dinner because everyone was too busy eating so you can imagine how good the food was!

This is a must read review!! So I was looking for a good bbq joint to cater my little dinner party of 15 people. I like Phil's so I decided to chose them to cater my function. I was a little questionable choosing them because I will need to pick up the food at 4pm on a Sunday (ultimate peak hours), but I decided to have Phil's anyways. I arrived at Phil's about 5 minutes early and was pretty scared that I would get my food late because it was incredibly busy.. I mean SUPER busy.. But right smack on the dot at 4pm they were ready with the food and it was perfectly packed. I ordered 15 dinners of the beef bone ribs with coleslaw and potatoes which did not end up being as expensive as I thought. It was a very reasonably price! The ribs we VERY neatly packed in two big trays and was put into a bigger Styrofoam holder which kept the meat hot for a very long time!! The coleslaw and potatoes were also neat in their own trays. There was many bowls of extra bbq sauce and had plenty of hand wipes! I was super surprised by how organized everything was.. AND IT WAS ON TIME DESPITE HOW BUSY IT WAS! I do advice you to order a few days in advance like I did. I very much recommend them for catering your parties! And don't get intimidated by how busy they are.. You will be pleasantly surprised. Bravo Phil's, bravo

The food was outstanding, not just terrific value for dining but seriously tasty and well cooked. We had a couple of 'best of both' dinners with a Beef rib/chicken and also the other Baby back rib/chicken - in two words, friggin awesome. Add some coleslaw as well as the finest beans I've ever tasted. All in all so great I even bought the t-shirt. No actually I bought 2 Phil's BBQ t-shirt just before I left! One for my fat brother lol.

Something happened to Phil's recently.. either they have a new meat supplier or they are getting lazy? I thought it was a one-time thing, but it's happened twice so obviously Phil's is not keeping up with it's good reputation. Last time we visited their chicken was dry and their ribs were not falling off of the bone. In the past we have had no complaints about Phil's. We may give it one more shot since Phil's has been so good in the past. Come on Phil's!

Phil's makes me homesick for the Carolinas. Not because the food is so incredibly good that it reminds me of home, but because it makes me wistful remembering how much better real barbecue is back home. While Southern Californians and transplants from other parts of the country may assume that any backyard gathering that consists of meat cooked over fire and drowned in sauce, this simply isn't so. Don't get me wrong, Phil's has excellent sauces for their ribs, pork, and chicken, but the meet is supposed to be falling-off-the-bone, melt-in-your-mouth tender and succulent, and this is where they fall short. Add in the fact that there's always a ridiculous line to get in, and it makes me long that much more for the tiny, off the beaten path barbecue stands that dot the state routes and highways of the South.

I'm usually not a big fan of BBQ. The first time I tried this place, I had the Baby Back Rib & Chicken Dinner with a side of fries and beans. Everything was very good. The rib meat literally just slid off the bone. THe chicken was super moist. But nothing really blew me away. The fries were just ok. The onion rings were good, but I couldn't have more than one since they were so heavy. The second time I visited, I tried the Pulled Pork Sandwich. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!!! I liked the pulled pork SOOOO much. Based on the pulled pork sandwich I give this place 4 stars. If I ever go back, I will try the burger. Private lot. Expect to wait 45+ minutes

Came by for dinner the other night and I think I missed the boat. Arrived slightly before 6 pm as I've heard about the long lines. Upon arrival, we were promptly greeted by an expeditor. The cashier was also friendly. As were the bus boys and waiters. The half-rack baby back ribs for $11.25 were okay. The ribs were mainly tasteless except at the edges. The BBQ sauce was too strong and had too much of a vinegar taste to it. The onion rings were bland and oily. They seemed fresh but were cold by the Êtime I ate them.. All in all, an okay place for baby back ribs and onion rings. ...definitely not worth a wait...

If you don't eat meat but want to, and dont want anyone to know - call the order in, go through the bar entrance. + Call in your order and pick up or eat in the bar. + Ribless, chickless and mac salad. * super long lines so call it in and pick it up.

ÊIt looks like they don't give enough bbq sauce but it's actually just the right amount so don't bother with ordering an extra side of sauce cuz you really don't need it. ÊThe flavors are intoxicating, they are just amazing ribs...i'm salivating just thinking about it. For our sides, we enjoyed the beans + slaw... oh many, those were some sweet, smokey beans! ÊI gobbled them up, they were divine. Êand the slaw was standard...we contemplated fries but since id had some earlier in the day i opted out. Êbut they're good and they have this seasoning on the table that go perfect with them. Êwe also got a full order of onion rings...YUM!! ÊBut even with 4 people chowing, a half order would've been fine...we had way too much food.

Phil's is a restaurant in San Diego that everyone needs to try for the experience, have to find out what the hype is about. The customer service is wonderful, but the line is like waiting for a ride at Disneyland only to be satisfied, not astounded, by the end of it all. The chicken is alright, it can definitely be juicier. The beef ribs are dry and chewy, and mostly huge bone - go with the baby back ribs. The baby back ribs are soft and Phil's BBQ sauce is drizzled all over it, but it is also a little dry and not as fall off the bone as many claim. BBQ should be about the meat not just the sauce. Phil's is really just about the sauce and it really isn't for everyone or the best. The sauce is mild, sweet, yet tangy. You don't have a heavy, smoky, spicy BBQ flavor that I personally enjoy. This is like the really toned down version Dad's make for their kids - so I guess it's "for everyone." I think I've had every single side here. The coleslaw, potato salad, fries, corn, and everything else is really very average. I personally like the macaroni salad and baked beans; they're much lighter in flavor and not too rich or sweet like most you'll have. The onion rings are worth a try but expect overly battered, thick onion rings that you will probably get tired of after just a few so split them for sure. Go for the experience, let your own taste buds tell you what's up if you survive the line.

Too much hype. The Good: The potato salad is an EXCELLENT side, they have VERY AFFORDABLE food options, they give you LOTS of fries. Baked beans were sweet, flavorful, and very enjoyable. The Bad: Semi-long line, but bearable. Sauce on the ribs was REALLY tangy and a LITTLE salty. The Ugly: Hype, hype, hype, hype, hype. I wouldn't kill anyone to eat the food here. The Verdict: Don't get me wrong, they have great food here. I DEFINITELY want to come back to try other things and hopefully be impressed by other main dishes.

I think with all the hype I was expecting a little more.... But it was still pretty good. Baby back ribs were good and tender, but the meat was more smokey and charred rather than juicy, greasy, flaky & drippy. Not that it should be, different folks different strokes, but that's how I like mine. However, I bumped them to 4 stars for: Macaroni Salad: BOMB, not what I expected. Small, al dente pasta and not too creamy. Fries: Mounds of them for a small side Onion Rings: Great airy batter and thick onions Beef Ribs: BIG PROPS. Beef ribs are different, the texture is tougher and the flavor more robust so they're not for everyone but I love em, and Phil's does an awesome job on them. Suuuuper tender, perfect chew, not overpowering flavors. Beans and Cole Slaw though a bit of a let down.

This is specific to my experience and the items I bought. I've lived in San Diego for about a year now and decided to try this place because I had seen it on TV and I enjoy good BBQ. Went on a Sunday evening and the place was packed line around the building, so we decided to come back at a less busy time. Came back on a Tuesday night and the same thing, line around the Building. Well we thought this might be a good sign of good food even though the wait was unappealing. After waiting for 35 minutes outside we finally made it to the cash registers, I was expecting to be seated but thats not how this place works, you order your food and find a seat on your own. When your food is ready you go pick it up at the counter. Again annoyed that we couldn't get table service but I understand thats not how this place is set up so whatever. We go up and order our food I got the Pulled Pork Sandwhich and some fries. Found a table and waited for the food. It came out pretty quickly which was nice. One thing that I can't stand though is the tip cups at the register. I have worked service jobs in the past and you tip based on a service provided and the quality of that service! At this place you seat yourself, pickup your own food and refill your own drinks! All after waiting 30+ minutes in line. Im not tipping someone for simply punching my order into a computer! Now I would gladly tip, and tip very well, if we had a table with a server but don't expect me to tip you for doing the same job that people do at McDonalds everyday too. And the guy that we ordered from was rude to boot. The portion sizes are good here and I was excited when I got my plate that was piled with food on-top. But after taking a couple bites of my sandwich I could tell that it was WAY over salted, To the point where my girlfriend could tell something was wrong by my face when I was trying to eat it. I am not one to complain and I don't want my money back all I wanted was a decent BBQ meal that I just didn't get here. I will say though that my girlfriend had the ribs and they were pretty good, and after trying them I wished I had gotten them instead. Personally for me this place is not worth the wait or the crowd of people that you have to deal with, when the food isn't over the top good then its hard to justify coming back. You are better off going somewhere else if you aren't prepared for the lines and the style of dinning that is provided here. If you do go my best advice would be to get the ribs and don't have high expectations of anything else.

I utilize my 5-star ratings sparingly and Phil's BBQ deserves the top starage. From what I hear there usually is a long line, but it goes very fast and the staff is friendly and helpful which helps the wait become more bearable. I had the Beef ribs and chicken combo. It was great. The BBQ sauce has a bit of sweetness, a little tang, and a small kick. Again, it was great! The best thing about the chicken was the tenderness. It was perfectly cooked and juicy. The portion of the dinner was large. Big enough to share, but I suggest to get your own and take home the leftovers! My friend ordered the onion rings and I tried one. They were good and crunchy. I also had a Caesar salad on the side and wasn't too hot about it. I'm not a big Caesar fan, but have had some good Caesar dressing, this wasn't one of them. It's not bad, just not great. If you're in San Diego do Ênot miss Phil's BBQ...it is the best I have ever had and I have had BBQ in Kansas City!

I waited in line for over an hour. the line was so dreadful, my friend and I just had to treat ourselves with beer from the beer stand. what better way to kill time. I got the Best of Both Worlds: Babyback Ribs with boneless chicken. Ribs tasted like ribs, chicken was very tender and juicy. The bbq sauce didn't stand out to me at all. it tasted like Honey Bbq to me. The fries were fresh, Macaroni salad was bomb. I got a small side of Ceasar salad.. that shit was pretty big so it filled me up that I barely touched my ribs. *Very fast service, pay and seat yourself type of restaurant. I really don't know whats the hype all about though? I think it's probably because the ribs are inexpensive here compared to most rib joints and they are very generous with their portions. One plate could easily feed 2 people. Or maybe it's just me, i think all ribs taste the same. I wouldn't come back here again.

This place is amazing!!!!!! my co worker always talks about this place,but since I live in Los Angeles, its a long drive to go. three weeks ago we planned a trip to sd to watch the angels padres game and we finally had the chance to go!! the line was long, out the restaurant and around the corner, this place must be really good i thought. i think we waited for about 40 minutes. i ordered the "el toro" sandwhich which is tri tip, my wife ordered the baby back ribs. the taste was awesome, like nothing i had before. they put a little too much sauce on mine which was okay but i wanted to taste more of the tri tip then anything. i also felt that it needed some coleslaw just to add a different texture but all in all it was delicious!!! we also ordered the onions rings (amazing!) with their homemade ranch/buttermilk. we loved this place so MUCH we drove down there the following week Ê(this weekend) Êjust for the food!!!! lol and we even ordered some to go plus bought some of their famous bbq sauce!!!

Coming from a guy that doesn't usually prefer BBQ, this place is good. As far as reviews, everything I've read about Phil's BBQ is pretty spot on. The portions here are huge and accurately priced for BBQ. It takes quite a bit of food to fill me up and I get relatively full after an order of Phil's Tickler Special(cheap and filling). Not much more to say, except GO HERE! If you're living/visiting in San Diego, this is one of those places you just need to try.

If you haven't tried Phil's BBQ then you are missing out. Their ribs and chicken are so tender and juicy, the taste buds explodes in your mouth once you take the first bite. I believe this place is known for their BBQ sauce which is its own. You can buy a bottle at the front desk and make your own Phil's BBQ at home. This place can get quite pack and waiting time is maybe around 10-25 mins. The best part about Phils is the price. Good price with good food equals a must try. Try it out! You wont be dissapointed.

A lot of people I know have said this place is amazing and they cannot get enough. So one day I came with my brother, family friends, and boyfriend (who has lived somewhere in the South for a while). First of all, the line was too long and customers were being very rude and trying to squeeze through the incoming line (but this review isn't about the customers). Anyways, let me tell you now that the long wait is NOT worth it. When we finally got to the front, I felt rushed to order. It was most of our first times there, we're not regular even if we are native San Diegans. So I ordered the chicken, and my boyfriend got the ribs and I can't remember what everyone else got. The chicken was so dry, and I asked for more sauce over and over and the sauce made it worse. It was too tangy and down right sticky for my taste, not enough of that real "BBQ" sauce taste. I think backyard BBQ chicken from any household is much better. Also, my boyfriend's ribs were insanely dry as well. I was pretty embarrassed because I could tell he was not at all satisfied. Honestly, I could make better ribs than this. He expressed how this BBQ was nothing compared to what good BBQ should taste like. In my opinion, not worth the time and money. I don't really care if this is San Diego and we don't know what amazing BBQ should taste like, but I promise you this is not it. You can't just give credit based on region. A 5-star review should be based on customer service (which, well there was none), the meat (it was DRY, I can't stand dry meat), and the sauce (I personally didn't enjoy it but you may like tangy, sticky sauce). I suggest going to that hole-in-the-wall place Coop's West Texas BBQ if you're looking for some great BBQ.

This place should be called Finger Lickin' Phil's cuz, damn... after Phill you will always have to lick each of your fingers! The lines are loud and the dining room is noisy, but thats all part of the experience. The best part about Phil's is that Phil knows how long the lines are going to be so he gives you a full stocked bar! The bartenders were nicely interactive and the manager on staff was an extremely awesome, fungi. He was so down to earth and chill that it felt like we were hanging out on the patio having a few brews with the dudes. Phil's is everything "they" say it is. It was like a blessing in my mouth, MmmmMMmMore... Êevery time succulent Phil's BBQ slowly dripped onto my taste buds... I felt like I was at Danny K.'s! ÊFrom the tasteful cowboy decor in the dinning room, the amazing manager, and the fully stocked bar... Phil's is BY FAR... the best. Ye-haw! Woohoo! As good as it gets! PS. Phil's, I have to tell you a quick story... I was reading over this review and I read the part where I wrote, "blessing"... thinking it may be over the top, but not minding enough to change it... I finished my review and then looked to my right to read previous ones... and I noticed that there are a lot of "religious" phrases or word-ology in the reviews... (ie) choir of angels... So now I've come to the conclusion that Phil's is the guardian angel of BBQ. Cheers!

Okay, disclosure up front: I'm a Texan and like my BBQ to taste a certain way. Phil's was good; however, for me personally it was too "smoky" in the flavor.

SOLID bbq joint w/ a SOLID WAIT! good thing our friends let us cut in line! I felt like I was at Disneyland when i saw the "approximate wait time from this point 21 minutes & 14 seconds" just get in line (which you can see live on their website), order up front, & you will be seated as you are waiting to pick up your food! I shared the 6-7 pork rib order that comes w/ 2 sides w/ my friend! I THINK we would have been fine sharing the 4 rib order because we were STUFFED the bbq isn't amazing, but its fall of the bone tender! i think i would order the ribs dry next time since the sauce is tangier than I prefer! the macaroni salad & coleslaw were mediocre, though the fries reminded me of In N Out. ON TOP of our order we got the "small" onion rings. WELL if that's a small i don't even want to know how big the LARGE is! these were hands down the BEST ONION RINGS IVE ÊEVER HAD w/ that crispy light batter!!!! P.S. i am loving the reasonable prices!!!

Why has it taken me so long to eat at this place. This place is on point with everything from the sides to the baby back ribs and beef ribs. I am very picky with my BBQ and this place has it all from the sauce to the smokey flavor even if you do not add sauce to the ribs itself. The meat, no kidding you, falls right off the bone and the BBQ Pull Pork sandwhich is really good. To the other reviews who said the smokey flavor was not there must like Lucille's which in my opinion is the bottom dweller of all BBQ. Over 3000 people cannot be wrong for this place. The wait is worth it!!!

My husband wanted to go see what the hype is all about for this joint. Personally I would never care to wait in a long line that wrapped around the parking lot. 2 hrs later we placed our order: 1. half baby back rib dinner w/side of fries & sweet baked beans *rib was moist, fell off bone, fries were like any ordinary fries, beans were good 2. beef rib dinner w/sides potato salad & macaroni salad *rib was moist, fell off bone, both salads had the exact same mayo sauce - nothing special 3. el toro tri tip sandwich *thinly sliced tri tip sandwich was good & tender 4. colossal onion rings *ginormous size fried onions, a little on the greasy side 5. 1/2 chicken *very moist & tender Phil's bbq sauce is a little too tangy for me and it was slightly on the salty side. Overall, it was a good meal. The staff were friendly & attentive. Not worth the 2 hrs wait. I wouldn't wait more than 35 minutes when I return in the future. Way too hyped.The ribs that comes out from my family's grill taste just as good, maybe even better, cause it Êfalls off the bones & melts in your mouth & our bbq sauce isn't overloaded with vinegar. **TIP, to AVOID the LONG wait, if you have a small group of less than 4 & 21 yrs of age or older, you can walk straight to their bar & order your food there** Learned this after we waited 2 hrs. Another tip - this is not the greatest place to take your child when long waiting is involved. Our 9 yrs old son almost cried from waiting in line so long. It'll be our first & last time we ever make him wait that long for food lol!

Your looking for a quick meal? This ain't the place because the wait is at least 30 minutes! My first impression of the place "HOLY CRAP LOOK AT THAT LINE" I would say its a little overrated and not something I would be willing to wait an hour for.....and yet I do for reasons I do not know -_- Get ready to get your fingers dirrrrty because your ribs will be marinated with intense amounts of bbq sauce! Their baby back ribs are the best! HANDS DOWN! :) I haven't been there in forever but its a good place to go with a big crowd. I hope i'll be able to go before I go back to LA for summer vacation!

My girlfriend and I drove down to San Diego on the Fourth of July, hoping to sink our teeth into something patriotic. As we approached Phil's BBQ, we spotted a long line of people out the door, wrapped around the side of the building. There was a sign at the corner that read, "Approximate wait time from this point: 21 minutes, 14 seconds." We've stood around longer for crappier food, so we dove in without hesitation. My girlfriend and I ended up getting half a chicken, a half slab of baby back ribs, a small potato salad, small coleslaw, and a small order of onion rings. Let me begin by saying that THIS IS WAY TOO MUCH FOOD FOR TWO PEOPLE! We should've just stopped halfway through our meal and taken the rest home like responsible adults, but we were already in the zone, that stomach-says-stop-but-brain-says-keep-eating zone. Anyway, the barbeque chicken was not very impressive. While the flavor was great--smoky, sweet, and tangy with a light kick--this is attributed more to Phil's original barbeque sauce (which is slathered on everything) than anything else. The meat of our chicken was quite bland and the skin, while nicely blackened on one side, was anemic and unappetizingly flabby on the other. We ended up eating what we could and discarding the rest. The side dishes we ordered were decent. The coleslaw had some nice texture, but the potato salad could've taken a lesson in ergonomics. Giant chunks of potato almost a cubic inch in size place the emphasis more on "potato" than "salad," which is good or bad depending on user preference. Personally, I prefer it a little less chunky. The onion rings, which come with a side of homemade (guessing) ranch, were a hit, and were probably our second-favorite thing on the table. The baby back ribs, obviously, were the highlight of our lunch. Phil's ribs taste DELICIOUS. The pork has this perfect char, not overly done as to dry out the meat, but just enough to seal the essential savory juices inside. You know that feeling you get when you search through an old pair of jeans and find a five-dollar bill that you didn't even know you lost? Translate that feeling into a meal and you'll know what I mean. Phil's BBQ is popular for a reason. They make good food accessible to Californians, food that I've only dreamed of tasting since spending some time in the American South. Come hungry and order the ribs. It will be worth the wait.

MY QUESTION TO THEM AND ANYBODY ELSE IS THIS--HOW CAN YOU CALL THIS TRUE BBQ WHEN IT HAS NEVER BEEN SMOKED. ÊTRUE BBQ IS SLOW COOKED USING SMOKE---PERIOD. CALL IT SANTA MARIA STYLE BBQ OR CALL IT THE BEST GRILLED RIBS OVER MESQUITE--BUT PLEASE DON'T CALL IT BBQ JUST CAUSE IT HAS SAUCE ALL OVER IT. ÊALSO, BBQ DOES NOT MEAN SIDES--SIDES MEAN SIDES. Ê i have gone to Phil's twice as my nephew-A MARINE and his wife love the place. Êit has great grilled meats and good sides and a very vibrant and noisy Êatmosphere. Êits fun and high octane--be prepared. Êsome might complain about the prices-- i think if you want to go out and enjoy a good family meal and enjoy it--YOU SHOULD BE WILLING TO PAY FOR IT. Êotherwise go to micky d's and get the MAC-RIB SANDWICH AND CALL IT A DAY. Êif you can't afford to go out, don't- and act like you did.!!

San Diego is famous for surfer dudes, Sea World, my house, and Phil's BBQ! Ê Waiting in line at Phil's reminds me of waiting in line at Disneyland. The line winds all the way around the restaurant. ÊIn fact, they even employ a motivational guy who is there is answer any questions you may have about the menu, the restaurant, and to convince you that the ridiculous wait is worth it. What I would order here: Entre: BBQ Short Ribs Appetizer: Onion Rings Small Sides: Macaroni Salad, Potato Salad, Cole Slaw What I would skip: Entre: BBQ Chicken Small Sides: Fries I was disappointed that our BBQ Short Ribs and Chicken was cold. ÊPortions were huge so it's definitely good to share. ÊDinner for three came out to $36.00 including tax (no tip required here because it is self seating). The wait: If you call in and ask about the wait, it will most likely be an inaccurate estimate. ÊWe arrived at 6:15 PM on a Thursday and was told that the wait would be about 35 minutes. ÊThe actual wait? ÊA whopping 1 hour and 10 minutes. ÊThey lose.

Phil's BBQ is the best! I'm not a huge fan of bbq really, but Phil's is SOO GOOD. Like omgah. I usually order the bbq chicken or the ribs, I can't pick a favorite because both are delicious. Love the bbq, love the macaroni salad, love the onion rings! Definitely a must have. The portions are huge, too, so be prepared to get super full! I try not to go here when it's poppin, because the line gets really long and I don't like waiting, haha. So I usually go late, like around 9pm, or early like 4pm to avoid the long line. If you're visiting SD, or live in SD but haven't been to Phil's, GOOO. It's worth it :) I know so many people who don't really like bbq, but they give Phil's the exception. :)

Tip: pork ribs and pulled pork Everytime I'm in SD, this place must be visited. The wait can be ridiculous but they now serve beer while waiting in line. If you want to avoid the wait, just call in and order for pick up, head to the counter and only wait about 10 minutes for your food. This is what we did. The pork ribs are amazing. The sauce is solid, the sides are good. There's not really much else to say other than. WOW. I did not do the pulled pork this time and went for the beef ribs instead. Extremely tender and almost falls off the bone. This is one of my favorite bbq spots and must be checked out for anyone visiting the SD area.

The staff will bend over backwards for you, even with our large group of 25+ people! All of the food here is soo good. Beef ribs are probably our favorite: Gigantic slabs of tasty beef on huge ribs! For sides, macaroni & potato salad are our favorites. Finish off with a Whoopee pie!! Yum! Tip: if you can find a spot to sit at the bar, you can skip the line & order food from there.

Phil's is YUMMY! I don't usually enjoy BBQ, but due to the super high ratings, the episode of Man v. Food, and my husband's love of the stuff, I decided to give it a try. Upon our arrival, we were met with a line wrapping around the building. ÊMy husband decided he didn't want to wait in such a long line, but I talked him into it since we were only in San Diego for a few days. When we moved a few spaces up in line we saw a sign that quoted a wait time of less that twenty minutes...kind of like the signs you see at amusement parks to get on a ride. ÊThe sign turned out to be pretty accurate, as we managed to sit down and eat relatively quickly. The staff at Phil's is friendly and fairly attentive even though you're responsible for placing your order and picking it up at the counter. ÊThey still come around to your table and make sure you're doing alright and will get you almost anything you may need. So, as for the food....because of Phil's, I can now say I love BBQ. ÊThey're sauce is tangy and the meat is moist and tender. The sides are super delicious, too. ÊWe got a plate of the beef ribs with chicken and a plate of the baby back ribs. ÊAll of the BBQ was yummy! ÊFor the sides we got the mac salad, the fries, and the corn. I think the mac salad is some of the best we've had...it was light and flavorful. ÊThe corn was sweet and complimented the meat nicely. ÊWe ate the fries with ketchup and some of the BBQ sauce that had dripped off the ribs which was super yummy. After we had nearly finished our meal we talked about trying to get back to Phil's once more before returning to SF. Unfortunately, we were unable to make it back on that trip, but will definitely revisit the next time we're in SD.

I suggest three things: Come on an empty stomach, make sure your waistband is mostly elastic and don't wear white. Phil's BBQ is by far the best place to get BBQ'd foodgasms. I am not a fan of waiting, but I have already subjected myself, more than once, to waiting for more than 40 mins just for a bite of Phil's meat (laugh all you want, perv but it's true). You'll need a bib to read the rest of my review... I've gotten the Broham, which is delicious pulled pork topped with coleslaw, slammed between a bun and the Rib-less Dinner, which is chunks of pork shoulder smothered in sauce. Both times the meat has been BBQ'd to perfection and is never greasy. Sides I've devoured: (Not all at the same time and shared with the bf) Macaroni Salad: macaroni with a creamy sauce- pretty good Potato Salad: red potato chunks with celery and mayo?- needed salt Corn on the Cob: sweet delicious corn on the cob- amazing Coleslaw: generic coleslaw, not too creamy- pretty good Fries: too well done and tasteless- not recommended The seating can get a lil sticky, but the host is there to regulate and she's not afraid of kicking out people that stake out tables before the rest of their party orders the food. So be warned!! If this review wasn't convincing enough, go down to Phil's BBQ and consider your life changed.

Phil's needs no introduction. It's so good that I'd drive down to San Diego just to eat at Phil's. My must haves on every visit: I like the tangy, not too sweet sauce on the side. 1. Baby back ribs - nice, juicy and tender with smoky flavor and CHAR Ê 2. Beef ribs - excellent smoky flavor, amazing char on the outer edges and moist and tender when you bite into them 3. Onions rings - perfect texture, not soggy (unless you take it home), crispy 4. Mac salad - great texture, Êgood consistency, doesn't taste too mayonnaise-y I don't think no other BBQ place in Southern California can beat Phil's. Phil's provides great service, a casual atmosphere, friendly people working behind the back despite the fact they're constantly busy, and tasty food; it's a perfect combination.

The meals are very fulfilling. If you're not full after one, then I you must be a beast!! For the price the food's pretty good, but don't expect anything gourmet. It's just very hearty BBQ. i love the onion rings though! If the rib meals are too much, try the sandwiches. And be sure you have A LOT of napkins at your table. You're going to need it.

I always get the baby back ribs! They're soo good!! Even though the wait takes awhile, I'm always more than willing if BBQ Ribs await me at the end. The format of the restaurant is lining up to order at a counter, find a seat somewhere, then pick up your order when it is ready. I've never really had a problem with finding a seat since the food does take about 5-10 minutes, where there's BOUND to be a table leaving within that time frame. Other things I recommend: -onion rings (crunchy & golden!) -BBQ Broham (pulled pork sandwich).. DELISH!!

!!!!!!! So yum! I ordered the "Broham Burger" with a side of macaroni salad. The Broham is a burger overfilled with succulent pulled pork drenched in their homemade barbeque sauce. (You can buy a bottle of their sauce, too.) I asked for the coleslaw on the side but it's usually sandwiched inside the burger. The pork was really juicy and tender. The coleslaw wasn't too overwhelmed with mayo either, just the way I like it. The burger is about $7 while the sides are $1.50 for a small serving and ~$3 for a larger size. The "Broham Burger" is definitely a must try item on the menu. It will fill you up.. I could barely finish half! You can't go wrong ordering other stuff from the menu though (i.e. rack of ribs, chicken, veggie burger, etc) because everything is delicious at this joint. Did I mention that their onion rings are massive and are about the size of half of my head? A must-go place if you're visiting San Diego! P.S. They're closed on Mondays.

Get the Broham!!! ÊIt's the most amazing pork shoulder sandwich (and Southern style with cole slaw on the bottom). ÊAmazingly delicious, and less than $7. ...but you have to get the onion rings, too.

HOT DAMN!!!!!! This is great BBQ!!! Ever since I moved to the area I've been dying to try Phil's. But their perpetual line that wraps around the building has always deterred me! But when the sis and her fam came in for a visit, they suggested we order some Phil's for pick up---per their friends' suggestions. And it was DEE BEST idea ever! We called in our order and were back at home within 20 minutes with bags full of bbq. Although I didn't go inside to pick up the food, the sis said it was extremely efficient---and she's a freaking tough cookie to please! I wasn't that hungry so I ordered the pull pork sammy without any sides. It was GINORMOUS! Easily the size of my head with tons of succulent and flavorful pork piling out of the bun! My sis also ordered the same sammy so we decided to just split one and have the other as leftovers. Between the both of us, one sammy was plenty!!! My only suggestion would be to order more bbq sauce because I prefer my pulled pork sammys to be smothered in sauce. We also had the baby back ribs and bbq chicken that were both a hit. Ribs were tender and chicken was super juicy! Prices are extremely reasonable----especially considering the serving size! This is a MUST try! And if you're not down for standing in lines than do what we did and take out! :)

Very tasty! An excellent place to eat with friends and have a good time. They have a very large selection of dishes and the portions are generous, be sure not to harass the the cooks (according to the warning sign). I've only went once so far and I'll go back back again. The only real negative of this place is the long wait in line, so come in early!

This is more for the people who only eat chicken rather than ribs but you're stuck going with your friends anyways. Outdoors: There is always a freaking long line at anytime of the day. It sucks, but I guess it's a good strategy for the the restaurant to keep everyone on point. Minus one for the long line, but I do like the fact that they've hung up Indoors: Always crowded which is a bit irritating, but it does add to the food's personality. I would much rather pick up food than have to wait in line for an hour. It is a good hangout place though if you do have the patience. Food: I actually don't eat ribs, but I do eat chicken. Their Chick Tickler is pretty bomb. The sauce that they slather on top is quite tasty. The fries are alright unless you put a bunch of seasoning. The onion rings are delicious and very crispy. There's nothing worse than a soggy onion ring :-/. I personally don't think the coleslaw or potato salad are anything wonderful, but to each his own. Price: Like I said, I don't eat ribs so I'm not sure how much theyre supposed to cost, but the food I have eaten wasn't very pricey. About 7 bucks for a filling meal.

What can I say about Phil's that hasn't already been said, when I lived in SD back in the day it was in PB I think. Anyhoo its ALwAAYs busy so dont be in a hurry, (if you are get it to go),but theres a reason why it's busy: good bbq! I need them to make more healthy options for when I want to cheat on my diet but still feel like I'm on one.....but whatever still love the place! Happy that they have wine here, ya know not every lady is a beer drinker, thanks!

My German friends came here, and we took them here. They loved it!!! We also got the BBQ sauce with the beer guy outside while waiting in line. They have really good customer service. My German friend wanted to buy 4 BBQ sauce, and so the guy wanted to get us a good deal. He called his supervisor and they gave us 2 free gooba dust! Awesome! I marinated ribs for 4th of July using their gooba dust and their BBQ sauce, it was delicious, tastes just like PHILS!!! (without the wait) Everyone at the beach was looking at our grill, smelling the nice BBQ ribs. Germans really loved it. Thanks Phil!

Best BBQ I've had. It might not be saying much since I've only had BBQ in California, but man this is some finger-lick'n good ribs. It's a shame I ordered the ribs to go, but I'm gonna go there in person soon. Even take out, it was delicious. Opening the Styrofoam container, I came upon a half rack of tender pork ribs drenched in their tangy, smokey, tasty, BBQ sauce. The sides weren't anything special though. Definitely worth it to go to this place. I'm not looking forward to the line though. Get the ribs for sure. I can't imagine them fresh.

Though many skeptics out there think: Rocky's, Canada Steak Burger, and The Neighborhood all got robbed out of the Burger's Championship belt. The competition, pound for pound, dollar for dollar, against Phil's BBQ is a losing battle. Phil's is the reigning champion of San Diego foodies. Unless you are a tree hugging vegetarian...but then you wouldn't be comparing burgers to BBQ, anyways. Phil's, the best place to eat in San Diego.

BEAST FEAST! Great for beast feasts. If you're a beast you have to feast here. It's a great pig out restaurant where you just come to get stuffed and sloppy with BBQ sauce flying all over the place. You know a place is popular when there's a 20minute wait and the restaurant hasn't even been open yet. Got here when it opened at 11am on Friday and there was already a line! Parking lot full...couldn't believe it, but that just made this place seem that much cooler. I would recommend coming here as early as possible, but no matter what you're going to wait. Didn't want to over stuff myself for my first meal in SD, so I chose the BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich with a side of french fries (instead of ordering the full ribs). It was deeeelicious, filling, and the portions was more than enough to make a hungry dude full. A little too much of their BBQ sauce which was a little overwhelming, but that can be fixed next time. If you're from out of town add this place to your list of places to eat in San Diego.

A buddy came from Munich, and the first thing he said when he got off the plane was "When can we go to Phil's BBQ?" Since Phil's was open, we loaded luggage into the back of the truck and headed right from the airport to the restaurant. ÊIt being 6 PM on a Friday, there was a line, that, when we joined, looked to be about 40 minutes from the door. Cellphone to the rescue, we called in our order (2 half racks of ribs and 1/4 chicken, large fries on one, fries and potato salad on the second, along with a burger and small onion rings). ÊOnce we called in, we went from the 40-minute wait to the call-in line, which had 1 person in front of us. Ê We paid for the order and I sat to wait to pick it up while the other two in my party went into the bar to watch whatever was on TV and enjoy a beer. Ê8 minutes after our order was paid for, we had food!! ÊWe proceeded to a local park in Ocean Beach, broke out our orders and proceeded to become engorged on ribs, chicken, onion rings, fries, potato salad and a burger. As always, the ribs were falling off the bone tender, and our friend from Munich asked if we could go back and pick up bbq sauce for him to carry home. ÊWe will make that run before we drop him off at the airport. ÊThe chicken, tender, moist and flavorful, and the burger, cooked perfectly to order at medium well always satisfy. Ê Don't change a thing!

What can I say that already hasn't been said about Phil's? ÊI've visited San Diego on three separate occasions and eaten here four times. ÊComing from an island where we don't have that many "good" BBQ restaurants, perhaps I'm not the best person to judge the quality of BBQ food, but all I know is that the food here is delicious, the portions are humongous, and it is quite inexpensive for what you get. ÊI used to get the Baby Back Ribs/Chicken combo, but the last time I went with just the ribs and it was Fantastic. The other thing besides the food that people mention is the long lines. ÊThe last time I went around 600 and waited for about an hour. ÊThe craziest thing was that we finished our meal around 830ish and the line outside was just as long as it was at 600...and this was a Wednesday night!!!! ÊI'm not even sure when the best time to eat here is. ÊI think it's best just to go there knowing it'll take 30 mins to an hour and plan accordingly, or you can call ahead and take it to go, but it just isn't the same as being there. Would I go back? Every time I'm back in town....

Oh Phil's BBQ.. the secret but not so secret of SD (Thanks Guy Fieri for the publicity! :P) Wait can be long if you go around dinner time, so I like to go around late lunch (2-3pm should be okay). There's also a smile cam on the website so you can check live how long the line is! -Onion Rings: Huge, but lacked flavor. All I tasted with just fried batter.. needed some salt, pepper, paprika, etc. -Fries: Pretty good, fresh cut, and they give a huge portion of it. Reminds me of in-n-out fries. -Macaroni Salad: It was just okay.. not that great. -Potato Salad: Huge chunks of red skin potato w/ skin still on. Okay as well. -Cole Slaw: Usually I am not a fan of cole slaw, but the cole slaw here was yummm-o!! -Ribs: Yep.. they're delicious. The best ribs I've had at a BBQ place. I like that it wasn't too drenched in sauce everywhere. I prefer to be able to taste the grilled meat. -I would recommend just getting the kid's meal b/c its the right portion... everything else on the menu is huge. My only real gripe is that there never seems be enough ribs to sides ratio. I always have way more sides to eat than ribs... and I like to eat my food in a semi even ratio so I don't get super tired of any one dish. The portions are big and price is a lil expensive but just split with a friend (expect to be eating a lot of fries...) Overall, I still come here from time to time if I'm really craving some good bbq ribs or just came back from mission beach (5 minute drive away). For me personally though I wouldn't wait in an hour long line .. but points for being the best in SD :)

I am visiting my friend & the First thing he did was take me to this place. The smell of this place is mouth watering! Okay, so we ordered the baby back ribs (a whole back), Two half of BBQ Chicken, BBQ pulled pork sandwich, got Corn on a cob (large side) so we can feel we are trying to eat our veggies, & a BBQ cheeseburger!Yes we were starving! It was soooo good! I was so in love and in massive food coma. The baby back ribs were perfect! What bones? It slided right off. The chicken wasnt dry at all! Oh & the pork sandwich....OMG...Makes me drool just thinking about it. As for the cheeseburger, I can take it or leave it. Idk Why I got a cheeseburger at a BBQ place. But whenever I see burger on the menu, I gotta have it! There was honestly barely any food left once we attacked it, only one half chicken was left. But we picked on it hours later. It was one of the best BBQ I ever had!

It reminded us of the bbq we would get when we visited in Austin, TX but with superior sauce. The girls split a rack of pork ribs with the sweet baked beans and cole slaw, friend had the pulled pork sandwich and I had the corn on the cob. We all split a tiny order of onion rings. Leading it off having a couple of drinks and our bill came up to just under $40. There was so much food that we struggled to finish and still weren't able to finish. I'm typically skeptical of corn on the cob from restaurants but this was fresh and sweet. The ribs could have made just a little much more flavor, but the pulled pork was nice and smoky. I missed the pineapple bits inside the cole slaw, however it was still tasty, as well as the beans had been a excellent balance of sweet and zesty.

Thanks to my fellow yelpers.. I've decided to phone-in my order because I wasn't going to wait in the rain. The gal over the phone told me it will take approximately 10-15 minutes and they won't bag my order until I get there. It was my first time there and I found the phone-in order line hard to find. There was people everywhere! Some gave me dirty looks as I passed them. I wasn't cutting, but I felt like I was. I was in and out of there in less than 10 minutes! *My full baby back rack was not melting in my mouth. They were a bit dry. *I ordered the dinner, which came with 2 small sides or 1 large side. I chose cole slaw and potato salad. Not the best. *Small order of onion rings was enough for two people. They were huge and so good! The best I ever had...

PHIL'S BBQ - 12.17.11 [The Story] It's College Bowl Game Saturday & all my bro-in-law has in the beer fridge is an abundance of COORS & a half case of his wife's Longboard Lager (which is a'ight, but wasn't about to dent her supply). I ask if it's possible to make a (craft) beer run before the afternoon games start..."SURE!" he replies. His buddy, Armando G. says "Phil's BBQ is right around the corner from BevMo, let's pick up some ribs, you fly I'll buy!" "Beef ribs?" pointing at my wife... "Beef ribs?" pointing to her sister... "Beef ribs?" pointing to bro-in-law... Before pointing towards me, I tell him that I'm still full from brunch, so I'm good. I guess he wants BEEF ribs. I'm not a real fan of beef ribs & prefer baby backs, but hey, he's buyin'. Armando is on the phone placing his order before we're out the front door. He asks for 2 orders of Beefy Rib Dinners, which consist of 5-6 bones each & a couple of sides, which is more than enough. Beef Ribs ONLY (no sides) - $18 per order Beef Ribs w/Sides - $20 per order "30-40 minutes? Cool!" After picking up a couple sixers of assorted IPAs, we headed for Phil's. The girl on the other end of the phone order assured "Mondo" that the order would be ready when we got there. [The Skinny] WTH? There's a line around the building! I've never been to Phil's so I was somewhat surprised. Thank gawd it was the "dine-in" line. As we head towards the front doors, I was happy to see that there is a second line...the phone-in/pick-up line. Mondo asks about his order & the girls says, "it should be about 5 minutes" & hands him a paging coaster. No worries...we wait outside & there's a beer cart which also sells Phil's BBQ sauce. COOL! So we purchase a beer for each of us and before we're done with 'em the order is ready to go! It's a great idea having beers available for those waiting in line. That line IS long! [The Downlow] We get the beers & ribs home and sure, I had a rib...and as expected, a little tough, but by all means, meaty AND tasty. The baked beans were delicious, but the potato salad seemed...familiar. Nothing special. Pricing is very comparable to some of the better BBQ joints in my neck of the woods (Los Angeles). I'll give Phil's beef ribs 3.5 stars since I've had worse, but not nearly as good as most. I'm definitely going to order the baby back on my next visit...so please look for the update in the near future. BTW: Phil's bbq sauce is the shiznit! I'll have to pick up a bottle on my next visit to S.D. Eat, drink & be awesome. deez¨ out!

Super long line. At least it gave me time to decide what I wanted because it was one of the hardest decisions I've had to make in a while. Watching the people through the windows devour their food as you're helplessly waiting in line did not help either. I ordered the best of both Beefy Rib with 1/4 chicken and a half rack of Baby Back ribs in addition because I wanted to try everything. The ribs were so good I wasn't able to make it to the chicken. Good amount of BBQ sauce, super tender and juicy meat, and delicious sides. I'd wait an hour just to have these again. Definitely a must-try if you're in the area. If people are waiting outside, the food must be good right?

Phil, wherever or whoever the heck you are, ÊY U SO GOOD OKAY yesss phils is SUPER overhyped, but what!? its still good :) I got the tri-trip sandwich along with a full rack of babiesssss! alright, beef ribs are bigger and chunkier and all, but gahhh i love babybackribs! they dont overuse and overpile sauce on the ribs, but they give enough so that it stays marinated and covered, without it drying up. the meat is not too chewy. the ribs fall right off from each other clean. the tri tip was awesome. its good. not worth the money, but phils is not too much about getting whats worth the money...no matter what you get at phils, you're bound to overpay. the babybackribs were realllly good. i liked it a lot. OKAY HONESTLY i dont remember too much about the food because i came here a week after taking out my wisdom teeth..it was incredibly difficult to eat, but i still tasted everythaaaang muhauha.

Fall off the bone tender baby-back ribs. The sauce is well-balance, with a rich smokey flavor and a slightly spicy twang to it. Best ribs I've had in Cali, hands down. I wished I lived closer so I could also try their beef ribs. The sides we ordered weren't spectacular. The fries got MUCH better once they soaked up the rib sauce but the mac-salad was just too peppery. Tip: Skip the loooong-line by getting take out; I was in-&-out in 5min with a heaping plate of ribs.

Seriously great place for BBQ. Another awesome find thanks to Yelp! Really sweet prices and huge serving of food. It's like a fast-food style restaurant where you order at the counter and sit down wherever you can find a seat. The lines here can get ridiculously long, but you can always order take-out. It makes the wait much much shorter. We normally get the baby back rib dinner with two sides and a kid's meal (Phil's ticklers) for me. The ticklers are seriously a great value if you're not a big eater. You get 2 huge perfectly breaded onion rings, so good cole slaw and a large mound of fresh cut fries. With the baby back rib tickler, you get 3 bones and with the beefy rib one, you get one bone. Trust me, it may not sound like a lot with only one to three bones of meat, but you will leave satisfied! The slaw and macaroni salad are our favorite sides here. The slaw goes so well with the meat and the macaroni salad has a great punch on its own. Slightly sweet and tangy, so creamy and delicious. We've tried both the beefy and baby back ribs, and I think we both prefer the baby back. Both are good though and fall-off-the-bone tender. I've yet to try the famous Broham (pulled pork) burger but that's definitely next on the list.

All I can say is this place is seriously LEGIT! After running a relay race from Huntington Beach to Coronado Island, I wanted to get my grub (and drink) on like you couldn't even imagine. ÊI had heard about this place and knew it would satisfy my carnivorous cravings. ÊHow can it not? Phil's, you did not disappoint me in the least. ÊI ordered the full rib dinner, with cole slaw and beans as well as the tri-tip sandwich. ÊTold you I was hungry. ÊThe sandwich was a mound of thinly sliced, deliciously smoked tri-tip with just the right amount of BBQ sauce to top it off. ÊThe bun was steamed and oh-so-soft. ÊThe ribs were fall off the bone good, again with the perfect amount of sauce. ÊNot dry, not drenched ... just perfect. ÊEven the sides were delectable. ÊWashed it all down with a couple Yellowtail Pale Ale's and I was a happy camper :) The line was out the door when we got there, but a quick tip ... you can bypass the line, sit at the bar and order your food from the bartender. ÊThey give you one of those little buzzer number thingies when you're food is up at the pick-up window. ÊGENIUS!

First time coming to this restaurant. EPIC FAIL. Okay we didn't have the Ribs but we came in expecting some really good Bar-B-Que...dont have brisket on the menu, so i ordered a chicken breast sandwich and the husband ordered a pulled pork, fries and bean to share. We sat down Êand waited for our food buzzer to let us know our food was ready..waiting, waiting..and more waiting and others that had sat down after us had got their food and were already eating. the "walk around waitress" grabbed our buzzer and went to the kitchen to check on it. we waited another 10 or so minutes for the food. my sandwich was dry and had what looked like barbque sauce on it but really was hot sauce when i ate it...it was gross. my husbands pork Êsandwich was very dry and the taste was just okay..nothing to write home about. it was a heaping of meat on a bun. the fries were discusting and we didn't touch the beans because they had a film on the top of them. i was very disappointed with this place. most barbque places have beef brisket and sausage and corn bread and sweet tea...they dont. i guess they are only known for their ribs. i will not come back. i say go down to OB and go to the restaurant out there for barbque..

Best bbq EVER. Ê Had the pleasure of eating Phil's again this weekend. ÊThe line, as always, is disgusting and long. ÊBut the ribs are worth every second, minute, hour you wait. The meat falls off the bones. ÊI can literally eat a full rack. ÊThat is what happened last time. ÊThis time, I had to share, so I was nice about it. Ê Don't skimp out on the sides like corn, slaw, rings, and fries. Word to the wise. ÊIf you don't want to wait in line, call in your order ahead of time.

I came here twice over the summer. A friend swear by their ribs and I think I have to agree with them. The first time I came I had the half rack ribs with a side of steamed veggies. The second time I had the same thing but with the sauce on the side. The reason why I had the sauce on the side the second time was because I am not a huge fan of saucy foods, I prefer to be the one in control of how much sauce goes on top. Regardless, the ribs are still perfectly delicious with or without sauce! The meat slides off the bones until you reach the cartilage at the top/bottom of the rib. The veggies, were just plain steamed veggies. I stole some fries from my friend before he drowned it with seasoning, and those were pretty good too, but then again, they're just fries to me. Instead of my usual ketchup, I dipped my fries in their delicious BBQ sauce. The BBQ sauce does not have the "fresh out of the bottle" taste which is fantastic!! Phil - please make a "small side" for veggies because I really want to try your other sides in small portions.

Visited San Diego for the wife's sister's wedding and had to stop here because It looked awesome on travel channel. Made sure got there early (before 5), because nothing is worst than waiting in line and being hungry. It's like waiting in a bathroom line for a sporting event :) Line took 5 minutes and we were off to ordering. You order your food and find a table yourself. Don't worry, there's plenty. Got a beer and some wine-in-a-cup and waited anxiously for our food. Food came quickly. I had the BBQ Broham Pulled Pork samich. Damn good pulled pork and coleslaw soaking with all the juices and bbq sauce in the bread. Potato salad was okay . Big chunks of potatoes with lighter sauce. Wife had the ribs and chicken combo. Ribs were great, if not the best I've had. Tender, flavorful and smoked perfectly. Chicken also was good with same smokey flavor, but I'm more of a fried chicken guy. Fries were yummy as well...Needed a lot of napkins, because good food while eating with your hands always gets messy...Service was pretty good and prices were cheap. Food was badass. Must go...go later than 5 and there will be a line that goes around the building.

this is a place for all you meat lovers. super cheap for some really good ribs. we got the beefy ribs and baby back ribs. i personally loved the beefy ribs because the meat around the bones are a lot juicier. but either way, i think it's their bbq sauce. overall, it's prolly like 2000calorie meal but recommend coming here early and sharing

Ribs was cooked juicy but the sauce tasted like Chinese sweet n sour sauce not bar b que. Cole slaw had too much horseradish and pepper. Beans were bland. Macaroni salad was horrible. Chicken was ok. Made a 2 hour trip just to be disappointed. Lucille's is still my #1followed by Famous Daves.

Great Food Horrible Service... After hearing about this place from a couple of friends i decided to finally check this place out. ÊI would have given this place a 2.5 star Review But ill stick with a 3 because this place has one of the best Ribs I have ever devoured. ÊThe Baby Back ribs were Great and the sides of Cole Slaw and Macaroni Salad, Yummy! So why the 3 star Rating? ÊWell, i have no ideal this was a self serve restaurant. ÊMy friend and I sat in the bar together to avoid the long line outside. ÊBartenders were great in serving us and taking our orders but over here they had a pager to pick up your food, OK, that's fine i understand this is a busy place so i picked up our food. ÊOther then that nobody really helped us in anything else. ÊOnly after closing our bill a server came by to check on us, who even called me a Lady when i was clearly a Man...!!! Here's the worse part, after paying my tab and drinking a little they forgot to give me MY DRIVERS LICENSE BACK!!! ÊThis would normally be ok, if i lived locally in San Diego, but i was visiting from Los Angeles!! This caused so much problems!!! and i missed out on many networking opportunities and events because of a missing LICENSE!!!! ÊDon't expect much from this place in regards to service but def come here for the food.

I can't miss a trip to Phil's BBQ when I'm in San Diego! ÊI met up with my cousin for dinner during my most recent trip. ÊThe line was extremely long, however since he got there early, he was able to save me 15 minutes of the wait time. Ê=) Ê The total wait time was approximately 45 minutes and we finally got to the front of the line and to the counter. Ê My cousin ordered the Half Baby Back Rib Dinner with sweet baked beans and fresh cut fries. ÊMy friend and I shared a Full Baby Back Rib Dinner with Steamed Veggies and a large order of colossal onion rings. Ê The Baby Back ribs were so tender that the meat just came off the bone. ÊThe Onion Rings were crunchy and were fried to perfection with a golden color and not overly battered. ÊThe Steamed Veggies were a mix of broccoli, cauliflower, zucchini, carrot and squash. ÊI felt a little better since I had something healthy on my plate. Ê Again, I must say that the prices are extremely reasonable for the amount of food that you get. Ê The staff were very attentive by coming to our table and offering wet naps at the end of our meal. Ê I'll be back when I'm in town!

This place is good. By no means is it Texas BBQ. Born and raised in Houston I tend to compare BBQ places to what we have back in Texas and place was NO where near as good. I would rather go to Texas BBQ on Miramar Rd. over this place. Just my opinion.

After hearing about how amazing this place is, I walked in a skeptic. But, the hype was well deserved. The only downside to the entire experience was the wait. Around 90 minutes in line. It was windy and raining, and standing outside was miserable. Once inside, the line moved a bit faster. Cost was about average - maybe even slightly less than I had expected. The food was done in a few minutes, and it was definitely worth the wait. The tri-tip sandwich was awesome, and the pulled pork was amazing. But, the ribs were hands down the best I've ever had. As far as the service: Zack was our server, and he was incredibly attentive and diligent. Even though he was constantly busy he made sure to stop by numerous times and ask if we needed anything. He was what you would want a server to be. Overall, the line was the only negative thing. If they had more seating, or at least a more comfortable area to wait, this place would be second to none. In my book, still worth 5 stars. The portions are huge - expect to take some home.

Whenever my boyfriend and I travel down here from L.A. we always make sure to pig out and overeat because who knows when we'll be here again? Although the line always looks so long, it moves pretty fast. ÊWe arrived around 1 PM on a Saturday and we only had to wait about 15 minutes. ÊAnd if you're one of those fidgety folks who hate waiting in line, they have a makeshift bar halfway up the line so you can have a beer while you wait. This time we got a full rack of the beefy ribs, the BBQ Broham (pulled pork sandwich), sweet baked beans, and macaroni salad. ÊAmazing!! ÊIt's like they put crack in their BBQ sauce -- it's so sweet, tangy, savory, and just a little bit spicy. ÊI can't get enough of it! ÊGood thing the beefy ribs were soaked in it! ÊThe beefy ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender and simply scrumptious. ÊThe pulled pork sandwich was even more tender and was a bit tangier than the ribs. ÊI vaguely remember ordering BBQ chicken here the last time we came and I was not as impressed. As for the sides, the sweet baked beans were exactly how it sounds. ÊIt perfectly complemented the tangy BBQ. ÊThe macaroni salad was forgettable (sorry!) but provided a necessary carb component. I love that they have Fresca at the soda fountain. ÊIf I didn't want to completely gorge myself out on BBQ I would have taken advantage of their bar as well. ÊDuring one visit I had a few beers at the bar and it completely derailed my food coma plans so I don't do that anymore.

- Baby back ribs - My fav! ÊVery tender! ÊI'll stick to this next time! - BBQ chicken - Good, but too bad the white meat was dry. - BBQ pulled pork sandwich - Good, tons of meat piled on. Their sauce is nice and tangy.. I like! ÊFries, potato salad, macaroni salad, and cole slaw were all good as well. Ê Some tips: - They give a lot of more food when you dine in instead of takeout. Ê - They put bbq sauce on everything, so you'd have to tell them if you don't want it. - Line moves pretty fast.

This is probably the best bbq i've had... just minus one star for the wait... i got there at 4:45 and didnt get to order til 615. ÊMy friend and I sat down at a table and a lady told me we couldn't sit there cuz it was for large parties. So I went to get my food and asked the guy where we could sit.

This place is famous... so don't let my rating throw you.... I'm basically writing this review as a letter of warning: ORDER IT TO GO!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm serious... I can't believe the lines this place has... It is outrageous. Now, I must give you a reason for my 3 stars: I'm not a big meat eater... The ribs are FANTASTIC... the chicken was a little dry in the center... but I came for the SIDES, and I wasn't too impressed... Their beans were very peppery... and their macaroni salad was good, but not the best thing I've ever had. Their fries, amazing.... Other than that, BBQ is BBQ to me... so consider other reviews =)

This place gets 5 stars for HOSPITALITY! Ê So many other big restaurants could learn from this restaurant on how to treat your customers and make a popular place as efficient and friendly as possible for a pleasant dining experience. ÊEspecially for large groups! Yeah, the line is long, but the sign that tells you how long it will take to be seated is fairly accurate. ÊI noticed everything about this place was really clean. ÊBefore we even got inside, someone asked us how big our group was and started to reserve a table for us in advance. And as we got to the front of the line and in the door, the greeter helped group us and send us to the cashier to give our order. The food is very good. ÊJust NOT 5 star good... I honestly think it was because I came away with the sauce tasting overly vinegary. ÊThe price was right. ÊI got the half chicken and half ribs, I think that was the best value meal. ÊThe sides were good too, beans and potato salad, although I would have liked some bits of meat in the beans. ÊEven the meat was well cooked. ÊBut just cant say it was the one of the best for BBQ with that dry, vinegar after taste I had. Ê I'd still come back because they really do their best to satisfy.

I agree with what that one guy said. Phil's BBQ is, "OFF THE MOTHAF**KIN HOOK!" Best place hands-down to get a large plate of meat-fall-off-the-bone-ribs with a large heaping serving of macaroni salad, and a beer. This place is so hardcore for barbeque, they even have a trough-sized sink for washing off your bbq-blessed face and extremities. The only drawback: the lines are FREAKISHLY Disneyland-In-The-Summertime-Six-Flags-Wait-for-?Hours LONG. Can you blame them? It's freaking worth it!

3rd time lucky. Visit 1- THAT line. Forget it. Red Lobster is OK and right next door Visit 2- Closed.....Why? Throwing money away they are, With these big lines, open 24/7 and make hay while the sun shines Visit 3- Got there before 5, but STILL had to wait. I mentioned all this to a guy I met at Golf who ad been here before. "Is it worth it?" I eagerly asked him. "Not really" he said. So, was he right? In my opinion...Yes he was. It was good tasty food, but not worth waiting an hour for in the cold, not worth 3 trips, not worth waiting my own tables, and not worth the prices. To expand. This isn't a restaurant. It is a fast food place. You order your food at the register, you collect it yourself, you get your own drinks, make your own doggy bag. There are staff managing the process, to stop fights over tables I expect, and very much needed they are. That's it. At least you don't have to leave tips. For ribs and fries; it is expensive. it was $17+tax +drink+sides. That is a lot for fast food. So, if I was hungry and passing I might go in, but experience tells me I would also have to be prepared to wait for quite a long time. So I doubt I would be back. I bet Phil doesn't care though. He has got them waiting around the block to get in his place, so good luck to him.

Came here at 11 am and waited in line for a bit . My friends and I ordered a full rack of ribs , half a chicken,and 2 large sides ( macaroni salad and french fries). All this for 32 dollars what is there not to like?!!!! The rack of ribs were delicious, very moist and well seasoned and dressed in bbq sauce. The chicken breast was sort of dry, but it got better when you started to eat the other parts of the chicken like the drumstick, wings, and etc. It was also well dressed in Êthe bbq sauce. As for the the sides, french fries were normal and the macaroni salad was gooooodddddddd! Not too heavily dressed with mayo. Overall the food was really good. Service: Waited in line for about 2-3 mins and the cashier took my order. This place is a do it yourself type of place so there really is not much to comment on. However, the waiter did frequently come by to take away empty plates and etc. Final Verdict: I now understand why this place receives such high ratings. The food is amazing, one of the best bbq restaurants I have tried. Furthermore, if I lived in the SD area I would come here more often. It will definitely be worth the wait and if I am in the area I will be coming back for more !

This place lives up to its hype. One thing for sure is the line. However, I'll tell you a secret. Order via phone or head over to the "take-out" line and your order will be finished in 10-15 minutes. Then take your "to-go" ribs and find a place nearby to sit and enjoy nature. Your stomach is happy and most importantly you save time (which equals money). For a party of 3 we ordered 2 full slabs of baby back ribs and a small order of onion rings. Each full order comes with 2 small sides or 1 large side. We opted for 1 large french fry order, 1 small potato salad, and 1 small macaroni salad. Ribs: The ribs are fall off the bone and very tender. Full of flavor and I can tell the ribs were well cared for. However, I was disappointed the with the sauce. The sauce is kind of on the spicer side and doesn't have that molasses taste to it. I prefer the sauce at Lucille's. Onion rings: EXTRA crispy and were all battered with perfection. None of that soggy stuff. French fries: also very crispy. The french fries are nicely deep-fried and also contain some of the potato skins. Not as well seasoned with salt like McDonald's so adding some salt may make it more flavorful (just not too much, watch out for hypertension). Sides: Potato salad was nice and cold. Potato wedges neatly cut and were not overcooked to the point of being mushy. The macaroni salad wasn't anything special but it had less mayo than the ones from L&L Hawaiian BBQ, so that's good. Overall, a must visit for anyone visiting San Diego and is craving some BBQ. It may not be the best I've had but it certainly is close. The best BBQ I can have would be of Phil's ribs with Lucille's BBQ sauce with Phil's french fries and Lucille's biscuits with apple butter. Regardless, Phil's I'm glad I have met you even if it's been 3 years since I heard about you. I may not frequent you much but I will always think of you. I'll try my best so that others will also appreciate your presence.

It's been a few years since I've had Phil's. Recently, I went on another outting. As usual, the lines were ridiculously long, but I've opted to call in my order and take it to go. I never find waiting in such a long, crazy line enjoyable. The wait was bad when Phil's was at its original spot. Now it's just down right terrible! I've given up hope of ever trying to eat there. To their credit, the barbecued meat is nice and fall-off-the-bone tender. The generous combo deals are pretty good for the price. The sides are just alright with the onion rings being super greasy. But, after having a taste of Texas style BBQ, I now find that their BBQ sauce is a little to sweet, tangy and a bit too sticky for me. For me, it's all about the sauce and Phil's just doesn't do it for me anymore. I have seen the light.

The lines are extremely long but it is definitely worth the wait. Things I love and suggest: Baby Back Tickler- Cheap and good for one person Sweet Beans are a must! Onion rings are huge and paired with with ranch sauce is awesome! My husband loved the broham sandwich. Bottom Line- Phil's is the best bbq there is in San Diego. The friendly staff are caring and they always have a smile on their face:) Fan for Life!!!

Thank goodness I didn't give up barbecue for Lent. I can go 40 days without Grey Goose. Maybe not so much the succulent goodness. Could you imagine 40 days in the desert without barbecue? What if you were all in the desert like a honey badger all walking around eating snakes and bugs and then you rounded a cactus and there in front of you was a Phil's? What then? Honey badger dilemma, methinks. I had never been to Phil's. My sweetest Yelp friends swore by it. I bookmarked. Then, today, as I was in SD, I ventured. Holy cow. As I've said in similar spaces, I fancy myself an aficionado. Not an expert per se of the smoky flesh and sweet sauces. Just a mighty big fan. Phil's stuff is crazy good. At lunch today I had: a beef rib a babies rib a tri-tip sammy macaroni salad beans sweet tea I'm a fat you know what right now. The ribs from the babies back were my favorite. I like kids a lot more right now than I used to. The sammy was my second favorite, sauce so sweet and hot, most perfect bun ever. Beef rib third best, but still better than any I'd ever et before. The joint is popular - I arrived 15 minutes before the 11AM opening time and the line was already 20 deep. But the staff are efficient and the crowd eager so who cares if you get closer to them than you'd otherwise like. There were small children in line at the start, but I never saw them leave. Hmm. Maybe I ate them. Thank you then, those of you who made the yummy children. Keep em coming.

After seeing the rave reviews about Phils I had to make it a point to check it out while visiting San Diego for the weekend. I made the mistake of arriving after noon time on a Saturday. The line wrapped all the way around the building pass the sign that said you have a 21 minute from this point. I thought to myself this is insane so I walked passed everyone and went right to the bar where there are seats open. After starting off with a cold Stella beer I ordered the half rack of baby backs with beans and mac salad. I thought the system here was unusual BC you have to pick up your own food when it's ready - there are no waitresses here. The male and female bartender were attentive and you could see they worked their tails off trying to keep up with everyones thirsty needs. I've experienced BBQ in Texas, Alabama and Georgia not to mention places I've forgotten. OK back to the food. My buzzer went off after around 15 minutes and I made my way to the pick up line where there was no wait and I carefully maneuvered my way back to the bar. The portion was generous and my ribs were tender but lacked a smoky flavor which I feel is mandatory for great BBQ. My beans were tasty but nothing spectacular and was a generous portion. The mac salad was flat tasting so I used the Cajun seasoning to add flavor. I tasted the onion rings which were very good - large, firm and not greasy. The fries were soggy and Cole slaw lacked flavor which I also seasoned. The beef rib was tender and meaty tasting but lacked any smoked flavor. Overall my take of Phil's was above average BBQ although I've have had better and I would not wait in line as so many others do.

The beef ribs and pork ribs speaks for itself. Falls off the bone, sweet, juicy and full of bbq goodness. The side dishes are nothing to write home about though. Who cares if the onion rings are oversized, it's just onion dipped in batter! The coleslaw and fries were just ok too. For those who are hesitant about the long line, don't be! We saw a helpful tip from another Yelper who suggested to opt for Take Out (instead of Dine-in). BEST decision ever!! My friends and I ordered and picked up our food in less than 15 minutes and headed to Balboa Park for lunch at the park.

This review is for their CATERING services only! My bf was throwing a surprise party for his dad and asked if I could pick up the food since he'd be at work. Phil's said they'd email him a form that I'd have to bring when I picked it up. They sent it that morning, which was after I last saw him. He wrote me a note explaining that I could use his credit card and to pick up the food. I had never been there before so when I arrived, there was a line out the door and down one side of the building. I went in the front door, which is NOT where you go for the catering services (it's the side door). when I approached the counter, I was greeted by a friendly cashier who started to ring me up/put together the order. ****A PLUS**** even if you cater your food, they don't start packaging your food until you get there. It's not sitting for hours in an oven. They have so much constant business that they are able to do that! There was an issue with the note my bf wrote as it wasn't the order form they emailed him. There was a manager involved and some photocopying of my DL. While I was waiting for the mess to be sorted out, the friendly cashier from earlier offered me a cup for a drink and insisted that their sweet tea was the best. She was the friendliest person I've encountered working in a restaurant in awhile! All in all, it Êworked out. The food was boxed up and i even got help taking the boxes to my car.

I'm not ashamed to confess that I've traded Phil's BBQ sauce for a place to stay when I'm traveling. It's that good. And Oregon-ites love Phil's.

Let's just say... Phil's BBQ lives up to all the hype that you hear!! It's cheap, and the meat was so tender that if I were a cartoon character, I can probably put the all the ribs in my mouth and come out with only bones -- the white ones without sauce!! It was definitely worth the two hour drive, and I would definitely drive another two hours just for it! Ê Tip: Come on a weekday so that the wait isn't long.. My friends and I went on a Tuesday evening so we didn't have to do much waiting. Ê Next time I come, I will be sure to buy a bottle of their BBQ sauce!

I'll give that the food is damn delicious but the line and the wait is NOT worth it.. I'm going to order from the To Go line next time and eating it at home. If you're going to go and want to wait in line. Check online and see how long the line is with the webcam first.

Skip the line, order to-go and eat it somewhere else. The bbq is to die half because of the sauce and half because the meat falls right off the bones. Get more than you want and share with a friend because you'll always seem to want more after you finish.

One word sums up this place: ÊAMAZING! ÊI have been to this place twice and have tried their Baby Back Ribs, Beefy Ribs, and BBQ Chicken. ÊRegardless of the kind of meat you order, they all taste delicious. ÊThe meat has just enough BBQ sauce to add a lot of taste but not enough to completely take away the delicious meaty taste. ÊNot only that but their sides taste pretty good as well. ÊThe two times I went, I had Corn on the Cob, Fresh Cut Fries, and Coleslaw and all I could think was that they were some of the better sides I have had in a sit-down restaurant. Ê Ê Ê The only drawback to this place would be the fact that the wait is always a long time, ESPECIALLY during dinner time. ÊI remember going at about 7:30 and not getting to the ordering counter until about past 8:45. ÊNonetheless, the wait is usually worth it just b/c of the sheer deliciousness of it. ÊAlso, although I have never tried it myself, I imagine the phone order will be pretty fast, especially considering that they have a separate line just for phone orders. Ê Ê Ê One last thing to note: Êthe price is very reasonable. ÊI ordered the half chicken half beefy ribs and I ended up with two pieces of each as well as two small but reasonably sized sides, coming out with a slightly bigger gut, the fatigue feeling that accompanies food coma, and made my wallet only about 14 dollars (including tax) lighter. Ê Ê Ê Bottom line: If you are in San Diego and craving some American BBQ, this is the place to go.

Pros: Baby back ribs, french fries, pretty good deal for the amount of food you get Cons: Long lines if you don't show up at the right time, chicken is a little dry Went here with Kristin C. when we were visiting San Diego and I was definitely impressed. ÊWe showed up around 11:30 am on Sunday and there wasn't too long of a line. ÊWhen we left around 12:30, the line started to wrap around the building. Anyway, after trying the food, I can see why. ÊI ended up getting the "Best of Both, Baby Back Rib & Chick-less Dinner" for Ê$12.25. ÊIt comes with 4 bones and a couple pieces of chicken. Phil's probably serves the best baby back ribs I've ever had. ÊFall off the bone goodness. The meat is nice and tender and the BBQ sauce has the right amount of kick. ÊTheir french fries are actually pretty good too. I was kinda disappointed by the chicken because it's kinda dry, but it's still pretty tasty. Not sure if it's worth an hour wait based on some of these other reviews, but it's definitely worth a try if there's not too long of a wait.

Phil's Catering was the first thing that came to our mind for wedding reception food. Everyone knows their food is amazing, but I don't think enough are aware of how good their catering prices are compared to others. Everyone was excited to eat dinner, which is a little rare at a reception. The food was great, and the the catering staff was just as wonderful. Kristina and Michelle were both a great help, and helped us out with our budget.

The best BBQ RIBS EVER!! I love the fries and the sauce. The portion is HUGE, a good idea not to eat anything before you come here. The wait is long depends on the hour. The longest I've ever waited for this place was probably 2 hours and a couple of minutes. The staff is friendly and the smell of BBQ coming from the kitchen makes you excited to get some bomb BBQ ribs. They have really good coleslaw, and the prices are decent! Best to come around lunch time, not so much people or waiting a long time in line.

I hope I don't get stoned for writing such a sucky review of Phil's. Well, maybe getting stoned would be kinda nice now that I think about it. Here's the deal....I am a BBQ snob. ÊI was raised in the south. ÊYes, where it's hotter than hell in the summer and the ONLY way to cook meat March thru October is outside. ÊThe vampires that kidnapped me at birth from the hospital (I'll refer to them as my family) brainwashed us with the belief system that we HAD to eat meat and that flesh is our life force. ÊMy family hasn't changed much over the years, except now they suck the life out of me too. Ê Anyway.... On this particular day, the wait line @ Phil's Êwas 1 1/2 hours-2 hours deep, so I called in an order from the car and it was ready immediately. ÊIf I would have waited in line for any amount of time, for this quality of meat...it would have been freaking anarchy. Ê The baby backs were far superior to the full ribs. But, in comparison to the ribs that I've digested as chunks of decaying flesh in my gut throughout my life...Phil, my darling, listen. You need a trip to Austin, Texas. ÊThey could show you a few things. Ê And also, where are you buying your beef? ÊAre they porking up these cows with ho-ho's and twinkies? Burnt fat is not tasty. So, the star break down: One star for not having to wait. ÊEven though a car picnic was not what I had in mind, I appreciate opportunity to save time. One star for the nice guys at the counter and the really unhealthy but delicious homemade whoopie pie.

Thank you fellow Yelpers! I have found THE PLACE to get my BBQ fix. You start off in a line that wraps around the building, but don't let it fool you. The line moves quickly. When you get close enough to the ordering counter, someone from your group should split off and reserve a table. The menu is advertised throughout the line so that everyone usually knows what they are ordering way before they reach the counter. You order your food, receive a buzzer that will buzz when your food the ready. You pick up your food at the pick-up counter and the rest is history. LOVED: the baby back ribs. Doesn't matter whether you get it in a half rack, full rack, in a chicken combo... JUST GET IT! You won't regret it. So flavorful and tender. The onion rings are a must have. Thick, crunchy exterior. Sides I tried were the potato salad, fries, cole slaw, and beans... all yummy. It's safe to say that you can order anything on the menu and won't be disappointed. I'll definitely be back for more!

I am updating my review. ÊIt's unfortunate I have to also, because it was something so dumb. ÊTheir food is still as awesome as before... but one thing really bugged me. ÊWe waited 1.5 hrs for dinner. ÊNo problem. ÊWe were seated and enjoying our meal and the Laker game was on. ÊTwo minutes left in the game and they changed the channel. ÊNo problem. ÊWe asked them to change it back. ÊTheir response was that people was not leaving so they couldn't play the Laker game. ÊWTF? ÊOne TV behind us was on... so we turned around to watch the game. ÊWow.

Literally, as good as it gets! Phil's catered my wedding at the La Jolla Cove Suites and did a superb job. ÊFrom the first contact, they were professional and responsive.

Damn near perfect ribs. ÊThe barbeque sauce they use is the perfect combination of tangy and spicy. ÊI wish I had a larger stomach. ÊFor my sides, I got the fries and potato salad. ÊThe fries were pretty standard, but the potato salad was really fresh - possibly one of the best potato salads I've ever had. ÊIt's not the pre-packaged, reheated kind. ÊThey actually chop up their potatoes and make it. ÊDelicious. Ê Like others have mentioned, the line can be ridiculous. ÊIt's extra hard to stand around and wait when you're starving, and watch as everyone else enjoys their mouth-watering ribs and sides. ÊHowever, that won't deter me from revisiting this establishment if I ever make it back down to San Diego.

Theres a reason why this place is so packed all the time; Its because it is freakin' DELICIOUS! for such a good price. Theres a long line, but if you come early, before peak hour, then it aint so bad. You may not even have to wait in line if you get lucky. I've tried the Macaroni, Potato salad, fries as sides before with baby ribs before andi believe some of the other meat too (obviously at separate times because the portion is enough to get me full!), and yummmmmmmm. I've tried the pulled pork sandwich before; it was pretty good, but i got jealous of all the ribs around me, so i prob wouldnt get it again. But something that I do like doing with the sandwich now is to use any of the left pork to put into my fries, and it makes for some pretty good fries too. Double the treat. Also, for the ppl that spill all the time, they also have bibs and places to wash your hands or toilettes. Even just making this review makes me crave it.

I came here expecting "OMG, super delicious, to die for" food because of all these 4-5 star yelp reviews & the opinion of one my bffs. ÊWOW oh WOW, this place is BEYOND OVERHYPED!!!! Not to mention the line/wait is RIDICULOUSLY long. ÊNOT WORTH THE WAIT AT ALL... BUT, if you request to sit at the bar, & they have seats available, you can skip that unending line cause that's what my friends and I did over the weekend. Their menu is very small. ÊI ordered the half order of the baby back ribs. The baby back ribs are your typical BBQ ribs. Yes, they're good, but there's NOTHING special about them. ÊI honestly prefer Lucille's ribs, but probably because I know Lucille's would never have a wait that wraps around the building only to find out you're in for a lunch/dinner that serves your mediocre meal. Ê All I have to say is OVERHYPED & OVERRATED!

Very hyped up joint. As someone visiting up from LA, I was very excited to get my chops on this. We came here around 1pm on a Saturday. As such, I was expecting a crowd or something. To my surprise, there wasn't a soul in line. So we literally parked, walked all the way in, and had a register available for all four of us. I got a plate of ribs and boneless chicken, w/ sides of cole slaw and fries. Which were pretty generous portions (along w/ the meat) for the $13 or so I paid. The ribs, as everyone else has stated a million times over, were freaking amazinggggg. I wasn't wowed by the chicken. And the cole slaw and fries were great sides. The only problem I could see with this place is, that when it gets back, I assume it'd be hard to find seats, seeing as you seat yourself to whatever booth/table's open. And like I said, there was no line, but as we were sitting and enjoying our moment of gluttony, the line started to form and rear its ugly face. Thankfully, we were already inside, bahahhaha.

I had never heard of Phil's before but just recently took a trip down to San Diego and ate here with my girlfriend and her dad. He lives in SD and recommended the place. I was really surprised by the line reaching around the building. Which hadn't gotten smaller even by the time we had finished eating and were walking out. Bottom line, its worth the wait. once and awhile they will have servers go down the line and give out free samples of onion rings which are amazing. Good idea because I was getting pretty hungry while waiting. I had a little bit of everything to eat. Can't say enough good things about it. Best BBQ I've ever had. Whenever I head down to SD I will for sure be coming here again. I only hope they will open a location closer to LA.

Went skydiving and this was our destination after... and boy am I glad we came here... There was a line wrapped around the restaurant when we pulled into the parking lot, but it went pretty fast as this is a cafeteria style restaurant .. order, get a beeper, find a seat, get your food, sit down and devour! luckily, we had a party of 6, so we managed to be seated first before the line even got into the door. (I got to sit down versus the rest of the group and them having to stand there in line, tee hee) I go the half rack baby back ribs with fries and cole slaw, while the BF got the half rack and half boneless chicken with fries and macaroni salad. The ribs were delightfully flavorful and cannot be compared to Lucille's or any other places as this was way better. The fries were spectacular and I tried my best to finish all of mine. Luckily, I wasn't that hungry to finish my entire plate so I was able to have some food for lunch & dinner the next day.

Nothing to write home about. First off, I love barbecue. Absolutely adore it. When some people recommend Phil's, I had to go! When I was told that there would be a long line, I didn't expect the line to wrap around the building. I thought that was a good sign. I shouldn't have had such high expectations. I was not blown away from the barbecue. I wasn't even impressed. There wasn't even that, "I'm-so-hungry-that-anything-is-going-to-taste-?good-must-eat-now" sense of satisfaction of having food in my stomach. The chicken, okay. Beef ribs, definitely had better. Onion rings, light batter, almost tempura-like, interesting. Sweet baked beans, outright watery and bland. Maybe we went on a bad day. I sure hope we did. Good: At least the employees were nice. Bad: The line, the food. Final: There are great barbecue places, this is not one of them.

It's not like Phil's is gonna die without my review, but in fairness, I find myself wanting to go out of my way these days, just so I can drive by and open my car windows. ÊI've become a Phil's addict. ÊThere, I said it. ÊI crave the smoky goodness that wafts around that part of the world. My first visit was on Tuesday night. ÊThe second visit had to wait until, yep, Wednesday night. ÊGood thing I had plans on Thursday. Ê The other reviews here go into way more detail. ÊIf you want good Barbeque in San Diego, Phil's is a must. ÊHey, it's not Dreamland Barbeque, but as good as it gets in these parts. Positives: Large portions of delicious ribs and fixins.

Phil's BBQ is the place to go in San Diego, or so I've been told (along with Extraordinary Desserts). My friends and I took a road trip down to SD on a President's Day weekend, giving me the opportunity to finally try this place. Being the foodies we are, we braved the ~40 degree weather and waited patiently for 2 and a half hours, instead of chickening out and finding refuge at an AYCE Chinese buffet place in the same plaza. It was tempting though. The line wrapped around the building and only grew longer as the night went on. We ended up playing a dozen or so rounds of Connections while waiting. Even for people dining in, orders are taken up at the front counter. Everyone's given a remote control-looking pager to let them know when their order's ready. Pretty neat contraption, imo. People who buy drinks are given different colored cups, but we shamelessly just used our water cups to pour ourselves beverages from the fountain tap. I think the wait staff is pretty lax about it too. I ordered the Baby Back Ribs & Chicken ($11.95), with sides of potato salad and cole slaw. I was a tad disappointed by the portions (4 baby back ribs and quarter breast of chicken) because my plate looked sort of empty. The pork ribs totally owned the chicken though, but there was way too much bbq sauce slathered onto the meat. All that smokiness and tang overwhelmed the flavors and juices of the barbequed meat. Potato salad was alright, but I thought the cole slaw was a bit soggy. Everyone else ordered variations of chicken, pork and beef ribs. I can't comment on how the beef tasted haha. My friend and I split colossal onion rings ($5.95), which came with ranch dressing dipping sauce. I don't particularly like ranch or milk-based dressings, so I just drenched these perfectly-fried onion rings in ketchup. Perfect amount of batter on these large onion rings. They made my day. Verdict: BBQ chicken is one of the world's most perfect food combinations. But given all the hype, I expected something so flavorful that it would induce a food orgasm, for the 2.5 hour wait. It's a good experience, all in all. That's all I can say about it.

Ok finally made the decision to check out Phi's. ÊThe line as always was wrapped around the front of the building and then around the side of the building. ÊOf course parking is almost impossible, cars circling like hawks over dead prey! The place is like a zoo, so packed with people. ÊFor as crowded the place is always, there is only one toilet in the men's room! ÊThere was a line of people waiting to use the toilet. ÊAt least they did have a sink outside of the restrooms to wash hands. Moving from North Carolina, I know excellent BBQ. ÊThis is not like a typical bbq place that I have been too. Regular bbq places always have a variety of squeeze bottle of bbq sauce at the table so you can try different types and add or drown your food in it if you so desire!! Phil's had no bbq sauce at the table. ÊAlso they provide you with a cup for your soft drink u get your self and even your own food you need to pick up yourself once the buzzer stick goes off. ÊWhat is the sense of having any wait staff?! Overall the food was good, service was putrid. ÊGot one of the 2 side dishes wrong and no extra sauce bbq as was requested. ÊIt was nearly impossible to get the servers attention. ÊWas more occupied with getting orders from tables one after another other checking on tables with their meals. Ê Finally got the attention of the server, but food was all but finished when the extra sauce arrived by the time 4 tables of drinks were served and got the sauce to me. Ê Be especially careful at the bar area, if you leave to replenish a drink or use the restroom your seat will be poached by people, waiting for a seat. ÊHappened twice during dinner! ÊDon't they see the food and drink at the stool??! Macaroni salad was excellent, the slaw was soggy and not crisp, left a lot to be desired. ÊNot enough bbq sauce on the baby back ribs or chickless. Ê Chicken was tender, but ribs were fatty. ÊThey ran out of out brewed tea too! Overall mixed results. ÊMay try it another time to see if it does improve.

**BIAS ALERT** Ok so here is the thing.im from the south and I'm used to a different type of BBQ. So i feel that i should put that put there. Anyway here is my story. We(me and my girlfriend who gave it 2 stars) where looking for some BBQ and and yelp pointed us to this place. "best BBQ in San Diego" OK ,OK Êso Phil went out his way to bribe a politician to put that on yelp Your pretty sneaky Phil i thought...but wait they have a live camera. So we took a look and ÊIt just so happened to be four pm (1600) ÊThat line was GINORMOUS a line like a Jay-Z concert or maybe Phil was giving out free money to every family. Phil cant be fooling this many people i said to my self. So i decided to give it a try but i refused to stand in that line and i feel that I'm smarter than the average bear so i called my order in. apparently there are allot of smart bears in San Diego because i still had to wait in a semi long line in the take out side which is to the left which happened around 5ish. I didn't mind the wait because my nose was being hijacked by the sweet smell of BBQ. "OK Phil...maybe just maybe you have something going on here." i got my order which was ribs and chick-less for me and ribs for my girlfriend. Got in the car and my brain decided it wanted to join in the rebellion that my nose had started. Needless to say i broke more than a few traffic laws to get back home. Now I'm sitting at home with my box open deciding how I'm going to re-murder my ribs and chicken. I decided to Êgo with the ribs first..first bite and they slid of the bone they where so tender..man they where tender. Fully excited now!!and they had a hint of sweetness in the BBQ sauce.."what is it that your hinting at BBQ??" as i waited for the BBQ sauce to give me the rest of the answer i realized that, that was all it had to offer.... a hint of sweetness. Ê"Don't worry Phil i wont give up on you yet i still have my chick-less" Now those weren't bad..but they werent special either. They tasted like BBQ chicken...with a hint of sweetness. The baked beans i didnt like at all. I look to my girlfriend who is just pissed all together. All in all it wasn't BAD...it just wasn't GREAT...to me at least plus i didn't pay for it. Not good enough to wait in line next to half of Point Loma. But as i said in the top im pretty biased about my BBQ. Would i go back?? ..sure.. at lunch for a special...it was alright and besides this is the best San Diego has to offer right?

We knew we had to stop by Phils BBQ at least once during our trip in San Diego. My brother tells me about this place every time he comes back from visiting his girlfriend. So the bf and I really wanted to try this place. First thing I noticed when we got there, um hello long line! We waited in line for a good 40 minutes and that was considered "short". Second thing you will definitely notice is the smell from the delicious food! Yeah doesn't quite help when you're super hungry and waiting in a 40 minute line. I chose the 6 piece baby back ribs with sides of coleslaw and homemade baked beans. Everything under $16. What a steal when your meat literally falls off the bones. Yummy! Bf had the beef ribs and omg were those things huge. The four of us (bro, bro's gf, me, and the bf) decided to share a pull pork sandwich on top of our entrees. That was a little too much but it was delicious! Remember to put the coleslaw in your burger, not on the side. Ê Here's the procedure: -you order your food like you would in McDonald's -they give you a buzzer and will let you know when your food is ready -find your own table (yup they don't seat you!) -*buzz* -get your food and start chomping (warning: it gets messy!)

I've been to a lot of bbq places and phil's for me takes the cake... or bbq smothered baby back rib. :D I've been coming here for years and every time I'm reunited with that sauce... mm mm mMM. Yep, sometimes there's a long line. Yep, you might wait for your food a while. Yep, It's crowded. But the craving for Phil's is undeniable. :D If you don't wanna wait, phone in for pick up.

This place is amazing. This was a must-go-to place on our San Diego trip. The wait was long and the line stretched around the building; but it was worth it. I got the (regular) Beef Rib Dinner with 2 sides (fries and macaroni salad) Good thing I got the regular (3 bones) because I could only finish 2. They're so tender they literally fall off the bone when you pick them up. The fries are filling so go easy on them, but the macaroni salad is amazing; I should've gotten 1 large side of macaroni salad instead of 2 small sides. Next time...next time.

For a place known for ribs and bbq? Not bad. For me, it's a good place to eat but nothing extraordinary or special. I've gone to Phil's since the Goldfinch location and it has always been good, but nothing for me to die for. I think it's great that they came up with the 'system' to seat the people in your group together, but still quite a wait on any night. Personally I think the chicken is a bit dry (used to get ribs and chickless) so I never get the chicken there anymore. Nowadays, baby back rib tickler is perfect for me, although I wish that I could switch out the fries for macaroni or potato salad. The bar could have been built a lot bigger and better, but I don't think even Mr. Phil Pace could have foreseen every section of the restaurant to be so packed every night. Overall, it's a good place to eat if you are willing to wait in line for a bit. If you don't care about eating in the restaurant environment that Phil's provides, call in your order, park on the curb side, pay and take your food. Simple and fast.

So so so so so so so yummy!!! D'lish! I've had Phil's a total of 3 times. Once to-go, once at the San Marcos one, and my latest time here and dined in. When I had it to-go, I wasn't super impressed and I think it got a little cold on the way back. In San Marcos, I waited in line for over an hour but I enjoyed it a lot. I was expecting long lines again, but we came at a non rush time. NO LINE AT ALL. We walked in and straight to the register. Awesome! I think I prefer the beef to the pork. Beef is super meaty and tender. They drench it in their tangy BBQ. So goooood. I watched Diners, Drives and Dives after coming here and am interested in trying their tri-tip. But I don't know.. I really loved their ribs and there's so much food, it's not like I can get both! We also got an order of onion rings. Beer battered, and deep fried, not to mention the size of the rings, all amount to perfection. So greasy, so good. Their fries are okay, but are you really here for the fries? I liked their mac salad a lot, but I'm just a huge fan of all mac salads. Cole slaw was average. And I haven't tried their potato salad yet (maybe next time). The meat is just so good. Not dry, super tender. Man, I want some right now! If you haven't been, you have to try it. Unless you go during a random time, expect to wait in line forever. And the staff is always really helpful and nice. Super friendly; it really seems like they like working here which makes the dining experience even better.

Not that Phil's needs my 5 star review but I just have to do it. Thee best BBQ I have EVER had, hands down. BBQ ribs had a perfect crispy texture on the outside but were moist and fall off the bone tender on the inside. Pulled pork sandwich was equally as delicious and they give you TONS of meet. The amount of meat could probably go onto 3 sandwiches. Sides were great too. Macaroni salad, bbq beans Êand french fries...all outstanding. The line was per usual around the corner but there were only 2 of us so we walked into the bar and were able to sit down immediately. I cannot wait to go back!

After more than 2600 reviews at this writing, what can I possibly add? When I discovered Phil's, back before he got chased out of Mission Hills, I tried telling my friend from Arkansas how good it was. Ê "Good BBQ in San Diego?" [sarcastic laugh] "I don't think so." Halfway through the meal, he had his head down, working those ribs. Ê "What do you think, Devin?" "Pretty damn good."

We've been to Phil's before, so we knew what to expect. I usually don't eat meat, but once in a while I can make an exception and this is one of these times. As a European, I consider the 'regular' BBQ plates to big. ÊIf I order one of those, it seems to be untouched after I'm finished. Ê Therefore the Phil's ticklers are perfect. ÊI always order the baby-back tickler. ÊIt comes with fries & coleslaw. ÊThere's only one downside, you cannot change the sides with the ticklers. The meat is outstanding! ÊI tried them all, but I prefer the babybacks. Another thing about Phil's is that it's dirt cheap. ÊMy husband and I had dinner (both ticklers of course) for under $15. ÊIsn't that amasing?

So I went to San Diego this past week to take my little boy to Sea World and as you can imagine all they have is overpriced food there so we decided to go eat dinner after we left the park. I yelped bbq food and this was the first restaurant that appeared. I read the reviews and they were all pretty good. I agree with all the positive feedback. I called in an order to pick up and take back to the hotel and I walked right in even though there was a long dine-in line there is a separate line for take out. The food is reasonably priced and delicious. I ordered the half stalk of short ribs with baked beans and macaroni salad and it was so good that I would recommend this place to anyone going to SD.

Phil's BBQ - it's like falling in love for the first time. After eating here, you WILL: 1. Compare every other BBQ joint to Phil's - and they will ALL fall drastically short of what Phil's has to offer 2. Every time you eat at a different BBQ restaurant, you just wish it were Phil's delicious ribs and fries sitting on the plate in front of you 3. When friends and family try to introduce you to other BBQ joints, you put on the happy face, smile, and try to enjoy the food... but the entire time you're just wishing you were stuffing your face with PHIL'S!!! Oh Phil's.... you'll always have my heart!

If you call for take out, they'll just ask you show up and then prepare the food for you - no wait at all. We ordered the full baby back rib dinner and it was served on fries. Yum!

PROS: -The beefy ribs were really tender and they were good. -The girl that was helping us when we were trying to find seats was really nice. CONS: -SUPER long lines. -Hard to find seats once you order your food. -The girl at the cashier was really pushy about selling BBQ sauce. -Pricey - but given the lines, I would do the same. Definitely good BBQ but I'm not sure I would want to wait in another long line for it.

Yummy! I would make this a regular stop any time I'm in the area and so should you. I tried the baby back ribs with fries and macaroni salad. ÊEveryone is right, the meat falls right off the bone and sauce has a nice spicy kick to it. ÊThe fries and macaroni salad were good, but everything it overshadowed by the tasty ribs. We ordered to go, because the line was sooooo long. ÊOur to go order took about 10 minutes to get so definitely a good option if you don't want to wait.

Came here for lunch today with 2 friends. There was a line winding slightly around the building from the entrance to about 50 ft. away. Don't be TOO discouraged, the line moves at an adequate tempo...well at least it did for us! Now about the food! :) What we got: -Full Beef Rib Dinner (5 bones) with Potato salad and macaroni salad with an extra side of baked beans The baked beans to be honest sucked. The flavor was extremely one-note and it didn't have that deep flavor good baked beans usually have. Not worth getting as a side. I prefer Lucille's baked beans...then again baked beans everywhere are too damn sweet. The potato salad is quite good; it had herb-y notes to it and it's just an overall good potato salad that is NOTHING like the kind of sweet Êand yellow potato salad from supermarkets. The macaroni salad for me tasted very similarly to the potato salad, but that isn't a bad thing. The fact the potato and macaroni salad aren't sweet make them great! AND THEN THE RIBS... GET THE BEEF RIBS! I ate a bite of Êhalf of the "Broham" and the "El Toro" and then took a bite of a beef rib. My eyes rolled to the back of my head and I didn't even want to go back to the sandwich halves. What does it taste like? Fatty in a way great beef ribs are, that great beef taste just about everyone loves with an aroma of smoke (a more hard smoke if that makes sense as opposed to a sweeter smoke taste Lucille's bbq has), then all that cut by a tangy bbq sauce. I'm pretty sure you could say the sauce has TWANG. Actually, anyone who comes here for the beef ribs...ASK FOR SAUCE ON THE SIDE. They do put a little bit too much for my taste. I mean I want to taste the beef itself! A little too much sauce can make it taste like smokey sweet and sour ribs. -Regular Beef Rib Dinner (3 bones) with cole slaw and potato salad. -Small order of onion rings that came with buttermilk ranch. The onion rings are pretty damn good. Rich because they're fried and you dip them in buttermilk ranch. The onions don't slip out when you bite into them which is always nice you know. If you like onions rings, these won't hurt you to try. Maybe. -One "Broham" sandwich (pulled pork with cole slaw on bun) Meh. I might have gotten it at a wrong time. The pork tasted like pork meat does when it is old. It didn't really taste of pork...and even more surprisingly it didn't have a smoky taste I was expecting. I will have to give it a shot another time. -One "El Toro" sandwich (tri-tip with bbq sauce) I saw this sandwich on Man vs. Food so I had to try it. The tri-tip in my sandwich didn't taste fresh at all. It tasted like it was reheated and has this semi-dry experience to it. Also, the meat was cut extremely thin like pastrami...which definitely added to the dryness of the meat. I was expecting better out of this sandwich. Tri-tip should be juicy and the texture however sliced shouldn't be like a cross between extremely thin beef jerky and pastrami. AND there was too much sauce. -One whoopie pie. Nothing special and I've had better. An oreo cakester tastes better quite frankly. It's so sugary that it's triabetes-inducing! OVERALL! I would come here again for the beef ribs and potato and macaroni salad. And I would remember to ask for the ribs with sauce on the side. The sauce is pretty good, but too much and it makes the bbq have an overbearing tangy flavor! I happily say that Phil's BBQ is better than Lucille's BBQ. It's cheaper! :)

Baby back ribs....literally SLIPS off the bone. Or the BBQ chicken that is FULL OF FLAVOR and so tender and juicy. My mouth is watering just describing this thing. Besides the excellent BBQ sauce that they come around your table and give more of, it comes on a huge plate of french fries and potato or macaroni salad... I think the sides aren't THAT good, but the ribs/chicken speak for themselves. Warning, the portions are HUGE. Prepare your stomachs. I think I'm full after 3-4 ribs. They also have bomb ass onion rings!! Warning #2.... FOOD COMA UP THE HEEZY. I think I could fall asleep before I even finish chewing my food. LOL, but on my way home, I literally want to pass out and sleep it off. So bad for you....but feel sooooo good. Warning #3... If you don't get there early enough, prepare yourself for at least a 35-45 minute wait. The longest I've waited was an hour and 10 minutes, but it's worth it. TRUUUST. ALSO, there's a wait for to get your food. It's true. But you have a buzzer thing so you can hang out or grab a beer at the bar while you're waiting. Good for groups, esp large ones bc they will help you get a table that big, but if you're only a group of 5 or less, then you're on your own to find a table. You gotta snatch that up quick! ...or someone else will!! i love this place cause you there's a hand washing sink thing near the back so you don't need to bother going all the way to the bathroom. Overall, #1 place for ribs. NO DOUBT.

**4.5 stars overall** Came here with Yelpers Sam B., Andrew R. and Paul K. Decor: 4.5/5 -lots of tables, the wait in line moves quickly -heated outdoor seating -large sink to wash your hands near the refreshments dispenser -many menus posted all over the walls and in front of the registers Service: 4.5/5 -one of your party gets seated prior to ordering -food comes out fast! -Kale was my server, whom was friendly and energetic Food: 4.5/5 -Full rack baby back ribs dinner ($18.95): The first half rack was delicious. The second half rack was covered in too much BBQ sauce which made it very salty. Some of the ribs were a bit burnt. -Colossal Onion Rings: Ever had Funyuns? These taste just like it, only better. Don't get the large size for yourself. ÊDefinitely give these a try though -The single beef rib it 2-3x the size of the baby back single rib. -Sides: potato salad and baked beans were Okay. I came here on a Tuesday night @ 7pm and the wait was about 35-40 minutes.

Phil's BBQ may seem like a long wait but they do move kind of fast. You are actually waiting in line to order your food then get seated. Food was ready in less than 6 mins thereafter! The baby back and beef ribs were so delicious. All meat came right off the bone so this BBQ is done right! Only thing is....the bbq sauce is not the best that I have tried. It's got too much vinegar and salt in it for my taste. I do enjoy the itty bitty kick it has to it though.

Even though I find this place way over-hyped with the lines going out the door (which i'm assuming is because of the publicity it received after man vs food), I can't say it's bad, or even just OK because it's not. It's really fucking good. I hate to give into the hype, but I can't resist some good ol' bbq. The prices are decent pero the food took a while to come out. That and they ran out of fat tire, when i was there at 3pm. Um, why? Nevertheless, I'm a fan.

BBQ Mecca! After hearing my friends rave about Phil's BBQ, I had to give it a try. Came with a bunch of friends around 6pm. We got seated at 8pm. Yup, the line was that long. Be ready to wait! The wait is worse than it seems because you can smell the barbecue. Also, you can see the people through the windows chow down their food while you just try not to stare at them and drool. While waiting in line, I had a hard time deciding what to get. I definitely wanted baby back ribs, but I also wanted to try the beefy ribs and the chicken. Also, I wanted to try ALL of their sides!! I decided to go with the Quarter Baby Back Ribs Dinner with Sweet Baked Beans and Coleslaw....AND Beef Rib Dinner with Macaroni Salad and Potato Salad. Yes, I was starving. I was so excited for this meal I was about the cry when I picked up my food. First bite into my baby back ribs....OMG.... I cannot believe how good it was. The meat fell off the bone. The bone came out so clean. Meat was juicy and tender. It was perfectly paired with the sweet, tangy, and spicy barbecue sauce. The beef ribs where the same. Super super tender and really soft. Fall of the bone as well. I'm DROOLING as I'm typing right now. Sides: The best was the Sweet Baked Beans. Sweet, but not overly sweet. Really good. The coleslaw was really good and refreshing. The mac salad and potato salad were good as well. I cannot wait to come back. Phil's BBQ, you have raised the bar. I will NEVER order ribs anywhere else.

The first experience I had with Phil's BBQ, we decided to cut the line and order out instead of waiting. Then we proceeded to drive to the nearest McDonalds to eat our BBQ because we could not wait any longer after smelling the BBQ goodness for a couple minutes. I am pretty sure the families around us were super jealous that we were having an orgasmic eating experience with our baby back ribs while they were eating their fake versions with McRibs. I never change my order. Always baby back ribs!!!! I love eating the fries with the bbq sauce and ranch. OHMYGOSSSSSSH!! The one thing that never changes with Phil's is the quality of the baby back ribs. Tear off the bone, soft, tender goodness. I am always happy afterwards. The only negatives is the other sides are mediocre. I've tried the potato salad, macaroni salad, coleslaw and fries. The only ones worth getting are the fries and coleslaw. The coleslaw is nothing special but it tastes pretty refreshing alongside your fries. The potato and macaroni salad are probably as standard as your regular grocery store brand. I have yet to try the chicken but if you want a good first experience, I do not recommend getting it. If you want a lot of meat, get the beef bones because the amount of meat on the bone is ridiculous. Phil's usually does not skimp on the meat either way. So if you are not a big eater, get half a rack or tickler. I do not think it is worth an hour wait but it is mighty tasty to make me forget I waited an hour.

Well well. What can I say? The famous Phil's BBQ holds true to its title. I came here expecting to have some good BBQ, but little did I know that I'd be running away with the best in the business. The only tincy wincy little problem I have is that I could use more sauce on my food, but the quality of everything here is amazing. The ribs are INTENSE. If you want to be full for three days straight, I'd recommend the "beefy ribs." Otherwise, for the same great flavor, the baby back ribs will suffice. I, personally, am a chicken-fan, so I roll with the chick tickler almost every time. It comes with fries, onion rings, coleslaw (ughhh...), and of course the boneless chicken pieces. Again, more sauce = happier pawl but it's still super bomb. I'd say swoop on a nice whoopie pie for dessert to top off your stomach but most times its hard to finish. TL;DR: Super good but super filling, so get the "ticklers." - pawl e.

Ahh sorry dude, Texas still does it better. But I had to try Phil's out! I recommend the onion rings, RIBS RIBS RIBS and maybe occasionally the mac salad. We ordered: * The best of both worlds (chick-less & w/ ribs) w/ side of corn: The ribs were really delicious! They fell off the bone and the meat wasn't tough or fatty. The bone-less chicken was just alright. I didn't' really like the BBQ sauce too much and the chicken could have been less dry. The corn was a big ear of corn! I was expecting a little portion of it! I felt like I was at the fair. There was a little sauce carousel w/ cajun seasoning and it came with butter. *Large onion rings: Onion to batter ratio was PERFECT. They were crispy and the onion never slid out of the casing (personal onion ring eating peeve). Came with a side of ranch. Doesn't taste as good the next day so make sure you finish it all! *Mac salad: my friend got a side of the macaroni. I usually don't like macaroni salad but I liked the celery in it which gave it a nice refreshing crunch. And they don't use your typical elbow macaroni! Yay! *Fries: reminded me of wing stop fries. I love fries so I don't have any complaints here. *Pulled pork sandwich: There was a LOT of pulled pork in this bad boy. I liked that the cole slaw provided a nice tangy textural difference. Next time, I'm getting it in the sandwich (as opposed to on the side). The slaw wasn't too bad! Ê Would I come here again? If I'm in the area I guess.

Love this place...would love it more if the line wasn't always out the door. Since there is always a line out the door when I want to go, which is why I deducted 1/2 a star, I typically order over the phone so I can by-pass the line and get my food to go. I do have to say that for the size of the line it does move pretty quickly. The baby back ribs are by far the BEST. The meat just falls off the bone and their BBQ sauce is a nice blend of sweet to spicy. I usually pair those with the chicken breast which is sometimes dry, this is where the other 1/2 of a star is deducted. Their french fries are really good too, I like when they put the ribs on top of the fries and the BBQ sauce soaks into them. I usually also get a side of the baked beans which are sweet, just the way I like them. Overall quality food with reasonable prices make this place a regular on my list. Writing this review reminded me that I need to get back there ASAP.

dude you NEED to get the food to go, the line is much much shorter! And eat in the parking lot or something- I don't think this place is worth an hour+ wait. The people who work here are really nice though- passed around fries to those of us waiting in line and there's cucumber water so you don't die of hunger. Had the baby back ribs + fries + macaroni salad. I surprisingly liked the bbq- I'm not typically a fan of sweet sauces and thankfully this was more savory/vinegary than sweet.

After much talk from friends raving about this place for months and almost years, I finally got too jealous and had to come here. ÊWe made a trip down here and grabbed lunch on the way to a day in San Diego. ÊI was forewarned by friends that the line will be long, but they also gave me a tip to go straight to the bar area to the left of the lines...the tables are first come first serve basis but the bartender will take your food order right away. ÊWhen we drove up to it, holy crap, it was almost 130pm and yes the line wrapped around the place. ÊIs it that good?! ÊAnd thank goodness for the tip because I did not want to wait in that line. ÊI happily walked by all of this and luckily found two spots at the bar. ÊYes..my mouth was already watering, it smelled so good. ÊThe place was packed! The bartender was super busy but he was very nice and attentive. ÊHe knew who walked up, needed to order, asked about drink refills, he was all over the place..he was good. ÊI was impressed. ÊHe took our drink orders right away, then our food order. ÊThe menu is not too expansive, I wish they had brisket or pulled pork on its own, more meat varieties since I'm such a meat eater, but I guess the ribs will do. Ê:) I ordered the half rack baby back ribs and an order of onion rings. ÊI was hesitant about ribs because I have never eaten ribs anywhere else that Ive loved. ÊMy favorite is from Houstons. ÊTheir ribs are deliciously fall off the bone. ÊYUmmmmmmm...and yes, I know it's not the most sophisticated place but I grew up on Tony Roma's hahah, and I do like their ribs. ÊBut I was excited to try someone else's ribs! The half rack was huge, more than i can handle. ÊIt's about 6-7 ribs and I ate three. ÊThey were definitely meaty and pretty tender. ÊThe sauce isn't anything too original but pretty good. ÊThe ribs were definitely enjoyed. ÊMMMMMMMM....the onions were crispy and huge. ÊLoved those. ÊI would definitely come back to satisfy my craving for ribs, but maybe after Houstons hahahah...mmmmm.....great stop for a trip to San Diego!

Came here after hearing a lot of great things during my visit to San Diego. ÊWhen we first arrived, the line was out the door, so I was a little discouraged because I didn't want to wait that long, but a sign said it was only a 20 minute wait from where we were standing which was very accurate. They have menus all over while you wait, and again, I was disappointed when I saw they didn't have brisket, just ribs and chicken. ÊI thought it would have more variety but that's ok, ribs will do. ÊThen I was disappointed when I saw that there was no wait service at your table, and you order at the front and seat yourself, like Armadillo Willy's. Ê:( Ordered the baby back ribs with beans and potato salad and hot diggity dog, those were some damn good ribs. ÊTender and plenty meaty. ÊI was satisfied completely. ÊThe reason for 4 stars is that they drown their ribs in sauce, which they freely and proudly advertise, and I prefer mine dry. ÊThey do offer to serve the ribs dry with sauce on the side but I was being a dumbo face. I will stop by again next time I'm in the San Diego area.

Finally got my chance to check out the incredibly popular Phil's BBQ. ÊStrategically planned on coming early and on a weekday to avoid the equally famous "epic-long line." ÊPlan worked; only took 10 mins in line and we were eating within minutes. ÊI liked that we didn't have a waiter; you order/pay at the front, the cashier hands you a pager, then you find a table. Ê The food: pretty damn awesome. So why only 4 stars? (I'd give it 4.5 if I could. ahem...yelp?!) I found that while the meat itself was cooked to perfection, the sauce overwhelmed the flavor of the meat, imho. ÊIt is indeed tangy and sweet -- perhaps a little too sweet. ÊI was definitely in a food coma afterwards. ÊWhile I started with a soda with my meal, I was screaming for some water halfway through (-0.5 star for that). ÊBut I know, to each their own... so if you dig a lot of sweet/tangy sauce on your baby backs and beefers, this place is for you. ÊDress appropriately! Also, you get A LOT of food for your money. ÊThe ribs are very meaty and the sides are abundant up the yin yang! ÊFries are reminicient of In-n-Out's and their potato salad was pretty good. ÊI spied some other dishes and the portions were equally as huge. ÊThe BBQ sammich looked great, but looked to be swimming in sauce, so I'm a lil' cautious now about getting it. ÊThe onion rings looked like they were made from huge mutant onions! ÊI will definitely have to try those on my next outing. The place: works for what it is. ÊTables in the main dining area will seat 4 and they have larger tables reserved for 6 or more people. ÊLoved the paper towel rolls on the table; you'll definitely be using A LOT of napkins. (Not eco-friendly, but hey, you're eating bbq! ÊYou're in the wrong place if you're thinking about the environment.) ÊAcoustically, it does get loud in there. ÊAnd there's something about bbq & blues/southern rock that really makes babies and kids scream extra loud! oof. Service was good. The girl before the cashier was helpful and sweet, however our cashier wasn't the friendliest of people (and here's the other -0.5 star). ÊBut everyone else was great and made us feel welcome. Overall, I'll be back to try some of the other goodies on the menu. ÊPhil's definitely lives up to its reputation and should not be missed by anyone. (Actually, go ahead and miss it...that way the line won't be as long!! Just kidding! Wuv u, Phil's!)

Came here with the family and high expectations. Having lived in the Midwest we have had our share of very good BBQ. The sandwiches were recommended as the best on the menu, so my wife and I got one each, my kids (9 &7) were smarter than us and split a rack of ribs. We also ordered fries, beans, slaw's and onion rings. The great: Nothing The good: ribs The bad: onion rings (worst I've had), fries The just ok:everything else If I do ever come back, it would be just for the ribs. Overall, just average at best.

Phil, it has been about 2 years and I still pine for you. ÊYes, there is The Joint in Bywater, and he does a 5 star job of satisfying my Q cravings, BUT, it is you PHIL who kept me full of sweet, delicious Q. The baby back ribs are my favorite, close second pulled pork (am I correct?) yeah, those 10 napkin meals and the beer I had to go get separately from the separate bar area. ÊI didn't mind, really I didn't. I miss you Phil, you were a great find....

Coming from a white boy growing up in Compton... I know barbeque! Phil's BBQ is hands down the single best bbq I have ever had. I think I even broke my Dad's heart when I told him that Phil does a better job than he does. FOOD: You cannot go wrong with the food here. Huge portions at a great price. The secret behind all the food is the awesome sauce they use. This sweet and tangy sauce could be spread on liver and onions and I would eat all that yucky stuff up. My favorite items: El Toro (tri-tip) sandwich, baby back ribs, onion rings, and macaroni salad. Great food, service, and prices - Phil's BBQ is a San Diego MUST!!!

Phil's BBQ is one of those places every San Diegan should experience. I'm sure this has been said many times, but don't let the long line intimidate you! The amazing, mouthwatering food that's waiting for you inside is worth all that queuing up. All three of us who went are small eaters - so we got two "Best of Both Worlds" combos - the beefy rib/chicken bbq plate and the baby back ribs/chickless (aka chicken breast bbq) plate. Coupled those with some of the best-tasting macaroni and potato salad I've ever had - we're not talking Costco/Sysco here! Plus a large side of mixed veggies. Mmmm! That's the shizzle right thurr. And the portions are just right - we even brought some of the food home. You order at the counter, so there are no servers to deal with. But there was this busser, a charismatic feller named Marco, who just seemed to be the most genuinely caring, sweetest busser in the entire world. He often stopped by our table to check up on the food, or if we needed anything else. He even brought us water. Now that's awesome customer service, folks. And I just have to mention the music. I'm not sure what genre it is, but all I know is it's ~southern~ music - bluesy rock 'n roll, southernized mainstream rock covers, big band, whatever you call it - the music kept me bobbing in my seat throughout our meal. It's not the stuff that typically floats my boat, but there's something about this kind of music and mackin' on bbq that goes together so well. It's osm. It amazes me how a place that's so hyped up can actually live up to it.

When it comes to BBQ Phil's knows what it's about. Now let me explain the four instead of five stars: For a place with a massive line, I wish the food would be piping hot when I received it. Also, I am more of a savory BBQ person, Phil's sauce is more tangy (felt like there was some cinnamon in there). I got the pulled pork sandwich that was delicious just not hot enough. The ribs my friends got instead was more food for your money. If you like tangy, sweet, BBQ Phil's will be your heaven, just make sure to head over when you're not even hungry otherwise by the time you order you will be famished.

Portions are CRAZY huge. For individual portions, I would highly recommend getting the "ticklers." Getting one of the combination plates will make you really full. I like their beef ribs and chicken; this place prizes itself over its special BBQ sauce, which has a sweet, molasses consistency. Sorry I can't give this place a 5/5. All my SD friends raved about Phil's, but hands down there are other BBQ joints that beats this place. There are long wait times esp. during the weekend lunch craze. They have amazing coleslaw, fries and baked beans. It's good for large crowds. Did I forget to mention their staff is super friendly?

I heard this place was amazing and therefore when I was in San Diego I made sure to go here with my wife. ÊThe line at 7:30pm on a Friday night was out the door and around the corner. Ê2 Hours later we were finally inside. ÊNot sure which to choose I went with the chicken and ribs combo with fries. ÊThe sauce they use on the chicken and ribs is amazing, spicy and sweet. ÊHowever, the chicken was nothing to write home about and neither were the fries, kind of bland. ÊThe thing to go here for is the ribs. ÊThey were some of the best ribs I've ever eaten, comes right off the bone and were perfectly cooked. ÊNext time we're in the area, if the line isn't long we'll stop in again for some ribs, but with all the hype I expected a bit more.

This place has a lot of hype around it. I that you can order, pick your own table, then wait for the buzzer to pick up your food. It seems to go off pretty quickly. That't the only ok thing about this place. I waited in line for an hour (Saturday afternoon). I ordered a chicken sandwich. When I got it I immediately thought it looked nasty. I was a burnt piece of grilled chicken with a huge blob of BBQ sauce on it. The sauce was all over the place even on top of the bun. I get that BBQ isn't tidy food but this went overboard. Ê On top of that, I took 2 bites of my sandwich and honestly couldn't finish it. It was disgusting. Worst BBQ flavor I've ever tasted. Oh and the french fries were nasty too. Horrible food. I'll never go again.

Came by a few months ago. ÊI'm not a huge fan of baby back ribs, but this place is worth the hype. ÊI'm not so sure it's worth the 2-hour wait in line on busy days, though. ÊFortunately an employee does come by to offer complimentary fries for the hungry guests in line. The meat on the baby back ribs literally fall off the bones when I begin to consume it. ÊThe Onion Rings were also very delicious.

There are two types of restaurants in the world - restaurants who fail to live up to the hype, and ones that do so. Phils was definitely the latter. People don't realize that barbeque is expensive. It's a lot of protein, and protein is expensive!!! With that said, I think Phils is considered to be really cheap for barbeque. I've been to other places, and all charge more than Phils. Now that value is out of the way, the other 4 stars goes towards the taste. I've never had "legit" all american barbeques before, but I think Phils is already pretty darn tasty. The ribs fall off the bone and you can taste all the smokiness it gets from the smoker. But I think the X factor behind all this deliciousness is the sauce. When you get your ribs, always make sure you ask for extra sauce. With every bite of ribs, make sure you soak your ribs in that delicious sauce!!! I come here almost every time when I visit my friends at SD. Believe the hype.

Most people might think i'm crazy for giving Phils only four stars. However, i do have my argument here. Phil BBQ is a great place to try and almost a must try if you don't live in san diego. their tenderness of the beef and the meat falling right off the bone as you bite it is something very difficult to do. There's usually long lines but they move very quickly. Their side dishes are very traditionally american food and they also prepare it well. Alternatives such as chicken and beef ribs are also fantastic choices if you prefer somethign aside from pork however, i cannot come here more than once a month. The heaviness of the sauce doesn't make me crave phils for a long while and i think that may be the biggest upset of a great restaurant. I understand that the BBQ sauce from Phils is what makes Phils, but for someone that loves food as much as i do, i cannot give 5 star rating to a place that i don't crave enough. but i mean, if you're totally craving for ribs, this place is totally bomb ;)

Two words: ÊMUST EXPERIENCE. Phil's cannot be described in words. There needs to be an adjective in the English dictionary that accurately defines delicious-epic-fingerlickin' good-life fulfilling-want to come back again and again good. There can be long lines FYI but hey, for the nation's best baby back ribs, i think it's worth it. Plus, it builds anticipation and good character. You get a bib to wear. That right there should tell you that you are in for a TREAT.

Okay, maybe i don't rate it as high as other Yelpers. . . We went here on a day off for me. So we were able to get in line before they opened and we were still at least 10 peeps back. But as soon as they opened, the line moved quickly. We met the greeter and she is cooly cool. It was our first time, so ...we wanted to get a good taste. The cashier was attentive in getting our order. All good, got our pager for when our food is ready and we went to get a booth. In hardly any time, the food was ready. We picked: Full rack baby back ribs. Sauce on the side for me. I judge my bbq without the sauce to see where the seasoning is at. Great flavor. Tasty seasoning. Pork ribs cooked to perfection. Nicely charred on the outside and tender on the inside. Dipped some on the side, sauce was pretty good too, even for a non-sauce guy like myself. The sides I got were: potato salad - nice flavor without the over-powering taste of Dill. Also got baked beans - very tasty stuff, not too sweet. Boo got the El Toro - Tri tip sandwich smothered in the house bbq sauce. It was also tasty and the bread was delicious. The onion rings and fries were huge for a small order. Both, crispy and, well, what can we say...fried goodness! The staff is friendly. Taking your dirty plates and making sure all is cool with you. Place got packed fast. We can see that line kept on getting longer. We were so glad we finally got to experience this bbq place that people have been talking about. One thing I do wish they had was rib tips or burnt ends. You get a 3.75 stars for the tasty ribs. But for the sides selection is a 3. No burnt ends, rib tips or short ribs either? Wow. 2 in my book. Maybe they would have some if I asked one of the staff. Next time, Phil's...next time.

I'm going to say it, I don't like ribs. Actually, if you really knew me, you'd know I like ribs, I just don't like to eat anything that has a bone in it when served. (I know your mind is going there, so just come back to me when you've let the thought finish...) Done? Okay. Dragged here against my will, my jaw dropped when I saw the line to get in to this place. I also don't like lines either. It's a good thing I went with some pros who showed me the secret way of getting a table and eating in less than an hour. Sorry, I've been sworn to secrecy not to tell. The four of us troublemakers ordered up a pitcher of beer. Finished it before the food came. So HAD to order another pitcher. I got the Chick Tickler, why? Because I thought the name was cute, and again, I don't eat things off bones. Plus, who can say no to ONION RINGS?! I'm on a new journey on looking for the best onion rings, suggestions welcome. Back to the food, right. Chick Tickler? Everything I wanted it to be. Not on a bone, onion ring heaven, and "cold slaw" in honor of my friend Evelyn who didn't know until last weekend that it's "cole slaw". Then to top it off, our neighbors offered us the rest of their pitcher of beer! (We all think it's because the guy was on a date with a girl out of his league - why would he bring a girl to Phil's on what looked like a first date? Plus, he was shorter than her. It was never going to happen). Which brings me to the boys in there... Um... Really good odds. Yeah, it's dude central.

Phil's is my favorite BBQ joint in Socal! ÊI discovered it a couple years ago in San Diego and had it again a couple months ago in their new San Marcos location, which is a 60 mile drive instead of 85. ÊI drove there just to eat at Phil's, so yea it's pretty good! Normally I like St. Louis ribs better, but Phil's babyback ribs are excellent... that and they don't have St. Louis ribs. ÊAlthough I don't think they're actually smoked, they're extremely tender and rich in flavor. ÊThe texture of the meat is good. ÊIt falls off the bone, but only if you pull. ÊSome places have ribs that I actually think is too tender, where the meat can literally fall off from the force of gravity and is too soft. ÊThey throw a ton of BBQ sauce on which can be a bit overwhelming, but you can ask to get it on the side. ÊMy only complaint is that the sauce is a bit too vinegary for me, but most people really like it. ÊThe beef ribs are not bad, the not as good as the pork. A full rack of ribs combo dinner is $18.95, which is really not bad for the amount of food you get. ÊI really like their fries also -- natural cut, crispy on the outside and soft inside. ÊDon't get a large order of fries. ÊThe small order is HUGE and can easily feed 2 people. ÊI hope they open another location in OC!

I've been here twice in my life, once 6 years ago in high school and that was the best barbeque experience i've ever had in my life. ÊGood service, best barbeque i've tried at the time, i couldn't ask for more. Now 6 years older, i went back with the hopes and expectations of the memory i had of this place. ÊThe cashier service has become atrocious, and the food quality had greatly declined. ÊI expect so much more from a place i've held to such high prestige.

I've been in San Diego for a year and a half and have never ever had the desire to try Phil's, despite the hype surrounding it. But we finally got to go there for a friend's birthday. I didn't finish ANYTHING. There were enough leftovers for an entire dinner the next day, and I got the half-rack. Because this is one of those meals where there comes a point where you feel sick because all the food is heavy, greasy, creamy, and drenched in trans fat sauces. Not their fault though... I just don't have an appetite for that stuff. I got the "fall-off-the-bone ribs", macaroni salad, and the fries. The ribs were as good as everyone says they are, but my mouth never waters when I think about them and I think I'll stick with a sandwich next time I go. The fries were okay... but the macaroni salad. Ohhhhh baby.............. maybe next time, if ever, I will stick to purely sides. They definitely give you enough to fill you up. I also sampled some of my friend's coleslaw and I hate coleslaw... but I ordered one of my own after trying hers out. I was about to give this place 4 stars, but I WILL give them an extra because: +: service. Their service was AWESOME. Although I felt really bad because the man helping us out was old and cute and grandpa-like, and I just feel plain uncomfortable when people give off that way-too-nice-shouldn't-be-working-as-a-waiter-at-?Phil's-because-they-deserve-better vibe. Yeah... it was one of those. +: Their system of payment. Clever... they must know that a lot of college students sans enough money to treat their entire party to dinner come here, and being as busy as they are, they don't have time to split the bill and deal with the graciousness required to wait on tables. I know that comment sounds like it's a bad thing, but it's not. It's win-win. They don't need to shell out great service because I'm not tipping for it (although the people bringing you stuff are quite gracious as it is). And I save money on tip! Yippeeeeeeee

OK For a BBQ aficionado, this place is pretty good. Not fantastic but pretty good. Sauce is tangy and tasteful, Ribs were tender and juicy, chicken was a little on the dry side, but the Tri-Tip sandwich was VERY good! I was surprised at the line at this place. In my opinion, it would be better if they offered table side service; vice the order at the counter, come get your order when your pager goes off. But that would slow down the service significantly! A sign outside says "21 Min and 14 Seconds from here" it took 45 Minutes, I understand it is a joking estimate and I have no problems just relaying how it was for us. The great thing is the complimentary water and the beer garden available while you wait in the line. nice touch. 4 vice 5 stars due to some of the food being a bit dry and not having table service. Slinte!

Oh Phil's...I so badly wanted to fall IN LOVE with you. Would you settle for IN LIKE with you. Came here for the Hubby's burpday lunch. Neither of us had ever been and Phil's was on our hit list for some time. So off we go... I had a half rack of ribs. Hubby had their Broham sandwich. No sides came with either so we decided to order a side of macaroni salad, potato salad and baked beans. The ribs were definitely tasty. Were they $11 and some change tasty? I don't know...maybe I'd feel better if they actually included the sides. I am sure that I wouldn't complain about the price then. But I just didn't think the quantity matched the price. Believe me, I am so willing to throw down the bills for exceptional food but one of two things has to happen...quality or quantity. Now the Hubby's Broham was ginormous! Again no sides were included but then again it was only $7 (rounding up). I thought that was way worth it. (Scratching my head...) I don't get it. I have to say it was just as delicious as my half rack of ribs and probably had as much meat as I had on my plate! The sides were all meh. To be fair, it could be my palate. I'm used to the island style mac salad and potato salad. And me being the opposite of an onion-lover, I didn't appreciate the bits of raw onions that would surprise me when I'd take a bite. The baked beans...I was hopeful. It was too peppery for my liking...but again, could just be my palate. Phil's seemed to have a pretty organized ordering system. Menus are posted everywhere so you can contemplate and have a decision made when it was your turn. There's a sink to rinse your messy hands. Tons of parking. Outdoor seating to be taken advantage of especially with beautiful SD weather. Overall, it was just A-OK to me. I'm willing to give it another shot, but this time I think I'd order something different. Clearly, Phil's is doing something right and there are tons who are IN LOVE with Phil's just based on the packed restaurant. Maybe one day, he'll sweep me off my feet . For now, I'll play hard to get. ;)

Phil's BBQ is one of my favorites and if you haven't tried it before you have to try it, their baby back ribs are simply the best in my opinion. ÊAlthough Phil's has changed since it was at a small location on Goldfinch St in Mission Hills which had a homey feel with it's board games to pass the time while you waited to the current location with a lot more seating area and very nice bar area with televisions. ÊSome things haven't changed, you will probably have to wait in line but it's all worth it because the staff is great and you will get great quality food. The baby back ribs are so good it is very hard from me to pick something else to try but I did recently try the Broham Pulled Pork Sandwich, although very good baby back ribs are still my poison. The sides are all very good, although recently I have only been getting their rib tickler which doesn't allow for substitutions but bbq sauce covered fries and coleslaw are great and at a great price. ÊA tip for not waiting in line is to call in your order and you can skip the line and enjoy Phil's to go!

Question: ÊWhat's tougher than Chuck Norris? Answer: The meat at Phil's BBQ This is my second review for Phil's BBQ, since my first review was flagged and removed. ÊApparently it "lacks a substantive firsthand experience." My first review was this: Phil's BBQ is all hype and carbohydrates. Ê "When reviewing, please describe your actual experience with a business." Okay so here goes. Ê A group of us visited Phil's one evening as a farewell dinner for my sister before she left for college. ÊThey waited in line for a good 45 minutes, and once we all arrived, we were practically pushed to the registers and rushed to place our order. ÊI understand trying to keep the line going, but I felt like we and the rest of the people in line were handled like a herd of cattle. ÊMy poor boyfriend was pressured into ordering something off of the menu that he didn't really want, you know, just to keep the line moving. Inside the restaurant: crowded, chaotic, loud, impersonal... sort of reminded me of a high school cafeteria, from hell. ÊWere we trying so hard to recover from our horrible line and ordering experience, but it was nearly impossible in such an environment. Luckily, our server was amazing. That was the only good thing that I can say about Phil's BBQ, our server, I wish I can remember his name. ÊHe was positive and upbeat, and I definitely give him credit for being able to keep his cheerful demeanor in such chaos. Now the food. ÊI have to say, the BBQ sauce is pretty good. ÊThe meat on the other hand, not so good. ÊThe ribs were tough, you would think, at a place that has nearly 4.5 stars on yelp, the meat would fall right off of the bone. ÊNope. I ordered the "Chicken Tickler".. I expected chicken with a side of french fries. ÊWhat I did get french fries with a side of chicken. ÊThey weren't kidding about tickling the plate with chicken. ÊThat chicken was scarce! I truly wanted to enjoy my experience, because seriously, (and I don't know why) EVERYBODY and their mom likes this place. I'm sorry I can't say that I feel the same way. I've had Phil's BBQ before and it was great, but I'm thinking their quality has just gone down the drain ever since it was on "Man vs. Food" because they know people will keep on coming. If you've never been to Phil's BBQ and you see that line that wraps around the corner.. you ask yourself "Is it worth the wait?" - NO. That's pretty much it, and I hope it adheres to Yelp's "yelping" requirements.

After reading the glowing reviews for this place, it almost made me believe that Jesus himself came down from heaven to man their BBQ. Was the food good? ÊYes it was. ÊWas the food amazing? ÊNope. Ê If you have never had real BBQ that has been smoked for hours to absolute perfection, then you might think this is amazing. ÊIf you have never lived in the country and stopped off at at roadside stand to have meat grilled over an oak pit, then you might think this is amazing. If you can go on over when the wait is 15 minutes or less, then go for it. ÊThe food is tasty, the service is friendly, and the food is solid. ÊIt just isn't worth waiting 45 minutes for, and it isn't worth bragging about (unless the status of the restaurant is how you choose what is for dinner).

I'm not really into the BBQ scene but this place is pretty good. Have i had better? YES! I've only been here a couple times and it's not because i hate it, its because i dont really eat BBQ. But the times i do come here i usually just get "Best of Both" Rib-lets and the Chick-less with either 2 small sides or 1 big side. With the sides i never go wrong on choosing the fries and usually for the other side its a toss up between sweet baked beans or the macaroni salad which both are delicious. Overall food quality meats juicy and hardly dry if that makes sense. Never any complaints on dry meat. Prices for this place is kinda high, if you're not looking forward to paying $15.00 or higher i wouldn't recommend it to anyone. This place every time is ALWAYS packed. Service is always great and it doesn't really take to long to get my food.

Saw the HIGH ratings on Yelp PLUS the hotel clerk said to try this place out I phoned in an order and picked it up to eat in my hotel. When yelpers say this place is BUSY ... ok THIS place is BuSY!!!! If I waited to dine in, it would have been a 2 hour wait. ÊAll I did was PICK UP the food and that took 40 minutes. ÊNOT BECAUSE the food wasn't ready. ÊThe food WAS READY! ÊIt was sitting on the counter all bagged up waiting for me. ÊJust the LINE TO PAY and PICK UP the food was 40 minutes long. ÊBut hey, this is one way to socialize and talk with people. So be prepared to wait if you want to eat/order here. And I went at 6PM on a Sunday night. Why the 4 stars? The pepper. ÊEVERYTHING had pepper in it. ÊMy 2 year old toddler couldn't eat anything because it was so peppery. Ê * Baby Back Ribs - EXTREMELY tender and scrumptious. ÊJust too much pepper. Ê * Sweet Beans - Very sweet and delicious ... too much pepper. * Cole Slaw - Tasted fresh ... but too much pepper. * Ceasar Salad - Super fresh ... but too much pepper. * Onion Rings - SUPER HUGE ... didn't think onions could be so big. ÊLOVED IT. ÊNo pepper! ÊYAY! If you are a PEPPER lover, this place is for you! Unfortunately I'm not a fan of all that pepper so as much as I LOVED the baby back ribs I'll have to pass on this restaurant.

Go for the baby back or beefy ribs. I personally prefer the baby back but really, both are great! You will be blown away by the smoky flavor and the tender, juicy meat. I like getting the tickler size because it is just the right portion for me. I also love that Phil's makes it so easier to clean up the mess (big sinks, paper towels, wipes, etc) so there is no inconvenience in picking up the ribs with your hands. Expect a long wait (45 minutes to an hour) Êespecially on Saturday evenings. If you want to skip the wait, do a phone order and take the ribs home.

I understand why people wait. The food is delicious! The ribs are savory, the corn is sweet, and the potato salad is hearty. We stood in line for almost two hours, but servers came out with onion rings and fries to keep waiting patrons happy. The staff was helpful, and the food came out promptly after we ordered. I ordered a chocolate whoopie for dessert, but had to bring it home, because I was too full after dinner.

My second attempt to check this place out was a success! We got here at 3 in the afternoon on a Sunday and the line was still long but it was moving. Right as we pulled into the parking lot I made a dash to the end of the line. Good timing because a handful of people followed right behind me. This restaurant isn't your typical waiter service type, the line we stood in is to order your food. After they'll hand you a pager when your food is ready. We didn't have a problem finding a table after we ordered. There are signs saying you can't save seats before you put in your order. We ordered a full rack of baby back ribs with steamed veggies, one beef rib sampler, and a beefy rib tickler comes with one beef rib, fries, coleslaw, and two onion rings. When I got paged the manager took back my order of the beefy rib sampler saying it didn't have enough meat on it. I waited a couple minutes and when I got the new order they added another beef rib on the house! Now that's awesome service and I didn't even complain about the wait or anything. The beef ribs were full of flavor and very tender. I liked that the bbq had a slight kick to it but it was a little too tangy for me. I wish I ordered the sauce on the side. The baby back ribs were good too, our batch wasn't really "fall off the bone" tender but I enjoyed them. If I had to pick I liked the beef ribs better. The onion rings were good but kind of oily. The french fries were nothing special and a little soggy because the rib was right on top of it. I did like the coleslaw a lot and usually I don't care for it. This time I actually finished it. Next time I'm in San Diego I'll phone in my order, get the El Toro, and take it back to LA with me. As Seen On TV: Man v. Food - Travel Channel

Dear Phil, You have made another 2 LA residents fans of your BBQ joint. Your staff, food, and restaurant in all are fucking awesome. Love, Me We got there exactly at 11:07 (7 minutes after they opened) and already there was a line of about 20 people ahead of us. The line moved quickly and efficiently. It's smart how its set up for the volume of people who pass through. You're directed by a very nice man to a free cashier, get issued a taser likebeeper, find your own seating and wait for the little beeper to go off and grab your food. I got the Rib-less dinner with potato salad + cole slaw. Meat + sauce was delicious, potato salad a total winner, slaw was a little too sweet and fruity for me. I like it with more vinegar but it was refreshing nonetheless. Every staff member we interacted with gave 5-star service with smiles. The gentleman who was Êwalking around our section (His name tag read R. Af or something to that effect) made sure everything was in order and was so cool. He even pulled my chair out for me!!! How cute. He noticed my friend was watching her buzzer and me bury my face in the food so he went to check on her order and personally brought it over. I'm looking forward to making the trip down soon.

I probably don't need to say much about this place as the other reviews are pretty thorough, but you will leave this place stuffed and very satisfied. Phil's is one of those places you have to try when you're in San Diego. Its employees are enthusiastic and happy to work there and are more than happy to give you recommendations. The main downside of this restaurant is the wait, which can often be 40-60 minutes. They try to make the wait less painful by coming out with fresh fries for you to try, which is an awesome courtesy. Definitely not a friendly place for vegetarians.

I dare you to try and tackle the full beef rack without getting messy! No visit to SD is ever complete until you go to Phil's BBQ. If you are a rib lover, this is the place to go! Seriously delicious fall-off-the-bone ribs. I prefer the Beef ribs, however, some people love the baby back pork ribs. This place is award winning for a reason, and you will not be disappointed with the portions for sure. Grab some Onion rings, salad, or other appetizers if you really want; but, I will tell you... it's not necessary - go straight for the beef ribs and you are good to go! This place is like a cafeteria where you place your order, and find your own seats. This place is great for large parties because you can order and pay seperately, so no headaches over splitting the bill! The place is worth the wait, and has a great service where you can purchase some alcoholic drinks while you wait. Anticipate anywhere between 20 - 1 hour wait. So plan ahead!

We ordered 3 beef ribs, 1 baby back rib dinner with a side of fries and potato sald and another small side of onion rings. I loved everything I had here.. I just wish I had another stomach.. yummyyy Thanks to my tour guide... a friend who suggested we must go here, I loved it... With the meal above and 3 ppl to share.. It was more than enough. All of the above was suggested by the worker there and we took her advice. Glad we did. Liked it so much I bought the sauce to go.

Visiting San Diego on vacation. Heard about Phil's so had to try it. We drove over and the line was so long, we decided to call and order to go. No wait at all as they had the food ready. It just needed to be packaged up. We drive back to our hotel and excitedly dig in. It was ok, good even. But I just don't get what the fuss is all about. It was good BBQ but not the most amazing thing ever like people said. Had the baby back ribs and onion rings. Meat was very tender. But I am so glad we didn't wait in that long line. It was just....ok BBQ.

GOTTA TRY THIS ONE if you're in San Diego. THE END. Does this place really need a 2,226th review? Probably not. With a 4.5 average rating, how can 2000+ people be wrong? Ryan M. highly recommended this place, so I made it my mission to try it. ÊMy initial impression was that Ryan must be crazy. I've never seen so many people waiting to eat at a restaurant. Lucky for us, we called in our order. We called in our order at 5:00pm on a Saturday. The guy told us our order would take 45 minutes, and that we would probably have to wait about 20 minutes once we got there. ÊThat was sort of annoying at first...because I think they don't even bother to put your order together until you show up, even if they know what you want. We got there at 5:30pm and over 100 of the above mentioned 2000 people were waiting in the line which wrapped around the restaurant when we got there. ÊI couldn't even find a parking space so I dropped off my husband and went to the grocery store to buy the drinks. Half an hour later we returned and he was still in the take-out line!! Yes, don't get in the wrong line!! There is the line to eat in the restaurant (which can be over 2 hours long), and then there is the other line to pick up your phone orders (which was about 30 minutes for us). Normally in my regular life, I would NEVER wait in a line that long for anything. ÊBut I was on vacation and I had my best friends in my rental mini-van to entertain the kids and we were having a good time driving down the 5, searching for VONS etc...while we waited for our food. This place has a web-cam so you can see how long the line is before you drive down there...there are signs like at Disneyland that say http://www.yelp.com/biz_É so you know how much longer you have to wait.... We ordered: 2 Full Racks of Ribs which were the softest, juiciest, fall-off-the bone ribs that I've ever eaten, here's a borrowed picture: http://www.yelp.com/biz_É all smothered in Phil's famous BBQ sauce (which can be purchased in the restaurant or at Costco in San Diego, btw). http://www.yelp.com/biz_É 1 Half Chicken plate which was surprisingly moist and juicy. Most BBQ places tend to make the chicken too dry, or they burn the outside. Phil's chicken was just perfect. Here's another borrowed picture: http://www.yelp.com/biz_É 2 Broham sandwiches, which are pulled pork and coleslaw sandwiches. You can't really eat them with your hands, those suckers are waaaayyyy too big. http://www.yelp.com/biz_É Our sides were: baked beans, corn on the cob, and fries. ÊThe baked beans are a definite WINNER. The fries I could do without next time. Double up on the beans!! I didn't bother to take any pictures because we were too busy eating. Thanks Ryan, you are not crazy after all. BEST BBQ place EVER.

I was super excited to try this place out. ÊSeveral people had recommended it to me and I guess I had very high expectations. ÊI am from 'BBQ' country so I am not really the best person to be open minded about BBQ. ÊI stood in line for about 10 minutes to order and then found a seat outside, which was nice until everyone started taking other people's tables while they went to get their food. ÊI ordered the full baby back rib meal that came with a heap of fries and backed beans. ÊThe ribs were truly 'baby' backs. ÊI cannot say that I have ever seen such tiny baby back ribs before. ÊThe rub on the ribs was nice and the sauce was a bit spicy for my liking as I am more of a sweet sauce guy. ÊI have to say that the staff was VERY helpful and friendly. ÊI guess that I shouldn't have listened to all the hype. ÊI will say that San Diego is not really the BBQ capitol of the world so Phil's is a very good place to eat BBQ. ÊOverall, I did enjoy my food and dining experience, but still do not think it can live up to all the hype.

We come here to celebrate! Normally, in a large group. I usually split a Beefy Rib dinner with a friend. It comes with 3 ribs and 2 sides, which is just enough for a pair of small girls. The ribs are gigantic and the meat is tender and comes straight off the bone! Only sometimes, it can be more burnt than usually. There's almost nothing else to say, except that It's just so... good!

Phil's BBQ, do you really need ANOTHER 5-star Yelp review? Well, okay. Here it is. *FIVE* stars. Their baby back ribs are some of the tastiest I've had. And the sides? All very good too! The wait is insanely long 98% of the time but like I tell everyone...it's going to be so worth it, just wait and see! Your legs will be mad but your belly will be happy. It all works out in the end. And once you do finally get your order in, you get your food in no time -- maybe 5 minutes max.

My three star rating is probably going to make some people mad/angry/confused, but it's my honest opinion of Phil's BBQ. My #1 standard order for a BBQ place is Tri Tip. When I checked out the menu I saw that the only tri tip was a "deli sliced sandwich" hmmmm that doesn't sound right this side of Subway, so I went for my #2 choice, pulled pork sammie. The gist of this sandwich is quantity over quality. I had to take out half of the pork just to call this a sandwich and then douse the pork in bbq sauce because it was so dry. I tried the onion rings which are visibly appealing, but are disappointingly soggy. The worst of the meal was the baked potato. It was a baked potato with a slice of processed Kraft cheese folded inside it. It was inedible. My final conclusion of Phil's is that it is for children who enjoy BBQ or for people who want to shovel in the food without much dependency on taste. I would have given them 2 stars, but I really liked the BBQ sauce. I bought two bottles. The next day Mr. R and I made a Tri Tip and had used Phil's sauce and it was fantastic. I would choose Famous Dave's in a second over Phil's, possibly even Lucille's. Here's a recap: Pulled Pork Sammie: 2 Stars Baked Potato: 1 Star Onion Rings: 2 Stars BBQ Sauce 5 Stars

I think Phils used to be better. Either that or the crowds just detract from the overall experience. I think the prices are fair and average and the food is average as well, but I definitely do not think that the lines and searching for a table are worth it in the long run. Weekdays during non-peak hours are worth it, but I would never stand in line for more than 15 minutes to eat here.

Ok. There are so many mediocre reviews on this page. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, My husband and myself have traveled a good part of the US and know good food when we taste it. This BBQ joint is fabulous. Yes, on Saturday night it was crowded. We waited in line for 45 minutes. We did find a place to sit once we ordered and our food was served promptly after we ordered. The bbq sauce that Phil has concocted is by far ingenious. The sweet tangy spicy mixture is sure to please even the most picky eaters taste buds. I highly recommend this place to anyone who loves an adventure and some good food!

Visited this place for the first time over the weekend during dinner time. ÊDefinitely a bad idea because there was a huge line out the door for the establishment. ÊHowever a long line usually means the place is good, right? We ordered the full rack of baby back ribs, the broham sandwich, large onion rings, small mac salad, small bbq beans. The onion rings were HUGE. ÊThey were quite tasty, and very crunchy. ÊMac salad and the bbq beans tasted average. ÊThe baby back ribs tasted good, I think it tasted better than lucille's. ÊThe broham sandwich tasted very smokey and the pulled pork was juicy, however the juicyness tasted more like it held too much water than pork juices, so wasn't as good as I hoped. Overall a good experience.

Came at 6pm on a Saturday on a friend's recommendation and didn't know what to expect. Holy cow! The line was out the door, around the corner, and down the length of the restaurant. I've never in my life seen such a line for a BBQ place. We didn't get to sit down and eat until right after 7:30pm. I guess it was worth the wait to get ribs that just melt in your mouth, but only once in a blue moon can I stand that line. Coming from Texas, I love my BBQ, so I'm glad Phil's stuck with ribs and didn't try to make brisket and sausage. I've been disappointed in every BBQ joint in California in the past 7 years. Phil's is best BBQ in California that I've found so far!

I've gone here over 20+ times and I always leave incredibly satisfied. Make sure you join the mailing list (with your real birthday) and get a front-of-the-line pass on your birthday week (this is SO useful). Also, avoid crazy busy hours. It sucks waiting sometimes...but it's always worth the wait. I also think the Rib Ticklers are such a DEAL (I believe it's like 6.95?). The 3-4 pork ribs are CHUNKY too. You get a good portion of food and make sure you ask for the fries on a different plate to get more! you NEVER disappoint me, Phils. Thanks for existing in SD.

This place seriously doesn't need anymore reviews so I will make this quick. Outstanding service and great food. Workers all seem happy to serve you. I hate the line for this place but the wait is what makes your meal that much better. My personal favorite is the BBQ Broham sandwich aka pulled pork sandwich. They give you so much meat on the sandwich that I have to take half off just to close the sandwich to fit it in my mouth.

Firstly: Phil's is good. Secondly: You will have to wait in line. Now that those are out of the way, allow me to elaborate: ÊPhil's business model basically has you wait in a God-awfully long line for up to a couple hours, order at a counter, and then fight for a seat so you can eat when your food is ready. ÊIt's worth it, but only just...and I'd never go there when the wait is over, say, half an hour. ÊWhen they're busy, this model lets you basically wait, order, and eat, and someone else to do the same right after you. ÊThe timing works, but at the same time it's not the most pleasant experience... Everyone raves about Phil's food. ÊIt's good, and I'm defintiely a fan. ÊStill, they can be a little skimpy on the BBQ sauce, and the fries aren't great. ÊI'm also not ga-ga over their sauce, like some peolpe are...and they can be a little skimpy with it anyways (but, if you go ask for more, you can get it. ÊI think they're supposed to charge you, but they didn't for me on Sunday, so whatever...I'll take it...) The ribs are good, as is the pulled pork sandwhich. ÊBoth are really tender and super filling. ÊThe steak sandwich, chicken, and baked beans are all okay--the chicken especially depends on how much sauce you put on it. ÊAs I said above, the fries suck...so maybe get a small one until you're sure of it. Parking can be a hassle, but the staff is always really friendly. ÊI'd say, if you can manage it, you're better off calling in your order, picking it up, and taking it elsewhere to eat (the beach is only a few minutes away!). ÊPhoning in means you get to skip the queue...so consider it the next time you're at Phil's.

Phil's BBQ is always a great time! ÊThe line was out the door (which should be expected on every visit). ÊI usually get the Broham and share a side of rings. ÊThe service here is amazing as well. ÊThey really know how to handle the big crowds.

This place is pretty good. The down is that the line is ridiculously LONG. My boyfriend and I waited for about 2 hours. It was like waiting in line for splash mountain at Disneyland or something! However, the food paid off. BBQ ribs were BOMB! The meat just slides right off the bone. We ordered BBQ ribs, BBQ chicken which is okay...kinda dry... with 2 sides, baked beans and fries. YUM! oh yeah when youre near the front, you'll see a sign that says "22 mins 14 sec from this point" sign (i think)..LIES. I waited for another 37 mins. But i guess its okay because they had a worker to entertain us.

Visited SD this weekend and FINALLLY got to go to Phil's! My friends talk nonstop about it and oftentimes drive 2 hours just for some of this BBQ. We got there around 7pm, and the line looked so long - luckily for people in line, i saw servers passing around trays of french fries to keep hungry tummies happy!! We anticipated the long line, so called in our order and only had to wait in a 10 minute To-Go line. Baby Back Ribs: YUM! Beef Ribs: LARGE and YUM! Beer Battered Onion Rings: SO MANY in one serving and also YUM! Come hungry! Servings are pretty big - for 2 guys and 2 girls, we ordered 2 full racks of baby back ribs, 3 beef ribs, onion rings and fries, and we ended up SO FULL and also probably only killed 2/3 of it.

I went here last week with my friends and I have been wanting to try this place for forever now. I was so excited to eat here that i starved myself before this so i can pig out here. My friends and I got here at about 4 o clock, which was the perfect time because we did not have to wait at all. I got the 1/2 baby back ribs with fries and macaroni salad. The food came out super fast and the macaroni salad was really good, but the fries were whatever. I also sampled my friend's food and the beef ribs were really good too. It was more than enough food for me. I will definitely come back here again. This is one of Êthe best bbq that I've ever Êhad and its pretty cheap compared to other BBQ places. Just make sure you come early so you don't have to wait forever in line. It gets super busy here.

I come here at least once every 2 weeks. I remember one time coming and it was during the dinner rush hours and me and my friends had to wait 2 hours in the cold, but it was SO WORTH IT. It's a definitely must go place since their baby back ribs are renowned. I usually order the half-rack since it's a reasonable $14 and comes with two sides. I always get the macaroni salad, it's like the best thing there IMO =) Not only is the food delicious in every aspect, but the workers there are super friendly. Most of the time they are packed but they cycle through tables really fast and the workers are most willing to help you find a suitable table. Another thing I love about this place is their restroom. Since eating at Phil's is such a messy deed, we all have to go wash our hands. The cool part is, they have the Dyson hand dryers that basically dry your hands in 10 seconds with those powerful bladeless dryers! A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! Basically, if you're new to the SD area and you're craving something good and top of the line, then Phil's BBQ is the MUST-GO place! I promise you will not regret Phil's BBQ.

I never believed in ribs til I tried Phil's famous half-rack of ribs. I never ate ribs that my mom used to make for me as a kid. I hate getting my hands dirty and am not a believer of finger food, especially at public restaurants. The ribs here thankfully are so soft and tender, that it's so easy to eat with a fork and knife. Call me high maintenance, but it's a lot easier to eat and a lot less messy! The half rack always satisfies. I'm a small girl, but the half rack does the job. If you're not that hungry, get the tickler. Sometimes, I order the half-rack and my friend orders the tickler and our dishes look identical, give or take one bone. Lame... I try to stay healthy so I order the mac salad and cole slaw as my sides. I try to stay away from the french fries but I sneak them into my order occasionally. They go so well with the fries seasoning, yum! The onion rings are a hit or miss. Sometimes they taste like paper machet. Though I've never tasted paper machet. The lines are ridiculously long especially on the weekends. But I forgive- the wait and anticipation makes the food taste even more delicious. Mr. Phil, I'd just like to say thanks for introducing me to ribs that are out of this world. Sincerely, E.

I had heard a lot about this place from my friends every time I would visit San Diego. But for one reason or another I never made time to visit until last Sunday. I got to say it lived up to the hype! The meat on my baby back ribs were tender and fell right off the bone no problem. The BBQ sauce had just enough sweetness to it along with a good Bold kick to it but not to thick or to watery... just right. The cistomer service was friendly and on top of it. I recommend this place to anyone!

Oh Phil's.. I think I've become a fan of BBQ foods after coming here. Food: Baby back ribs - delicious! It comes with the right about of BBQ sauce (which is tangy and a bit spicy) and if that's not enough, just ask for more! The meat was super tender and melted in my mouth. Fries - yumyumyum! I LOVE FRENCH FRIES. and I would definitely come back here just for the fries. I split a large portion with someone else and still wanted more. Yes, I'm a fatass. :( Macaroni salad - Not your typical elbow macaroni (+points there). It doesn't have as much mayo as your normal macaroni salad.. but it's GOOD. Garlic-y. Need I say more? Chickless - Meh. I'd prefer the baby back ribs over the chicken.. Service: Attentive. Someone came by and asked if he could get us more bbq sauce/ranch before we even had a chance to take a bite of our food! Parking: Can be a pain in the butt when it's busy. Wait: Came on July 4th and had to wait about half an hour. Not bad. There were lots of tables open too, so I guess it's just the ordering that took awhile? Cleanliness: I like the huge sink in the back to wash your hands. And the moist wipes too. Mm.. I want their fries again :)

At first glance of the line, i wasnt sure if i wanted to wait. Sure you can take out with a short line and a 15-20 minute wait, however i wanted to sit down. about a little over an hour we ordered, found some seats and right away had service from the most bad ass server in the store. This guy was wity and funny. The wait was worth every moment! you gotta taste the food yourself, there are no words but go and wait for an awesome moment of rich service and food!

Came to San Diego for my Spring Break vacay. A friend of mine suggested this place and I was shocked to see over 3,000 yelp reviews! Therefore, I had to come to this place. There is a decent size parking lot. The place is pretty big and you walk in the front and there is a line. When I went the line wasn't too long (so thank god!) You look at the menu and you order first and then you pick up the food.. they give you a buzzer to let you know to pick up your food. There menu is not overly complicated, my bf and I got there full rib dinner ($19.95) with 2 small sides or 1 large sides. We got two small sides which were the cole slaw and macaroni salad. It looked mighty delicious. The ribs were slathered with bbq sauce. It is really really good! The meat falls of the ribs and the sauce is so addicting!~ I was really surprised that there sides were really good too!! I've tried other bbq places, it seems they only focus on the meats instead of there sides and they shouldn't do that. Phil's BBQ knows what's up! I totally recommend this place to everyone that is down in San Diego. It is a must have and must try place!~ I definitely will come back to try there other menu items.

I looove this place. I usually go with their sandwich choices and it fills me up plenty. ÊSplurge a bit with fries once in a while, but I gotta share that. Rather than mimic the other reviews on Phil's Epicness, here are some tips for avoiding the line: Call in your order Take Out or if you don't have that many with you, head for the bar area =) (I've been able to bypass the line twice already )

The 2 times I've been here so far have been with the same cousin (and we ordered the same thing both times lol). We ordered the baby back rib & chick-less dinner with cole slaw and potato salad. Even after sharing that meal, we were both full. I'm sorry to admit that I don't have a really great palate that is super critical, so I can't meticulously rate how the bbq is compared to places I've eaten in the South (e.g. places like The Shed). ÊWhat I can say is that it is GOOD! (my mouth knows when someone is tasty =P) There's obviously a reason why people wait hours in line just to eat here. The last time we came here it was incredibly busy and when my cousin went to get our food (they gave us chicken vs. chick-less ..so he had to wait for them to correct it), they gave us an order of [huge!] onion rings for having waited so long. My cousin's trick to this place.. eat at the bar side if you can. It moves A LOT faster than the other side (which I've actually never been in lol). Also, gotta love the hooks under the table for purses. =P

My husband' favorite place in San Diego! ÊI, being a vegetarian, also enjoyed going there, as their vegetarian burger is surprisingly good for being a BBQ place. ÊI also like their cole slaw, and always order a side of it along with the veg burger. ÊMy husband ordered the dinner portion first, and he thought it was a little bit too much. ÊThe following times, he ordered ticklers (usually the baby back ribs), and with a few sides, it was actually enough. ÊThe wait is loooooong always, but it was also part of fun. ÊIf you don't like waiting in line, go there and order by the phone, and line up at the pick-up line, which is much shorter than the dine-in line.

I went to Phil's w/ my friend JJ. When we went there it was around 1:15 and we didn't have to wait long to order our food.We ordered the pulled pork sandwich w/ onion rings which were really tasty.The coleslaw was really good b/c I find that most coleslaw is really gross. Ê I refuse to get on the band wagon and say that this is the greatest BBQ I've ever tasted in my entire life.With that being said I wouldn't turn down the chance to eat here again either. Truth to be told this establishment could NEVER compete w/ places in Tennessee.Kentucky,and places in the south who'd smile &say Ê"May the lord bless your delusional soul!".

Took my girlfriend, visiting from Seattle, to San Diego and we both decided to go hit up Phil's BBQ, since we've heard about them from numerous friends and family as well as seeing them on TV. Got there and the line was extremely long, and we were about 35-45 minutes away from the front of the line......was worth the wait though! The food was delicious, and made sure that I had some to bring back home too. Don't be intimidated by the long line, like they say "good things come to those that wait", in this case good BBQ!

Wow do I hate to rate this place low but I have to speak my peace. I'm native to San Diego and have tried some fair to good BBQ here. I like to think I give all places a fair shake when I try them. And when it came to Phils... maybe I just expected TOO much. I had never tried them while in Mission Hills and when I went looking for them some time ago to find they were gone I thought I had missed my chance to try the best BBQ meats in SD. Sometime ago I heard they were in Pt Loma and I have been looking forward to finally trying them. A recent Man vs Food episode visited Phils and I just had to go. After walking Kobeys most the day the smell of Phils made us somewhat hypnotized and we had to try it. Let me say that with the business this guy is doing he is obviously doing something right. Personally I think it is the sauce not the meats themselves. You WILL be waiting to enter Phils. But the nature of the people seemed cheerful in anticipation of the wonderful smell surrounding the area. No doubt they use wood fuel. Not wanting to wait we decided to order via phone and grabbed a menu from the bar that serves free lemon water and limited beverages including some alcohol to those waiting to enter the place. You can by pass the line if you order it to go. I do think that the atmosphere of Phils is worth the wait though. Its was truly upbeat. We ordered 2 sandwiches, the pulled pork shoulder and the tri tip as well as a large order of the fries and baked beans. The fries were good. nothing spectacular but good and there was SO many. A large is good for 4. I wasn't thrilled about the beans but my companion enjoyed them. Ok Now I love BBQ but if it the meat is dry... it's not good. and the pork sandwich was very dry. Oh there was lots of good sauce on it but the meat itself was very dry. My companion who is not as critical as I can be agreed that is was really dry and declined more than a bite. The Tri Tip was not as dry but dry none the less. Both meats had good flavor but honestly, if its dry it's ruined. I WILL try Phils again They can't be doing this good of business and getting such great reviews for nothing. Maybe we just got the end of a pan? I don't know but I was dissatisfied with the meal. Had I eaten there, I would have asked for replacements. Barnes BBQ, (real smoked meats,) in Lemon Grove and Ramon's, (moist meat with great sauce,) in Alpine are much better choices for BBQ in my opinion.

I'm new to SD and one thing my friends told me I have to do is go eat at Phil's. My expectations were pretty high and when I saw the ginormous line circling the perimeter I knew it had to be good. I came with a group of 14 people, and I was the only newbie here. No worries! The host was super nice to be and gave me tips like getting ranch with the onion rings. I got a full rack of Baby Back Ribs with macaroni salad and cole slaw along with a large onion ring stack to share with my friend. The cole slaw sound have been better, but the ribs were DELISH! They fell off the bones and full of flavor. One of the best that I've had. My other friends had the Beef Ribs, which were 10xs bigger than the Baby Backs. The beans were so good too. I stole some of my friends (: Anywoo, it was an amazing experience and would go back (but maybe a little later, since it was so heavy).

I'm not big bbq fan but after my experience with Phil's BBQ. I'm totally in love with bbq !! Went to Phil's bbq after a day trip to the SD zoo. After we got to the restaurant the line was super long maybe like a 2 and 1/2 hour to 3 hours wait time. So instead of wait for a table, my bf and I ordered take out, which it still took 50 min to get our food. We ordered a 3 pieces Êbeefy rib dinner, half rack of baby back ribs and a El toro sandwich. The meats were so good. They were tender, juicy and the meats just fell off from the bone. ÊAfter eating at Phil's BBQ, i think I just became a meat eater. I love this restaurant.the best bbq.

Much better than I remember from last time. Service was very exceptional- a lot of employees asking us if everything was good. The sign outside that says there is a 21 minute and 14 second wait, is pretty much a lie, it's really about a 45 minute wait. The wait to get the food is about 5 minutes. This time I tried the El Toro, tri-tip sandwich in addition to the baby back rib tickler. The ribs weren't burnt this time and the onion rings were hot from the fryer. Not the best that I've had, but really good for california standards. The tri-tip in the sandwich was very flavorful and cut extremely thin which was very pleasant.

Awesome place to come get bbq in SD I can only review the Baby Back Ribs as thats all I ever order,they are SO DELICIOUS that I cant bring my self to order anything else when I go Tender meat, smoked barky crust, Super Tangy BBQ the Fries are always crispy and real, reminiscent of In n Out Fries the Baked beans are a great side too, rich and flavorful ,not cheap and full of bbq like other places. Lines are huge, but believe me its always worth the wait, and while the price is defenitely up there, you gotta pay to play! Not to mention the service is BEYOND impeccable, the servers are incredibly dilligent and polite and help you have a great night. do yourself a favor if you havent already, go to Phils, you wont be dissapointed.

Wow no wonder this place got more than 2000 reviews. Phil's BBQ is the busiest restaurant I've ever been! And totally worth waiting in a loooooong line. Ê This was my first time so I went for the classic, the Award Winning Ribs. It was very well seasoned, so tender and extremely yummy!! Now I'm trying to remember how awesome it was and I'm so drooling... I had mac salad and cole slaw for the sides and both were pretty good. And their onion rings? It's a must! We ordered the bigger one and it came with about 13 huge pieces for only 6 buck. More than worth the money. Even thought I wasn't really a big fan of their super tangy BBQ sauce, I still give them 5 stars. I'll just have to ask them to serve the pork and sauce separately next time.

Well apart of my SD trip from la i had to go to this spot as everyone raved about it .. My friend and i waited probably an hour before getting to order and seated .. Damn spot is too famous that the line wraps around the building .. But that's all gravy as the wait was worth it. We ordered a full beef rib and a full baby back rib and cole slaw, fries, and mac salad sides. What were we thinking? Lol .. Goodness gracious the portions are very large, but delicious! Fall off the bone meat on the baby back ribs and the beef ribs were just full of flavor/fat/meat. Good sauce that they use to. Not too sweet, not too sour/tangy. I liked it :) This spot made me want to come back .. Better yet .. Try to find other BBQ spots to try and beat it .. So thanks phil's bbq! I'll definitely come back when i come back to SD.

Not sure it is it worth a LONG wait. I say if the wait is 15-30 minutes its ok. Anything over 30 is not worth it. Tip, go to the bar area to eat and NO WAIT if you can find a table or seats! Servers in this area. Onion rings YUMMY! BBQ was tender.

I bookmarked this place for a while now and I finally had some! THE WAIT IS AROUND 50 MINUTES!!!!!!!!!! we arrived at 1230. got in at 145. ordered. sat down. this tall black guy name KENNY was really wonderful. we weren't even waiting for that long (prob 10-15 mins.) he looked over the counter at us and came over asked what did we ordered, came out a bit later with our food! we didn't even have to wait for the buzzer to go off and go get our food. He was really friendly =) I just wanted to include him because he was not a server or anything. He didn't have to serve us our food, but he did anyway! What we ordered! - Beefy Ribs (5 pieces) with 2 sides ( Macaroni Salad & Fries ) + a side of fresh corn on a cob. $19.95 - Baby Back ribs (3 pieces) + 2 sides of cole slaw & fresh cut fries. $6.45 I prefer the beefy ribs over the baby back ribs! Just sayin'. I enjoyed this place and it was worth the wait! Will come back.

I did not get a chance to eat in the restaurant, but had the pleasure of having take-out. ÊMy family has always raved about this place and I was overly curious. ÊI let them do the ordering: ribs, pulled pork sandwich, onion rings, potato salad, and coleslaw. ÊYum, yum, yum! ÊThe ribs had fall-off-the-bone meat -- perhaps the best ribs I've ever eaten! ÊI enjoyed the onion rings greatly because the shell was crispy and thick -- nothing irks me more than an onion ring that falls apart because the onion to batter ratio is off. ÊPotato salad was also really delicious. ÊNext time, I will make a trip to the actual establishment. ÊThis place truly deserves the reputation of serving the best BBQ in SD!

No question, this is our favorite bbq in San Diego and anywhere. ÊEverything is melt-in-your-mouth good. Of course, I miss the atmosphere of the North Park location, but don't miss the long wait there (even after you'd ordered your food), and the food at the "new" (though not so new anymore) Midway location is just as good. We love it, the kids love it, enough said.

Be wary going on a Saturday night...we waited in line for 45 minutes. ÊWas it worth it? ÊOh yes. ÊThe servings are ENORMOUS and a great value. ÊI ordered the pulled pork sandwich - comes on a bun with slaw. ÊThe meat spills out of the sandwich onto the plate. ÊIt had to be several pounds of pork. ÊAll for $6.95. ÊA bargain! My husband ordered baby back ribs and a beef rib. ÊFinger licking good! We also ordered a large onion ring order. ÊShould have gone with the small. ÊHUGE! We loved everything we ordered. ÊIt is family style and loud. ÊBut worth it. ÊWe came here based on recommendations from many friends. ÊWe met up with a San Diego resident who'd never been and we all enjoyed it. ÊWe sat and visited after we ate and though the place was very busy, we were not asked to leave. ÊA big plus for any restaurant. Add Phil's to your list of must-eats in San Diego.

Stopped by to see what all the fuss was about. Saturday, 1:00 pm = late lunch. There is a huge line (probably 80-100 people) itching to get in. Admittedly, I entered the premises as a skeptic. I've eaten at some great restaurants and there are only a handful of which I'd wait more then 30 minutes to eat. So here it goes... Setting: Situated in a VERY SMALL shopping center. What does that mean and why am I placing emphasis on "very small?" Parking. If you can't park, you can't eat. There are not enough spaces to accommodate all potential eaters. People were sitting in cars waiting to park. A truck cut off a slew of cars and ended up doing what looked like a 25 point turn trying to park in a spot that was too small. With the long lines, sometimes extending into the parking lot, people had a difficult time backing out of their parking spot, perpetuating the problem. Once you find yourself in line, it's all about patience. There is a small bar near the door that can serve drinks (alcoholic and sodas) to help lessen the pain of waiting in line. Once inside, you notice one thing. IT's LOUD!!! There are a lot of people moving around (both employees and customers) which makes it very easy to spill or have an accident. People are all screaming to be heard over the next table. Televisions are on. Tables were situated a little too close together - every time someone would walk behind me, they'd bump my chair. I'm just lucky I didn't drop any food onto my clothes. Definitely a lively place. Individual grade: 3.5 stars. Waiters/Waitresses: The waitress that brought us to our table relatively quickly. This portion of the review is to primarily grade the waitress who tended to our table. There were others (lady directing customers to the cashier to order, cashier lady, lady calling out numbers, lady bringing food to table). All were efficient, which serves a place with a high customer turnover rate well. However, it limits the friendliness of the service that customers are generally accustomed to when eating at restaurants. The waitress at our table cleaned everything up very quickly and greeted us with somewhat of a half-effort smile. The table to our right had Alfredo. Two words: Shameless flirting. It was painful watching him giggle with his target. In the span of 30 minutes, he made 7 trips to that table. At times, another customer would ask for his help and he would just scream his response while refusing to budge from his position which allowed for maximal flirting exposure. Individual grade: 3 stars Food: Ordered the BBQ baby back ribs, complete rack with small side orders of macaroni salad, cole slaw, and onion rings. Individual grade: 4.5 stars RIbs: WOW!!! The meat literally falls off the bone! The sauce has a hint of honey and a kick. Simultaneously, that's like having an _____ (looks similar to the word "organism") in your mouth. The only drawback is that I wish we could have had more. The complete rack definitely came from one of the smaller animals selected for harvest. Try adding some of the hot sauce (on the table). Macaroni salad - Very tasty. The perfect complement to the texture and flavor of the ribs. The small pieces of pasta were all cut in half. The perfect mixture of mayonnaise and spices. Cole slaw - light and refreshing. Also complemented the ribs well. Simultaneously sweet and sour. Onion rings - HUGE! Still, some of the rings had a little too much breading on it. The onions were fresh. Each bite gave you the crunchiness of the fried breading with the moist juicy expulsion of juices from the actual onion. Served with ranch dressing. Drinks: Water. Sorry. Individual grade: Incomplete. Recommendation: EAT! At least once. I'm not sure I'd ever crave Phil's bbq. However, I wouldn't be averse to eating there if someone recommended it.

if heaven has a BBQ cafeteria...let it be phills bbq please! I've been told by couple of people that i need to stop by here while in SD...and the first time i stopped by, the line was long out the wazoo! ÊI didnt wanna wait and my stomach was already beating me for starving it. ÊWent back for lunch and it was still long but not as bad....and i was told NOT TO FEAR THE LINE...and correct they stand because the line went by pretty fast....not 20 minutes but good enough. So newsflash! ÊPhils BBQ isnt like a wait on service where someone takes your order, you order at a counter and you find a table yourself...you get your plates and drinks yourself but they do come around every so to ask how you're doing...just FYI So they have two type of ribs....beef and baby back (pork) and for those who love chicken like i do, they also have chicken too...but im here for ribs! BRING IT ON! ÊWe got the full rack baby back ribs, with fries and macroni salad and two beef ribs samplers.....and trust me...its enough!! ÊDid i mention sodas are unlimited...heaven! ÊBy recommendation from a friend, go with the small sides because they give you a lot!!! Êso much fries!! Get ready to get dirty!! I tried the beef first...and when they said sampler...they should really say a half rack,....it was big! Êit's so moist and juicy but the top is also very charred. ÊIt does have a lot of fat but it def helps with the moistness and juices! ÊI went on to the baby backs and i fell in love. ÊThe pork is smoked in its own meaty flavor and slaughter with the infamous bbq sauce....did i mentioned that we got extra on the side cause i sure love the bbq sauce and im so AHHHH happy that it was free on the side =D. ÊYou can taste the porkiness but its doesnt overwhelm when added with the bbq. ÊI even mixed the macroni salad with it and its heaven.! Please move to SF, phils bbq....PLEASE...i miss your baby backs!

Food is definitely not bad... But I do really think it's way overhyped and overrated. Let's say the only reason I would be back is if 1) I'm in the area and someone suggested and 2) If there is no line. ÊThere are a lot of better bbq places out there. So I guess I won't back anytime soon. Should you try it? Sure....maybe you will love it like the few thousand of people who does. :)

Juicy BBQ and fries The wait for this place was definitely worth the wait!! Best BBQ ribs and fries ever!!! I got the hype for this place, it was definitely a great experience. Got the pork and beef BBQ and chicken plus fries. The fries were hands down awesome!! I thought the pork BBQ was definitely juicy and melted in my mouth. The beef bbq felt a bit dry in my opinion and the chicken was not bad but some parts felt a bit dry. I thought the place was really cool and great to visit once a year. After awhile the place starts feeling overcrowded and loud. After dinner I felt like I had way too much bbq sauce and can't eat it for a long time. But at the time of eating it, it was like heaven on earth. I recommend everyone to come visit this place and see what the hype is all about. Great juicy experience and BBq

A few months ago, I discovered Phil's BBQ on MvF. I tried the 1/2 baby back rib dinner (3 stars), BBQ broham a.k.a pulled pork shoulder sandwich (3.5 stars) and a small order of colossal onion rings (3 stars). The food was good, but my ribs weren't as tender as I'd like them to be. Pork sandwich was half moist and half dry, but the sauce helped. Overall, the service was good, peeps were friendly and things moved along fairly quickly. HELPFUL TIPS - Note for everyone, the portions were ginormous. Bring your appetite. - One dish is sharable for two. - Arrive early to avoid the long waits. - Phil's has a "BBQueue Cam" that provides estimated wait times - Have one person save a table while the other person orders at the counter.

So I finally had my Phil's BBQ virginity taken after hearing people rave about it for a while. I had heard of the long two-hour waits in line for their ribs and whatever they offered there, but my friends and I got there around 9:30pm, so the line wasn't too long. After about 20 minutes in line, we finally got our food. I ended up ordering a half back dinner with fries and potato salad as sides, thinking that this was something I could finish. I ended up bringing home half of my ribs, a little potato salad, and most of my fries. It was so much!! The meat on the ribs were tender and felt right when I was eating them, I didn't have to fight with the meat at all. Fries were pedestrian. There were big chunks of potato in my potato salad, which is a big plus to me! And I felt there was a good ratio between potato and the cream stuff... Overall, I was satisfied. But I didn't realize that this place would be expensive (and before you guys put me on blast, this is my first time at such a place. I usually dine at the cheaper Asian restaurants, so I'm used to $6-$9 dishes) ÊThen again, I still have leftovers, so I guess it still works out!

3.5 Stars at best The food was good, but nothing was outstanding. We sampled the ribs, which were good, and the sides were fairly average. The onion rings were also good, but again nothing outstanding. Perhaps what put us off was the pricing...for two rib family specials shared among 4 people and one drink we paid $53. I feel as though Lucille's serves the same quality of food for a slightly lower price. Again, I'm glad I went but probably won't come down from OC to here anytime soon.

Lunch: Broham sandwich cole slaw on the side + ranch. Dinner: Baby baby baby back full rack with cole slaw and fries + ranch and BBQ sauce! Okay, my very first time at Phil's, I was really disappointed. I waited forever to eat baby back ribs overly drenched in BBQ sauce. The BBQ sauce was way too much for me. Couldn't handle it. Eventually I returned and ordered the same thing but this time, it was all different. I was man enough to eat without a bib. I really think that's what changed the taste. Trust me, eat without a bib and it'll taste 10x better. Since everyone already wrote about how great the food is here, I don't really have anything else to say about it. I'll just say I agree with everyone. Quick tip: If you don't like waiting (I don't like waiting), and you don't mind taking it home to eat, call in and make a phone order and go straight to the front of the line (left line). When I go here, if the line is around the first corner, I immediately call in and order while I find parking. This way, the wait is no more than 5-10 mins!

I haven't found any good southern BBQ places in CA. I finally found one here. There was a line wrapping around the building, but it was definitely worth it. There's a reason why Adam Richmond visited here on Man vs. Food. Food: 1) Baby back ribs - the meat just falls off the bone. The bbq sauce really helps out with the taste. 2) Sides - Macaroni salad, fries, and bbq baked beans are really good. They go well with the ribs. 3) BBQ Chicken - the chicken is soft and tender. Nothing special, just chicken and bbq sauce. 4) Tri-Tip - Very soft and breaks apart easily. DELICIOUS Be prepared to get dirty. I always use a lot of towels

After a day of surfing, there's nothing like a little BBQ in ma' belly. My feelings of this place is mixed... On one hand the portions were outstanding though I think they could have added a little bit more BBQ sauce. But none the less great BBQ. IDK if I was so exhausted from surfing but that 30min wait time felt like forever. I can't really complain cause I was alone so I got to bypass the HUGE line and go to the bar. Which I must add that there are no signs telling you that. A staff member came outside asking how many ppl in my party. I told her one, then she told me of the bar area. That was another thing you kinda have to wait for ppl to finish their meal 'till you get to sit at the bar. The odd thing was standing there staring at ppl eating, trying to see who was gonna finish first so that you could swoop right in and occupy their seat before the person behind you see's it first. I really think they should organize this process better. It's seems we're on our own to fight for our seat at the bar. Plus, there's only one waiter helping the whole bar area; which again seems like forever until you get asked what you want to order. I must admit that the staff were really friendly despite the constant busyness of the place.

We got to Phil's BBQ around 5:30 or 6pm so the line was already pretty long, but my housemates and I knew we'd be waiting for at least an hour anyways. It was torture seeing all the other people eating. The wait was still pretty long so we decided to grab some beer to kill time. They have this little concession stand for drinks. The guy working it, named Douglas I believe, was a good sport. The beer was made locally and it was good! I ended up ordering beef bbq ribs, 3 bones with small side orders of macaroni salad and potato salad. I was worried it wasn't enough food, but when my order came up and I saw the amount of meat on those 3 ribs, I stopped worrying. The sauce is so delicious. Very tangy and vinegar-y. I asked for extra sauce and dipped the meat in it even though it was covered in BBQ sauce already. The meat itself is so tender and just... ahh man, I want some more. I was so focused on the beef ribs that I nearly ignored the sides. My friend let me try some of his baked beans -- I'm not a big fan of beans but WOW those were yummy. I ended up not finishing my food so I got it to go. I brought back a little of San Diego with me to Norcal. I can't wait to go back, whenever I end up in the area again! Not only is their food amazing, but their customer service is the best as well. I love Phil's BBQ! When we left, the line was 2x as long. No lie. Get there early, know what you want when you get to the cashier, and keep an eye out for an empty table. This place is packed and for a good reason!

something useful: long lines but quick turnaround and heat lamps in the waiting area forget the chicken (breast really dry), get the full bbq back back ribs with cole slaw. Êthe ribs were smoked so much that there is kinda too much char on the skin (hence the 4/5 stars). ÊTaste wise it's absolutely the most tender, savory meat combined with the super tangy bbq sauce to make this a must try when in SD. Êanother reason why the ribs is better than the chicken is cuz the char on the ribs you can lightly wipe away while the char on the chicken is stuck on the skin, harder to wipe out. food this rich and good should be eaten once every month or two (too unhealthy, but too good).

Perhaps the place was WAY too hyped up for me. A bit disappointing, although, it was some serious BBQ business. The ambiance of the restaurant was loud and fun. A lot of excitement in the customers and the employees. Especially the guy greeting the customers in line with menus and samples. We were a big party and was seated at the very end corner of the restaurant so it was kind of nice to chat amongst ourselves and not have to yell across the long table. Food was good. Worth the wait? ehh... kind of half and half. Baby back ribs, beef ribs, chicken, fries, onion rings, cole slaw, chicken salad... we had it all. The famous BBQ was a little tooooo tangy for my taste but that is just my preference I prefer the spicer BBQ sauces. So, if you like sweet tangy BBQ, this is the place for you.

If you are staying in one of the nearby hotels and aren't with a group, skip the line and get to-go. Only takes about 5 minutes to get the food after ordering (with an hour-long line wrapped around the building), and the inside is so neat that you will probably still be looking around when your buzzer goes off. I tried the 4 baby back ribs and 1/4 chicken combo, the girlfriend ordered the chickless combo. Everything was incredibly delicious, and it was a very different kind of barbecue than I'm used to. I really appreciated it not tasting like any major BBQ chains or smokehouses I've been to. Don't miss out on the onion rings, they are quite a treat. I would be remiss if I didn't mention the whoopie pie as well. The girlfriend spotted it and HAD to get one. It basically looks like a giant oreo, but it's more like a cake. Very tasty. I must give one final mention to the staff. They were incredibly friendly, helpful, and welcoming. I will be visiting Phil's again, sooner rather than later, I hope.

The food was a flawless victory. It's delicious, it's messy, and the portions are generous. This place has some of the best bbq sauce I've ever had and serves up some great ribs and onion rings. The one thing that I disliked about it was the wait. You have to wait outside in line to get in and they don't take reservations. What the heck guys, you're the highest rated restaurant in SD and you don't take reservations? Am I not famous enough? It's not like I can get bottle service at a BBQ HOUSE or some shiznit to skip the line...

Perfect For: Birthday or Large Group dinner Ambience: 4 Taste: 5 Bang for Buck: 4 Service: 5 Wow Factor: 5 Fatty Meter: 4 Very lively atmosphere and it's almost always packed so try to avoid the peak dinner hours and try to get there early, especially if you have a large party. The BABY BACK RIBS... BBQ CHICKEN... PULLED PORK... ONION RINGS! End of story! Ribs are expensive everywhere, but you more than get your moneys worth if you order the full rack dinner.

The line you have to wait in to order food reminds me of the Space Mountain line at Disneyland. It is daunting. But it is well worth the wait if you're into the most tender, juicy bbq in California. Phil's is DEEEELICIOUS and, without a doubt, deserves five stars. I'll highlight some of my favorites about this bbq place: 1. They're quick. The line takes forever, but once you're in, you get your food in a heartbeat. Seating is well regulated so if you're in a small party, finding a table isn't that difficult, and if you're in a large party... they take care of the mess for you. 2. There's plenty of choices for everybody! I chose the baby back ribs. They were perfectly tangy and sweet. I chose cole slaw and corn as my sides, and they were the perfect companion to my soul food feast. 3. The service is great! (Maybe it was because I was in a big party, but I'd like to believe differently...) We got checked on loads, and they were super friendly. Everybody seemed to love their job. 4. The atmosphere is fun and light. I listed this last, because I find this to be the case at most bbq places, but still! Relaxed meals are the best. Go. You won't regret it.

Really? 5 stars? I cant agree with the reviews. I had the baby back ribs and 1/4 chicken dinner and 1 beef rib, my wife had the pulled pork sandwich, my daughter had the chick tickler and we ordered a small onion ring. Everything was so/so, definitely not 5 stars. For sides I had the beans and potato salad, took two bites from beans and 2-3 from tater salad, meh.The only thing we could think of was that there are no other BBQ places in San Diego, I mean Famous Daves is better than this place. Also, where is the brisket? and the only way you can get pulled pork is on a sandwich? I was hoping for a combo platter but figured with what we ordered we tried the "top" choices. My daughters chick ticklers were dry.Once is enough for me. Every night the line would be out the door at this place, cant understand it. We were in San Diego for a week and this was one of the bottom places we ate. Claim Jumpers was great, Mahi, country fried steak and chicken fingers all were excellent, including the sides. Even Souplantation, which is down the road from Phil's, was better than this place, in our opinion.

My husband loves this place and so do I. The fealing changed after it moved from hillcrest. The place used to be more quaint but now its a lean mean BBQ machine. The building is next to the sports arena and its usually easy to find parking. Then this place turns into Disneyland. You may have to wait up to 40 minutes in a line outside the resturaunt before you order. Is it worth it? Absolutely! The bar has a wide range of local beers. It is a very solid place to catch a beer. The BBQ is the best in SD. The sauce is smokey and yet still has great flavor. The ribs are super moist. The sides are great. I always go for coleslaw and fries. The fries are quintecential for soaking up the extra sauce. I love the tri-tip sandwich beacuse the meat in thinly sliced and juicy. The table has all the paper towels you would ever need.

What can I say.. When you are eating out here, you will be expecting to spend some money. Some people will think this place is overpriced and all. But to me, I think it depends what you are getting and you will also be getting your money worth. I usually get the best of half of baby back ribs and 1/4 chicken breast with fries and macaroni for my sides for 12.95. That meal alone is more then enough for me for tomorrow light breakfast. Compare to other restaurants when you order any type or ribs there, they give you such small portion. At Phil's, they give you the portion you deserve Êof what you pay for. Also I think their sauce tops it off with your meat also. This place is the place I would bring my friends when they come visit me or people that have not tried it. I agree with everyone that the line is such a *BEEP*, but if it is too long, I would just order out and take it home to eat it while watching a movie to make the night perfect.

OK...if you're in San Diego and haven't been here, do yourself a favor and go. ÊSure, the line may wrap around the building and you may wait for up to, and past, an hour, but suck it up, smell the BBQ smells from the building, and wait....it'll be worth it. ÊAside from O'Brien's, I miss this place more than any other place in San Diego. Ê As you're standing on your ass with your stomach growling, you get to see fixed menus on the ceiling as you wait in line. ÊSo by the time you reach the front of the line, you damn well better know what you want. ÊHere's what you'll want (I've had almost everything on their menu): Ribs/Chicken dinners: Their babyback ribs are my favorite. ÊThey are drizzled in Phil's excellent BBQ sauce and fall off the bone by just looking at it. ÊTheir beef ribs are a favorite of my old roommate and they are the best beef ribs I've had. ÊNormally, beef ribs are a little touch, but these fuckers are really tender. Ê Chicken: ÊExcellent, also in their excellent sauce, opposite of dry Sandwiches/Burgers: ÊTheir pulled pork and tri tip are the best sandwiches they have. ÊTheir burgers are OK, and if you order them it'll take longer to get it because let's face it: you go there to get BBQ - go get a burger at IN-N-Out or something. ÊThe pulled pork is smokey deliciousness and comes with a surprisingly good coleslaw. ÊThe tri tip is very tender but doesn't come with slaw. Sides: Get....their....damn...onion rings. ÊBest ever. ÊThey're FAT, like a real onion ring and have a great batter:onion ratio, as in it's got a lot of onion but enough batter to give it a great crunch. ÊTheir beans, potato salad, and macaroni salad are the best I've had - not too heavy either. ÊTheir fries are nicely fried. ÊMay not be the greatest, but they're definitely good. Oh and when you're done, you can wash your sauce-ridden hands in a freaking trough that is motion activated. ÊGENIUS. ÊStop reading and just go.

My husband and I just had our wedding rehearsal dinner on 8/26/11. Can I just say YUM, YUM, YUM!! All of our guests from accross the US and even Guam said it was the best ribs they ever had.

I don't understand the appeal of this place. The line is ginormous, you order at this mcdonalds looking register, you wait for your food while staring at all the people who are feasting on their selections, you finally find a seat after lingering around a table of customers, and.... Then the food arrives. We dig in, expecting an out of this world experience. I'm not denying that the ribs and meat aren't good, because it is! But I can make all of this at my BBQ parties, and for much cheaper and less stress. It's not worth all that!

We came about 8pm on a Friday and were shocked to see a line reminiscent of a new attraction at Disneyland. It took a good hour and a half to get to order but we came because all our Comicon friends said it was really good and was featured on the Food Network. The servers and the other employees were really nice and courteous but it's really self serve. Order at the front, find a seat, make a mess. The food is great. The ribs (both baby back and beef) and BBQ sauce are amazing. They're very tender and super meaty and deserving of the hype it gets. The only reason I didn't give a 5 star review is that the chicken breast wasn't very juicy and the chicken wing was blackened to the point it was inedible. If KFC can make every chicken breast tender and juicy then for this much more money they should do the same.

In the Kingdom of San Diego a legend has spread since the beginning of time. From the lowest squire to the noblest lord, talk of a magnificent place abounds. A promised land. A Mecca of Meat. This place is Phil's BBQ. A dragon amongst sheep. Talk of such greatness brought me here. I expected a dragon but found a tiny iguana instead. Guess the dragon was nothing but a legend, hyped up through the ages. Don't get me wrong, the food was good but not worthy of the school-girl level crushes this place seems to attract amongst San Dieguns (San Diegites, San Diegonians?). The meat on the ribs was definitely tender and the bbq sauce not disgusting, I can't say that it will forever reside on my palette as a god amongst sauces. The coleslaw was interesting (in a good way) and had very prominent horseradish undertones. The sides all seem to be stuffed with celery (which I hate) so those were almost certainly ruined for me. The fries were overcooked and dry. Come early, like I did, or you'll face the dreadful lines one hears so much about, the only thing about Phil's that ISN'T over-hyped. Parking was ample.

The ribs here are definitely one of a kind, they must be smoked for extended periods of time because smoke is intense in every bite, in a good way. Chicken can be hard to do at times but it was decent here. All the sides were fairly mediocre... the french fries, onion rings, coleslaw, baked beans. I am a fan but I am not sure if its worth the lunch rush.. its a great place if you don't have to wait long.

UMM.. AZING!!!! SERIOUSLY! WOW! I'm so happy to finally have visited this place after all the wide-eyed shocked stares I got from my SD friends from not having been. ÊNow I will do the same when I meet someone who has not yet tried this place. I wasn't even hungry when I came but I shared a Tickler with a friend. TICKLER?! I thought it'd be small.. it had 3 (actually ours had 4) BBQ ribs smothered in sauce, huge golden-fried onion rings, loads of cool cole slaw, and to top it off (or rather underneath) lots of crispy french fries (w/ potato skins)~ What a happy meal it was. Somehow we fit 12 people in a cozy table in the corner, and as I looked (longingly) at everyone's food.. I was so amazed at how much food we got, for such a decent price. I will forever feel guilty for buying anything the same price for lesser quality. But, that's hard to beat. I'll hopefully be back. Phil's fills f'reals! :]

I imagined how hard it would be to review this world-renowned place without being redundant and I'm already struggling. What else could I say about their succulent and tender ribs? Their quick and friendly service? How about their enormous portions for a cheap price? But most of all, I really like the atmosphere here. There's something very unique about it that taking Êdate, or coming with a group of friends both seem so perfect. It probably is the food. I just wished no one else shared this positive opinion I have so that I wouldn't have to wait in line for so long every time I come here. Remember that if you don't like something about their food, feel very free to ask them - they will make it again for you with a smile.

Definitely good food. ÊIt would be splitting hairs to say that this may not be 'true BBQ' because BBQ is a regional phenomenon and it varies depending where you are. Most true BBQ is cooked low and slow with plenty of smoke. Some places hit you hard with sauce and some places don't. Phil's food is very light on the smoke and heavy on the of sauce. ÊIf you are a true BBQ fan from the Midwest or the south, your experience of BBQ may be very different. I like their food. Is it 'true BBQ'? Maybe not, but that doesn't mean it's bad. I can like Panda Express even though it's not 'true Chinese' and I can like Chipotle even though it's not 'true Mexican'. It is what it is and Phil's has good food no matter what you call it. Just temper your expectations. If you want true southern BBQ, don't expect it here.

Call me crazy but I wasn't super impressed - maybe this is because we got take-out? ÊOr maybe because I've been spoiled my whole life with a family of awesome barbecuists (is that a real word?). Surprisingly, I hadn't heard about Phil's until recently (and I grew up in San Diego). ÊEveryone swears by this place, so I was pretty excited to try it. ÊGot the BBQ ribs and there was nothing wrong with them but nothing really memorable either. ÊThe meat was tender enough so it wasn't chewy or anything... but not fall off the bone, melt in your mouth awesomeness. ÊAlso, I wasn't a huge fan of the sauce. ÊNot my personal taste, and sauce makes a big difference with me when it comes to ribs. Overall, I'd eat here again if I were in the neighborhood or someone were picking it up for me. ÊBut I wouldn't go out of my way or wait in line to eat here again.

Everything I wanted to say, everyone's already been there, done that! Sharing a dinner with someone isn't a bad idea, the portions are sizable. My brother and I always share the beefy rib and white meat chicken dinner, with an add-on of a large side to accommodate our appetites. Works out just perfect! The onion rings are HUGE, nice and crispy. The steamed veggies are really fresh, and the ribs are, as said by everyone, fall-off-the-bone. It seems like the large beefy ribs have a lot more fat on them, but I could be wrong. The sauce is just excellent--I can't even put into words. It's definitely a tangier version, less sweet. The vinegary taste is very present. But wow, I dip everything in that stuff. TIPS: Parking is not the best. You just have to get lucky. Lines are usually 1 1/2 hrs at peak times, or more, so either call in or have someone wait for you. Also, it's a really great place to bring out-of-towners. I brought my little cousin, a high school senior, who said it was the best place he'd eaten at on his road trip up and down California =) Hi Mono!! *waves* This place was already bangin' even BEFORE Man v. Food, so don't give them all the credit =) Succulence. Period. One of those places that makes you thank God you're a fat kid =) Also, the service was really awesome. Our busboy was super attentive, helpful, and very polite. Got us napkins when he saw we were running out--I like service that anticipates. It rids us of having to bother him for it later. He was tipped nicely =)

My first rib experience and a very, very pleasant one. While Phil's is apparently notorious for its line, we were serenaded by a karaoke singer extolling the details of the reasonably-priced Phil's menu as we waited. Inside, the vibe was warm and chummy, with fast and friendly service. Order ribs. Seriously. The chicken is flavorful but the ribs are where it's at. (If you get a full rack, be sure to ask for the sauce on the side unless you want a BBQ sauce overload.) Oh, and definitely wear the plastic bib, complete with catcher. It's part of the experience. (Okay, okay, so the only people in the restaurant wearing bibs were me and my friend. No shame.)

OVERRATED - ribs are only ok CONS: - Impossible wait times (20mins+ just to PAY for take-out, 1.5hr for table) - Impossible lines - Ribs are VERY SOUR (the sauce) - NO PARKING EVER (cars circle and circle) - Bad elements and cops hover Try Mo's BBQ Ribs from San Luis Obispo and Pismo Beach. Or order the sauce from their website yourself. It KILLS Phil's. If Mo's was in San Diego, Phil's would be out of business. Mo's is softer, moister, sweeter and yummier (with 4 DIFFERENT rib sauces to choose from).

For years now, I have been a regular and finally got around to writing a review. ÊThis BBQ joint is special! ÊTheir baby back ribs are delicious! ÊSoft, tender, smoky, and tangy bbq are just falling off the bone delicious! ÊMy favorite sides are their BBQ baked beans, huge crunchy but oily onion rings! Their fries are so delicious! ÊTheir potato salad is also very tasty. ÊWhen I'm trying to go on the healthier side, I order their large mixed veggies. ÊTheir veggies has broccoli, zucchini *green and yellow, cauliflower, and I believe carrots too! Steamed to perfection! ÊIt's now raw but it's soft but still has the vibrant colors and slight crunch to them. ÊI have also tried their tri tip sandwich. ÊIt's delicious but I always go back to my favorite baby back ribs. ÊTheir chicken is always dry and almost dry. ÊSomehow, I'm not a big fan of their chicken. ÊI've had better. Ê The Staff are amazing! ÊThey are fun and on point. ÊPerfect spot to have a small or large group. ÊJust the downside is the long line. ÊBut definitely worth waiting for. Ê Their BBQ is available for purchase by bottles but somehow, it doesn't have the smokiness flavor when we actually order inside. ÊJust let them do the grilling! Ê What tops the icing on the cake, this place has a bar and have lots of tv's if you are interesting in satisfying your craving or hunger, you can also watch sports! ÊFUN and very inviting place.

I'll wait! Even if it means waiting through the rain! It's worth it! I had the baby back rib tickler, which came with 3 ribs, a side of cole slaw, fries, and two onion rings. Ohmygoodness! Fall-off-the-bone heaven! I love the smokey-ness of the meat and how they don't drench the rib with the sauce. You can still taste the flavor of the meat. It was amazing. The cole slaw, fries and onion rings were delish! Everything was amazing! I came in a group of 6, so they actually set up a table for us and our waiter kept coming back to refill ice waters, hand out bibs, give us extra ranch/bbq/etc. sauces. Overall, super friendly service and amazing food!

Was not impressed at all! I kept hearing all about Phil's BBQ and how packed it is and it's the place to eat BBQ. 1) They messed up my order and had to restand in line to fix it. 2) The BBQ sauce was gross, very sweet and not tasty. A little like the BBQ packs at Arby's. 3)After wiping the sauce off and added salt, it still was just ok. I really wanted to like it and have a good BBQ place to go. I do have to say the Coleslaw was very very good and I enjoyed the onion rings. I will not be back!

I love barbeque. ÊAnd when I finally went to Phil's to see what the hype was about, I'm sad to say it didn't live up to it. Ê Parking isn't the best, especially because it gets super crowded. ÊThe line has almost always been out the door of the few times I've been there, so it really didn't help the experience.

I originally was going to give the place just four stars but upon other consideration, I guess I will have to be one of the 1000 reviewers to give the place 5 stars. I know that most people will talk about the baby back ribs but I am actually a big fan of Beef Ribs since I am not much of a pork eater. ÊYep, I know they can be very messy to eat but I don't care. 5 stars and more should be given based on their Êribs and sauce alone. ÊHowever, there are other factors that you really have to consider. ÊSo, here are the factors that you have to consider before going to Phils. PATIENCE IS VIRTUE - Just like Brandy C., my family and I were one of the ones that braved the cold slightly foggy long a$$ line at Phil's last night. ÊThe wait was long but not boring since all of the people kept reassuring us that the ribs were worth waiting for so we decided to stick around. ÊHowever, in the back of my head, I kept on thinking these RIBS better be the sh!T$$. One suggestion, they shuld have someone serving coffee or tea outside specially on a cold night like last night. SHARING IS CARING - We knew that doing full orders for everyone would be crazy so we decided to share. ÊA full order of anything will probably feed a whole village somewhere else so share your food with the peeps you're with. ÊI shared my meal (A full order of the Beefy Ribs with two sides) with an extra corn on the cob. THE MEAT, THE MEAT,THE MEAT - Like I said, I loves me some beef ribs. Let me tell you, the reward of even just using a fork to just separate the meat from the bone of those ribs got me all excited already. ÊIf you've had beef ribs before, it's usually not like baby back ribs where it just comes off the bone most of the time. ÊHowever, Phil's BBQ hit the jackpot on how they cook the meat. ÊAs soon as I picked one up, the meat started falling off the bone already. THE SAUCE - ÊAs soon as you bite into the meat, you can taste the meaty flavor, but the sauce totally compliments the meat. ÊIt's a little sweet, a hint of vineger, lots of smoky flavor and definitely not overpowering. SERVICE - Phi's staff are awesome. ÊKnowing that the line is long, they have someone come up to you and give you the menu an hour in advance. ÊNOT sure if this is a good thing because it only got me hungrier. ÊThey also have a sign that was slightly inaccurate when you reach a certain point letting you know that you are close to getting seated. SIDES - They have all kinds of sides but I opted for the potato salad and steamed vegetables with an extra corn on the cob. ÊOne thing I have to suggest is they are missing some bisquits or bread to go with the meat. ÊI also am looking for some GARLIC ROASTED MASHED POTATOES. ÊAnother suggestion that I think should go really well with the sides you already have. THE RINGS - We decided to just get one COLOSSAL order of the onion ring. ÊEAT IT RIGHT AWAY because it was really good when it was fresh but it tasted a little doughy towards the end. Oh, another suggestion just popped! ÊNO DESSERTS. ÊThis place could use some but I do understand that most people might not have room for it. ÊTHAT IS WHY YOU GIVE THEM DOGGY BAGS. Ê Oh, one last thing, we did not realize that there are full size adult bibs available by the sink right by the soda fountain right next to the washing area so I will give Phil's one last suggestion (yeap, I know its kind of a run-on but that's how long it too for us to realize that the bigs were available.) ÊPut the bibs right up front so that the rest of us messy eaters can put the bib on before the meat from the bone falls right into my shirt! Alright, I've said more than my fair share of comment so I will just let you review th rest of the more than 1000 reviews about this place.

There's not much left to say after 2278 reviews...but here i go anyways :P Shared the full dinner, perfect amount of food for 2 ppl! I gotta admit the meat is really delicious here, so tender and falls off the bones like it should. The BBQ sauce on the other hand is just ok, I've had better...Now oddly here is what I love the most: the mac salad. SOO GOOD! I even got a large to go because I loved it so much. A large side is only $2.25! The onion rings are good too. Get them if you have some people to share it with. The staff here is nice and they get an extra point for giving us free onion rings. They initially took them back but gave them to us anyways thanks to vinh h :) I'd love to come here again but I don't think I will put up with a 1hr wait...or maybe i'll just buy the macaroni salad to go :P

BELIEVE IT! THIS PLACE LIVES UP TO ALL THE HYPE AND MORE!!! I first heard about this place watching "Man Vs. Food" and then after a couple of my friends talking about how much they love it here, I finally decided to go try it. When I first got here, it was REALLY MIND BLOWING to see how BIG the line is to get inside this place! It's like standing in a Disneyland line, it wraps around the building, but I decided to try it anyway. After an HOUR wait, inching towards the door, I finally get to the front to order a TRI TIP SANDWICH. My first bite into the sandwich and my first thought was "OMG!! I HAVE TO GO BUY ANOTHER ONE" because it is literally THAT good! I just began to eat the sandwich in front of me and I was already thinking about getting another one! It's really crazy how mind blowingly GOOD this meat was! My friend got the RACK OF RIBS and I got to try one and that was DELICIOUS too!! I ended up getting ANOTHER TRI ÊTIP SANDWICH and PULLED PORK SANDWICH. Both were amazing! I was really baffled on how I could describe what this BBQ tasted like and the only thing I came up with was: "ORGASM IN MY MOUTH!!" Yes, I said it!! I know it doesn't sound right, but believe me people, you have not tasted meat until you've tried Phil's BBQ!! If eating an excessive amount of BBQ meat is going to clog up my arteries and give me a heart attack, so be it. This meat is worth it and I guess I"ve had a good run now that I know how good meat can taste. Will I come back? FOR SURE! And I'm totally gonna bring all my friends and family too!!!

This place is pretty hyped up. ÊTheir food is delicious but fairly average in terms of taste. ÊNothing special about the taste, but the ribs and meat are very tender. ÊPrices were fairly consistent with other rib/meaty restaurants. ÊThe mac and cheese wasn't as good as I would have hoped, but still a nice addition to the meal. ÊIt gets messy so first dates- NO BUENO. Expect long lines unless you're early! ÊYou can end up waiting up to 50 minutes... I would say it's not worth it to wait that long.

All the anticipation made my hungry belly growl even louder seeing that I work less than 2 blocks away and the smell of Phil's BBQ somehow always lingers in through my doors. ÊWhen we arrived one busy Saturday afternoon, he almost turned around after seeing the enormous line. it took some pleading and some definite persuasion to get him to stand in the line. 30 minutes later we were placing our order...Had the El Toro and Beefy ribs plate and an oatmeal whoopie pie. What can you really say that hasn't been said yet? Is it good BBQ? Yep, especially the beefy ribs...OMG. Would I wait in the line that is always no less than 25 minutes? Probably not.... I've smartened up and decided anytime I need a Phil's fix, I'll call in and pick it up. Grab a whoopie pie on the way out---I suggest the oatmeal. It's legit. BFF/SD 4

I usually go with the chicken and ribs combo and the girl gets a pulled pork sandwich. It really is as good as everyone says it is. If there is a long line do not freak out, they do an excellent job of getting people in and out (and no you won't feel rushed). Another way to order is to call it in and then take a short drive to the beach and enjoy the scenery while you have a foodgasm. After writing this I now have to drive over there immediately and stuff my face.

I wanted to go see what all the hype about Phil's was so I went, and Im sooo glad that I ordered over the phone in advance. ÊThe place was PACKED with a line wrapped all around the building. ÊClearly many people love it and it is a local hot spot. As for the food, I loved it for what it was. ÊGood old fashioned BBQ. ÊThe only thing that was missing were a little greens and some corn bread on the menu, but I didnt mind. Ê The ribs were great and you have so much fun just eating them with your hands. ÊHowever, since it is a bit on the heavier side I personally wouldnt go too often. ÊBut if youre looking for some BBQ just order take out so you avoid the lines and you still get some yummy grub :)

This place is bomb diggity!!! I ordered the beef ribs and man they were really big (that's what she said). I got three ribs with coleslaw and mac salad as my side. I had also ordered for my friends and I a side of Onion rings I believe that they are beer batter onion rings. To sum everything up since everyone had said what I was going to say. This place is a must.

Dare I say....overrated???? We went here because friends raved about it. ÊHmm... Lucilles is WAY BETTER!! We ordered their ribs/chicken dinner with 2 sides. ÊI'll admit, the ribs and chicken were tender and good. ÊI thought the bbq sauce was a little bit too sweet/tangy. ÊPowerful. ÊFries were good and so were the baked beans. The pulled pork sandwich was horrible. =( ÊThe bread was too hard and the pork was TOUGH! ÊI almost choked on it. ÊThe coleslaw was decent. ÊI do admit that they don't skimp on the pork. The pork was piled on! ÊBut it was so big and messy that there was no way you could eat it as a "burger". Ê I'm glad we tried it but I don't think it was great enough for us to go back. ÊSorry SD, you need a Lucilles!!

4+ star rating w/ over 2600+ reviews?! ÊKind of impressive, and unbelievable at the same time. ÊMade me skeptical, but with that many positive reviews, how could it be bad? Ê We had no choice but to pay a visit with these stats, unfortunately after eating the food, I thought Phil's was just OK. We first showed up on Saturday at 2pm, the line was so long, that we decided to leave and come back another time. ÊThere was no way the little BB would wait around for an hour or more quietly... Tried again on Sunday at 11:30am, we had much better luck this time. ÊThere was still a line, but it was only a 20 minute wait. ÊDefinitely doable. Good: ÊThis place is super efficient at serving a large number of hungry customers - you wait in a line, when it's your turn, you order and pay, they give you a buzzer, you serve yourself drinks, pick any open table, then when your buzzer buzzes, you pick up your food at the counter, and grub! ÊPortions are large, and prices are very reasonable. Not so good: I don't know for sure, but from the look and taste of the ribs, I doubt they are 100% slow smoked. ÊTell tale signs - no smoke ring, not much smoke flavor, meat very shrunken off the bone. ÊI would guess that they make smoke the meat for a short period, then finish it off by baking it in the oven. ÊFurthermore, the sauce is TOO sweet, salty and sour. ÊIt has the taste of chinese sweet and sour sauce, which is not really my preference. I ordered the beef rib dinner (3 beef ribs, coleslaw, potato salad), the total price for this meal was $13.95 (not including tax and tip). Ê The meat was tender, but I couldn't finish my meal, because it was just way too salty. ÊMaybe it would have been better if you ordered them dry with sauce on the side...? In any case, it was pretty good, but I probably wouldn't wait 20 minutes in line or suffer the hour long drive just to eat there again in the future.

OOkay okay i know this place is for the carnivores && its meat eating heaven but ... i went with the veggier burger. Only one word can describe it; AMAZING. Best veggie burger i have ever had in my life. So if you're a vegetarian that gets dragged along to this place the veggie burger is no joke. instead of lame old boring onions this place hooks you up with the meanest most biggest onion ring ever! the burger is just adgjaklgjajrffklgn goood. && so you dont feel left out as your friends lick their fingers and devour their food the veggie burger comes with a splash of bbq sauce. Along with my veggie burger I got a side dish of potato salad and mmm FABULOUS substitute for Êfries. sososo sooooo good. The potato chunks are thick so its not like the norm but it was still pree' good. This place is almost like a fast food type of restaurant, it OWNS.

Phil's BBQ - A San Diego institution of succulent sauce, tender meat, top-notch service and long lines is one of best-run mass meat markets in the city. ÊLet's break it down: Food. ÊVegetarians need no apply. ÊCome for the beef and/or pork. ÊIt's good. ÊIt's darn good BBQ. Service. ÊThe management here is excellent. ÊOne one occasion while dining with a co-worker his order mysteriously disappeared and mine was served. ÊWhen it was observed that I wasn't eating, an employee first asked if everything was fine; it was, I was just waiting for him. ÊThe employee then noticed the missing order, reviewed the receipt and returned with the food immediately. ÊAnd this was on his own volition; we didn't NEED to ask. ÊThat defines excellent service. Wait. ÊYou'll wait in line at Phil's, but it moves fast and is worth the time. Decor. ÊThe large stainless steel tables are move efficient than pleasant. ÊSame thing with the paper towel rolls -- you'll be glad they are there to use more so than you will enjoy looking at them. Personal recommendation; get the tickler's. ÊThey'll completely fill you up and are some of the cheapest items on the menu.

I'm a big big big fan of Phil's BBQ. ÊThis place is amazing and my family and I make sure to come here every time we vacation in San Diego. I don't think there's a single dish I've had here that didn't disappoint. Pork ribs are a must... the chicken is always juicy and flavorful... even the sides are awesome... we always enjoy the onion strings, bbq baked beans.. .heck, even the steamed veggies are great. The portions are HUGE and you can't beat the price. The only "complaint" I have .. and it's pretty darn minor... is the fact that they don't offer a type of bread.... be it corn bread, or rolls or biscuits. I know that this probably isn't that big of deal for most... .but I enjoy a little carbs with my meat. Also, be prepared to wait... the line gets crazy on the weekends. So go early.

I've had ribs in Nashville and thought nothing could compare with a true southern style ribs. Phil's BBQ was comparable. Baby back ribs so tender that it falls off the bone and your don't even have to chew it. Smothered in a smokey, tangy sauce and just make you salivate more. Delicious, fantastic, orgasmic. You already know its a great place because there was a line forming as soon as it opened. Omit the fries, but do get the onion rings...its the best I've ever had. A must try when you're down in the San Diego area.

Giant succulent beef ribs? Crispy delicious onion rings? Good portions for a good price? Phil's is your place. While long lines are characteristic of this humble abode, it moves quickly and is well worth it for a taste of the meaty goodness. I'm not one usually for meat unless it's nicely grilled or battered so Phil's is definitely my kind of place. Always with efficient, friendly service and food that will leave you quite satisfied, this is the place to go to satisfy those bbq cravings. Usually I'm not a big fan of onion rings, but this place has ones that you can't resist. With a thick crisy batter on the outside and soft sweet onions on the inside, I could munch on them forever were it not for the amazing beef ribs that are the main course. Beef ribs so big, meaty, and fatty that three or four will satisfy even those with big appetites. Deliciously flavored barbeque sauce tops it all off for one great meal. Be sure to come early though if you don't want to wait in line for an hour or two.

We waited 90 minutes on a Friday night for dinner... The Phil's Cam that we checked out online beforehand wasn't much help, and the wait time indicated by the sign around the corner was not accurate... Don't get me wrong - I don't dislike Phil's BBQ - BUT the hype does not meet the wait. The meal prices were reasonable, and I liked the sides more than the meal itself, i.e. cole slaw and macaroni salad.

Best BBQ in ALL of San Diego hands down!!!!!!! This place is just downright amazing. I went with some of my friends for a late lunch, early dinner type meal around 3:00 on a Saturday because we were afraid if we would have gone around 5 or later there would have been a MASSIVE line, and you know what even at 3 PM there was a huge line so that right there tells you that this place has to be good and the wait was well worth it. As soon as we got in through the doors the line continued haha. I was immediately taken by the aroma of barbeque and great food. You better come hungry too and expect to have tons of food to go because the portions are huge and for incredible prices too. When you get seated at your table, they have a paper towel roll in the middle cause the food gets very messy. The overall atmosphere was awesome. Now getting to the food. So we all decided to order our own thing so we could share our food with each other. I ordered the EL Toro which was the tri-tip sandwich and loved it but I think my personal favorite was The Broham which was the pulled pork sandwich. It was so tender and juicy. I also loved the onion rings or colossal rings as they call them because they are huge and the french fries were very tasty as well. Surprisingly though the BBQ sauce was a little spicy which was actually new to me but it was good nonetheless. Overall this place is downright amazing and I can say that I will definitely be back soon. I also think I deserve a little pat on the back for finishing my meal and more especially being a mere 5'5" 122 pound dude. It was tough but I managed and pulled through. Thank God it was so delicious, that sure helped a lot haha. EDIT: No matter how many times you go here, this place never disappoints. After my third time here, I didn't want to leave. The difference between this time and the first two times is that even after eating all of my food on my massive bowl, I was still hungry lol. My friends both got full before me and weren't able to finish their food, so I finished it for them and still wanted more haha. I can never get enough of those amazing onion rings of theirs. They are the flat out best I have ever had.

So we waited an hour and a half to get in, but that's what I get for getting there at 6:00pm on a Saturday night. ÊBut, as most can attest to, its worth the wait.

4.5 stars Had to come here on my Mymy vs. Food tour in San Diego! The wait wasn't too bad because we came before the dinner rush and the food came out pretty quickly. Had the baby back ribs which were super tasty and melted off the bone. That bbq sauce is a freakin winner! Had the large side of a baked potato with everything aka melted cheese and sour cream. Wish I got the potato salad because it was hella good, but stole a few bites from a friend. Wish they had mac and cheese on the menu; that woulda hit the spot! Phil's BBQ has got their formula down and they are doing everything right. Definitely worth stopping by and waiting for it! Oh and in the battle between Mymy and food at Phil's BBQ, Mymy won.

I've never really been a big fan of BBQ, but Phil's could definitely convert me into a believer! The people here are super friendly and the food is just guilty pleasures galore. I've been here a few times and I usually like to order from the Best of Both part of the menu when I can't decide what I want. I'd suggest this for first-timers because you can get both ribs and chicken (with sides) for under $12.. That is seriously a steal for the amount of food you're getting! I've never been able to finish a plate here before. I usually get full after eating like 1/3 of my meal, to the point where it looks like I haven't even touched my plate. Phil's is definitely a must-try when you're in San Diego, whether or not you like BBQ!

I was on vacation visiting my girlfriend for her graduation from UCSD, I was told by many to give this place a try. After doing my research on http://yelp.com it did not take much convincing for me to head over. The first thing that you see upon driving up is the long line that wraps around the building. The line was ridiculously long, but the people did not seem to mind waiting for 2+ hours. I myself eagerly walked up and took my place in line. The smell of the smoky bbq wafted its way into the parking lot. I swear I was salivating profusely. Eventually I made my way in and ordered. I got the pork ribs and cole slaw and fries. It did not take long for me to polish off everything...boy was it tasty! I am so sad that I don't get to enjoy this on a weekly basis.

LOVED that we didn't have to wait in a 2 hour line (sorry can't tell you the secret to that). Pros: RIbs were tender and the juicy meat fell off the bone. Ê Fresh cut fries were addicting. Eric, our server was nice. Cons: I wouldn't order another Sangria there. The 2 hour wait looked horrible. I'd be a grumpy hungry bear by the time I got to the front. I don't know how I feel about the self-serve everything. ÊIt seems convenient and effective for the size and traffic they get, but it just means more people walking around and possibly bumping into trays of bbqed food and drinks. ÊJust sitting down at our booth, a server dropped a Êtray of dirty plates and a rib landed on a friend's seat. Overall, I would come back, but only if I didn't have to wait more than 30 mins OR if I came with a bunch of friends willing to wait and be entertainment for 2 hours.

Best BBQ I've had this side of Texas. ÊI had the Baby Back Ribs, BBQ Chicken, baked beans, and french fries. The ribs were nice and juicy with a wonderful smoke flavor. ÊThe chicken was excellent too. ÊThere was a delicious BBQ sauce poured over all of it. ÊI detected a hint of spice in the sauce but nothing a person who doesn't like spice could handle.

TIP: I ordered over the phone thinking I would save time but they said that they will not put in your order until you show up and pay....they said they want it to be as fresh as possible. ÊSo, if you don't want to wait in the long line to sit and eat, then just show up and order to go. ÊPhoning it in will not save any time.

Chickless Dinner with macaroni salad and fries. BOOM. You're welcome. Just thinking about it makes me hungry and my mouth water. Their sauce is the best part. So unique and different from any other BBQ sauce I've had and sooo good. I buy it from costco to cook at home when I can't make it to Phils.

ÊCan't quite figure out what the "regional" flavor is closest too, but it is just simply great, no matter what your preference is.

ÊDon't know if I would wait in the line on a weekend -- probably opt to phone in an order, and then jump into the much shorter "take out" line instead. ÊLine moves at a good pace for "sit down" dining, but it is a very popular spot, so the line can be dauntingly long on the weekend. Any visit to San Diego will now include a stop in at Phil's. ÊWe stopped on way down, and then had to stop again, for a repeat, on the way back.

No matter what time of day it is, Phil's stays busy from open to close. Get there just before they open to avoid a line that'll easily stretch around the restaurant. I ordered the "best of both worlds" chicken and beef ribs plate w/ an extra order of half rack of baby back ribs on the side. The chicken wasn't so great but the beef and baby back ribs more than made up for it. The beef ribs were practically the size of my arm, and I'm not even exaggerating. The sauce is awesome but I do suggest getting it on the side instead because it can get a little too tangy after a half rack of baby back ribs. With great service, a super clean restaurant, and flat screens everywhere, how can I not give this 5 stars?

I got to Phil's around 7. The line was wrapping around the building but luckily we had some friends that had been waiting a while and saving us a spot in line. If we started at the back it would've been 2+ hours. (Note: If you plan to eat in-house, I suggest logging onto their website and checking out the webcam of their line. It is a great tool- use it!) The line is the reason I give it four stars. I've chose to eat elsewhere on many ooccasions because I just didn't want to wait forever. When you do finally get in you go up to a cashier, order, and wait for your food. Much like a fast food resturaunt. ÊA hostess type person will point you in the direction of a seat and then you go to town. Now for the good part... The food! I ordered a half chicken/ hakf ribs dinner. Some of the best BBQ ribs out there. They are amazing. Cooked to the point where the meat just falls off the bone. ÊNot over or undercooked; just right. Then they cover it in their special BBQ sauce which has such a great flavor! The chicken wasn't anything special. A bit underwhelming after the ribs. The bbq sauce is the only redeeming quality. If not for that it would just be plain old chicken. I got the french fries and baked beans for my sides. ÊThe fries were the same thing you could get at any old resturaunt, nothing particularly special, and the beans were okay. ÊThey have this seasoning at the table that I think is meant for your fries but I added it to the beans which actually made them really good. My suggestions: -Go for the ribs or a pulled-pork sandwhich. -Order take out. You can eat in the parking lot or at home. You're really not missing anything by not eatting in-house and the line is a million times faster -If you do want to eat here, try to avoid weekends and any time after 7 or you'll be in for a nice long line.

Need I say more. This by far is the best BBQ in San Diego! Whatever you order here is on point and If you're looking to grub come with an empty stomach! I love their El Toro sandwich which is boneless pulled pork with their amazing BBQ sauce. I add tobasco sauce to it to spice it up! Can't really taste their bread but its perfect because the BBQ drowns it out. They have a bar you can sit at or you can fall in the long lines for a good 45-1hr and sit down. ÊThey also have pick up which is great. Their ribs are to die for, their macaroni salad is the best in SD and I love their greasy fries and onion rings. ÊTheir Veggies on the side are also great and I love going there and chowing down with a beer! Very busy staff but very courteous. Can't wait til it reopens, went there when they were renovating and they were closed, so dissapointed that me and my family drove ALL the way to San Marcos and ate at the new one. It'll get 5 stars eventually. Them being closed and not knowing about it just hurt my feelings there for a bit. LOL

When I went to school in SD, Phil's was my favorite place to eat. Ê Everything on the menu is delicious... everything. ÊI would recommend the best of both for first timers, so you can have a taste of the ribs and chicken. ÊMy personal favorite was everything on the menu. Ribs, chicken, sandwiches, burgers, onion rings, slaw, beans, potato salad, mac salad, etc. I'd also like to say I'm not a fan of onion rings, but i'll have Phil's onion rings any day of the week. Only downside to this place is the long line because everyone in SD wants to eat some dank bbq.

Oh, the long line phenomenom. You know a place is good when there's a busy crowd abrewing. And Phil's is no exception. We came here the same night as the Glee concert. At least the almost 2hr wait had an entertaining crowd. It was nice to see some of the staff outside, which made the wait even more fun. The food here was really good. I ordered the babyback rib tickler which comes with 3 ribs, coleslaw, 2 onion rings, and a MOUNTAIN load of fries. Way more than a tickle, I will say. Afterwards, I felt like I was attacked by the tickle monster and put into submission. My minus one star is because of the sauce. Although it was pretty yummy, it tasted really familar. It reminded me of the jerk sauce at Layalah's patties. Weird. I think that confused my tastebuds, seeing as I was eating American BBQ. I will defintely be back to try out the rest of the menu items. However, I'll probably opt for the order out option. No more waiting eons that delicious food.

Out of the 700+ photos from this restaurant, not nearly enough pictures of the lines. It wraps outside around the restaurant like a Disneyland ride, even the way the line moves is similar. Slow but moving. I waited over an hour just to make the order, but the food was ready within 20 mins...Dont come here on a Saturday at 6pm-9pm (rush hour). Honestly, it was really good bbq. Êbut i rarely crave food that needed to wait 1.5 hrs for the food to arrive. ÊWhich is the reason why i still havent tried Pinks yet.

I don't know how to put this but Phil's BBQ is kind of a big deal. Knights Of Columbus!!! The El Toro sliced tri-tip beef sandwich is Phenoficent! (That's Êphenomenal and magnificent combined). The real star of the show is the sauce though. it has a sweet, tangy, spice to it that is truly amazing. Ive been to Memphis, Texas and Kansas so Ive had some pretty awesome bbq and this one is up there with the very best. I'm definitely taking a trip to pleasure town again.

Contrary to some of my other reviews, this is gonna be short and sweet, because there are just not words in the English language about how good the food is here. Ribs.

For someone who doesn't enjoy bbq 90% of the time, ESPECIALLY bbq sauce, the fact that I'm saying that the food and bbq sauce here are AMAZING and that I would wait in line again for those sauce-covered ribs MEANS IT IS EXTRA, EXTRA AMAZING. Their onion rings are also incredible and definitely bigger&better than your average onion rings. I know everyone says this but it really must be said: be prepared for an incredibly long line. I waited for 1.5hrs, but as long as you're with the right company and have the right attitude, who the heck cares, right? Just treat it like an extremely long line for a Disneyland ride.. except BETTER (was that sacrilegious?)!!!!!! So if you're a huge BBQ fan, GO. If you're not the biggest BBQ fan, STILL GO.

All the hype? It's all true! Seriously love this place. Definitely get the beef ribs, it's life changing. Not in a born again kinda way, but pretty close. :D Baby back is good too, but I definitely prefer the beef. Staff is also super friendly and helpful. One anecdote: Was here on a random night and I guess there was problem with a customer in the bar section who was asked to leave because he was saying some inappropriate stuff. In a fit, he walks over to the main dining area throws a wad of cash into the air and yells, "Here's your f*!@% money!" and walks out. The food is so good here and the staff so nice and professional everyone in the restaurant gave him a dirty look and went back to the same happy vibe as before. Yuuuuummmyy!

I LOVE THIS PLACE. Obviously, I am a huge BBQ fan. Love it. I have been to this place twice and always leave with sauce all over my face and I am too full and happy to care about wiping it up. I am not toooooo in love with the sides they offer. Although the beans are pretty good. Forget the sides and just go for the meat. The line is always wrapped around the building. It's probably the amazing intoxicating smell of BBQ that fills the square mile around Phil's. Sometimes the line is just too daunting for an instant gratification girl like Sweaty. So, I call ahead, bypass the line and pick my food right up. I can't say enough good things about this place just like everyone else. BOTTOM LINE: Worth the wait. Do it.

Can you say BBQ.......Uum Humm Simply Outstanding. No reservations, but if you don't like to wait in line which you will do, I suggest calling ahead and taking it to go. I BBQ, grill, smoke slow cook. ÊThere is a lot of time and work that goes into this style of cooking. ÊYou have to have a passion for it, because it is a labor of love. Ê I have never had BBQ outside of California. So I can't speak about how other states like Jeff l. has, but I have eaten at other BBQ establishments in California, and IMO Phil's has them beat hands down. Onions Rings---hot Crisp sweet Fries-----------not oily, hot fresh Beef ribs-----Makes me a carnivore Pork ribs-----meat following of the bone MESSY MESSY MESSY, need a shower after eating here, but like Carl said, If it doesn't get all over the place it'as not worth puttin in your face.

Had never wrote a review before because of its thousands of raving reviews already, but I feel compelled to write, even a short one for it due to it literally making up a large portion of my college memories. Once this location opened, I have been a frequent patron of Phil's and it has never disappointed me. ÊMy favorite order are Baby back ribs with fries and mac salad. ÊThe ribs are always tender and the sauce is unmatched. ÊThe fries are also delicious and the mac salad is the best I've ever had anywhere. ÊFurthermore, the servers and staff are nice and helpful even when it's a busy night. The only gripe is how popular this place is now, but I still make it a requirement every time I visit san diego to hit up this place for old times sake. I've found BBQ places in Los Angeles that have great tri tips, or great ribs but bleh sides. ÊBut I haven't yet found a place with the complete package with savory ribs, excellent sides, family fun atmosphere, and friendly staff that Phil's consistently delivers on.

Best BBQ I've had east of the Mississippi, Phil's is legit. ÊWent with a group and was able to try a few things - Baby Back Ribs - 5/5 - melt off the bone tender and not in a "overcooked next day" kind of way. ÊSuper moist and tender in a "they know how to bbq a rib" way. ÊThey pre-cut the ribs so you don't have to rip them apart with your hands, just pick up a rib and take a bite. ÊThey use a tangy Memphis-style sauce that works. El Toro Tri Tip Sandwich - 5/5 - soft bread, GREAT tri tip. ÊIt's not like a brisket where the meat is in chunks, it's sliced super thin almost like deli cut ham, and tossed in bbq sauce so the meat is coated. ÊI could eat one of these with a side of onion rings every day. Onion Rings - 5/5 - the best onion rings i've ever had. ÊThey're HUGE and come battered and super crispy. ÊThey come with a ranch dip but I like them in old fashioned Heinz ketchup. ÊThese onion rings would be great with anything made out of meat. Coleslaw - 5/5 compared to other coleslaws, 4/5 as a side because I'm not a big fan of coleslaw in general. ÊI grew up on KFC coleslaw which as you know is super sweet and crunchy. ÊOther coleslaws to me are not as crisp and taste like cabbage coated in mayonnaise and black pepper. ÊPhil's coleslaw has the KFC crunch, and a slight sweetness to it that was familiar to me. Macaroni Salad - 3/5 - a little too mayonnaisey for my tastes. ÊLooking back on the meal the macaroni salad didn't stand out as anything memorable or special. Corn On The Cob - N/A - a full whole ear of corn. ÊDidn't bother taking a bite because that would take up stomach space for ribs. If you live in LA this place is arguably worth the drive along. ÊNote that I went on a weekday at 11:15pm and the line was already out the door to the parking lot so get there early. ÊLine goes pretty fast but remember you also have to wait for the food so it could be almost an hour from the time you get there to the time you start eating.

If you only had one meal to eat in San Diego, you definitely have to go to Phil's BBQ. Why?? Because the Baby Back Ribs are simply OUTSTANDING. C'mon, the meat just cleanly falls off the bone. Sooo good!! But besides its tenderness, the secret to its success lies in the flavor of the meat. Specifically, the flavor comes from the dry rub on the meat before grilling, and also the sweet, spicy, and tangy barbeque sauce that is added at the end of grilling resulting in PURE AWESOMENESS. For those of you who don't feel like eating baby back ribs, another favorite of mine is the pulled pork sandwich. The sides are good too but they're just there to help you fill up. Without a doubt, it's all about the Baby Back Ribs at Phil's BBQ! The line can get ridiculous but it's totally worth the wait. Phone orders for take out are also a great option. Plan your visit wisely.

I think the reviews before me have it pretty well covered, by the way, the number of which, should be a good indication. Once you get through the line, which isn't as bad as it looks, it's all good times ahead. You can get in even quicker if there's only a few of you, and you don't mind a seat at the bar. I've been here a bunch of times, and had just about everything once. You can't go wrong with anything, but sometimes it's best to keep it simple. Perfect meal: Half rack of ribs and a few pints of your favorite Stone brew.

Substantially adequate. I'm a little mixed on this place. ÊI happened to have a friend visiting from out of town and decided to stop in here to see what all the fuss was about as I am a new San Diego resident myself and haven't been yet. ÊWe tried to go for dinner one night but the line was tooo long and I'm not waiting two hours, so we decides before hitting the beach tomorrow to come for lunch. I would suggest doing the latter as we were secod in line at 10:30 and after that the infamous line at Phils began. ÊNow I'm going to say you don't come to a BBQ joint foe the ambience or service you go for the food!!!! I ordered the pork rib platter with fries, and onion rings ad everyone said it was great. ÊThe ribs were not fall off the none tender as everyone here says so. ÊThey were okay but lacked the seasoning I was hoping for. ÊThe fries were okay and the onion rings extra greasy, now I'm all for greasy onion rings but these were a little much.

WORTH THE WAIT! I drove down to San Diego for over an hour and waited in line for another hour just to eat at this place. The line was literally out the door and around the corner. Parking was difficult to find and the place was packed. But this place does not disappoint. Thankfully the line does move quite fast because stand in line to order their food and then wait to pick it up. It may be one of the best BBQ place I have been to so far and I am very satisfied overall. The portions are just right and very delicious. I ordered the Beef ribs and chicken platter and it was bomb. I also sampled the baby back ribs and they are awesome. I would definitely suggest getting some baby back ribs ÊBut honestly I dont think you can go wrong with ordering anything off the menu at this place. Everything is just so tasty and juicy. This place is literally finger licking good. Asides from the wait I would see myself coming back to this place over and over again if it was closer to my location. If your in San Diego please do your stomach a huge favor and check this place out & dont let the line scare you. There is always a line, in fact there is a dedicated camera for it on its main website so you can monitor it. It moves fast and is worth it. AWESOME BBQ!!

We were lucky in the fact that when we hit Phils, it was a slow day in the middle of the week. No lines, no waiting. I don't get why people would wait over an hour for this joint though. I had the ribless dinner and a couple sides. It wasn't bad, but the meat was a bit dry. The sauce a little sweet. Seasoning was good though. The sides were what you would expect. Onion rings were cooked perfectly and my corn on the cob was crisp and sweet. No complaints on the sides. The staff was great as well. From the front counter to the people who clear the tables, everyone was smiling and seemed like they were having a good time. Again, that might be due to the fact that it wasn't busy and it was the clam before the storm. If you're in the mood for some BBQ, go check em' out. But I would avoid the lines during the weekend. Phils isn't bad, but not worth an enormous wait.

Phil's BBQ is one of those places you have to try before you die if you're in the Southern California area. I've been to Phil's BBQ a couple of times and it was amazing, just like what many of the reviews have said before me. Today I want to emphasize the amazing service. It's 9pm and my friends and I are in Long Beach. We're bored, a couple of my buddies just finished their finals and want to do something out of the ordinary, and so we decide to bust the a mission to Phils. Normally, a trip to Phils is 2 hours. We leave at 9:30 and Phils closes at 11 on a Saturday. Against the rain and all other odds, we make it RIGHT at 11. The place is practically getting ready to close and we're like, "Damnit, we're too late." We decide to test if it was really closed for sure, so we sat at the bar and the first guy that comes up goes, "Sorry, our kitchen closes at 11." Right as we're about to leave, the majority of the employees were like "Oh, no, we'll still cook something up." We got our food in 10 minutes. They brought out the plates to us. It was amazing. Of course my friends and I did an inspection for hairs, spit, dirt, toothpicks, tic-tacs, doritos and so on. Nope. This was my friend's first Phils experience and I don't need to tell you how much they enjoyed it. So thank you, Phil's BBQ, for being so hospitable even though you guys definitely wanted to close up. I know other restaurants would be pretty angry for people coming in RIGHT before closing. The people had Phils knew we were hungry, they knew we busted a late night mission from Long Beach, and still wanted to show that Phil's hospitality. Here's to hoping that Phil's BBQ lasts forever.

Phil's is about the best barbeque in San Diego, or at least that I have had. The chicken is done to perfection, mesquite grilled and well sauced in a tangy sauce. The beef ribs are huge and meaty, I Êcouldn't finish a full order of five in one sitting if I wanted to. The baby backs are the same, great pork, slow cooked, tender and tangy. The tri tip only comes in sandwiches as does the pulled pork, both are great and filling as are all the portions at Phil's. Don't wear clothes you don't want to get bbq sauce all over, the only way to enjoy Phil's is to dive right in! The downside of Phil's is it can be hard to get in. The line moves quick usually, but be prepared for a line that snakes around the building, but that is the price you pay for a place being the best.

I'd have to say, when you first experience BBQ, Phil's knows how to do it. Ê Although you wait maybe FOREVER to get inside, the wait is definitely worth it in my opinion. Ê(Not a place to go if you want food right away, or to sit down right away) Phil's offers your generic bbq of the south I would have to say. Their ribs are amazing. ÊI prefer the beefy ribs because I love to taste that bone. The chicken is a little dry most of the time, but I can get through it by drenching it in sauce. Ê The fries are pretty good too; however, the onion rings, a bit too much batter for me. Ê I can't handle having that much batter because it makes me a little sick to my stomach. The pulled pork sandwich is awesome too. ÊThey give you so much meat, it's more like you have bread with your pork. Ê I normally wouldn't wait for something like this; however, I usually can wait if I know I'm going to Phil's. Ê Parking lot sucks because it shares with others and is very small. Ê The servers and waiters are really nice and caring (Except for that one cashier...). ÊThey are always willing to get you sauce, fill your cup with water and make sure everything is in place. ÊI would have to say there is this one guy, if you don't pay attention to what he says, you'll sit there thinking for a bit, because he says "how you all doing?" and if you don't respond, he'll say, "thanks for asking." It is a great atmosphere, definitely a place to hang with friends if you really want to go watch the game or what not, although they can't change any of the channels, so if you do want to go watch the game, go to the bar.

Phil is getting Review #2000 from me :D!!! Sigh, yup, I became another fallen, stuffed victim of this infamous SD food landmark. ÊWhat took me so long to finally eat here is that I'm absolutely NOT a fan of BBQ, particularly its sauce, EXCEPT on chicken. Guess what, after roughly 30 min. in line & approximately 5 minutes post-order-by-counter, my dinner consisted of the $6.45 Chick Tickler, while my BFF got the $6.45 Baby Back Tickler. 1st I'll mention the included sides. ÊThe coleslaw was crisp & so held together, i.e., you're not eating such icky, runny cabbage w/ watery mayo (which is, ewww, really yucky to me..). ÊThe fries had the similar texture (by bite, not appearance) as In-N-Out's version: not that crunchy & not mushy. ÊFinally, the onion rings may be too rich for me, but the crunch sound was harmonic to my ears. Now on w/ my pickiness on BBQ & chicken. ÊAt 1st the portions of my chicken seemed smaller, but my BFF advised that it'll fill me up. ÊTrue ^_^. ÊBut what I was disappointed with was the poultry's dryness. ÊTo make up for that, I requested the helpful & attentive server for more BBQ sauce, which now brought up this... I had (HAD) no heart for BBQ sauce, okay? ÊWell, Phil's BBQ changed my attitude towards it. ÊI was quite afraid & cautious that it'll be more sweet than tangy--which is why I dislike BBQ sauce in general. ÊNot this one; the sauce on my chicken was exceptionally tangy & I didn't notice any sweetness. ÊWhat's even better news, somewhat, was that I sampled my BFF's off-the-bone, moist baby back rib, & that made me LOVE baby back ribs--well, only Phil's version. ÊAnd I mentioned "somewhat" b/c it means that I'll have to painstakingly be patient to go back to hometown SD some other time & head to Phil's BBQ & face the viciously inevitable long line. Despite giving 2.5 stars exclusively on the chicken, the rest of my delicious & affordable meal; the exquisitely organized, welcoming & attentive staff; and the overall value easily condemned that setback to 4.5 stars. ÊPhil, thanks for giving me an appreciative outlook on BBQ sauce, & I'm definitely looking forward to order your Baby Back Ribs when I'm down in SD!!

Lines.. there is always a line but what 's great about Phil's is that they have a webcam online so you can see how busy it is.

I lived in Nashville for four years, and by no means did any of the BBQ joints hold a candle to Phil's. Phil's is the holy grail of BBQ Ribs . There are a few things I look for in a good rib: Sauce, Tenderness and Size. It's safe to say that Phil's has mastered all of my requirements. I had no idea what to expect, so I ordered 3 of the beef ribs, and a quarter rack of the pork. The ribs are absolutely colossal, I'm convinced they resurrected woolly mammoths, slathered some sweet tangy BBQ sauce on, and fired up the grill. Three of the beef ribs is more than enough to fill you up. The baby back ribs were sweeter and smaller... but both ribs were out of this world. The sides were all great but the ribs and bbq sauce were clearly this restaurants golden goose. I honestly can't imagine a better tasting rib... if your in San Diego, go, and call your gastro doc for a stomach pump following the meal. Go figure, San Diego has the best BBQ i've had... well I guess I should make a trip to Memphis before I can say it's the best in the country. I laughed at the sheer sight of the gigantic beef ribs, it's honestly comedic.

I'm on this mission to review all the BBQ restaurants I've been to, and Phil's has got to be the best one! My brother took me here when I visited him in San Diego while he was in law school. ÊThere's always a LONG line out the door and for a good reason. Ê Ribs are so tender. ÊIt's actually better without additional BBQ sauce in my opinion. ÊI didn't like my ribs smothered with sauce. ÊAsk for it on the side. ÊRoasted chicken was good too. Ê Definitely will elevate your cholesterol after eating here, so spend a day at Seaworld or San Diego Zoo to burn off some calories then head over here to fuel up!

I can't even handle this place, it's so good. Ha! I've only been here 2 times. (I need to go more!) It's ridiculously mouthwatering and delicious. So much barbeque-y goodness! It's super messy, but I honestly don't even care. The pork ribs are the best, I think. Fall off the bone wonderful. I love love LOVE it here! Be prepared to wait in line, though. I bet you'll devour every last bite! Yuuummm.

The best BBQ I've EVER had in my entire life. ÊJuicy and moist and straight off the bone. ÊThe best flavor. ÊBetter than any BBQ I've had here in Dallas, TX (where they're known for their BBQ). ÊDon't be surprised if you see a line out the door. ÊIt has gotten so popular that the last time I went I stood outside the restaurant for almost a half hour before I seated myself. I've heard that they've also built and opened one in San Marcos, CA. ÊOf course, I've been following them on Facebook (since they're one of my favorite restaurants). ÊI've been begging them to come to Dallas, TX but don't know if they will. ÊI know that they'll be successful wherever they go with that special sauce of theirs. Definitely worth the wait if you haven't been. ÊJust make sure not to wear anything nice or anything white. ÊEnjoy because you'll be back again. ÊI guarantee it!

OMG! I've never had BBQ like this at a restaurant. After a family trip to Seaworld, we were all starving. My boyfriend, and cousin watched the show Man vs. Food & was raving about how great the food was at Phil's BBQ. My cousin warned us about the wait. He told us it can be up to a 2 hour wait. Thank goodness for our iphones! As we parked, I noticed the line was incredibly long covering 2 sides of the building. As I got in back of the line, I was about to ask my family if they really wanted to wait in this line, but the wonderful aroma from inside filled the air as a very pleased group exited the side door. ÊI could hear them all exclaiming how great their meal was. The aroma & everyone's content countenance gave me the patience to wait. There's a camera when you get to the halfway point in line & you can watch yourself live on their website if you have internet access. As you get closer, they have the huge menu posted up high because you have to be ready to order when you get to the front of the line because of the high volume. After they take your order in the front of the line, they seat you & you pick up your order when they call you. You basically order & serve yourself. Get your own drinks & everything. All the people you encounter seemed really friendly. ÊIt seems pretty kickback. As I was picking up the food, I noticed a bar, so I grabbed a corona. Nice and cold. I went w/ a big family so we decided to order everything & share so we could all try everything. As I took the first bite of the ribs, I thought it was gonna melt in my mouth! Wow!! The flavor was absolutely wonderful! The pork & beef ribs were so tender! Oh my! The BBQ chicken was amazing! Everything was amazing!! All the sides! The corn, the coleslaw, the potatoes! Everything!! Good Lord! I think I died & went to heaven. I just wanted to relish that moment! When I go back to San Diego, I'm def going there again. The food was definitely worth the 2hour wait. Love it!

Phil's BBQ is the place you want to go for BBQ in the San Diego Area. ÊThey are not messing around when they provide you with portions or quality overall. ÊI remember them being a small joint on the other side of town that always had smoke billowing out the front, yet had a line around the block. ÊNow that they are becoming a multi-location BBQ place, they haven't sacrificed quality for a money trade out. Ê I typically go for the TIckler plate and my meat choice will change from time to time depending on my mood. ÊThe Tickler offers you the meat as well as two sides, and you are more than full when you are done. ÊThe rib plates are also generously portioned and leave you a fair amount to take home for dinner and lunch the next day. Ê I recommend, if you don't want to wait, go to the bar and snag a seat and a beer. ÊThey will call you when your food is ready and it's better than waiting in the long line around the building.

Food is ok to me, but everyone I ever go with loves the joint. I just hate waiting in line for two hours! I actually won't wait that long, so if the line is too long we'll go somewhere else. I know you can always do takeout, but that doesn't always fit the bill for the night. ÊThey need a second location for sure. Otherwise it's a pretty well run restaurant. We take all our out of town friends here, unless the lines are too long. After further consideration, I'm editing my review from three stars to four because I didn't know about the second location up in San Marcos. Although that just means they need to open a 3rd location ASAP because this one's line is too darn long! It's a good place to go though, fun for the experience of eating at Phil's if nothing else.

What is there to say that hasn't been said? Having been there once and stood in the ridiculously long line (which seems to ALWAYS be there regardless of time or day of the week) and also having been there once to pick up an order, I can definitely say that picking it up is the way to go if you have someplace close by to eat it. Heck even if you don't you can chill on the grass outside and save yourself at least an hour if not more (their 'the wait is __ minutes if you're at this spot in line' sign is very inaccurate and desperately needs an update.) They do have a bar section that may take less time to be seated in, but I'm not sure as I've never tried (and it always looks full anyway!) The ribs are quite delicious, but I really enjoy their 'Chick Ticklers'. These are bite sized pieces of grilled white meat chicken smothered in their famous BBQ sauce. Plus the tickler meals automatically come with 2 of their HUGE beer-battered onion rings (yum), slaw, and fries. It's a pretty good deal for $6.75! You can also get it as a baby back rib option (but you only get 3 ribs, just a heads up!) Overall they seem to have a great reputation for a reason. If you're visiting, on vacation, or if you live here and have never been then give it a go. But unless you really love standing in lines that rival amusement park rides I'd strongly suggest calling it in!

BEFFY RIBS!!! They are the bomb! I love them from there! My Pops made me beef ribs all the time since I was a baby and I was super bummed I was never able to take him here but I always have fond memories of papa when I go here. Ê The only gripe I have is that they wouldn't seat us until everyone in our party came. ÊWe literally were sitting at the front of the line waiting for two people. ÊThe kids were super hungry too. Eh they were quite happy when we sat down. Ê I of course ordered the beefy ribs dinner to enjoy with the boy. ÊWhich we did. ÊThe meat was of course falling off the bone. ÊThey are such large portions I always get a meal and split it between the three of us. ÊI always get a small order of onion rings too they are awesome from here. ÊCrispy and light berry berry good! Ask for extra ranch and barbecue if you like :)

Others have said it and its True. HANDS DOWN THE BEST. I order the ribs on every visit and they are amazing. I love this place! It is my favorite BBQ ever. writing this review is making me want to go and eat there right now. I will always come back to phils and i go about once every 2 weeks. Im very happy they opened one in san marcos which is closer to my house. A word to those looking to maximize your spending, if you get a meal with 2 sides and you order fries- they give you a ridiculous amount of fries. GO TO MEAL: babyback ribs and chicken- macaroni salad and baked beans. This is the spot i would recommend anyone to try when they come to San Diego.

I heard about Phil's on the Travel channel show, Man vs. Food. ÊWas in town and decided to check out the Point Loma location for dinner. Ê The line was insane to get in the door! ÊI mean it was a 1.5 hour wait at dinnertime. ÊBottom line, do not go to Phil's if you're in a hurry or real hungry. ÊSomeone below said to call in your take out order to beat the line, not a bad idea but then you miss out on the ambience of the place. ÊSomeone also said that Phil doesn't actually BBQ the meat but cooks it on a grill/stove. ÊThat's disappointing to hear but after tasting the food I have to say that I don't really mind much. ÊPhil's BBQ sauce is the stuff of legends. ÊStarts out sweet and tasty and slowly heats up. ÊPerfect! I had the beef tri-tip sandwich with a small side of fries. ÊThe sandwich was huge and delicious, price $6. ÊThe fries were also delish but it was the biggest 'small' side I've ever seen, covering a whole plate for $1.50. Ê Service was awesome once I got a seat. ÊIt's really loud in there when it's crowded but after a couple draft beers I didn't care. Ê I plan on going back and buying one of their t-shirts when I get the chance.

Can't believe I've never reviewed Phil's before. It is the best BBQ I've ever had. Ever. Go, don't look back. I can eat an entire rack of ribs on my own. That is saying a lot! If it wasn't so good, I would knock it down for the struggles to find seating (it is all open) and the long wait. But it is too good to do that. If waiting really bothers you, order take out.

Me and my friends, party of 6 i think only waited for 20 minutes at 5 ish but right when we were leaving at 7 the line wrapped around the corner !

Why do people wait here? Why did we wait here? WHY WHY WHY? Do you not realize that the to-go order counter and the eat-in counter is the SAME DAMN COUNTER? Do you not realize that the huge long depressing line you see circling the strip mall plaza floors is the line to eat-in, ONLY? Do you not realize that they give you the same food in both to-go and eat-in, only in different receptacles? Sure I'm not a big fan of Styrofoam as much as the next I came here thinking that YAY I'm going to wait in line to eat amazing BBQ. Okay, fine I kind of threw a fit in the middle of waiting (I'm SO HUNGREEEEEE AGGGHH). Yeah, I kind of complained, a lot. But you know what! It was raining! And cold! And stuff. So when we finally got inside and to the counter, I was like holy shit all that could have been avoided. My companion and I spend the entire dinner marveling at the waste of our 1.5 hour wait. Do yourself a favor, order to go. Seriously. Unless you like waiting in lines or something, then go to Disneyland where you can't take the experience back in a paper sack (unless your companion vomits on Space Mountain, another review). The BBQ? Pretty good. Onion rings could use some work.

It's hard to choose a favorite between beefy and baby back ribs. They're both wonderful! I'm don't like cole slaw, but the cole slaw at Phil's is probably the only thing I'll eat. The cabbage is so crunchy and fresh and very light. Their onion rings are also very good. While we were waiting line for over an hour, they were giving out onion ring samples. First bite, I was in love. Fresh out of the deep fryer, which made it nice and crispy. The taste reminded me Funyun onion ring chips and knew I had to order them. Wait times are a killer. Bring something to entertain yourself.

I don't think there is enough good things I can say about this place...it's as good as it gets in terms of BBQ in SD. The Broham sandwich is my favorite, the meat is tender and smothered in sauce, while the bun is thick and absorbs all the goodness of the juicy BBQ. Every time I visit Phil's I must order the onion rings...I find myself craving these darn things all the time! You can't go wrong when you choose Phil's for lunch or dinner. The staff that works here is great and they're very helpful, you can tell that they truly love working there which says a lot about a restaurant. One word of advice, prepare to wait if you decide to go during busy hours such as 6 or 7. I always try to go at non peak times which works great because I am able to walk right in and sit down. Overall I'm obsessed with the food at Phil's. Side note: Phil's BBQ online offers a webcam that allows you to check the status of the line so that you can anticipate your wait period...pretty awesome!

Phil's probably doesn't need another review and I doubt many will choose my review to read but I'm a loyal yelper so here I go. The evening started out with a crazy long line but I'd been warned so this was no big deal. I'm not a complainer and the company of the bestie made it 100% bearable. We waited about 40-50 minutes in line. An employee offered us water all the while and then came the onion rings...yum. Free sample. Toward the front of the line you can also order beer to enjoy while waiting and there are also menus up top to gawk at and get your order ready. So we finally get to the front (pre ordering to go is probably the best idea if you don't feel like waiting.) We were extra fatties an ordered a full rib plate with fries, a BBQ chicken thing and a full order of onion ring. The ribs were just as promised, the meat fell right off the bone and deliciously flavored. I wasn't too fond of the chicken, I can just make it at home! And lastly, the onion rings...the big a$$ onion rings. Soo good! What was even better was the ranch, it's so creamy. It tastes like sour cream ranch. It's milky with a hint of ranch flavor. They have silly bibs to wear when you're eating and you can refill your soda at the soda station (they have cherry pepsi!). The portions were good, we took a lot home. When I reheated the onion rings they didn't taste very good so eat them while they're still hot. The fries tasted like in and outs fries which I love and at the table they have cajun spice that you can add to your fries and also rolls of napkins to keep wiping the BBQ away. There was someone walking around ready to clean your table when you needed it. In conclusion...good ribs, yummy ranch and onion rings, and long line. They have yelp posters posted all over and seem to be concerned with giving the customer good service which is appreciated. Hit them up, even if it's just a one time thing, phils has turned into a SD must go to place.

Came here after recommendations with friends. I don't eat ribs often so can't really compare but the food is pretty delicious here. I got the baby back ribs, the sauce flavors is very strong which makes it salty. But the meat is cooked well. The place is pretty packed, even on weekdays.

This is by far the best BBQ I have ever eaten. I usually go for the baby back ribs with corn on the cob, but their fries are good too. Their onion rings are huge and to die for, and are a must with every visit. The only negative thing about Phil's BBQ is that it's so popular that you usually have to wait around 45 minutes outside the restaurant before you're let inside to order. But the food is ready by the time you sit down, so total wait before getting the food isn't that bad.

Phils BBQ draws in it's masses by piping the BBQ love out across Point Loma... Usually pretty crowded at midday, but worth the wait. My Staple is the "Broham" which is the BBQ pork and slaw sandwich. I'm not really a rib lover due to the amount of actual meat you get with any rib factor, but they are good too. Sides are very generous and tasty. Service is great, makes it a special day for me whenever I go.

ÊIf you are worried about your weight or cholesterol or gout, then do like me and go once every couple of years! :-) The "ribless" was a bit dry, so stick to that as a pulled pork and go with the Baby Back ribs and Beef Ribs.

This is definitely a tourist spot. If you are ever in SD, you should hit this spot up! Friends and I waited in line for about 30 minutes. Once you turn a corner, there's a sign posted above to let you know that it takes 21 minutes from that point to the cashier. You order what you want to eat, pick it up, and find a seat! Condiments on the table and paper towels. When you're all done eating and have leftovers, there is a little station where you can grab your own to-go boxes and plastic bags to pack up. The experience was awesome. The food was delicious too. I ordered the quarter pork rib dinner (4 bones and 2 small sides or 1 large side). I ordered macaroni salad and pork beans. It was delicious. The bbq sauce was tangy but yummy! The pork beans were sweet and the macaroni salad was perfect. If you get a little messy eating you can always grab a bib to wear so your clothes won't get stained! I would definitely come back!

I used to get pissed off when Phil would shut the restaurant down for a couple of weeks to go on vacation or when the neighborhood would shut it down because of the bbq scent cloud... this is all when it used to be located in Mission Hills... but I could still always go back and have my bbq with a relatively short line and eat in peace with my friends. Now I get pissed off when I go to Phil's because I don't wait in line for any food for an hour. ÊThus, I cannot eat my bbq in peace with my friends. ÊIt's ridiculous. Ê I started going to Phil's probably about 15 years ago. ÊPhil's was about one twentieth the size it is now. ÊI have heard the main reason for the huge influx of people is because it was featured on a food network show. ÊOne night my friends and I went to Phil's on a weekday, took one look at the line and skipped it. ÊI said let's just go to Hodad's instead (which i've been frequenting for probably 20 years) and the line was around the block!!! Ê(i've heard that Hodad's was also featured on a show.

YUMM! If you are ever in San Diego, you MUST try this place. And if you live in SD and have never been, you are missing out! The food is hella bomb! So good I usually order a full rack so I can eat half then have half for leftovers! I always get the baby back rib dinner or the best of both baby back ribs & chicken dinner. The ribs are tender, the bbq sauce is great, and the dinners come with 2 sides (I really like the potato and macaroni salad). The COLOSSAL ONION RINGS are amazing too! They're huge, crispy, and somehow Phils has mastered the art of making onion rings in which the entire onion doesn't come sliding out upon the first bite, leaving you with an empty fried shell. Other things worth trying--the broham sandwich (pulled pork) or the beefy ribs (huge). The workers are extremely friendly and efficient too! No complaints except it's so popular the line can get reallly long. If you're starving in anticipation of your amazing bbq and the line wraps around the building, just get the number off the menu and phone in your order from the parking lot. Then you'll only have to wait 15-20 min in your car and you can skip the line to pick up your order! :) P.S. If you're craving Phils on Mondays, you're out of luck. They're closed :(

Funny, every time I dine at a new place with rave reviews, a tiny part of me always hopes to find something horribly flawed with it so that maybe I can be that lone asshole giving the restaurant a measly 1-2 star review. But no, I'm going to tell you right now that Phil's definitely lives up to the hype. First of all, the service was awesome. Although you'll encounter a line that hugs the building, it is always moving. Theres even an outside beer garden near the entrance complete with free water to keep you hydrated as you wait. There are no servers at Phil's, there are plenty of tables to sit at, and the food is ready and in your belly just a few minutes after you order! I recently switched to a pescetarian diet, making very few exceptions for eating mammals or birds. But when going to a BBQ restaurant with a group of friends (including one who can't shut up about how orgasmic the food is), what are you going to do -- eat a garden salad by yourself? No way. I tried the half chicken meal with sides of macaroni salad and baked beans. Both of them were excellent! Usually, macaroni salad is a hit or miss for me (since I hate it when they're made w/ too much mayo) but this one was one of the best I've had yet. As for the chicken...outstanding! Tender, meaty, juicy and sauced up just how I like it,I was beside myself with every bite. One of my friends got the tri-tip sandwich (which resembled the most epic sloppy joe you can have) and I had a couple of bites of it and boy, was it tasty! I swear that thing was BLEEDING with BBQ sauce. Oh, did I mention my whole meal was under $10? SCHWING!

YUM! This was my first meal on a recent weekend trip to SD/LA, and boy did it hit the spot! Even though it was already past 1pm, the line was still wrapped around the corner and it took a good 30 min. before we ordered. My friend and I got the baby back rib & chicken dinner to share with a side of macaroni salad and a side of fries. Both the ribs and chicken were SO delicious! Nice and juicy and full of good barbecue flavor. Though my SD friend claimed that the macaroni salad was the BEST ever, my friend and I didn't share his enthusiasm. Regardless of when you come, be prepared to wait... but it's worth it! If only there was a location in NorCal... -L.

What can be said about Phil's that hasn't been said before? Here is my take To say something bad about Phil's is to face the firing squad from the evangelists singing its praises. Let's start with what's right about Phil's Ribs Phil's is obviously one of San Diego's most popular restaurants in the city. The line around San Diego waiting to get in to first place your order before your wait for the food and Êthen search for your picnic table makes the TSA security line in most major airports and a strip search look inviting. Even in our countries worst recession in my lifetime it didn't discourage the crowds or the enthusiasm these past few years. Clearly Phil's apparently can do no wrong. Phil the owner who I have never had the pleasure of meeting is a genius he has amongst the best ribs in the world.Ok all food is subjective. As a jaded ex New Yorker tasting his ribs at a corporate party was a game changer for me years ago. When I heard ribs was being served I ate before the party.I wasnt a big ribs fan previously.The Kansas City Barbeque in Downtown San Diego secured that feeling about bad ribs.It was awful. Bad mistake Kansas City BBque is not anything like Phils! One taste of Phils and I was hooked like a drug addict. The ribs have right amount of spicy sweetness with a nice charred crust on the outside with a moist tender flavorful taste with good mouth feel. If there is anything consistent about Phil's it's always the quality of the ribs. Unfortunately I have also (though rarely) received room temperature ribs which is frustrating after spending 70 plus bucks for lunch for 3 Êpeople and the long wait for the food and the line. To be fair they typically do the ribs right if nothing else goes well. But why do I continue to love this place? Did I say the ribs are great?!!! The management at Phils is simply excellent having conversed in the past. with these folks.They understand its not about mass feeding but building good customer relationships.Many of the team members are passionate about their customers and brand. You have to admire that. The pressure they are under with the volume of folks they serve.Phils and their management team find some very caring team members to their credit. Things that annoy me about Phils.The potato salad frequently is semi hard like a rock with undercooked potatoes. I stopped buying it for parties and meals. The barbeque chicken could be a great product here with the same great sauce however it is frequently made to far in advance and served dry like leather after being thrown back on the grill And because it is reheated after being cooked to far in advance Êfrequently is warm in one place and room temperature in others. I have stopped ordering the chicken. The fact is when they make it to order for our corporate functions it is fantastic. My guess is they take more pride when it is a function in getting things right. Their worst crime against dining humanity is when a new customer walks through the door and orders a complete meal with French fries They pour barbeque sauce drenching the fries in sauce. Though this may bring pleasure for some when the fries are crisp and it is eaten within minutes its certain misery for others. When the fries are undercooked as they have been once in awhile and they are drenched in sauce and you do take out and bring home it can get ugly.... Upon arrival home you have wet under cooked greasy soaking wet fries dripping in sauce that cannot be reheated. Hello? what are they thinking? It's not pretty and it turned my dining guests off where we dumped fries for 8 into the garbage can one evening. They should warn folks but they assume everyone knows their quirks and assumes everyone likes this treatment or are too busy to communicate it to their guests. To their credit when I call up to place an order a red flag goes up to not drench fries in sauce.They leave it off.......Ah the perks of being a regular! I'd like to give Phil's 5 stars out of love however its ribs only for the most part for me and a few of the side items they don't mess up At the end of the day long live Phil's! Great Ribs nice folks that work there, infuriating long lines and a dose of inconsistency. But I admit to loving the place anyway. They try to the best of their ability to take care of the customer even when the cooking goes into auto pilot as it does with the chicken.All that said when the urge arises I too need my fix of ÊPhils Ribs.YUM! Bring a lot of patience. Other than that Kudos to Phil's it's a San Diego institution and success story which cannot be denied

45 minute wait on a Saturday afternoon (around 2). My boyfriend and I wanted to try everything on the menu so we had two orders of The Best of Both Worlds. Baby back ribs &chicken with two small sides of macaroni salad and potato salad and beefy ribs & chick-less with a large side of baked potato. EVERYTHING was good! BUTthe baby back ribs and chicken was better than beefy ribs and chickless. OH YES! and a small order of the onion rings, A MUST! I was anticipating to have leftovers but everything was sooo good we finished every last bite! Standing in line, I asked a kind lady in front of me what was a must have here. She said everything. BOY WAS SHE RIGHT! She also added, this place is addicting. RIGHT AGAIN! Woke up this morning craving Phil's bbq D:

I enjoyed coming here and was worried about the hype. It certainly lived up to it but didn't exceed it. I visited on a Saturday a little after noon. The line wasn't as bad as I have heard it to be which was great. Set up wasn't what I expected... more like a corner bakery style place... you place your order, get your drinks, and come to the counter to claim your food. Between my other two guy friends, we ordered two beef rib dinners (which comes with 2 small sides or 1 large side) and a medium pork rib dinner. The beef ribs are gigantic... 2-3 plus a little of the sides could easily get you full (I'm a 190lb guy with a hearty appetite). I really preferred the beef ribs over the pork ones. The sauce was agreeable with my palette. For the sides, we tried the macaroni salad, baked beans and the coleslaw. I remember really liking the macaroni salad (strong red onion flavor if you're into that) and the coleslaw was better than average. Because I don't like baked beans all that much, I don't have much to say. Apparently, their onion rings are to die for. I really enjoyed my first two onion rings, but I can only take so much before I get sick of 'em. Share them with at least 3-4 people! The service here was abnormally great. The cashier did a lot of chit chat with me and even provided me a free drink. How nice is she! The bus boy also came by several times throughout the meal to make sure we were comfortable. All in all, good food, great service! I wouldn't say Phil's is the ultimate authority on BBQ, but they are pretty close!

I feel like just another 5 star review but I need to speak my mind.. Amazing beefy ribs!! They were just falling off the bone yummo..the line wasn't crazy when I got there but when I left it sure was super long..the people working here are super nice and very attentive. They frequently checked on us and before I asked for a box they showed up with it and soon after with a bag. I now see what the whole rave is about but it's so worth it the food is outstanding it's indescribable I honestly fell in love with the beef ribs and the bbq sauce was perfect. Too bad I can't frequent this place as much as I would love to since being from out of town.. hands down this is one of the best BBQ.

Wow to the wow. ÊPhil's BBQ is everything you could want in a BBQ place. Logistics first, then food. Yes, the line is LONG. ÊBut it actually moves. ÊI waited in line for about an hour, which is about the same wait time as a ride at Disneyland. ÊBut, honestly, the line is constantly moving, and by the time you get to the front, it isn't too difficult to find a seat (then again, I went with a party of 2). ÊIt definitely beats signing your name on a list and waiting to be called. ÊYour eye is always on the prize, which makes it a pretty encouraging wait. What's great about this place is that they don't only serve great food but great customer service. ÊDuring my wait in line, the manager and maybe one or two other workers walked up and down the line to chat with the customers, to see if it was anyone's first time, and to see if anyone needed information on the restaurant or the menu items. ÊI found this to be a nice touch considering I've waited for hours for a restaurant in the past and have always felt like the workers are on another planet until you are called and seated. ÊAs you get closer to the entrance, there is a sign that reads "Before ya start Yelp'n Let us start Help'n." ÊThis sign says it all--this place wants your experience to be the best. ÊAnd it really was. ÊBy the time we got to the front of the line, we were extremely haggered from hunger and our long day at Sea World. ÊBut everyone in the restaurant had nothing but smiles on their faces, from the hostess to the manager to the cashier to the bus boys. ÊI appreciate great customer service because I know how hard it can be to offer it, especially when things get busy and stressful. ÊThe manager even did me a huge favor and helped me out when I forgot to order a drink. ÊBest customer service I've had in a long time, hands down. Now on to the main event...we ordered the Pork Baby Back Rib Dinner with fries and potato salad, a small order of Onion Rings, and the BBQ Broham (pulled pork) sandwich and split it between two people. ÊMy eyes oogled and oggled when I saw the food. ÊThe portions are HUGE. ÊJust looking at the food made my mouth water. ÊThen, I took my first bite out of that huge onion ring and couldn't believe what I had just eaten. ÊThe crisp batter is unlike anything I have ever tasted. ÊThen, I dipped the onion ring in the buttermilk sauce and wanted to DIE. ÊI was in HEAVEN. ÊI have never tasted an onion ring that was that good! ÊI took a fork and ate a piece of the pulled pork sandwich and stopped chewing. ÊThe meat was soft and the sauce was unbelievable. ÊI wanted to dig right into the ribs. ÊJust as I had expected--soft, tender meat right off the bone and a semi-spicy, semi-sweet BBQ sauce that did the already amazing meat some extra wonders. ÊThe potato salad even impressed me--herby and potato-salad-y without surprisingly overdoing it and without any of potato salad's worst attributes. ÊTo be honest, I didn't get to try the fries or much of the sandwich while they were fresh--I filled up too fast (probably because I was tired and devoured the food a little too quickly). ÊBut eating the sandwich as a leftover was a joy, which is hard to say for most leftovers. ÊThe pulled BBQ pork is placed on top of a bed of coleslaw (which I usually don't like by the way). ÊEven as a leftover, the combination of the two was so delicious; I can only imagine what it would have tasted like fresh. This is probably the longest review I have ever written on Yelp, but it was well worth my time (as was the line at Phil's). ÊIf you're ever in the SD area, check it out and don't be afraid of the line! ÊIt will definitely blow your mind. Thanks for the great experience and the great food!

I finally popped my Phil's BBQ cherry!!!! I grew up in San Diego but I've never been to Phil's BBQ until 3 days ago. Me and my parents went there at an odd time (between lunch and dinner) so our wait was only about 15-20 minutes. However my mom says that usually the line is wrapping around the whole restaurant. Anyway the way it works is: while you wait in line you figure out what you want to order (there's menus posted up on the walls), order at the cashier like at a fast food restaurant, they give you a buzzer so you know when your order is ready, and then you seat yourself at whatever table is available. Also there's an area where you could grab your own plates, utensils, bibs (if you need it haha), etc. Me and my parents shared a whole rack + a quarter rack of the baby ribs. Hahahaha my mouth just started salivating as I was typing that. The ribs were soooo good! The ribs were slathered with their own BBQ sauce and the meat fell right off the bone, which is a sign of a good rib. The ribs were combined with a few sides: fries, beans, steamed veggies, and we ordered the onion rings on the side. The sides by itself were okay, but they complemented the ribs well. This was total satisfaction! I can't wait to go back when I visit SD again.

just aiiight.. not worth the wait. But, if there's not a wait, the BBQ chicken is good. I like all the yummy sides too. Macaroni salad, potato salad, fries, corn, beans, and the onion rings. I never get them though. I'm always afraid of becoming a lardo after a plate of onion rings. I would not recommend this place if there is a line. In fact, I'd tell you to head to Bull's. But, if the coast is clear, then by all means, get in, eat up, and get out. The service is eh, the food is eh, the prices are eh. Not bad.. just meh.

This is by far the best BBQ you can get in San Diego. The ribs are OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!!! Do yourself a favor and get a full rack. The french fries are really good. I have gotten the ribs probably the last 10 times Ive gone, but I've gotten almost everything on the menu. It's all good. Since they opened the second location in San Marcos, the lines are much shorter.

I went here under the recommendations of many of my friends and ive heard about this place from random people too. I took the 2 hour drive here to buy in to the hype and needless to say it did not disappoint. The wait here can be a while i came on a weekday and waited approximately 40 ish minutes because its almost always crowded. Ordering is an easy process and theres plenty of cashiers to serve you. Food wait is not very long considering the amount of people ordering. I ordered 2 Full rack of baby back ribs with 2 small sides (French Fries and Macaroni salad). The bill came out to be $20.42, the portions here i can say are quite generous. Each rack has about 5-6 ribs one of mine had 7 and the other had 6 which i wasnt complaining about. The meat on the baby back ribs is very tender and just falls off the bone. The sauce on the ribs is perfect blend of spice and sweet and just offers an awesome baby back rib experience. The small sides here are actually quite large, the fries were decent but nothing special. The macaroni salad was above average to me. Overall i give this restaurant the highest of my recommendations. I thought the 2 hour drive was well worth it and would definitely come back again.

I've tried. I've been to many different rib places, and I still can't say I have had anything better than Phil's. Too bad I no longer live in SD. I pray to the rib Gods that some day, good ol phil decides to expand up here. This guy could become a billionaire if he opened up a chain. The meat is fall of the bone tender, charred to perfection. The BBQ sauce is the BEST bbq sauce I have ever had. Sweet, tangy, and not too thick. It's almost like a bbq glaze. And the price. ~22 bucks for a full rack and 2 sides?!? That beats any of those chains like chili's, tony romas, that offer the same deal with crappy ribs. Sure, the line is long. 45 mins to an hour. but HELL! if THAT many people are waiting, then you know it's good. ÊIt's definitely worth the wait. Some people say that the 'meat' quality is not that good. Then don't eat it. GO eat steak. This ranks as one of my favorite restaurants of all time.

I don't think I'm alone when I say that I have heard A LOT about Phil's. ÊPhil's is certainly the talk of the town when it comes to BBQ and it's famous food ranks in the most talked about for any type of food here in SD. Ê There is no question that Phil's is very good. ÊI went here last night with a group of 10 people and there was plenty of room and no wait. ÊI ordered "El Toro" with a price tag of around $7. ÊAlso got a large order of the macaroni salad ($2.25). ÊEl Toro was very good. ÊShaved, tender tri-tip slathered in BBQ sauce on a hamburger bun. ÊThe only thing that brings this from a 5 star experience to a 4 star experience is the amount of sauce as well as the flavor of the sauce. The sauce is pretty good. ÊIt has A LOT of flavor. ÊIn fact, the abundant amount of contrasting flavors and spices was slightly overwhelming for me. ÊThe amount of sauce seemed to mask the quality of the meat to an extent. ÊThere was A LOT of sauce. I'm afraid that the accolades that Phil's has received is a bit overboard when considering the the amount of sauce on EL Toro along with it's slightly overwhelming flavor. ÊThat, being said, I would still highly recommend Phil's for a good plate of BBQ.

I can't believe I have not reviewed this place yet! ÊWell, obviously, they have the best BBQ here. ÊThe ribs are amazing and so are the fries and cole slaw. ÊI usually dislike cole slaw at most places because it's just dripping with mayo or whatever it is they put in cole slaw, but the slaw at Phil's has flavor and texture. Ê Just recently I have reverted back to my mainly vegetarian lifestyle due to a 10 day cleanse that had left me uninterested in the flavor of meat. ÊSo when I went back to Phil's this last time, I pondered what I should order. ÊI decided to go with the veggie burger. ÊOMG!! ÊIt was amazing!! ÊIt comes with an onion ring, cheese, gardenburger patty, and of course their famous BBQ sauce. ÊI could not have asked for a better burger. ÊSo if you are a vegetarian and all your friends decide to go to Phil's, don't fret, they got something tasty there for you too!!

I'm really only giving this 4 stars because the line was so insane and the ribless dinner was a little dry when I was there mid-July, 2011. I went there with some friends who had family in the area who went here all the time. ÊWe were very lucky to find two spots at the bar with two people next to them getting up to leave (Four people together at the bar is evidently uncommon). When we are at the bar we can order food/drinks from the bartender. However, if you wait in line like most people, you have to order at the front, sit and wait for your food to be ready. ÊWhile this my be an inconvenience it's worth it for the high quality of food and it's obviously worth it to all the other people that have a couple hours to kill by standing around the side of the building.

BEST BBQ SPOT IN THE WEST COAST!! I just wrote a review from another SD restaurant (see: Analog Bar) ranting about how douchebaggy this waiter was.... NOW i think one of the best parts of this restaurant, is that you pay, you get your food, you sit in clouds of happiness as you eat, and you get the F up and leave. ÊNo tips, no waiting for your check, no having to deal with good/bad waiters... just pay eat leave. As for the food, that's definitely a 5 stars. ÊI've never not pigged out over here. ÊI usually come out with a BBQ smothered face, all up in my scalp which i don't even know how it gets there. ÊI usually follow it up with a confession at church for punishing my digestive system to work that hard. ÊThen I pass out for about two to three days, so it is advised to go here on a Friday night. Ê(I usually order a full ribs, and chicken and ribs combo). People get turned off by the line that wraps around the building several hundred times. ÊHowever that is part of the experience. ÊIts like lining up for free vaccine or lining up for your first roller coaster ride at six flags. 5 stars are hard to come but this definitely earns each of them!

It was a Sunday afternoon and my wife and I were staying in Old Town, San Diego. We decided to walk a couple miles to the BBQ place we have heard a lot about. Phil's. The line was pretty short and the greeter asked us if it was our first time there. We said,"Yes" and he explained how everything worked. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and my wife ordered the boneless chicken tenders platter with steamed veggies. The order taker was awesome and the lady that gave us our food was fantastic too. Everyone had a smile on their face. Even the bus boy was in a good mood. Now onto the food. The pork sandwich was teeming with meat and spilling over the sides. It was juicy and perfect. The sauce could have been hotter, but I like spicy stuff. It was good though, kind of tangy. I would have liked multiple options like Famous Dave's back in Minneapolis, but that is just being picky. My wife's platter was full of white meat pieces of chicken breast. They were awesome, but I would have liked more sauce on them if I had my choice. Her veggies were fresh and crispy and with the service and pop refills, Phil's lived up to expectations! A must visit in San Diego. The line looks big, but it went by quickly and it is worth the wait.

Be prepared to wait a ridiculously long time (4 of us came here on a Saturday night around 9pm and still waited 40 minutes), but it's worth it! I got the rib combo meal with white meat chicken, and it was super delicious. ÊThe white meat chicken was good and tender, but I think going forward, I'm just going to get the ribs because those suckers are amaaazingly good. I also tried the onion rings and steamed veggies (you know, to balance out some of the fattiness), and both were delicious -- even the steamed veggies. I'd definitely come back for the ribs and to try the beef ribs, but it may be worth it to call ahead and get a take out order if you don't want to wait in the long ass line.

This place is finger-licking good(LITERALLY!). The menu offers a variety of choices for both meat and poltury lovers. My usual is the El Toro(Tri tip) sandwich.

I should probably disclose that I am a New Yorker and I am better qualified at reviewing pizza than BBQ. ÊHowever, I do know good food.

It's hard to hate on Phil's. ÊThe food is good, they are super generous, great atmosphere, and I take basically all my San Diego guests to eat here at least once. ÊI've never, ever had anyone say they didn't enjoy their meal. ÊSo, it's hard to complain. ÊTheir sandwiches are great can feed a family of 14. Ê The ribs are moist and flavorful ... they do in fact fall off the bone. ÊBut truth be told that's where the problem starts. ÊBoiling ribs makes them too moist. ÊProper ribs are smoked so when you bite, the bit you bit should come off the bone clean. ÊAt phils, you take a bite and the whole rib comes sliding off the bone. ÊSo, if you really know BBQ don't expect it here. ÊExpect good food, generious portions, and super moist ribs. That said, I do enjoy Phil's and since it's so close to home I'll keep going back. ÊBut when I got hankering for some real BBQ with that true smokey goodness, I'm heading to Coops in Lemon Grove. P.S. The line at Phil's blows! Out.

The best bbq I've had. ÊLiving in Los Angeles there just aren't any good bbq joints in so cal and Phil's was certainly the first. ÊThe ribs are soft, moist and juicy that easily come off the bone. ÊBbq sauce was great too. ÊDefinite revisit just wish they had one in Los Angeles.

Stopped here on a trip down to SD to pick up a car. The line was super long, but that's always the sign of a good place. ÊIt was most definitely worth it though! Probably my the best BBQ I've ever had. The sauce is pretty sweet, but I personally like that. The ribs fell off the bone but still had some texture to them. The people working were very friendly and even fed us little snacks as we waited in line. ÊCan't think of anything to complain about. It was pretty much a perfect BBQ meal.

I came here again today with a friend, we've been craving Phil's for months. And when I say months, I mean MONTHS. It's been passed due, so we decided to go today. We never actually went on a weekend, which means we never went through the massive line. But when we arrived there I didn't think it was that bad. The line moved pretty quick. We ordered the usual except this time we had a full rib dinner. I had half and she had the other half. And we had a side of fries and potato salad. And is it me or the large side of fries is the same size as the small side? At least I thought so. Usually we can eat a half rib dinner together and we would be full. But nope today we were extra hungry. We chowed down like we haven't ate for days. People might not think it's a lot, but I think it is. If you look around everyone's boxing their food. Not us though, we demolished it. One of the workers came around and was like "Damn, that's pretty good." While staring at us with disbelief. What? He hasn't seen two little Asian girls eat? Haha. I love this place, never disappoints me. And I doubt it disappoints anyone else. By the time we was leaving the line wrapped around the restaurant. People want their Bbq! haha

4.5 star rating with more 2,000 reviews and I'm not a fan? I'm devastated that this place wasn't my cup of tea (but I could see why everyone else would love it). My boyfriend and I were super ecstatic to FINALLY give this place a shot and decided on our day off from school and work to drive two hours down to San Diego. We arrived about 10 minutes before it opened and there was already a line. When it opened, we went in the Dine-In line where you order first AND THEN you find a seat. You can't just find a seat, hold it, and then order which makes perfect sense so no complaining there. We ordered the baby back ribs, fries, potato salad and a couple other things. As soon as we paid, we found our seat and waited to have a mind blowing experience. On to the food! Ate the fries first and it was pretty good. Went for the potato salad and it was even better. Saved the baby back ribs for last (because you always save the best for last or so I thought) and took a bite into one heck of a super tangy rib. Talk about DISAPPOINTING! I like my sauce sweet not tangy but apparently, according to all the reviews, the sauce is what makes Phil's BBQ a favorite for many. So, for all you barbecue lovers who LOOOVE tangy barbecue sauce, make your way to Phil's BBQ because I'm sure you'd love it. I wish I did so I would of enjoyed my visit but it was definitely worth the try!

This seems like the place to be in San Diego. ÊI don't think a bbq purist would really enjoy this place. ÊThey drench everything in sauce, and the meat itself didn't have a ton of tenderness to it. This just furthers my belief that San Diegoans, San Dieguns, San Diegans are just trying to puff up anything that is half decent, to try to make themselves feel better about living in a city that has very few amazing experiences.

Oh good I'm just the 2387th person to review this place. Luckily, I wasn't late or anything... My bf is a total snob when it comes to BBQ. He grew up in the South (not Mexico, but Arkansas)...so he feels he knows when the presence of good tastin' BBQ is present and even he simply LOVED this place. Personally, south or no south...I thought it was better than ones he took me to down in AR. Well, I always preach that the food speaks for itself and this place is no exception. Not only did it speak...it sang!! Ahh the sound of Fall-off-the-bone ribs and juicy tender bbq chicken is music to my ears. The side dishes are pretty standard. Normally, I'm not too keen on baked beans, but even that was quite tasty here....along with their potato salad and slaw. They're around the clock busy, so if you have a big group...make sure everyone is on time or else they won't seat you. ÊPlus, they're not your typical restaurant where you sit and order, but rather you line up...order first, then sit. ÊAnother nice touch about this place is that they serve beer from many of the local SD breweries on tap, but worry not...they also carry imported bottles as well. I think with 2000+ 5 star reviews...not too much else needs to be said...Phil's is worth a try.

Still as good as I remember it. ÊOver the years, the quality and consistency has not changed. ÊThough now that they have moved out of their original location and practically have taken over the strip mall at the Sports Arena, business is better than ever. ÊSo good that they've even opened a location in San Marcos to cater to the North County peeps. ÊWished they opened this location a few years ago when the gf still lived in Rancho Bernardo. ÊRhonda is also at the new location to ensure things are set up correctly =( Êdidn't get to see her this time. This time around we had a group of 8. ÊWe shared the 2 beef rib dinners (http://www.yelp.com/biz_É), a baby back rib dinner (http://www.yelp.com/biz_É), an order of steamed veggies and an order of onion rings (http://www.yelp.com/biz_É). We have yet to find a better bbq place in LA and I even dare to say Houston. ÊI just love how the meat on the beef ribs just simply falls off the bone.

"All normal people love meat. ÊIf I went to a barbeque and there was no meat, I would say 'Yo Goober! ÊWhere's the meat!?'. ÊI'm trying to impress people here Lisa. ÊYou don't win friends with salad." -- Homer was always a very wise man...And yes, the endless line around the building supports the notion that you don't win friends with salad. the people come for the ribs. and the ribs....they are good. You smell the smokey, meaty, tanginess in the air for a good mile surrounding the building. but im not here to talk about ribs. you can read over 1,000 other reviews to hear people's thoughts about ribs. im here to talk about BEANS. ...baked beans, to be exact. i know, im crazy. i get absolutely obsessed with the most random things. and the latest is Phil's BBQ baked beans. i pat myself on the back for selecting that as one of my sides. holy-freaking-BBQ sauce, Phil. what the hell do you do to those beans to make them so sinfully creamy and delicious? yes, creamy...i can't think of another way to explain it. outstanding. any place that puts that much awesomeness into the sides as well as the meat gets my kudos. one note: if doing the "best of both" - i wouldn't recommend getting the chick-less. yeah, i feel a bit stupid. it is LESS that the standard boned chicken...at the same price. and come on now, Phil's represents the most american of attributes: Gluttony and Bang for your Buck. I come to phil's to eat way more than I should and get my monies worth. Oh and though comical to me that the whole experience felt like I was at disneyland...down to the huge hanging sign as you shuffle through the line (which boasts over 1,000 5 Star reviews on yelp), I gotta give it to them....they do a damn good job with efficiency. And I was amazed at the friendly and personable experience with the order taker. Felt like I was at trader Joes. They don't rush you and even enjoy a bit of chit chat. so maybe with most people, Phil wins their love with meat. but for Heather, you won it with baked beans. mmmm.

When my boyfriend suggested we have lunch at Phil's, I had no idea what I was in for. ÊI moved to San Diego from Seattle about three months ago and until that day, I hadn't heard of Phil's. ÊBut I'm happy to report that I'm glad to have discovered it! We arrived a little before noon on a Saturday and beat the lunch rush by about 15 minutes. ÊOn our drive to the restaurant, my boyfriend said that we might have to postpone our meal at Phil's if the line was too long. I didn't understand how that could be an issue at a restaurant but by the time we left an hour later, the line was out the door and heading down the side of the building! ÊBut the people all seemed content to wait, which must be a sign that it's amazing. I ordered the white meat half bbq chicken platter with fries while my boyfriend got the beef ribs with onion rings. ÊI couldn't believe the size of the portion! ÊHuge plate filled with two chicken breasts and wings and more fries than I could eat in a week! ÊI managed to work my way through one of the breast pieces and boxed up the rest to go. I'll add this to my list of places to take my Seattle friends when they come to visit in San Diego!

After living in San Diego for 5 years, working literally 3 mins drive away for the past 1.5 years, and hearing my friends from LA/OC rave about how much they love this place, I finally made my way to Phil's BBQ. The restaurant is closed on Mondays and consider yourself warned: the line is ATROCIOUS on other days. It literally wraps around the building, but most people find the 45-minute wait worthwhile. They don't take reservations, either. But if you sign up to be part of their club, you get to cut the line on your birthday (and if it falls on a Monday, well... I don't know what to say to that, haha). I was hesitant to come here for two reasons: 1) I hate heavy food (especially things like burgers and BBQ) 2) I don't like eating anything containing bones or shells (it's just too much effort for food) 3) Every time something is hyped, I'm always disappointed because it falls short of my expectations But Phil's BBQ proved me wrong on all three points. VERY friendly service- the waiters were VERY helpful in aiding me since it was my first time here and I was pretty confused. They were also very quick to clear the messes off the table. The menu isn't all that extensive, but there's no need for it to be. Baby Back Rib Dinners: At first glance, it looks pretty much like your standard baby back ribs. But the meat was fall-off-the-bone good. Very tender, seasoned well, and Beefy Rib Dinners: The bone definitely contained a LOT more meat that pretty much fell right off the bone. I'd have to say this was my favorite, but that's because I like beef more than pork (my friend argues that the baby back tastes better). Half Chicken Dinner ($8.75): Chicken is chicken. I would NEVER suggest that anybody order chicken. The chicken is on the dry side, slathered with BBQ sauce. Definitely not as enjoyable as the pork and beef. If you have to order chicken to try it out, I'd suggest eating the chicken first. Fresh Cut Fries: I wasn't blown away, but you pretty much have to have this if you're eating BBQ (or at least, I do). Fresh Cole Slaw: Surprisingly full of flavor (and probably fat, which I don't want to know about). Macaroni Salad: Again, very delicious (and no doubt chock-full of calories, but hey, I already screwed myself over eating everything else listed above, so why not?). I got pretty excited when I saw Phil's BBQ sauce at Costco the next day. Whether or not it's as OG remains to be seen (all my friends are guessing it's not going to be as good). Parking is not too bad, as Phil's BBQ is located in a plaza with plenty of parking on both sides of the restaurant. The good thing about this place is that it's open relatively late- 10 PM or 11 PM depending on the day. Next time, I'm definitely going to try the sandwiches. My OC/LA friends have already put in requests for me to bring Phil's up with me on my next trip. With that being said, see you on Friday, Phil's!!

Yes, I am definitely a fan. A must go for any visitor in San Diego, and you can ask any San Diego native. the lines are long, but you can phone in your order to have it to go, much more convenient option. I haven't gotten anything else besides the ribs here, because I have no reason to. I'm no barbeque expert, but I know what's good and what's not. and this stuff is good. what more do you need to know? I prefer the beef ribs, because they are huge and meaty. totally satisfied after 3 bones, but it won't stop me from finishing the entire full rack. come and try it. pretty much everyone else has.

I LOVE Phil's BBQ! I love it to the point I drove 80 miles there on a Tuesday night for my birthday dinner. Is that not love? It's pure commitment to delicious beefy ribs and, awesome perks of cutting in line. How? Sign up for Phil's newletter (http://philsbbq.fbmta.coÉ) they send you an email the week before your birthday to jump to the front of the line for the whole week of your birthday. guy: EXCUSE ME! there's a LINNNNE me: i know, it's my BIRTHDAY Phil's employee: (waves me to cut and lets me order) /end scene Another funny story...you know you've been to Phil's too much when you phone in an order and they know you're name and that you order Brohams...scarrrry! They've finally caught on that people order via phone and eat their "take-out," -in to avoid lines. Innocent mistake O=) Get...anything here. Really. I use to only get baby back ribs, then it was the Broham crazy (to the point that I would bring it on the plane with me, and have others stare at me with jealousy) and now it's the beefy ribs crave. Too bad their mac salad and potato aren't that good...and they shut down the original location that had board games... but that is easily forgiven with the addition of a bar and big(ger) screen TVs. Ah, the good life!

Came here expecting something amazing because of all the reviews and hype my friends gave it.. overall, I'd have to say, the ribs were okay, nothing special and I left disappointed. Menu only consisted of baby back/beef ribs and chicken as the meat. Missing the brisket! Bludso's bbq in compton is way better and the best bbq I've tried in California by far. If you haven't tried it, definitely make a trip. Phil's is good, but not worth the drive/wait.

ÊIt tastes just as good in the comfort of your home or on a Thursday afternoon at work (mmm that was a good day at work). Ê When you do eat there, if you end up sitting at a table by the window be prepared to feel like a lion at the zoo.

How have I not written a review about this place?! As all SD-ers (and friends of SD-ers will tell you), this place hits the spot! I literally crave Phil's every week, and I gotta tell you, I didn't particularly like BBQ until after Phil's. Even my native Texas friend thought the BBQ here was on point! If you've never been there, I suggest you go and experience Phil's BBQ. Make sure that you get there before 5pm though, or you will incur the wrath that is the Phil's BBQ long line. I ALWAYS order the same thing at Phil's: -Best of Both Worlds (1/2 chicken & 1/2 Baby Back Ribs. BBQ sauce on the side) w/ fries and macaroni salad sides. I love the BBQ sauce here because it's got a tangy kick to it instead of all sweet. -Sometimes if I'm feeling especially bad, I'll get the onion rings (which are the best onion rings I've ever tasted! They are HUGE and don't do that thing where the entire onion comes out with one bite). Other note worthy things to order: -pulled pork sandwich -potato salad -everything (haha) The people there must get paid hella $$$ because they are all so friendly! Imagine working in a restaurant that is busy all the freaking time and still having a smile on your face. One time I even got free ice cream here =) So, what are you waiting for? Do you really need to read the other 1,870 reviews for you to decide to go?! Just GOOOOO. (Unless it's a Monday, because they are closed!)

I've recently tried the pork ribs also (because I was afraid to stray away from beefy ribs), and they are so delicious! Now I need to order them both everytime I come here. The bar also carries one of my favorite beers - Karl Strauss Amber Lager. I'd rate this place higher if I could just for that.

So, I made the drive to Phil's from Culver City because, like most everyone else, I saw it on Man Vs. Food and HAD to try it. Let me just say that I've had REAL Southern BBQ in the heart of Texas AND watch a shit ton of Top Chef so I'd like to think I'm a pretty tough critic. With that being said, here's my first yelp review--WHATTUP?!?! First off, the line looks really, really long but it does move along pretty swiftly. You can watch a live feed before you stop by to see what the damage is, which is pretty cool. If you really can't wait to get your fingers dirty, you can always go snag a seat yourself at the bar which is what we did. I got the baby back ribs and an order of onion rings. The onion rings take a while to make so you'll be waiting for your food a bit longer than your buddies if that's the route you take. The BBQ sauce is pretty damn good the ribs are definitely fall-off-the-bone tender. All in all, it still didn't top the Texas BBQ I was spoiled with so I wasn't THAT impressed....but then I bit into an onion ring (which literally was the size of my face!) and all was right with the world again. Oh my GOD, seriously the best onion rings I've ever had. I thought it was funny that I enjoyed the rings more than the BBQ itself but what can you do? Not sure if I'll ever make that drive again JUST to eat here but if I'm in the area I'll probably stop by for an order of Samoan-sized onion rings and an El Toro sandwich instead of the ribs. P.S. Phil, quit being so stingy with your BBQ sauce.

Freakin' awesome place! Fun atmosphere and friendly service. The food is so delicious! I came for lunch and had the Broham, which is a pulled pork sandwich. I ordered it with a smalll side of fries and a soda, which came to about $8.50. When I picked up my order, I was happy with the amount of food. The sandwich was huge and overflowing with meat! ÊTons of fries for a small order. Did the sandwich taste as good as it looked? Yes! Tender tasty meat drenched in BBQ sauce. Don't worry about making a mess on yourself. Besides regular bathrooms they have washing stations. Two stand alone sinks for you to wash your hands. Very good idea. I liked the food so much I thought about coming back the next day for the ribs. I didn't, but next time I'm in SD (or San Marcos, where their other location is), I'll be sure to drop by!

Okay, so its not gonna satisfy people who are set on particular styles of BBQ (texas, memphis, etc..) because what they do is a style all their own, and they do it well. It could be hailing baseballs and this place will always have a line out the door and around the block. Its that good. Full rack with beans and onion rings and I am instantly in BBQ heaven. I have tried their sandwiches on occasion but their ribs are the star of the show, pork or beef, either one is done right and make me happy every time. Order ahead if you don't want to wait forever, and prepare to get into a fist fight to get a table because its seat yourself, and first come, first served.

We weren't even hungry at the time, but I knew we could not pass up the chance to try Phil's BBQ while we were in SD. I was in disbelief at the crowd outside when we first rolled into the parking lot! The line curled around the side of the restaurant, which reminded me of the lines at Magic Mountain. We decided to bypass the line and order take out to enjoy at the picnic tables by Mission bay. There was barely anyone ahead of us in the carry-out line... and after taking our number, it literally took 5 minutes for us to get our order. We ordered the full rack of baby back ribs and took a crapload of moist toilettes and napkins. When we got to the beach, we dug in and it was delicious!... and messy! The ribs were super tender and the sauce had the perfect amount of spice and tangy-ness. I don't know if I would have the patience to wait in line... maybe if I was majorly craving BBQ. PS. by the entrance, they had complimentary ice-cold water, which was lightly flavored with cucumber and lemon/lime so that was a nice touch!

What can I say that hasn't been talked about in almost 2,000 reviews before me? ÊPhil's is a good BBQ spot, indicative by the round-the-corner line that is always formed at the front door. Any place that serves mass quantities of slow-cooked meats can't be a bad thing. ÊThey have great variety on their menu (as long as you want beef, pork or chicken). ÊThey'll smoke it, grill it, pull it, chop it, or sauce it with each individual order. My first man-meal years ago at their Hillcrest location was their standard (pork) ribs and chickless meal with beans and mac, to which I added two beef bones and onion rings to share. ÊMore food than one person needs, but when has that ever stopped me before? ÊBeen going back ever since, usually with a smaller order but I still try to get the best of everything, usually by sharing with someone else. I would like to see a thing or two added to their sides, namely mac 'n cheese and collard greens... but I am always happy with the beans, mac salad, fries, cole slaw... you really can't go wrong with any of them.

This place is over-hyped. There are is usually a 30mins-1 hour wait Baby Back Ribs: 4/5, tender but so salty -.- it leaves me so thirsty BBQ Chicken: 3/5 way too dry I love their Macaroni and Potato Salad but then again, it's pretty hard to mess those up. I think it's a little pricey for the quantity you get. But I'll be back again but only when my friends feel like getting Phil's

I am usually NOT a big BBQ fan, but everyone who I asked for food recommendations in the SD area said to come here, so I just had to. And I was not disappointed at all! The line was long, but they had heat lamps to shield me from the cold. We had a party of 10, so I thought we would have to wait forever to be seated. But luckily, within 10 minutes, the hostess asked if we mind sitting in the bar area, and we automatically cut that huge long line and got seated at a TABLE in the bar area. NICEEEE! The waiter took our orders quickly too and the food came out quick. I shared a dinner plate of BBQ Pork Ribs with 4 girls. Got two large sides and that was just the perfect amount of food. I didn't want to be stuffed with BBQ meat anyways. I can't explain it, but the BBQ Pork Ribs were soooo tender, the taste was amazing, and the meat just fell off the bones. I want to come back here! Next stop, Texas BBQ and we'll see if this place still holds up its 5 stars! :)

Never heard about this joint, But decided to go since my girlfriend friends are in town. ÊThe line is worst than ever. ÊI think a lot of SD's people Êgo here because it is the only restaurant serving ribs in there town. ÊDon't believe in the hype in this place. ÊYOu wait at least for 1 hr plus for the same taste as claim jumper or black angus, or even Lucilles. ÊGo wait and you will find out.

Good bbq... the wait in line to order was a bit of a pain, but the search for a seat was not as bad as I expected.... esp for a group of like 18. :) Ordered the bbq baby back pork ribs and 1/4 chicken, cole slaw, potato salad, onion rings. The bbq was good... meat was good.... I think i like my bbq more smokey like in the meat... it relied on the sauce a bit, thought it was still good. The chicken wasn't dry but it was on the border. The sauce was tangy and sweet (honey-ish). I like my sauces more tangy than sweet and this was to my liking. The slaw was decent, but then i'm only so-so when it comes to cole slaw. The potato salad was good (like the dill) with good texture and not overly mayo/mustardized as some can be. My friend said the mac salad was better, but i didn't try the mac salad myself... thought it looked awesome too. I loved the onion rings. Light crispy batter. The order was huge. fyi... portions are pretty big... maybe too big for one, maybe big enough for 2 moderate eaters.

I'm gonna make this short and simple: best bbq joint in the planet! Expect a long line! because this place is just that great, and get here early, or get lucky maybe the line will move faster who knows. The ribs: amazing! made tender, well marinaded, add creole seasoning and vinegar for added flavor, bomb! The sides: colossal onion rings with batter dip let it ooze those rings! Are you full? then great! you just had the best bbq in the land i don't need to say more.

Wow. This place is incredible. The ribs absolutely fall off the bone, and the BBQ sauce is simply amazing. I got the pasta salad and the fries, and they were both excellent sides. The food is so good, and you get a ton of it if you're not careful with ordering! I had a giant plate that made me look like the fattest possible glutton. I've never had a plate of food that made me so self-conscious. But, once I started to eat it, I stopped caring. It was too good, and I couldn't be bothered to wipe the sauce off my face. This is the kind of place where you wait in line (and if you come during peak lunch/dinner hours, there will be a LONG line) and order, then sit and wait for your meal. So service is nothing special. Even if the line is long, if you're from out of town, wait - it's worth it.

There's great debate whether Phil's is REAL BBQ. I don't know if it is, but I do know it's delicious. And the super long lines on the weekend prove that others think so to. I usually get a full baby back rib dinner with fries and whatever other side I feel like. You GOTTA get the fries. They're great under the ribs soaking up the sauce. Pro-tip: If you don't want to wait in line, go for an early lunch or call it in for to go and eat in the parking lot. That line is crazy, they even have a webcam for it.

I don't understand why this place is rated so high. I guess people in SD don't really know what good BBQ is. For the amount of time I had to wait in line I was expecting a lot more. This BBQ is just ok, the ribs are a bit too tangy and covered in sauce for my liking. It was ok but not fall off the bone good. I had beans and cole slaw as my sides and both of those were pretty typical. As I write this review I can't even remember what it taste like which is a good indication of how memorable my experience there was. I wasn't impressed with the service either. Lack luster at best. to me this is just a typical rib joint, you're better off going to Tony Romas

Phil's BBQ? Yes, it is as good as you have heard. Also yes, the line is as long as you've heard. I feel like everyone's first reaction to Phil's is based on the line they see driving up. Out out the door, around the corner, and down the strip mall. Unfortunately you have to stand in the line as there is no reservation/buzzer option. What many people do is have someone wait in line while the rest of your party chills in the car or waits at home. Average wait time 6-8pm? Probably 1.5 hours. Worth it? Yes. If you go at an odd time (3pm?) the wait will likely be only 15 minutes :) A less advertised option for small parties or single riders: sitting in the bar! As long as everyone in your group is 21+, you can scavenge for a table in the bar. It's really not as bad as you'd think! There is quick turnover with bar customers and hovering over someone for 15 minutes while they finish their last rib or beer beats waiting in line for over an hour. You get the same menu and the same great food :) SO, the food? I always get the "Best of both" with chickless (balls of boneless white meat chicken...better than it sounds!) and baby back ribs. The sauce is AMAZING and now you can buy it at Costco in addition to at the restaurant! The meat on the ribs falls of the bone and the chicken is juicy and succulent. For sides, I always get the fries (thin and crispy!) and macaroni salad (not too saucy and clearly their own recipe). I've only gotten to-go once, but I would not order fries to-go again. They were plenty soggy and essentially tasteless by the time I made it home :( I take all of my out of town friends here, and even the skeptical ones are completely awed by the food. Also, the service (once you get to the front of the line...) is great! Smiles all around. They must have a huge staff because there is always someone coming to your table asking if you need anything or want a box. Bottom line: Pros: Amazing bbq, great service, lots of soda choices, decently price, you get to experience a moment of heaven Cons: No options for our herbivore comrades, excruciating wait, not a good place to take a soft-spoke date, not open Mondays!! GO. NOW. :)

Sometimes when so many people tell you how good a place is going to be, it simply ups the ante to the point where if everything is just perfect, they've failed. We expected to and wanted to LOVE Phil's but alas, it fell short for us. It didn't bother us that it took nearly a hour to move through the friendly line of people waiting to place their orders. We actually met some nice people in line that we chatted with about food, restaurants that we had been to and what to order here. The menu was decent and prices more than reasonable. We were here for BBQ and BBQ we would eat. For the five of us, we ordered four dinners and a large order of onion rings. More than enough food. Here's what we got: 2 slabs of baby back ribs 1 order of beef ribs 1 order of a 1/2 chicken corn on the cob cole slaw macaroni salad potato salad

Everything you've heard is true. This place definitely lives up to the hype. The food was absolutely delish! It took me so long to check this place out because of the fact that the line is usually around the building and about 60+ people deep... We came on Tuesday around noon and we waited in line less than 10 minutes and received our food in about the same time...excellent if you ask me! We ordered 2 el torro sammies which were incredibly delicious and my bf got a full rack of beef ribs. For the price, quality, quantity and experience this place is unparalleled! Everything we ordered tasted superb!

Line might be long but service was pretty quick. The food is ok, we got beef ribs and bbq chicken with a small side of onion rings. OMG the order of onion rings were HUGE!!!! The size of the beef ribs were on the smaller side, but it was good - a bit dry on sauce (sauce is extra!!! WTF!!!). It was ok but not amazing. On a side note - when we were there the NBA game was on the TV but one of the guest wanted to watch hockey so they changed the channel, my friend asked them if it was possible to put the basketball game back and the guy answered, "I don't think there is a game on..." FAIL!!! LOL And he went and talked about it to his fellow workers and laughed, I laughed too.

Phil's is decent BBQ for San Diego, but it's too crowded these days. The bf enjoyed the full rack o beefy ribs and I ordered the half baby-back. While the meat was fall off the bone tender, the meat itself wasn't saturated with flavor. The meat and sauce seemed like separate components, although the sauce had a nice smoky taste. The charred-flavor and crunch are probably what you're paying for... Phil's apparently got fined up the wazoo for complaints of smoke by its previous ÊMission Hills neighbors. Overall, good BBQ by SD standards, friendly staff and sports-friendly. I'd come back again.

Hands down one of the best BBQ experiences I've ever had. No trip to San Diego is complete without a trip to Phils! IT'S MANDATORY. First time I came here I got the half chicken with the pork spareribs. FALL OFF THE BONE GOOD. Just the right amount of BBQ sauce so it wasn't drenched or skimped. The beans were tasty and cooked to perfection. The cole slaw was alright, can live without. Fries were so-so. Expect a wait on the weekends for sure, but oh so worth it!! BBQ chicken - 4.5 stars Pork Spare Ribs - 5 stars Beef Ribs - 3.5 stars Beans - 4 stars Cole Slaw - 3 stars Fries - 2.5 stars I dream of Phils which is probably why there's drool on my pillow.

I'm giving it a 3.5, better than Ok, but not quite a fan. Why? Mostly because of the food. Line: Went in the beginner of October. Despite the announcement that says.. Summer is over, and the lines might be shorter: This is untrue. Had to wait approx an hour at 7:30pm on a Sunday night. Bright side: Once you get to the corner.. and it says.. only 22min however many seconds.. its quite accurate. From the corner, took us about 25 minutes to get to the cashier. Don't get initimated by the lines... its moves quite relatively fast. I also was entertained with the jumbo sign that welcomed Yelpers! That allowed me to put it as a 4 star, instead of a 3 star.. for my 3.5 star rating :P Don't be afraid to voice your concern, as they try to aim to please (I didn't really had anything to complain about). Not much service contact after your cashier. Make your order, get your buzzer, seat yourself. People might think its like herding cattle, but it was a fun experience :) Food: Going to eat BBQ? Get Baby back ribs on top of baby back ribs on Êtop of more baby back ribs. Yes they might be substationally smaller than the beef ribs, but they taste a lot better, and less more tendon filled. They are good BBQ baby back ribs do doubt, but My dad makes them better (might not be fair to compare, as I haven't found a place that does it better than my dad). The downside was that.. (i forget if u get 8-10 or 10-12 ribs when you order the combo for ~$20) but its always the smaller number of ribs that you get :P Was kinda disappointed, because my ribs were in the smaller size so it didn't make up for the portion. Side of fries was not hot or fresh. I really enjoyed the sweet beans tho :) Chicken: dark meat was yummy, white meat not so much. But thats preference. All in all: Whatever type meat.. the sauce is the same.. so go for the best.. and get yourself the baby back, baby back ribs! Want the bib experience? They still provide plastic bibs if you'd like. All in all.. I've had better experiences in other baby back rib dives. And better deals with All-You-Can-Eat prices. But yea, I wouldn't mind going back to Phils. Tip: Don't want to wait in line? There is no line after 9PM. Oh.. and they have a newer location in Carlsbad too! Less of a line up, for the same flavor and experience (minus waiting in line experience).

I am being generous with my review. The sauce is okay but nothing extraordinary. The meats lack the bark and smoke rings you expect with really well done smoked meats. It is mostly cooked meats that are sauced afterwards. I have had Phils 3 times now and it is always the same. Try SlowCalBBQ truck for the ÊREAL DEAL!!

I promised after I visited this place, I would yelp them and here I am. Given that it's over 2k of reviews, I'll be brief. Service: VERY nice, despite the business, he asked me what's wrong when I stood up and I said that I wanted a booth. He helped me look, it was futile. I guess I should be grateful for a table. Food: Beefy ribs-excellent, moist and melts in your mouth. Baby back ribs-same. Fries-despite expecting something generic, it was so crispy and good. Like it was literally just fried. Onion rings-could be crisper Mac salad-I'm not a mac salad lover so don't trust my opinion in this. I didn't like it. Chicken-dry, just get the ribs. Pro: you get bang for your buck, I have so much leftovers. Con: long line apparently, however, I didn't have to wait so long. Usually, it runs around the store.

Less than 2 weeks later, a repeat visit from this West LA resident? ÊOh yeah! A group of 17 Yelpers came from Northern CA, West Los Angeles, the South Bay, and San Diego to meet for Q on this Labor Day Sunday. ÊNew friends were made, Pub Cakes were shared, and lots O Q was had! The wait was a shorter-feeling 50 minutes, and Phil's dude Steve even passed out frozen Otter Pops to the line. ÊWhich was nice, considering how HOT it was in the sun! ÊWhen he saw that our group wore our Yelpers' name tags, he made sure that a table for our group was ready once we made it through the front door. Once we got to the cashiers, Heidi expertly took our order, handed us our pager, and in 10-15-ish minutes we were bringing our trays of food to the table: Me: Beef Rib Dinner w/coleslaw and potato salad ($13.95) - 3 GIANT, saucy, beefy ribs with red potato salad and coleslaw. ÊAMAZING! ÊThe meat was charred in all the right places and perfectly fatty. ÊThese beef ribs are still my fave here! Steven L: El Toro (tri tip sammich), no bun ($6.95) and 1/2 slab Baby Back Ribs, meat only ($10.95) - talk about a meat lover's paradise! ÊA PILE of tender, smoked-pink, saucy tri tip, and a huge half slab of perfectly cooked pork ribs. ÊYUM! Dessert: Whoopie Pie ($3.00) - a giant, fat chocolate whoopie pie with marshmallow cream filling - so big, everyone at the table who had tummy space after their Q got to try a bite! ÊChocolatey and moist cakey, this was an AWESOME sweet ending to the meal! For all this food and a couple of bottomless drinks, I'd say that $42 and change was a DEAL. ÊWe've got leftovers and happily filled bellies, and awesome memories of BBQ on Labor Day! Thanks again Phil's!!!! ÊWe'll love you long time - heeeeheeee!!!

There's a few rules you must follow in order to fully experience the Phil's BBQ greatness. Never come here after 4 or suffer the long wait Always get the macaroni salad Don't come here before going to a concert and standing for 4 hours straight My first time at Phil's couldn't have been more perfect. There was no wait, ordered my food and recieved it IMMEDIATELY after.The macaroni salad is out of this world. I finished half a rack of ribs myself because it was that delicious. Unfornately suffered the repercussions/food coma afterwards though. But so worth it.

In San Diego for the weekend and Angie W places Phil's at the top of Êthe list when I suggest that the theme of the weekend is food. ÊShe warned me, "There's usually a line." ÊWe grab a couple more friends and head out. Upon pulling into the driveway, I can't help but notice one glaring factoid, Angie wasn't kidding - there was indeed a LINE! ÊIn what resembled more of a scene from Disneyland than the entrance to a culinary establishment, ÊI couldn't help but think to myself, "Really?... ÊWe're gonna wait in this?" Ê(When hungry, Angie really isn't the "waiting" type) ÊI take a look at her, see her excitement, and realize that the answer to my question is, "Yes, we're waiting." ÊWe hunker down and settle in - this is gonna take a while. We're not in line for two minutes when we're approached by Tammie, a Phil's staff member. ÊShe comes out to greet us at the back of the line and just starts... well... socializing. ÊWe ask her why she's outside, and very sure of herself, she replies, "I'm working the line". ÊNice!... They realize that the line is long, so they send people out to ease the experience. ÊThat's what I call customer service, and technically, I haven't bought anything, so I'm not even a customer yet. We explain to Tammie that half of our quartet are Phil's rookies and that this is our maiden voyage. ÊShe tells us, "Wait here, I'll be right back." ÊA couple minutes pass and she returns from the kitchen with a basket of fries and BBQ sauce. ÊAgain, attention to the details of your experience that you just can't ignore. The 1 hour and 15 minutes in line (OUCH!!!) go by as quickly as an hour and 15 minutes can, and we eventually get inside to order. ÊPersonally, I went with the full rack of Baby Back Ribs with the sweet beans and macaroni salad on the sides. The ribs were nothing short of awesome! ÊTender doesn't even begin to scratch the surface here. ÊThe tangy sauce was a perfect marriage with the smokiness of the meat, and to say that the portion was MAMMOTH would be a severe understatement. ÊThe sweetness of the beans provided a welcomed contrast to the meal, and the macaroni salad summed everything up with hints of garlic. ÊThe entire meal was an experience in itself, but the food coupled with the friendly and engaging staff made our visit memorable. Ê Unfortunately, my visits to San Diego are becoming less and less frequent, but when I do return, I have a tendency to hit up some of my old spots. ÊIt looks like I've got a new one now.

This is going to be one of those five star reviews where everything has gone right and the stars aligned perfectly. Ê Thanks to Yelp Wifey/Daughter Ciara G., who loved this place so much last time she and Lucy Y. ate here that she had to make her very own UYE. ÊLY and I made our way to Ciara's place, we piled in the Prius and headed down to SD to muscle up on some good old fashioned BBQ at Phil's. Ê We pulled into the parking lot and saw that the line had wrapped around the building. ÊJudging by the incredible smell wafting from the place, we had a pretty good idea why there was such a long wait. ÊThankfully Craig R. and his bride to be Kim had gotten there ahead of time and saved us a place, otherwise our wait would have been considerably longer. Ê As it was, even with Craig's good lookin' out for the rest of us, we waited approximately 50 minutes before we were seated, but the time did pass quickly thanks to the company which included Lucy Y, Ciara G, Craig R, Kim, Hugo C, Isabel F, and the many SD Yelpers who came to show some love. Ê Steve from Phil's BBQ came by, offered us menus, chatted us up, and, given the afternoon heat, even gave us frozen Otter Pops while we waited. ÊHow many places have you ever been to that would actually take the time for and/or care this much about customers who haven't even been seated yet? We ordered and our food was delivered fairly quickly considering the staggering amount of people being served. ÊI really appreciated the well-oiled, machine-like precision and efficiency with which the place was being run. ÊBig big ups on that. I ordered the half rack of baby back ribs with a side of tri tip. ÊThe price was right, the portions generous, and the food was OMG-esque delicious. ÊThe ribs were falling off the bone perfect, and the tri tip was sliced super thin and dressed with a generous amount of their tangy, spicy tomato-y sauce. Ê LY got the beef ribs and those were soo tender and flavorful. ÊShe also got a chocolate whoopie pie that was very good, if not a tad sweet for my liking. Ê The service at the end of the meal could not have been better. ÊWe had multiple people coming by and asking if we needed anything, taking our dirty dishes, etc. Phil's is a textbook example of how to run a successful restaurant: Êmake a top shelf product, treat people like they matter to you, and run a tight ship and the world will beat a path to your door. Ê Phil's is the new king of BBQ for me on the West Coast. Hail to the king, baby! Baby Back Ribs: Ê5/5 Stars Tri Tip: Ê5/5 Stars Beef Ribs: Ê5/5 Stars BBQ Sauce: Ê5/5 Stars (one of the best I have ever tasted) Whoopie Pie: Ê4/5 Stars Service: Ê5/5 Stars (I'd give them 6 if I could) Ambiance: Ê3/5 Stars (crowded and noisy but clean and well kept) Parking: Ê4/5 Stars (shared center parking; scarce) Value: Ê5/5 Stars Overall: Ê41 Stars / 9 = 4.55 Stars Rounded up to 5 Stars

There's a reason why pretty much EVERYONE in the San Diego area talks about this place, it is truly delicious BBQ. The Chick-less dinner with Macaroni and Potato salad is my favorite meal but everything on the menu is good. I usually come to Phil's on a completely empty stomach to make sure I have room for their huge portions but it can make the super long wait almost unbearable sometimes. With BBQ you couldn't get anywhere else and super friendly staff, Phil's is unbeatable :)

Inching their way to the 2,000 review mark I am not going to say much other than Phil's has some GOOD Q! Good enough to wait in their usual long @ss line that wraps around the building? YES! *note: I lucked out as when Lucy Y. and I arrived @ 12:30ish on a Tuesday there was only 5 people in front of us. Good enough if you are craving Q and it is early enough in the day that you would make the drive from El Lay to SD for dinner? YES! I had the half rack of Pork Ribs (6-7 bones) with a side of Cole Slaw, Sweet Baked Beans and I added a large side of Mac Salad. Ribs were charred and spiced to finger lickin-lip smackin perfection. My mouth was on fire but I like that. Great sweet sauce that was not overly thick. I am a sucker for sides at BBQ joints and all the sides were awesome. My only knock is that they did not have Sweet Tea but good ol Hi-C Fruit Punch did the trick for this BBQ meal. Who's hungry? I am! Phil's?? I'll drive! That Prius of mine gets good gas mileage.

I hate it when people hype up a place so much that my expectations are so high but when I finally try the place, it disappoints. I don't think Phil's BBQ is bad, in fact, it was really good. It just wasn't as good as the 2000+ reviewers raved, probably because I've already built up so much expectations due to their reviews. I really liked the portion size of the ribs. My friend and I shared a rack and I remember I was too full to finish the sides, but the sides were okay. The fries and potato salad were both decent, not to die for. Overall, a 3.5, and a will very likely return. But if you want to try this place, don't read too many reviews or raise your expectations too much because it'll ruin Phil's BBQ for you!

I was in SD this past weekend for a concert and had been hearing about Phil's for quite some time so decided to pop by. We timed it so we'd get there on the early side (4pmish) and had to wait about 55 minutes before we got to order. I have to admit -- this place runs like a well oiled machine! We were a little worried we wouldn't have a place to sit but they really monitor how they let you order. They also have this place really well staffed so that the tables are cleaned the minute people leave. I was impressed! My bf ordered the baby back ribs and I ordered the beef ribs. I thought my beef ribs were actually some of the best I've ever had...so incredibly juicy and tender. My bf liked his but didn't think they were the best he's ever had (not quite 5 star worthy - hence the 4 stars) but he agreed that my beef ribs were da bomb! I really wish I could give 4.5 stars cuz that's honestly what they deserve. We also shared some fries (super fresh and delish!) and also split one of their whoopie pies for dessert - YUM! All in all I'd go back to Phil's in a heartbeat... defintitely worth the wait! Also, we noticed you can phone-in your order and get it to-go which had a SIGNIFICANTLY smaller line so if you're a local and can take home I'd highly suggest you do that! ;-) Oh.. and don't forget to sign up for the mailing list cuz then they send you a birthday 'skip-the-line' email -- looking forward to that one! :-)

I would give this place 5 stars, but because there is always a long line is why I'd give 4. Phil's is for football nights in my household. I remember going to Phil's back in the day when you ordered through their shack and the line used to go around the corner, located in Mission Hills. To this day, they've lived up to their expectation and shows for it for being featured in Man vs. Food. If you haven't tried this place, you clearly must be a vegetarian!

Came here again with a big group of people, but it didn't take that long for us to make it inside the restaurant. Since it was a hot day, they even had water for people who were waiting in line. We were accommodated to sit outside in the patio area. I ordered the El Toro sandwich and it was delicious! The best tri tip sandwich that I ever had!! The tri tip is barbecued to perfection. The tri tip is smothered in bbq sauce and packed in between the buns. I do warn you that it is a messy sandwich to eat, but boy is it worth it!!!

I love the BBQ at Phil's. ÊWe are regulars.

ÊI'm not a fan of the moon pie thing. Phil's sells their seasoning and BBQ sauce. ÊWe always keep these in stock at home. The lines are always long at peak times, but it is so worth the wait.

If you ever visit San Diego, everyone who is in the "IN" wil tell you to come here! Its maybe not the best bbq you every tasted, but its probably the you'll ever taste in SD! its definitely GOOD and worth your buck. Ê The meat just falls right off the bone and the sauce... well... its really hard to describe. I would say kinda vingary with bbq zing! Lick your fingers and see what you think. ÊThe line is long, wraps around the whole place sometimes. just bring it home and watch a game! there's never a line for take-out! I usually get the tickler, its got the best of everything. your bbq ribs, coleslaw, fries, and two huge onion rings! yammy in my tammy! You best believe i eat the whole thing! ÊIts a huge portion and everything is hella good! i mean 2 of the things are fried, one is drenched in sauce and extremely tender, and coleslaw is your "salad," is good for you right?!

There's also thousands of review on this place, do I need to say more? ÊI would give it 3.5, but there's no half stars @ Yelp. ÊI am not a fan of BBQ food, but this place is good. ÊI like the spicy salt they have on the table for me to use; it went PERFECTLY with my corn. ÊI had the BBQ chicken, which was a little over sauced for me. ÊI don't eat pork, so the only other BBQ I tried was the beef rib, which is way better than any other places I had. ÊGo try it if you're in the area, but if the line is over 45 minutes wait (we waited for 40 minutes), then it's not worth it in my opinion.

First time there last night! It was SOOO GOOD! I had the ribs and chicken plate with macaroni salad and cole slaw. NOTHING tasted out of place. I ordered the cheeseburger for my kids, took a bite and was wow'd! It was so fresh! Husband ordered the El Toro. That was amazing too! So much smoky flavor! And lets not forget about the onion rings... OMG! You have to try them... CLEANLINESS ABOUNDS!! Hand sanitizer at the entrance. There are hand washing stations outside of the bathrooms! GENIUS! And the best part is there is an arm hook to open the bathroom door from the inside, so you don't germ up your hands all over again after using the "turlets"! More businesses need to incorporate that arm hook! We will be back many, many times I predict! So worth it!

Breaking news: BBQ fans, you don't need to go to the south to get your fill of good BBQ! It's right here in San Diego. Even better news: They're opening up another Phil's BBQ in San Marcos! Now, all they need to do is open one up in my kitchen... For light weight eaters like me though, the portions are pretty big, so it's good to share with another person. The baby back ribs and chickless combo meal is perfect for those who want ribs and chicken. I hear the pulled pork, Broham sandwich is pretty dang tasty as well! Here's a tip: If you're going for lunch, go EARLY. Like line up by 11:00 early. Otherwise, bring a snack to keep you from going over the edge and trying to gnaw your neighbor's arm off. For dinner, same thing. GO EARLY! Line up by 5:00! Otherwise, you're screwed... Guaranteed the line will be out the door and looped all the way around the side of the building by 6:00.

I know I'll get flamed for this. I went with a open mind since I'm not a fan of BBQ style nor ribs. Nothing spectacular, probably all hype.

I start to salivate every time I think about Phil's! The boyfriend and I ordered the full beef rib dinner (5 ribs) with a side of baked beans and potato salad. We also ordered a side of cole slaw and large onion rings. What can I say, we were eating with our eyes! The beef ribs were huge and the meat really does fall of the bone. I was full after two! Their BBQ sauce was also good. Sweet and Tangy. I enjoyed the baked beans and cole slaw, however next time I think we can do without the potato salad, it was just too heavy for the amount of food we were eating. Their onion rings on the other hand, OMG, best onion rings I've ever had! When I saw our plate come out, the onion rings were humongous, and I instantly thought it would be seeping oil once we bite into it, which wasn't the case. The onion would break clean with every bite and the batter was just crispy and non-oily. My boyfriend made the observation that the plate it was served on didn't have any remnants of oil on it. If you live in SD, I would suggest going on a weekday to avoid waiting in a line that wraps around the building. We went on a Tuesday night, the line was still out the door but it moved rather quickly. Next time I wanna try their pulled pork or tri tip sandwiches because when I saw them in passing they were overflowing with meat!

I LOVE RIBS!! I hate crowds and I'm not a fan of the location but I'll keep coming back to get my rib fix. Ê This most recent trip my sister had the El Toro and that thing was YUMMY! I ordered the baby back ribs, the sauce is flavorful and sweet with a spicy kick and not an overwhelming smokiness also very YUMMY. For bbq sauce it can be a bit on the oily side. As for the side items I'm not to well versed but this time I passed on the French fries as I remember them being kind a soggy and just OK but this time we split an order of onion rings and they were good. There the battered type not the crumby type. The line can be long but they do a good job at keeping it moving and getting your food out to you in good time.

There's a reason why this place currently has 2553 comments and STILL is 4.5 stars. ÊEveryone is going to comment on how great the food is, so let me just give you MY preference. Story time... I bring a friend who had yet to try Phil's, along with a few other friends who HAD tried Phil's. ÊThey LOVE the pork ribs (with just cause); however, the beef ribs here are AMAZING (X infinity). ÊSo when my friend asks what to get, I immediately tell him to avoid the chicken (which I consider to be kind of dry) and to get the beef ribs! ÊBut my other friends trick him into getting the pork ribs. ÊHalfway through our meal, I offer a beef rib to my friend, just because I feel bad for him. ÊAs he takes his first bite, he immediately says, "I should have got the beef ribs." Not saying that it's for everyone, but THEY ARE AMAZING!!!!!!

ÊYou think I'm crazy and maybe so...but i'm serious....it's so tender and the smokiness of the rib just knocks you out. ÊAs for the beef ribs, I tend to like my beef ribs a bit fatty so it's less chewy but it was super meaty (i'm not complaining by any means...hehe) Onion rings? ÊOrder it. ÊWhy? Êbecause i said so. ÊYou listen to the fatty and you can't go wrong. ÊIt's huge. ÊIt's juicy. ÊIt's heart attack. Ê As for the sides, i mean...i tried fries, cole slaw, beans...every single side wowed me.

I could take this restaurant or leave it. The line was out the door. Our food was pretty good, and the coleslaw was the best I've ever had.

Just because the portions are ridic...again, NOT a bad thing.....but, be prepped to EAT when you go here. From what I did try from others: -Beef ribs/brisket was super soft. -Pork ribs were the length of my forearm. -Beans were super good. -Coleslaw was pretty good, and I'm not a coleslaw person. -Sweet tea, which was supposedly good on yelp, is the kind of tea you can get at any Chevron. -Onion rings, I liked..batter was kind of sweet.

Phil's BBQ is ridiculous. My brother and I got here on a Saturday around 4:40 pm and there was already a line around the building. Seriously?? Come on, people...is there nothing else to eat in San Diego? We left and came back Sunday at 10:40 am (it opens at 11) and there was still a line, but it was much shorter (only to the "20 minute" sign). I ordered the half rack of baby back ribs, and it was pretty big...definitely enough for a full meal (half rack is $12.95 before tax and comes with 2 sides). I would have ordered a side of onion rings (not one of the sides you can get), but I wasn't really that hungry since I had eaten breakfast. The ribs were pretty tender and the sauce was very good, but my life wasn't changed or anything (a requirement if I'm going to wait in line for that long). I'll have to come back and try the onion rings some other time. Oh, and there's a separate line for take-out and the bar section...I think those lines were shorter.

I thought this was way too overhyped but after eating ribs @ stonefire grill, I finally understood that these baby back ribs are actually REALLY good. Went today after service at The Rock and the line was loooooooooong... never waited that long for Phil's before. But man, was it worth the wait. Shared a full rack with a friend, with the fries and the cole slaw. The fries are sooo delicious when they are drenched in the BBQ sauce! Also, the onion rings are so good! Better than Hodad's IMO. I personally do not like the beefy ribs and didn't really like the sandwiches (pulled pork shoulder and tri tip) that my other two friends ordered. (I tried them both). I always get the same thing! The lady working at the front was so funny and entertaining, too. I was getting a little grouchy waiting in line for that long and being in the front made it even worse. Seemed like I was sooo close but the people were taking so long to order! But yeah, she was super nice, joked around with us and even danced with one of the other workers! I'm getting hungry just writing this review. You must come here!!!

Best BBQ I've had, hands down. No where else in San Diego can you get food that simply tastes this good. I've waited in line for an hour and a half before for some ribs and I'll gladly do it again. Prices are reasonable, atmosphere and staff is top-notch, their sauce is amazing (and available at Costco), and food is incredible. I would vote that their baby back ribs and the El Toro burger are the best things on the menu (although their beefy ribs are incredibly tender). Love their corn on the cob too, and their onion rings are huge and delicious (i'm not normally a fan). There is a reason that this place was featured on Man vs. Food!

You can NEVER go wrong with Phil's BBQ! The best ribs I have ever had, thus far. The wait could be bad, but that's why you go at off times! You have to seat yourself, which could be a problem if its really busy, but I never had to wait too long to find a seat. I usually sat outside, though. I recommend the beef ribs and the baby back ribs. The portions are huge so sharing is a good idea! I don't like onion rings particularly, but the onion rings here are SOOOO good. It's so crispy and just plain awesome. The macaroni salad is really good too so I always get that as my side. Personally, I don't like the fries because every time I got it, it didn't taste fresh. It was very soft and mushy. I took my parents after my graduation and they fell in love. It's really hard to please the taste buds of Korean parents, but they approved. They are willing to make the 2 hour drive just to eat Phil's again! My dad's always asking me when we're going to go! If you are in the SD area and craving some bomb ribs (even if you aren't craving ribs), you should CHECK THIS PLACE OUT!!!!

These ribs are fantastic! but you don't need me to tell you that. Just read the thousand other reviews on them. Their macaroni salad is awesome, so is their coleslaw. I live a couple hours from San Diego, and I visit every month or so, and next time I visit, I'll be looking forward to coming here. We had to wait about 20 minutes in line, but since we were only a party of 2, we got to go ahead of the 15 other people in front of us and sit at the bar. Friendly service, SUPERB food. What more do you want?

I put the 'ass' in embarrassment. ÊI started dancing in front of the PhilCam while on the phone with my hubby: "Do you see me now?" ÊNOW, do you see me?" I kept asking as I did crazy dance moves that look like dry heaves set to music*. ÊAfter awhile, the guy herding the very long line started to join me. ÊWe looked like we were engaged. ÊI was only picking up food to go because the line snaked out the door and went on longer than I cared to wait for. Ê The bbq ribs were tender and juicy, the chicken was only eh--a little on the dry side--loved the potato salad. ÊThey sell the sauce and dry rub so I had to have me some of that too.. ÊCheap eats, great ambience and solid service from friendly staff. ÊThere's no good time to come here for short lines except if you're wanting to eat dinner at 4:30 so just come with a good attitude, hang out, do your little happy dance in front of the PhilCam.

AMAZING! The hype was all correct. Yes, there is a long wait but it's so worth it. Tried baby back ribs, macaroni salad & potato salad. The meat was so tender and delicious. I liked the macaroni salad better than potato salad, but both were great. Took 2 friends there and they loved it also. Price is good for the amount of food you get; we all had left overs. The employees are all very kind and courteous. I would definitely go back!

Definitely a must try when you're in the SD area. Ordered el toro's tri-tipped beef, beefy ribs, best of both (chicken and baby back ribs), side of fries and macaroni salad. we ordered way too much, and lets just say one plate is good for two people. I'm not much of a barbecue sauce fan, but everything was soo good. ÊThere was plenty of bbq sauce. Ê HELLA long ass wait though.. (we were really hungry). Self service type of restaurant too, order, get your stuff & eat. 4-stars (sorry, took one off for the long wait...)

What the others said about the BBQ smell when you pull right into the parking lot is the TRUTH! WOW! We had our sunroof cracked and the smell came into the car like it was nerve gas! I was literally knocked out! The line did wrap out the door and down the front on my trip. BUT there is a secret to the line...but i won't disclose that to you all. The waiter in out section was amazing...talk about 110% customer service Disneyland style! A+! The BBQ here is the sweet and tangy flavor.....personally I like the just sweet bbq sauce. The baby back's were off the hook! Soft and tender. The Mac Salad was kind of like the Hawaiian mac salads (yummy), and almost In n Out style fries. All in all a good experience!!

I came on a rainy Wednesday at 3pm and there was no line. I had the ribs and chicken combo with beans and macaroni salad. The sides were nothing special but there BBQ chicken really shined. Their ribs were good for Southern California but would just be above average anywhere else. I ordered a small order of onion rings cause they looked so good, but was not that impressed. They had a huge soda fountain section with a surprising amount of soda option for this reason. I still highly recommend this place because the BBQ is solid at a very reasonable price. I am not sure if I would wait in line if it gets as crowded as people say it can be.

I love this place! When I was in England for a year I would dream about this place and its yummy ribs!..lol My favorite is their baby back ribs they are so tender and yummy they just melt in your mouth! I love the bbq sauce to, its got some tang and spice to it which kicks up the flavor of the meat. The fries taste so fresh and are soft and fluffy and are best when you dip them in the bbq sauce. The onion rings here are amazing too! They are about the size of your hand and the batter has a good mix of flavors that go well with the ranch dipping sauce! When you come on a weekend night be prepared to wait awhile. If you don't want to wait in a long line then go to Phil's around 1pm after the lunch rush because then you get right in. Tonight the line was out the door and around the building which actually is not unusual for this place, but the line moves pretty fast and we only ended up waiting about 45 mins. The wait was well worth it!

MMMMMMMMmmmmmmMMMMMMM Phil's BBQ is seriously good food. The portions are HUGE (a single beef rib sampler for $3.95 is no small snack) and the food is delicious! The Broham Sandwiches are great, abet a bit too charred-tasting (however there is more than enough meat in them to pick around). The onion rings are gigantic, the BBQ chicken is moist, and the fries were so-so. The meat is the star of this place (and the reason you will wait in line for 45 minutes) so get the straight-up pork or beef ribs (beef are better IMO), chicken or one of the delicious sandwiches instead! Ê The drinks were good. Sangria was not the best I've had, but it's hard to complain at $5 a glass. There was a wide-variety of soft-drinks available, including fanta and crystal light. The atmosphere was one of eating - if thats even possible- everyone was just chowing down on their food. The menu is posted on every available wall, I was surprised it wasn't in the bathroom too! Service was very friendly! Lastly, I'd recommend ordering beforehand and picking up the order instead of eating on site.

It's not really a full service restaurant but the employees are friendly and helpful when you ask for extra stuff that they don't have at the condiment bar. You get your own drinks and pick up your food at the counter. Food was wonderful and definitely worth the wait. The baby back ribs were tender and savory. It makes me drool just thinking about them. Their beef ribs and bone less chicken were pretty good too. Definitly have to get their baked beans and potato salad as sides. Their bbq sauce is tangy, most likely vinegar based. Would definitely come back when I have the time. If only the wait wasn't so long.

I didn't have to wait in a long line! What's my secret? Going for an early lunch Sunday around 11am. Ordered the Full Baby Back Rib Dinner (comes with 2 sides) with fries and baked beans. Perfect for sharing between 2 people (especially for lunch!) The BBQ sauce is so good! Just a little sweet and a bit tangy. Perfect! The ribs were very good, except the last few that had bits of dryness. The fries tasted like they were cut from fresh potatoes and taste great smothered in Phil's BBQ sauce. Baked beans were equally good and completed my "dinner" for lunch.

Going to Phil's BBQ for the first time was like losing my viriginity 14 years ago...I knew it was going to be great, but I didn't know how insanely and wickedly awesome the experience would be. Like that "special solo activity" every young male does regularly before losing the Big "V" and becoming a man for the first time, eating non-Phil's ribs is 2nd class once one has had the truly orgasmic experience of eating Phil's Baby Back Ribs. Ê THE FOREPLAY: No 30-60min of kissing, feeling and caressing; but there is a 30-60min wait as you and fellow patient customers discuss BBQ and look through the windows jealously watching people slobber on delicious BBQ... THE BLITZ: You finally get to the cashier and place your order, and wait impatiently for your food to arrive, your heart races, you sweat...faster...faster!...FASTER! THE CLIMAX: That 4-5 second moment of ectasy when your brain explodes with euphoria from the first bite into Phil's Baby Back Ribs...AAAAAaaaahhhhhh....MMMMmmmm.... THE CUDDLE: After your first ravenous bites, you slow down, get into a steady tempo, relax, and calmly savor your yummy food. ÊWhen you are done, you settle into your fatty food coma...ZZZZzzzz... I'll never order ribs anywhere else...

I liked my experience here and the food part did live up to the hype. However, I'm not sure I would wait for over an hour to get food here. I think waiting that long anywhere for food is crazy. I had a total of 3 people in my party and we ordered one dinner portion of the Ribless Meat with a large side of french fries as well as a small portion of their spring mix salad with chicken. Ribless Meat: FREAKIN' DELICIOUS! So good. The sauce was just enough and tasted wonderful. Fries: yummy! Goes great with the cajun seasoning and bbq sauce. They taste natural and fresh. Salad: boring. The chicken breast that came with it was a little dry and I didn't enjoy that too much. All that was enough to feed 3 girls. We weren't super hungry, but that left us stuffed. I'd have to say that the portions are HUGE, so dinners can probably be shared between 2. My biggest gripe about this place is the ordering/food pick up/table situation. Otherwise it would've been 5 stars. I can't imagine coming here with a big party and looking for a table to sit us all. I guess this system makes turnaround time quick and would be suitable for parties of 6 or less. I'd definitely stop by again at a non peak hour just to have more of their delicious and tender bbq meats!! Yum!

ÊWhy on earth would you if you could choose a carrier with less stress and better service? ÊIt's the same with restaurants. ÊPhils = Southworst Airlines. ÊSeriously. Their policies bring out the absolute worst in humanity. ÊThere are hungry people waiting in a line, trying to jockey for position and sneak in to get tables, holding places for others who have not arrived yet (like standing in line for a Southworst flight - or in line at MacCarran to check your suitcase but everyone is pissed because they are going to miss their flight) or in this case - might not get a table - so they go to drastic measures to get help. ÊThere are intimidating stares, couples yelling at each other, children crying, for what? ÊIt's so loud and intense in there you can't even hear the cashiers mumbling "next in line" and you can't see over the masses to even see if it's your turn. I went through this hell for what? ÊSome decent pork ribs and nasty greasy beef ribs, some potato salad I could have made at home, beans that taste like they are fresh out of the B&M can, and some chicken, plus you get to sit on a hard bench with loud obnoxious people all around you. ÊReally people? ÊIs it worth it? ÊHELL NO it's not. ÊNot even a little. The prices are high, the food lousy to mediocre, and the ambience more than horrific. ÊIf they posted staff to monitor the line - one at the back and front of it, and a couple of people to usher you to seating I would think I could bear it and could bump this to about 2 or 3 stars. ÊAlas, that didn't happen and I won't be back. Ê If you're thinking - "Wow everyone talks about this place and waits in line for food so it must be good" you're wrong. ÊIt's not. ÊPeople convince themselves it's worth it because they had to wait in line to eat. ÊPlus, Americans can be dumb - give them fatty meat with a sugar glaze and you've got a hit! ÊI'm going to open a restaurant with some crappy food and design a rediculous ordering and seating system so that people will wait in line and convince themselves my establishment is worth it.

ÊWe simply sat at the bar, ordered a beer or two, ordered the baby back ribs with two side orders to share, and left within about 40 minutes. ÊThat's pretty damned awesome quick. I like Phil's.

You've heard the saying, "Procrastination is like masterbation..... it's fun until you realize you're fu**ing yourself." Well I was really screwing myself over by hesitating to get in here. On a hung over Sunday I was racking my dome for an orgazmically delicious eating experience close to home. After searching, I was shocked to see that the most reviewed place on Yelp was one that I had never been to. Feeling randy for some Q after reading the feedback, I headed out for a round of hot Phil- atio. I'm now a believer of the hype. It is about as good as the reviews say it is. The bro-ham is a delicious experience that one must certainly try if they are in the Point Loma area. Yeah, the line can be a bit unreasonably to wait through, but you really can't blame them for being busy. Good things are totally worth waiting for, but if you're the antsy type calling ahead is always an option as well. The service is really friendly, and everyone you encounter is wearing a smile with their Phil's uni. I guess it's tough to frown when you get to smell the aromas of this place all day long. Ê What more is there to really say about this San Diego classic? Over a 1,300 reviewers couldn't be wrong, so don't procrastinate like me. Get in and see for yourself how much this place rules.

There's nothing per say wrong with Phil's BBQ - I just really don't get the hype. ÊThe servings are ample, not too long of a wait even with the line, and staff is friendly. ÊBut most of the flavor and actual food comes off as plain, none of it made me want to stuff my face or say "wow" with a full mouth - an in San Diego every third place you eat at has that effect. ÊPhil's BBQ for me falls under the other two out of three.

You know the roll of paper towels they put on your table to clean yourself up? I didn't use them. I licked off all the sauce. PLEASE DO NOT USE ANY UTENSILS Leave all your etiquette and proper eating habits at the door and enjoy ribs the right way: all over your face and hands. There are sinks behind the pop-dispensing machines which are great for when you are ready to clean yourself up and step outside of Phil's just in case there's a line in the bathroom Phil makes a mean rack of ribs that are so tender and delicious.... and potato salad and macaroni salad and coleslaw and beans everything tastes as good as it looks Catering is quite organized, they equip you with all the necessary utensils and awesome trays that make it easy to feed the masses. The worst part is the long lines but after you order, pay and get seated....and wait for the pager to vibrate harmoniously to inform you that your gluttonous feast is ready, you can't help but look at the surrounding customers enjoying their ribs while you are silently clenching the pager, anxiously waiting for it to ring....it might seem like an eternity, but it isn't. Within fifteen minutes, the order is up, you pick it up at the counter and bring it back to your table and let the inner-neanderthal out and consume your food as barbaric as you can possibly be. and after you have eaten, prepare yourself for the best food coma ever.

I fell head over heels in love with Phil's about a year ago, and seriously, it was love at first bite, baby! :D Just pure L-O-V-E. I don't think I have to say much about this place since 1,000+ already said it all, with nearly a perfect 5 stars, this place is just pure heaven! Phil's is always, always, ALWAYS hella crowded with lines wrapped around the restaurant, then again, are you surprise?

Their full rack of ribs is so tender and juicy, omg, I'm talking about "fall-off-the-bone" GOODNESS (well said, Chuck F.) And omg, their ginormous onion rings, so goood. Although, I only eat the batter, because I don't like onions, haha, I know, wtf right? What a waste, but whatever, the batter is sooo tasty and crunchy, just the way I like it!

I hail from the Zion of BBQ, and I'm quite proud of that. To say that I'm a snob when it Êcomes to BBQ would be like saying Tiger Woods is a little promiscuous. Keeping that in mind, I think Phil's melted my brain with all it's insanely delicious food. The ribs were nearly fall-off-the-bone tender and saturated with the BEST (yes, seriously) BEST sauce I've had west of the Mississippi, possibly the best I've had outside of my beloved Mason-Dixon line. Cole slaw, onion rings, and fries are among the best I've had ANYWHERE as well. Speaking from extensive personal experience I can say that Phil's would hang close if not surpass many of the BBQ places in any of the many Southern Meccas of bar-be-que, even cities like Memphis and Atlanta. As far as food goes Phil's is far beyond anything I expected to find in San Diego when it comes to authentic BBQ. Impressed is an understatement. I can most certainly see where all the hype surrounding this place comes from. My only regret is that I didn't try it before now. Of course I've got to put my two cents in concerning beer fare. Phil's offers San Diego's finest on tap in the "Beer-be-que". They also offer bottles of other great San Diego breweries in the unlikely event they don't have anything you want on tap. I have two minor, minor problems: 1. No cornbread. 2. No REAL sweet tea. This doesn't change my opinion of Phil's at all. Other than that, this is as perfect BBQ as you can get in San Diego and stacks up well with anything I've had period.

With so may reviews no one will read this...I really don't care. I need to add my 2 cents. This place has simple fare. It is just simply good. Phil knows how to slow smoke Beef, Pork, and Chicken. His sides taste excellent and accompany the meals perfectly. The blues playing over the speakers just make the experience even better. I've tried almost everything on the menu. Hell even the veggie burger...which is great by the way. I'm a big guy and typically have a big appetite to match it. However, I always end up with leftovers due to the portion sizes. Phil's is just great the next day for lunch. I can't tell you if there is anything that is bad at this place. Pros: Best Bar-B-Q in San Diego, You can not miss this place if you have visitors from out of town. Order the best of both worlds (Beef ribs and chicken or Pork ribs and chicken) Mac salad + Cole slaw That is a solid 1st timers choice Cons: This place gets packed everyday. The wait on the weekend can be as long as 2 hours. Get there before or after the lunch rush and you should be okay. There are no food choices that suck here. Hope this helps the yelpers out there. Enjoy your culinary adventures, Francis

My second visit here and was disappointed the line to get in was probably double from my last visit. The disappointment was mainly because I got a good whiff of smokey deliciousness just as I opened the car door. Oh well, Êprice you pay for a popular place with good food. The line moved along at a steady pace and the wait was perfect for conversation with the group I met with and catch up on the goings-on of the day. Had a chance to learn a few things during the conversation too. I discovered that 200 bucks for True Religion jeans is a great bargain. I've not ever seen these jeans first hand so I'm assuming they are sewn with real gold thread or use platinum buttons. I've spent 200 bucks for jeans... total for the 10+ pair I own, that is. Also discovered Phil's webcam. As my FB friends can attest, my web presence is lacking, so more photos or video is great! We ordered several items so our group could share and sample. Everything was great. Crispy rings, tasty chicken, but the beef ribs... wow. Tough to share a rib so I had one all to myself. And, I'm a cave man and ate with my hands. No one had any interest in sharing once I got my mitts on it. I felt guilty for .001 seconds...Too bad... more for me!!! Juicy and flavorful. That's a must-have for my future visits.

2.5 STARS Let me put things into perspective, 4.5 star rating @ 1000 reviews?? That means this bbq must like melt in your mouth?!? You guys are taking crazy pills. It didn't and wait there's less. Actually, Phil's is ok but it feels like the McDonalds of BBQ. You order up at the counter and your food comes out in less than 5 minutes. Seriously, fast food bbq is an oxymoron. The look and atmosphere is all TGI Fridays/Bennigans with some blues music playing in the background. Gimme some more flair! Ordered up their 4 pork rib and 1/4 chicken combo platter ($12) with the mac salad and baked beans side. http://www.yelp.com/biz_É The ribs tasted like they were baked and were just OK - no pink smoke ring and no smoky flavor. The meat flavor was overpowered by the bbq sauce. The bbq sauce had a taste similar to that brand, "Bulls-eye". Unfortunately, the chicken was super dry. I took a bite or two and the rest was inedible. Might as well ate my sock. Also had a taste of their beef ribs. They had a charred flavor and were tender but weren't juicy and also overpowered by the sauce. I'd have to say pork ribs over the beef but I'd rather find a different bbq joint. http://static.px.yelp.coÉ No mac and cheese, no cornbread? Are you kidding me? C'mon even Friday's has those...

I just received the most inspiring Blackberry message (BBM) right now. Ê After months and months of convincing my dear friend Irene S. that Phil's cooks up THE BEST RIBS on this universe, she finally gave them a try, proclaimed her love for Phil's and deemed me a hero for this god-send of a recommendation over BBM, all the while leaving my mouth watering and my stomach pining for Phil's BBQ pork ribs. ÊAnd all I can do right now is Yelp about how fabulous Phil's is -- woe is me. While I loved the intimate and local hidden gem feel of Phil's old Goldfinch location, this new location is much bigger and well-staffed, meaning the service is efficient and I get to dig into my ribs much faster. ÊThis location does, however, make Phil's seem a bit commercialized, like a TGI Friday's or Chili's, but I still love it to death. The meat is guaranteed to fall off the bones and the tangy BBQ sauce is guaranteed to make you want to lick your plate clean. ÊThis is a Diane P.-approved and Irene S.-confirmed San Diego recommendation you do not want to miss out on.

I really appreciate all you people who stand in that looooong line. ÊIt makes it easier for those of us who like to call in our order on our cell phones (sometimes from the car on the way over, sometimes from the back of the line, if we need to peruse the menu). ÊOnce the order's placed we walk right up to the front and pay, and our food comes out pretty quickly. Sure, we have to enjoy our ribs and onion rings in the comfort of our own homes, with craft beers from our own refrigerators--missing out on the soothing din of college students and young families--but it's a small price to pay for streamlining what can be an arduous process. Ê Oh, and that's what you should order: Ribs and onion rings. ÊWith sides of ranch. ÊDelish. ÊAnd if you can't understand how "Rib-less Dinner" = rib meat without bones, I don't think those sweet kids behind the registers can help you.

I bookmarked Phil's BBQ a while back and couldn't wait for Comic-Con weekend to take the family there while we were in San Diego. ÊWe decided to go to dinner early and arrived at Phil's around 4:50 pm.....I'm glad we did. ÊWhen we arrived, there was nobody in line and we were able to walk right up and place an order. I ordered the Baby Back Ribs & Chick-less (boneless, skinless white meat chicken) combo with Fries and Potato Salad. ÊThe Better Half ordered a Broham (Pulled Pork) Sandwich with a side of Slaw, and the kiddo ordered a 1/2 Chicken Dinner (All White) with a side of Beans and Mac Salad. ÊBased on the recommendation of the cashier, I also ordered Onion Rings for the table. ÊI went to the bar and bought a bottle of wine for Wifey and me. While we were waiting, I noticed that the line had grew considerably since we arrived. ÊIt went out the door, down the front of the building and around the corner down the side of the building! ÊI was amazed! ÊI also couldn't wait to try what everyone was willing to wait for. Wifey & I enjoyed the wine while we waited. ÊAfter about 15 to 20 minutes our order was up. ÊI anxiously brought the food to the table and we dug in.....all I can say is that the first bite into the Baby Back Ribs was HEAVENLY! ÊWow, easily some of the best Ribs I've ever had. ÊI gave a Rib to the Better Half & Kiddo to try and she gave me a piece of the Broham. ÊThey both loved the Ribs and wished they ordered it. ÊHowever, they were very satisfied with their entrees. ÊI thought the Broham was very tasty too. ÊThe Chick-less Chicken was pretty good....but I should have ordered a full rack of Baby Backs. As far as the sides....the Potato Salad kicked ass, the Beans, Fries, and Slaw were OK....not great. ÊThe Onion Rings were very good....thick, beer-battered rings.....very delish. ÊI'm glad I ordered the bottle of Cabernet as it went well with all this meat. We finished everything! ÊAlso, we saved room for to try the dessert....Moon Pie....which is basically a soft Oreo Cookie-like concoction which is slightly larger than a hockey puck. ÊWe split one and it was awesome too! The service was also very good here. ÊWhen our food arrived an employee offered to take a picture of us and the food.....very cool. ÊHe also made recommendations on what to try next time and asked us if we were satisfied with our food. Overall, it was an awesome experience from beginning to end. Will I return? ÊDo you even need to ask!?

Many of you thought the line at businesses such as Blue Bottle Coffee, Saigon Sandwiches and Bakesale Betty were long. You should see the "super-long" line at this place. Line: Êhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_É These people are waiting for a table and many of the parties have like 2 or more people. Luckily, I was by myself and the lady, working there arranging the tables, told me that the bar was empty and I can be seated immediately. "Hey, it's not bad dining solo after all". Ê At the somewhat empty bar, I placed my order with the attentive bartender; I ordered the "Beefy Rib" meal and an iced cold glass of Budweiser. For $13.95, I get three humongous Beef Ribs and two sides, in which I took Red Potato Salad and Red Beans and Rice. The beef rib was so tender that the spicy meat falls right of the large thick bone. The Barbecue sauce was seasoned very well. My Red Potato Salad had some chunky pieces with a tangy sauce. All this meal with a refreshing iced cold glass of Bud for $4.00, makes my dinner complete. My meal: http://www.yelp.com/biz_É My beer: http://www.yelp.com/biz_É Of course at all BBQ place .i.e. Phil's, you'll get messy and need a lot of napkins. Nonetheless I also like the sink close by near the bar to wash up after your meal. Ê Credit cards are accepted, but I paid my meal with cash. This Barbecue place is one of the hottest businesses in San Diego, and a must go when you're down there.

Game Freakin' Over! Phil's is some great freakin' barbeque. ÊSeriously, this stuff is finger lickin' good. Ê Lookin' at the meat drippin' off the juicy, soft, tender ribs can drive you to insanity. ÊWhy insanity? ÊThe wait is at least 45 minutes whenever I come here! ÊDoesn't matter what time, if they are open, there's a wait. ÊI only come here when I'm starving or craving some ribs. ÊI wish I was a diligent planner and could come here an hour in advance of my planned hungriness, but that isn't happenin' anytime soon. I'm surprised that others like the new location better. ÊIt's larger and more accommodating, but loses it's charm in the process. Ê I can only give it 4.45 stars though. ÊOther than the ribs, I can't find much else to rave about. ÊEverything else on its own merit would be a 3 star affair. Bammmm Suckaaa! 50th Review.

I don't care what anybody says, Phil's is the best BBQ I've had. No I've never tried Tennessee or Texas BBQ (yet), so I can't compare. But in the San Diego area, Phil's BBQ is king. Hands down. I've pretty much had most of the items on the menu. The ribs are like dinosaur legs. They're pretty big, so be prepared. I like their sandwiches. Sometimes the ribs are too much for me, so my next go-to item is the El Toro, which is their tri-tip sandwich. The broham is tasty as well, which is their pulled pork. If you're travelling to San Diego, PLEASE take a couple hours out of your trip to visit this place. I say a couple hours, because (depending on the time of day), there's about a 30-50 min wait time. The whole Phil's experience is waiting in line tho. As much as you want to walk away and say, "Let's go eat somewhere else.", the smell of BBQ eludes your nose and you can't seem to walk away. By the time you know it, you're feasting on the most delightful of delightful BBQs in the southern california region. Trust me. You won't regret it.

It was my second visit here with Phil's. It was a late evening on a Friday and wifey was having a craving for some BBQ food! Where else should we go? We allowed our stomachs to guide us here again. For locals, the best time to come here to avoid the lines is very late. We strolled right in and anticipated on what to try this time around. I went for the pork ribs and 1/4 chicken combo with french fries and macaroni salad. Wifey went for the short ribs, but I knew she would be biting off my plate. In addition, we couldn't resist not going with the onion rings. The buttermilk here is to die for. I'd swear if I was Michael Jackson and the doctor ran out of "milk of amnesia", then allow Dr. Phil here to inject with with that buttermilk. Hmmmmmmmmm... Our service was excellent. Due to the fact there wasn't that many people around they were even super nice and answered our questions. We enjoyed the late night dinner and shared among our plates back and forth. Just about when we were finishing up, one of the managers started passing out pulled pork samples. However this wasn't no sample. It was a plate of freshly cooked pork. Hot and steamy, we elected to take it home with us. One of the employees asked if we needed TO GO containers. Please, we appreciate it. He commented that it was his idea to pass off these freebies of food since it breaks his heart on the amount of food that is wasted in the evening. The fat: To avoid the rush, come here after the rush! The skinny: Hang around in the wee hours...you may leave home with another snack!

There's only two ways to eat at Phil's: 1. Calling ahead and picking up your order to go. 2. Sitting at the bar. Our hero would rather not wait half an hour or more in line during peak times to sit down at a table and sup on the finest BBQ in San Diego. ÊIf you simply must eat in, come with no more than 1 or 2 other people and sit together at the bar. ÊYou can order food from the bartenders and enjoy some beer or sangria while waiting for your food. It's funny how the sinks near the washrooms are used more often by people trying to wash BBQ sauce from their hand than people who just went to the washroom. ÊRolls of paper towel on each table and at the bar are a godsend as well because there's no better way to eat ribs and sandwiches than with your hands. If you can avoid the horribly long line and you haven't had Phil's yet, it's a must try for BBQ in San Diego. PROS: - Pretty much the best BBQ in San Diego, with spectacular ribs and a killer pulled pork sandwich. CONS: - Lines out the wazoo. ÊDon't be a sucker waiting in line for a table here. - The sides are pretty average and there's definite room for improvement in the salads and baked potatoes.

One of my friends recommended me this place to eat at. We were heading to Sorrento Parkway to pick up some things and we decided to head to Phil's BBq and oh my freaken god the line was extremely long and i didn't want to wait. I guess i forced my myself to wait in the line and it all paid off in the end. The bbq was extremely delicious and the sides were just a bonus to the bbq. The price for ribs is a lot, but you get what you pay for and all i can say now I WANT MORE!

The obligatory review of Phil's BBQ: Phil's BBQ is simply irresistible. Since my first dining experience at Phil's BBQ's Mission Hills location, this has been one of my favorite restaurants in San Diego. For the past couple years, I have come to Phil's almost religiously. Trips to Phil's average once every two weeks or so; and at times weekly. Lines at the door around dinnertime, especially on weekends, are perhaps the longest for any restaurant in San Diego. For this reason, I usually just call in and place an order for pick up. The usual: Broham (pulled pork sandwich) with extra BBQ sauce and cole slaw on the side. The break-from-the-usual usual: Half rack of baby back ribs with extra BBQ sauce and a small order of fries. The feeling-like-a-Broham-but-also-want-fries usual (or what I like to refer to as the "Broham-asada fries"): Broham with extra BBQ sauce and cole slaw on the side and a small order of fries. Throw the buns away. Dump the pulled pork, extra BBQ sauce, and cole slaw on top of the fries. A Phil's version of carne asada fries. Delicious. Phil's menu items I avoid: Rib-less dinner: Looked like dog food, tasted far inferior to the regular baby back ribs. Ê Beefy ribs: These things are too huge for me - one of the bones looked like it could have been from a dinosaur. Slight gripe regarding beer: When this location first opened, Widmer was the hef most commonly offered. Now it is Windansea Wheat from Karl Strauss. Although the support for local brew is commendable, I prefer Widmer out of these two. Side notes: Their website features a BBQ Cam where you can see the line outside the front door in 'real-time.' This is one of the only restaurants I've seen that has a sign on the side of the building that advises of the approximate wait time at that point in the line (see photo); similar to a roller coaster line at a theme park.

This is probably the best bbq joint in California. When in San Diego I would definitely come here to check this place out. I rented a car for 5 hrs just to drive here to try it. Again, Diane P's "must" when in San Diego. Why only 4 stars? That's because I have actually had better. When you are making food for the masses it is tough to be great. It's sorta like eating at a nice wedding banquet in a very nice hotel. It's good but it's never going to be great. It's just the way it is. Don't get me wrong.......this is still a great restaurant. We ordered two full racks of baby back ribs and 1 full order of the beef ribs. Corn on the cob, macaroni salad, cole slaw, french fries, 4 drinks for a total price of 79.00. Not bad. The corn and macaroni salad were awesome. The fries were ok and the ribs were borderline being perfect. I cannot stress how important it is if you want great ribs, you have to go to reno's best of the west rib cook off on labor day at the Nugget Hotel's parking lot. Thanks for the tip Diane P.

Anyone who knows what real BBQ is will not give Phil's anything more than 1 star... If you do, you're being generous, back home Phil's is on par with Dickey's BBQ (A Cr@p BBQ chain)... Listen if you're from California, I don't blame you (Especially in San Diego, which has no good BBQ, with the exception of the few small catering companies up in North County and all those guys rock, maybe Phil's can borrow a cue), as you may not know any better (but please head to LA or NorCal for some good Q). But if you are from outside of California and hail from a BBQ state (Texas, the Carolina's, Kansas/Missouri or any where in dirty south), please do not eat here, it will only lead you to a dinner/lunch full of complaining & excessive b!tching... I've been in the BBQ business for quite some time and Phil's is terrible.

I went to Phil's a few years ago in their original Mission Hills location. I remember it being very good. I returned to Phil's in their new location last night and found them to be overpriced and overhyped. Let's talk about the good stuff first. The beef ribs are fantastic. ÊThe meet falls off the bones. And there is plenty of it. ÊI ordered a 3-rib platter and ate just one rib. ÊIf I return, I'll get the one rib teaser. (My hubby got the baby back ribs and chicken combo and was less impressed.) The soda fountain selection is fabulous. ÊSprite Zero and Fresca are always on tap. I know it seems like a minor point, but there aren't many places that serve the caffeine-free and diet soda combo, let alone two options. The onion rings are fantastic. ÊThe potato salad was good. ÊThe fries were also yummy. ÊThe whoopee pies for dessert were also good - the chocolate one tasted like a ding dong on crack. My son loved the grilled chicken. The portions on his plate were so big that he had it three nights afterward. ÊThe fact that he ate it for those three nights shows how much he enjoyed it. The new location has good parking. However... The line is always way too long. ÊForget going on a weekend. ÊForget going anytime past 4:30pm. ÊYou have to be geriatric and go at 3pm in order to avoid a 21 minute wait or longer. The food is totally overpriced. ÊThe total for three of us came to $50. Ha. ÊBBQ isn't meant to put you into chapter 11. Ê There is no kid's menu. ÊI know I sound like a total station-wagon mom, but come on - between the long lines, high prices, and lack of kids' options, there is little reason to come there with your tots. The lady that took our order was not knowledgeable of the menu items. ÊBecause of her advice, we ended up ordering a gigantic plate of extra fries for our son when, in fact, his meal did come with two sides (including fries). ÊI hate to fixate on one employee's little screw-up, but if you saw the amount of food on our table (and the ratio of fries to everything else), you would scoff. The last thing I want to say is that the sauce was not great. ÊIt was way too sweet, syrupy, and tangy - kind of like cheap sweet-n-sour sauce from a ghetto Chinese place. Ê I lived in Austin and Houston for four years, and I've been to Memphis. ÊI've had great BBQ. ÊThis just doesn't compare. My advice? Save yourself the time and the money by going to Baby Back Jack's instead. It's better food, less hassle, and cheaper. Ê(And you can actually hold a conversation with your hubby without competing with 2 billion other people in the same room and 40 large-screen TVs.)

It's about time I update and add a star for Phil's. Why? Because for some strange reason, it's addicting. Maybe it's the Sangria, or the great service at the bar. It might even be the fact that it's really three meals so I don't have to cook for two days post-visit. But whatever it is, I keep going back and I didn't think I would. Phil's I did you wrong. I'm still not going to say this is the best BBQ ever, because in my opinion, it's not. It's a pretty good option for San Diego. Plus, it's closer to my house than any of the other BBQ joints, and I love the sangria. Please don't get rid of that.

Okay, so I have been to Kansas,TN and Texas for some great BBQ but this place owns it! Who would have known that a place down on Sports Arena would have such succulent, tender, juicy BBQ? The sauce is great. I had the baby backs and a friend had the pulled pork and always fantastic. Busy - so if you are going for a quick lunch forget it. The line is all the way outside. I gave it only 4 stars cuz I was not crazy about the sides. The fries were nothing special and the beans and slaw were okay.

Grade A+ categories: * Baby back ribs - tender, delicious (but too much sauce and not the best) * Fries (In-N-Out style) * Coleslaw - fresh & crunchy just the way it should be * Reasonably priced (The two of us ate well for $25, excluding beer) Grade C categories: * Bar is separated from the dining room. You must order from two places if you want food and beer * You can order food and beer at the bar * Onion rings saturated in oil * Service - don't expect a greeting or "thank you" except from the excellent busser staff (bartenders and cashiers aren't helpful) Grade F (for failure) categories: * All white meat chicken was very dry. Be sure to have water or beer ready because you might choke on the dry chicken. Better yet, don't order it. * The wait is not worth it; come back once the crowd disperses (not worth waiting 30+ min for Phil's)

Call me crazy, but I waited almost 2 stomach-growling hours this past weekend for Phil's BBQ, and I'm already craving it again. I'm no BBQ expert but I've tried BBQ all over SoCal, and I know what I like. The 5-star rating is mainly for their heavenly fall-off-the bone baby back ribs. I have dreams about their ribs on a weekly basis. I'm a huge fan of them, and I've had it both with and without the sauce slathered. Ultimately, it's much better with the sauce on the SIDE. I think their BBQ sauce overpowers the taste of their ribs. Make no mistake, they put a LOT of it on your rack of baby back ribs. Even though I love their sauce, too much of the tangy flavor may overwhelm the meat and natural juices. With the ribs "dry," you can taste the tender meat, charred edges, and that oh-so-smoky flavor. They serve the BBQ sauce in a plastic container, so you can just dip a rib in there. It would be great if they had a squeeze bottle, for optimum BBQ squirting coverage. Of course it's not "true" Texas or Memphis BBQ -- they don't have cornbread, sausage, or brisket -- so it's really naive to even compare. In those states, BBQ is their livelihood. For hundreds of years, they breathe BBQ 24-7, all day and night. This is SoCal. Bottom line, good BBQ is hard to come by, no matter where you're located or where you're from. Combine good BBQ with friendly service and great prices, I'll keep coming back. Even if the approximate wait time is always longer than 21 minutes and 14 seconds. I can't wait until they open in San Marcos. Less time driving, and more time eating.

This was my first time trying Phil's and I had a unique, but good, experience. The talk about the lines were correct. When I arrived, the line was to the parking lot. I would highly recommend calling in your order. I called in my order. They told me to pick it up anytime I wanted to. I was perplexed so I inquired about it. Turns out they don't prepare you food until you arrive, so it's fresh right out of the batch. There was a separate line for call in orders and there was no one in that line when I arrived. I was able to go straight to the counter with no wait. I can't comment on the dine in experience as my order was to-go. But the dining area was big and loud with all the people there. I ordered the baby back ribs and chicken dinner and it was probably the best BBQ I had ordering from a restaurant. Most restaurant BBQs are dry and have no flavor. The ribs were juicy and flavorful. They gave me a chicken breast and I was afraid it would be dry as sand, but it too was juicy and not overcooked. The cooks at Phil's definitely know how to cook BBQ. If I lived in San Diego, I would be going there almost every day.

Can you give a place 6 stars? ÊI came back into town for a conference in October and on the plane ride out of town I remarked to my friend that I was sad to be leaving Phil's. ÊShe clarified, "do you mean sad to be leaving San Diego?" ÊAnd I said, "well, I guess so but mostly I'm sad that I will be so far away from Phil's BBQ." ÊI meant it. ÊShe laughed. 3 friends and I went on Saturday night to visit Phil's new stomping grounds. ÊThe new location on Sports Arena doesn't offer some of the same charm that the one on Goldfinch in Mission Hills did...but it does offer way more room for cooking staff and customers. ÊWhich all equates less waiting time!!! ÊAnd although I had waited many times before 1.5 hours for some ribs I'm happy to not have repeated that experience again. Now there is *no excuse* for San Diegans not to visit Phil's at least once a week (well, maybe those vegetarians out there but you will have to PM me so that I can more fully evaluate your claim). That night at dinner, we were served DELICIOUS B-B-Q. ÊThe four of us were able to share fall-off-the-bone-tender beef ribs, pork ribs, and grilled chicken, with large sides of onion rings and steamed veggies, and sodas all around, for under $50 and with only a 20 minute wait. I got a little teary when our food was ready. Ê My only complaint was that the large side of veggies were actually quite small. Other than that the experience was top notch. ÊWe had food to spare and I'm happy to report that Phil's beef ribs make for an excellent, next-day breakfast!

Woo hoo! As good as it gets! Honestly, this place means BUSINESS when it comes to BBQ.. you can literally see it wrapped around the building as you pull up, but don't let the daunting line scare you away. It moves by rather quick, and before you know it, you'll have BBQ heaven on a plate in front of you! I'll keep this short and simple: the 1400+ reviews with 4.5 rating is spot on. Every meat we tried was ridiculously smokey, tender, and piping hot BBQ perfection. They don't fill you up here with bread, because it's unnecessary! The sides were clearly house made, some standing out over others (ONION RINGS, potato salad, macaroni salad) and even their whoopie pies are made fresh. The pricing here is also extremely reasonable considering the amazing quality.. screw paying $25 for a full rack of mediocre ribs (ahem, Lucille's). I'd rather use the difference in price to make the drive down here for real BBQ instead. My favorites: Baby back ribs (completely falls off the bone), BEST beef ribs I've tried (extremely meaty and delicious), and pulled pork (which I'm not usually fond of but is SO good here). The chicken is also great, but the intense smokiness and flavor from the other meats kind of outshines it. My only minor complaint: they slater on the sauce like no other here, so I'd ask for light sauce next time because it's only supposed to enhance the flavor, not drown it out. Although, did I mention they have a million different drink choices for you to choose from as well?! Literally any drink you want is available here. Oh.. and the staff, despite the madhouse they work in, are EXTREMELY friendly and hospitable! They were happily offering a helping hand to anyone with a sincere smile on their face, but not to the point where it was a bother. We had a worker help pack up our leftovers and clear our plates, and you could tell he truly cared about our first time experience there.. It's rare to feel such warmth and welcomeness inside such a crowded dining environment. Since it is self seating, you don't feel compelled to tip.. but I think these guys really deserve it, so we happily tipped 20% of our check which gets split, but in all honesty, all the workers truly deserve it. Phil's is one reason why I'm sooooo glad I'm a carnivore. haha! and it's a MUST on my list any and every time I make it down to SD as it should be for you too!

hello yumlicious, its like Dave's famous bbq here in the Bay Area (which I heard was coming to San Jose soon!) There's no doubt that this place is happening, there's hardly any parking and I came during the busiest time of night (prime dinner hour) and had to wait in line outside. The line wrapped around the side of the building all the way to the back. The line moved decently but it was by no means fast. However, the end result is worth it, you walk up to a counter and order what you want. You should definitely take a good look at the menu in advance to make sure you're ready to order and know exactly what you want. The ribs are ABSOLICIOUS and a must order. Their BBQ sauce is extremely flavorful, and I love the spice! I would recommend the full rack meal if you can share it with someone because it's definitely worth it, but their chicken is also not bad and the brisket is YUM. (or maybe it wasn't brisket, I can't identify meats sometimes, I just know its downright good!) Tips for this place would be to get there early or call in to order to go. Eating in means after you order you have to try to stake a table somewhere, which can also be a pain when it is busy (and it's almost always busy).

Waiting in line for Phil's is the greatest pay off you will ever receive for waiting in a line. It is an evidence based fact that the length of time you wait in the Phil's line is directly correlated with the increase in amount of food you will order than when you first get in line. (i.e. 0 mins= "I'm gonna get the ribs"; 45 mins = "I'm gonna get the ribs AND the pork sandwich"; 1.5 hours = "I'M GETTING 1,000 RIBS.") The line length is also the determining factor for the speed of meat to face, allowing for optimal face stuffage, as needed. (i.e. 1 hour of line waiting = approx. 1,000 rpm [ribs per min]) Thus, the line wait is also equivalent to "WORTH IT." I've heard someone say that Phil's is just "ok", but I've decided that that person does not have taste buds. The pork ribs make everything in your life better, including the fact that you've just waited that long to get in. The coleslaw, Broham sandwich and onion rings are also rockin. And the staff still treats you nicely even though you turn into a carnivorous beast with sauce all over your face. What's not to love? 1,000 high fives for Phil's!

I'm clearly not going to communicate something that has not been communicated in the over 3000+ yelp reviews. Sacasm aside, apart from their inability to make brisket, this is the best BBQ in SD in my book. I'm still waiting for that day when I can get brisket, slaw and white bread. That's when Phil's earns the last star. ÊI will subsequently die of a massive coronary event.

I do my hungry hooligan dance while waiting in the massive line here. ÊIt helps me stay calm in preparation for the ultra messy, foodgasmic feast that is to come. ÊMake sure you come here with people you are comfortable with so you can act a beast with your food. 40 min later, we ordered the Beef Ribs dinner with coleslaw and fries, and the Baby Back Ribs & Chickless dinner with coleslaw and fries.

ÊBaby Back ribs - Smaller and less flavorful than the beef ribs, but still bomb dot com in my book. Ê4/5 3. ÊBoneless chicken breast pieces - Tastes just like how it sounds.

Its very tragic that so many people have not tasted real BBQ. (makes me die a little inside) Phil's is okay for the average, uninformed and certainly unenlightened BBQ eater. This place is best geared for the individual that thinks vinegar and spiced ketchup taste's great on "grilled" ribs. I suppose the sauce is the only thing dragging the ribs across the finish line for people. Ê Personally, I think Phil's is worthy of consumption as long it's processed for dog food.

Filthy Phill's BBQ...!! Have been goin to the Goldfinch location for quite sometime now...and I just had a chance to check out the new Sports Arena location..This is what I think.. The place is like quadruple the size of the previous location with tons of flat screens mounted on the walls! ÊThere's a dozen cash registers now compared to only 1 at the other location...BIG PLUS!...but even with the more registers, there still seems to be a long line that wraps itself around the building! Crazy! ÊWait time for your food is no longer 45 min to an hour..more like 20-25min..which is a huge improvement (less wait+good food=happy customers)..Finding a table can still get a little tricky even with the larger dining area and outdoor seating, but who cares.. Anyways...The ribs are still on point, especially the beef (brontosaurus size) ones...also, ya gotta have the sweet baked beans with the donut-sized onion rings..they both compliment the meat very well..I never had the chicken at either location, but thats what my wife gets most of the time and she says there the best! Ê Unlike the Goldfinch location...The Sports Arena location has a separate bar area with flat screens everywhere as well which is awesome and a great addition! Pro's: Ê- Same great taste and food selection! Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê- Great location; huge dining area Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê- A bar area to get drunk at Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê- Less wait (compared to other location) Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê Ê- More places to park Con's: Ê- Still a wait...even with more registers, but not too bad..

Phil's BBQ is BY FAR the most delicious location for BBQ! Yes the line is ridiculous and tiresome, but it is entirely worth the wait (which genuinely is not that bad). This location is amazing the line is worth the wait I repeat once more, due to the fact it they make the food taste even much better when you are feening for it. My mouth melts for the tri tip burger, so delicious! The service is fast and casual, the paper towels are plentiful, as well as the BBQ is mouthwatering and scrumptious. Each time I go down to point loma, I go back to Phil's!!

If a friend from out of town is visiting, I ALWAYS bring them to Phil's BBQ. This place is simply too awesome. If you haven't been here before, it's a must have experience! If you are new to Phil's, this is what I recommend: -Best of Both Combo - Baby Back Ribs and Chick-less. This should give you the general idea of what Phil's has to offer. The ribs are amazing - the meat comes off the bones! The sauce is alright - I've had better from Kansas City - but it does the trick. -Sides: I guess this depends on what you like. I usually like potatoes as a filler - so I recommend the fries/potato salad/etc. PROS: 1) Amazing food. 2) Smart bathroom - mostly everything is automatic. Ribs can be messy. 3) With the expansion and move to Sports Arena, they now have beer. CONS: 1) Lines - It's usually out the door, because of the design. I hope this review helps.

Phil's BBQ is spectacular whether you live in Texas, Memphis, North Carolina, Kansas City, or any other location that snobbishly puts forth the notion that BBQ is a purely regional cuisine. ÊWhile it is true that I have had better BBQ is many of the aforementioned places, I have also had plenty worse BBQ in all of those locations as well. ÊSo I'm going to give Phil's a relatively healthy 4 star rating. Ê Let's get to the important part of the review. ÊPhil's serves impressively large BBQ beef ribs. ÊWhile I will readily note that this is not a common order from me (I prefer pork ribs), I did find that the enormous ribs at Phil's were suprisingly tender and flavorful. ÊThe sides at Phil's, however, could use some work. ÊNone of our sides necessarily stood out as either good or bad, but part of that was due to our surprise at finding good BBQ close to the California beach. Ê If you are looking for something somewhat different on your next trip to San Diego, you might want to stop by this local institution that clearly has gained an appreciable amount of notoriety (970 Yelp reviews and counting!).

Definite 5 STAR! Man those ribs are delicious! ÊHands down the best ribs I've had in town....the portions are huge, it may look like just bones at first, but once you take that first bite, wow, there is plenty of meat to fill that tummy up, LOL! ÊIts more denser in good ole' flesh than you think! I brought a couple friends here and they were idiots and got burgers instead of the ribs because they had bad experiences with bad ribs here in town, so I let them try a piece and they were amazed at how it tasted and how much meat there was on the bones. Its cool how you just seat yourself and order like a fast-food place. ÊThey will give you a pager device that will flash and ring once your food is ready to go. ÊSoft drinks are also self-serve. Service here is great! ÊWe sat outside and got asked by 3 different staff people if we needed the heater turned on and if there was anything else they could provide for us. ÊThat is enough to make me come back to a place with service as good as that. ÊI left the last guy a fat tip because he was prompt in taking the plates off our tables and being super friendly. No other place in SD compares to Phil's for their ribs!

Once is too much. ÊNever again! Ê I am late in writing this review, but I guess it'll be like the titanic in ghostbusters 2 - better late than never. When I first moved to SD a few years ago, I asked where I could get some good BBQ. ÊEveryone I talked to said to go to Phil's. ÊOne day at lunch I took to trip down there and had lunch. ÊThe food was ok and I would have gone back, but what did me in was right after my meal. Ê I went to the bathroom to wash my hands as they were all sticky. ÊGetting your hands dirty is required anytime you eat BBQ. ÊSo I was at the sink washing my hands and there was an employee in there pissing at the urinal. ÊAs I was washing up, he finished up, zipped up, and walked out. ÊI stood there dumbfounded. ÊDon't we have laws that require employees to wash their hands? ÊI mean this guy just got done handling his equipment and now he is going to handle someones food. Ê I don't know,,,maybe he used a sink elsewhere because I was at the sink in the bathroom, but damn from a customers point of view, he is one sick puppie. ÊAll I can say is that I was in the bathroom for a minute tops and by the time I left he was back at the counter taking orders. Ê Not a good first impression and never again will I ever eat from Phil's.

the bbq beefy ribs are great to sink your teeth into and pull the meat off from the bone. the baby backs get charred/burned everytime i go, which leaves not that much meat that's edible. I also think the side dishes are wayy over priced and i dont like much of the choices. just go for the beefy ribs. i'd phone in an order and eat in the car if i can't wait to get home.

Totally worth the wait in line. This would be my second visit to Phil's since I moved to San Diego. My first time writing because the last time I came here was before I joined Yelp. I came for the LA/SD Yelp meet-n-greet and had a good time with my fellow Yelpers hailing from up north. The management was well accommodating to us as they're obviously well aware about what Yelp is. Phil's BBQ always seems well prepared for the onslaught of hungry patrons. Their system works well. Service: 6 stars. As for the food. Well, DELICIOUSLY. EPIC. I want some more right now... even though I was in a serious food coma for all of yesterday afternoon. Words can't correctly describe the taste bud orgasm you receive. And the portions are epic as well, hence the food coma. So, well worth the long wait. Well worth the long nap afterward. Well worth coming back for more. I think that we've also decided that Phil's is a tourist attraction. ÊIf you're visiting San Diego on vacation or whatever, COME HERE.

OMGWTFBBQ! Came here with Christine C for a late lunch after Warped Tour. It was a Tuesday afternoon so there was zero wait! =D Honestly, have never heard of Phil's BBQ until Christine C mentioned it. Looking it up on Yelp I was wowed by how many reviews this place has, it has more reviews than Porto's! I didn't double check the info and we actually went to the old location first. =( The old area seemed like a nice neighborhood, but the newer location is definitely made to handle the amount of customers this place gets. This place is all built on efficiency. Once you order they send you away with a little buzzer beepy thingy, that way you don't have to wait around for a number to be called or have someone deliver the food to you. Once you place your order and pay, you are on your own. Drinks are self served and takeout containers are stacked up to the side for you to grab. There was enough seating to go around on a weekday, noticed quite a few large parties. Though booths were supposed to be only for parties of six or more, I saw a couple sit at one. The prices were pretty average for a BBQ place. A full rack of baby back ribs was $16.95 and a baby back rib & chicken dinner was $11.95. My best of both worlds dinner was awesome, I got so much food! It comes with a quarter chicken, about 4 ribs and two sides (I choose French fries and sweet baked beans). The beans in the sweet baked beans seemed to be on the small side and mushy. It was ok. I really, really liked the fries though, natural cut and crispy it was perfect with the BBQ sauce covering the chicken and ribs. The rib meat was soft, just a little bit before the "falling off the bone" point which is good I like my meat to have some substance. The sauce is the real winner, its' slightly sweet, just the right bit tangy and only a hint of fire. When I make BBQ I tend to make my own marinade/sauce from scratch and it's Asian style. =p But if you are a true fan of Phil's BBQ you should pick up a couple bottles of their signature sauce they have on sale.

The wait sign said "Approximately 21 minutes and 14 seconds," which was an understatement. ÊWhile the line was long, the ribs were absolutely worth it. Ê Baby Back Ribs- the meat was tender, flavorful and really did fall off the bones. Ê Coleslaw- I can usually do without this side, but their coleslaw was light and complimented the BBQ sauce Macaroni salad- meh Onion rings- a little too much hype for what they were...I took a bite and was over it. Ê(Maybe because I prefer thick, crumbly battered onion rings.) Sangria- Don't waste your time with this, just order beer. While we were in line, there was a foreign couple in front of us that became restless and started to leave. ÊWe managed to convince them to stay for the ribs. ÊAfter they were done with their meal, they found us and thanked us for telling them to stay because they really enjoyed their meal! ÊSo, moral of the story: Patience is a virtue.

I am a girl who orders ribs on a first date. Phil's are the best ribs I've ever had, and I've had ribs at every restaurant I've been to that serves ribs. They are awesome. Also one time when I went there I had the BEST corn ever. But every other time the corn was normal. I like their fries too. Especially when some BBQ sauce gets on them. We would always call ahead and order, then drive and pick em up. Once I ate there and I thought the place was really cute. It's a house converted into a restaurant, so you can sit in the den, the living room, etc. Very interesting. When I go to SD this is one of the two places I always go.

What is a BBQ joint without its sauce (or, in some cases, its rub)? Phil's sauce is indeed red and looks/tastes/has the consistency of cheapo Chinese sweet 'n' sour sauce. Where's the molasses?! If I took my friends from Memphis to Phil's they'd laugh in my face. We had the BBQ chicken (nothing spectacular), beef ribs (disappointingly dry), and a few sides, which were okay (baked beans were as bland as the sauce, fries were decent, coleslaw was all right). We sat in the bar and the service was good, as were the prices on the beer. Bottom Line: If you've eaten BBQ *anywhere* else, prepare to be disappointed -- especially if you're caught waiting in the incredibly long lines.

Phil's is downright mind-blowing! Yes, there's gonna be a long ass line, but damn it, the food is sooo worth the wait! After waiting in the Disneyland style line for an hour and a half, we finally made it to the counter. I got an order of the best of both worlds with 3-4 baby back ribs and BBQ chicken, while Hugo C. had a full rack of baby back ribs; we also had a side of corn on the cob and a small order of colossal onion rings. It took a while for our food to be ready, but we passed the time looking at the poor suckers still waiting in line. When we got our food, we couldn't wait to chow down. My ribs were fantastic! They literally fell off the bone, my chicken was juicy and tender. And OMG the onion rings were fantastic! Crispy and true to there name, colossal. The corn on the cob was okay, not great but not bad either. Besides the amazing food, what will bring me back to Phil's it's the ambiance. Think along the lines of southern hospitality, the employees are friendly and ready to help when necessary. For all the traffic this place gets, the restaurant is fairly clean. Plus they have service staff constantly wiping down tables and cleaning the floors. If you're in San Diego, stop by Phil's!

I'd definitely come again. Funnily, the girls and I were chatting about how many stars we'd give it as we were eating the food. Our ratings varied... but i give it a solid 4. The chicken was dry (although my friend's portion was incredibly moist) and I'd give it a 3, while the baby back ribs were excellent and worthy of a 5 star rating. I'd recommend a rack of ribs with a side of cole slaw and fries if you're wondering what to order. The waiters were great, good service all around.

Good Lord! It was barely 5PM and the line already wrapped the restaurant and down the parking lot! Don't let that massive line dissuade you from giving Phil's BBQ a try. I almost did but I'm happy my friends took the initiative to come up with a backup plan. Although they say the line wait is only about 20 minutes we really didn't want to keep ourselves from 20 minutes of misery so we decided to get our food to-go. I got the baby back ribs and chicken with a corn on the cob. If you don't like your food swimming in a sea of sauce then ask for the bbq sauce on the side. The meat had that smoked bbq taste and everything literally fell right off the bones. Prices are great especially for what you're getting. Everyone on staff is surprisingly hospitable and friendly. I don't know how they do it. I'd be strangling someone if I were in any of their shoes. If you're leaning towards ordering to-go, go inside and steer to the line on the left. They spit out orders really fast. Definitely worth a visit if you're ever in the area!

Phil's is without a doubt the best rib joint in San Diego, period. ÊGreat sauce, great service, great food... ÊEverything there is done well. ÊAfter Phil's, all other's truly pale in comparison. Ê I've had the baby backs, the beef ribs and the chicken which were all excellent, but my favorite is the El Toro tri tip sandwich. ÊAn enormous El Toro with a side of extra sauce, an order of their bomb ass onion rings with ranch dressing and a Yellow Tail Pale Ale makes Beau a happy boy indeed! Ê Nothing more need be said about the great food here... ÊJust go and if you have a BBQ loving bone in your body you will be completely satisfied and then some. Ê Of course you will get those nay sayers who complain with all the "Oh I've had better in Kansas City," "There's this better place in Austin" or some such bullshit, but I would venture to say this is the best rib place you will find in Southern California. Ê Phil, you are my hero but I blame you for the extra weight I'm trying to lose you bastard!

Sorry but this place may be the most over rated place in all of San Diego if not California. I have competed in bbq competitions and have eaten at all of the great bbq spots such as Memphis, NC, Texas, and KC. This place would not last Ê2 weeks in business in any of those places. Anyone that knows what real bbq is would not be impressed at all. You could learn how to cook your own bbq in your backyard with a little training way better than Phil's or any other bbq place in San Diego. I think it is a joke that there are no good bbq places at all in San Diego which is the 8th largest city in the US!

Came here on a weekend with some Phil's BBQ "virgins". HA! Given its popularity, we decided to come here right when they open to avoid the long wait times. Gladly, it worked!!! Our party waited about 10 mins before reaching the head of the line. The hostess in the front was super friendly and mentioned the opening of the new San Marcos location. I was real excited as this would only be a 5 min drive for me! WHO HOO!!! Christopher C. and I ordered the BBQ pulled pork sandwich and the half rack baby back ribs with a large fries. I have to say, the pulled sandwich was good, but had a smokey flavor to it (which I didn't care for). The BBR were devoured. The meat was real tender and came right off the bone. Annalee S. ordered the quarter BBQ BBR, and Art C. and Gina J. ordered the the BBR and Chicken. Needless to say the "virgins" are now "de-virginized", and we were in BBQ heaven. I ended up getting a 2pk of BBQ sauce for $12. NUM, NUM, NUM...

This place is amazing. Anyone rating this place less than 5 stars is crazy. BBQ pork and beef ribs are always cooked perfectly and fall completely off the bone. Their sandwiches are delicious, and the rolls they come on are very good. All of the sides are very good as well. I definitely recommend the baby back ribs and chicken dinner. It comes with more than enough food for a very good price. I have eaten at Phil's BBQ several times and it has never failed to disappoint. The food and service are A+. The only bad thing about Phil's are the long lines, but it is worth the wait. ÊThere is even a camera online where you can check the line. If you are in San Diego or San Marcos and want some great BBQ then this is the place.

What? I haven't written a review for Phils? No way! I've been coming to Phil's BBQ since their previous location! Can you believe I had to beg my boyfriend at the time to come with me? Oh did he regret ever saying he didn't want to go. I've been to the Sports Arena location since it opened. The Line: Yes at times it can be massive but it's so worth it! Make sure you don't come here too hungry because I don't want to see you drooling while I'm next to you in line for an hour and a half. The Food Oh now this is finger licking goodness! Baby Back Pork Ribs are fantastic. The meat slides off the bone so clean. The meat is so tender. The BBQ sauce so tangy I love to spread it over my fries. Yum! Drool!

GOOD CALL! It was up to me to pick the nomming spots on a trip to SD with a couple of friends. The first placed I check was my bookmarks and Phil's was the only place that I had listed (not sure how I found out about it). By the time we got to Phil's we were hungry from the drive from L.A. But I was scared when I saw that long line outside, but not to worry, they had a sign up that said the wait was like 21 mins. The staff is super friendly. From the guy that walks through the line chatting it up, handing out menus and making suggestions to the lady directing traffic at the front. Ê The four of us coordinated our orders, with everyone opting for an entre we had... 2 orders of pork full rack with large sides (one macaroni and one fry), 1 order of beef ribs and 1 pulled pork sandwich (The Broham), and four sodas. ÊIt was more than enough for three guys and a girl. In fact, we probably could have cut out one of the full racks and went with a half or nothing . Our orders came up quick and we had already prepped ourselves with bibs, paper towels in the lap, etc. Digging in was like a kid on Christmas morning (at least that's how I felt). ÊIt is now my favorite rib joint in California. I didn't care much for the beef ribs. The pork ribs were excellent. I liked the bit of heat they put in the sauce. ÊFries were typical, but good and macaroni was great. ÊPulled pork was good as well. Our total, including tax, was $76.41.

SOOO freakin' tasty! ÊMy brother took me to this place because he said it was one of the best bbq places he's ever tasted! ÊWe waited in line for about 1 hour and we finally approached the front. ÊWhat stood out here the most at this place was their customer service. ÊThe cashier, host, and bus boys were super friendly and attentive! ÊI really didn't think I would receive that kind of service at a place like this. Ê My brother and I split the full rack of baby rack ribs with two sides (18.95). ÊWe ordered coleslaw and french fries as our sides. ÊThe meat slid right of the bone and it was nice and crispy on the outside. Êmmm delish! ÊThe coleslaw was also tasty..not too mayonnaise-y like some places. ÊEveryone needs to come here if they're headed to San Diego. =)

Phil's BBQ is hands down, the best BBQ in San Diego and perhaps all of Southern California. ÊOnce you have tried it, just the thought of it will make your mouth water. ÊLocated on Goldfinch in the outskirts of Mission Hills, it is not too far from downtown, relatively easy to reach from the 5 Freeway, and parking can be found on the street or in the paid lot. ÊThis restaurant is an absolute MUST visit for natives and visitors, a great casual date spot, and even a good night out for a family; kids will love eating with their fingers and licking all the BBQ sauce off. ÊThe menu consists of variations of a Rib and/or Chicken BBQ dinner, which come with your choice of sides including Fries, Baked Beans, Coleslaw, and Corn. Ê When it comes to pricing, this is the perfect place for a cheap date. ÊYou could easily share a Full Rib Dinner complete with 2 sides for under $20. ÊAfter picking up your food from the counter, you find a spot in one of the many booths equipped with a plentiful amount of paper towels . ÊAn added bonus: if your date is boring you, you can zone out to one of the several TV screens, which usually play The Simpsons, Family Guy, or sports. HOW TO ORDER LIKE A REGULAR: One of the most important things to remember about Phil's, is that the line to order is out the door every night except Monday (the only day they are closed). ÊHaving said that, there are a few things that regulars know that will make your experience more enjoyable: 1. Phone in your order. ÊGrab a menu, walk away and phone it in with your cell phone. ÊThen, go for a walk, maybe schedule to pick it up after a movie, etc. ÊWhen you go to pick it up, you skip over that HUGE line out the door and your food is hot and waiting for you. ÊOnce you have picked it up, you can still go back and find a seat or maybe take it somewhere else to enjoy. 2. Don't complain. ÊIt is possible (crazy, but still possible) that you might not like the BBQ sauce. ÊIf you complain to him, much like the soup nazi, he will simply take it away. ÊHowever, if your order is wrong, the staff is more than happy to correct it if you ask nicely. 3. Order the fries in a separate box. ÊTheir fries are really good, but if you don't specially order them that way, the ribs are dumped on them and they are drenched in the sauce. ÊSome people prefer it that way, but I enjoy them plain. Ê Regardless of whether you adhere to these rules or not, Phil's is a restaurant you are sure to enjoy, especially in these hot summer months.

My first experience here in all the years of living in San Diego, only to find out about this place from a friend from San Jose (Thanks, Carmen!). ÊGo figure?! What a coincidence that one of of good friends wanted to celebrate his birthday @ this place. ÊFor those that came out to enjoy the festivities... ÊLet's say it together, "Hooray for Ray, Happy Birthday!" Ê After reading all your praises & accolades, I was really looking forward to come... ÊAnd they did not disappoint =) The Parking: ÊGood luck =( The Restaurant No reservations. ÊThis place was too crowded (wrapped around the restaurant) for my taste but very understandable (a victim of it's popularity). The Staff Very friendly and accommodating. ÊThe waiter asked since we had a relatively large group, she asked that I reserve the table and we rotated when ordering our food. ÊGreat recommendation =) The Food An abundance of riches for the carnivore. ÊStarter: ÊA generous portion of Onion Rings (tasty and crunchy but yet soft in the middle). ÊEntree: ÊI went for the their most popular dish. ÊFull Rack of (pork) Ribs: Slow cooked "fall-off-the-bone" goodness. ÊThe sauce had a fantastic blend of sweet molasses & peppery spices. ÊSides: ÊBaked beans and Corn on the Cobb. ÊOh so good, I ended up ordered two =) Ê My 'final' thoughts after eating my ginormous meal... Ê"Oink-oink, says the pig!" The overall experience: ÊLoud & crowded. ÊToo much food for what we ordered. ÊExtremely full & content customers. ÊThe way a night with 'great' friends should be... ÊThank you, Phil's BBQ you've got another satisfied fan in me. ÊI'll be back...

Even after reading 35 extremely favorable reviews, I was still skeptical about this place. Hubby wanted to try it so I complied. I'm not a big BBQ kinda person so I thought, okay, we'll eat here, maybe treat it like an appetizer and then perhaps go down the road to the Japanese place I saw when driving to Phil's and get a bowl of udon or something. So we get to the counter (it was surprisingly uncrowded as I thought we'd have to wait forever), I ordered very conservatively: a half slab of ribs with 2 sides and 1/4 chicken only. I figured if we didn't like it then there wouldn't have THAT much to eat and if we did, then we could always get more. We waited about 15 mins for the food. It was late... we got off to a late start so it was around 8.45pm by the time we got our food. The crowds had started to flow in and soon the place was bustling. The beeper they gave me buzzed and I quickly got up to grab our food. I brought it back to the table (everything packaged as if 'to go'), ripped it open and gave lil guy a rib. I was afraid he might not like it, but I prayed for the best. He took one bite and he declared "YUMMY". A sigh of relief. I thought, this is a good sign. Then, hubby and I dug in and to my surprise, it was really good. I added some Frank's hot sauce to my portion and it was just outta this world. The coleslaw side was also fantastic. I'm a huge coleslaw snob and this has gotta be some of THE best coleslaw I'd ever tasted. Hubby got the potato salad (again I'm not a potato type of person esp not potato salad) but these were also awesome!! Lil guy ate most of our ribs while hubby and I shared the 1/4 chicken. What totally impressed me was the fact that Phil himself came out and greeted his customers and chatted with them. What a guy!!! I'm a total convert now that I've had a taste of Phil's! I now like BBQ a lot!!

I came back here for a late night dinner and it was perfect! ÊI think this is the best time to go (around 9:45) since there were only two other people in line before us and there was immediate seating available. For two ticklers and two drinks for less than $20 bucks, I'll forever be a fan of Phil's. ÊIt also took ten minutes for our food to come out...it doesn't get any better than that!!

OK I had NO Idea what we were getting into when I decided to come to this place. I was in SD for a Seminar which I will be attending 3 more times this year and I vaguly remember hearing about "some BQQ place" so I searched BQQ near out hotel. Notice lots of reviews and didn't even read them just said lets go there. Arrive at the restaurant and there is a line with over 100 people out the door. A sign that states 20 minute wait from the corner made me think we were at Disney or Magic Mountain. I was a little apprehansive after this large display of Hype and lines. After 50 mins of wait we got in and ordered. We had large order of beef ribs, full rack of baby back ribs, onion rings, half a chicken, baked potato, Êpotato salad, mac salad, and a pulled pork sandwich. Not one thing was bad!!!! To top it off they had Stone Smoked Porter which is my favorite new SD discovery for beers. Perfect for BBQ or chocolate and so I had to get a whoopie pie to go along with a botttle of that excellent sauce. Ê Believe me this place is totally worth the HYPE!!!!Heidi and Steve both rocked it with customer service. I mean usually at a place of this magnitude the service is hit or miss but we got all HITS on service that night. I expect to be back next trip to SD!!!!

Well, it's not like Phil's REALLY needs another review, but what the hell... When I worked across the plaza at Cafe India, the smell from Phil's always found it's way into our restaurant. ÊBy the time Phil's came into the neighborhood I was a little over Indian, so the smell was welcome and at the same time torture while I was working! Ê I didn't give into the hype until after the first month or two. ÊI couldn't understand the appeal and why there were infinite lines out the door (affecting the lack of tables I got!). ÊI also didn't want to betray the owner's of my restaurant... I finally gave into the smell, and didn't even have to wait in line! ÊI ordered (and have ordered every time I've been back) the "rib tickler". ÊIt comes with 3 or so giant ribs, coleslaw, fries and few huge onion rings for only around $7. ÊVery filling! ÊThey have great barbecue, but I still can't comprehend waiting in line for it...

The best place to eat in San Diego, hands down! ÊIt helps that BBQ is not on my typical list of places to eat for dinner, so it is always a good change from the norm. ÊBut Phil's is always our place to go in SD, and just on my last visit it was where I went within the first hour of my arrival! The sauce is what makes this place so well known, but also the fact that its smoked old school style and the meat is so tender it just falls off the bones. ÊI don't like the chicken as much, you have to go for the baby back pork ribs! And get some fries on the side to sop up the sauce, so good! ÊThe mac salad is also pretty popular. Ê In all amazing food, great service, and friendly people. ÊThere is usually about a 30-45 min wait, but even if you have a large crowd they will find seating for you and accommodate you, usually by the time you've ordered! ÊA place where you will get down and dirty, but won't mind it all!

Have you ever tasted something SO GOOD, you FORCED a burp just to TASTE it AGAIN? Ê...Yup. ÊThat's Phil's. Friend #1 [Male]: "Anyone wanna go half on a full slab w/ me? ÊI don't think I have the stomach to eat it all..." Friend #2 [Male]: "Nah, man - I'm getting a full slab... just order more and save it for later..." Friend #3 [Male]: "Doode, you're going to want to get as much as you can, seriously... It's DAMNED good..." Friend #1 [Male]:"I dunno man... how much are you eating?" Friend #3 [Male]: "Full beef slab o' ribs...! ÊJust share with one of the girls, they don't eat as much..." Friend #1 [Male]: "Sharon, wanna half one w/ me?" Me: [hesitates] "Ummmm... why don't you half w/ ur gf?" Friend #1 [Male]: "She is getting her own and doesn't want to share with me..." Me: "I hate to tell you this, but I was gunning to get the full slab baby back rib dinner w/ two sides..." All guys: "DAAAAAAAMMMMNNNN! ÊShe put YOU to SHAME!" Friend #1 [Male]: "Are you SERIOUS?!" Me: "Sorry, buddy... I'm hungry..." We got to our tables and everyone dug in. ÊI caught "Friend #1" glancing up from his 5 bone portion to see if I would actually finish the baby back ribs... I figured I'd eat as much as I could [to add salt to his wounds] and save the rest for drunk food later - but by the time I noticed I was getting full, I was already 3/4 done with the damned meal, so I finished up the rest of it, and sat back with a smug arrogant smile on my face as I rubbed my fat belly... I ordered the baby back full slab dinner with fries and macaroni salad... The ribs were cooked to tender perfection, and it makes me ache to have one here in the bay area. ÊWe did several things over this past weekend - but as interesting as it all was - the BBQ was the HIGHLIGHT of my trip... [food excites me]. Ê Service here was fantastic. ÊWe received our food no less than 5 minutes after we ordered, and that's UNHEARD of from where I am from. ÊServers were always checking in on you to help assist you with wet nap refills, utensils, and to clear away the loads of empty plates that accumulate. ÊThey're nice enough to change the channel if you request a sporting event, however they cannot do wrestling or fights... [bummer.] ÊHell, the BBQ is so damned good, that downer still couldn't drag my score for this place down. The bf and I love BBQ, and we go as often as we can... this place reigns supreme of the few places we've been, and I think it's going to be hard to beat... Seriously, $18.99 for a full slab of baby back ribs - that's unbelievable because I'm used to paying $25-30 - so you locals shouldn't even gripe about the price. ÊIf the bay area can match this, let me know the name of the place, and I'm GAME. Ê=D This place was HUGE - and the line extended through the width of the store, and out the front entrance - only to wrap around the side of the building and extend all the way down to the other end of the restaurant. ÊYup. ÊI was pissed at first, but after assurances that the line would move quickly, I patiently sucked it up to see we were seated within half an hour. Ê[That's an amazing turn around when standing in a line of 50 people for BBQ...with a party of 10.] - and every bit of agonizing pain from not eating lunch before dinner was worth the damned wait, because I was able to stuff every morsel of goodness into my mouth while it was still hot.

A couple weeks ago, I went to check out Gorilla's Barbeque up in the Bay area. ÊRumor had it that it was the NorCal version of Ê'Phil's BBQ.' ÊNaturally, I had to give both a try to see who wins in the bbq battle. As we neared the end of our daycation, the fella and I decided to go to Phil's for dinner. ÊBeing that it was a Tuesday, we didn't think that the line would be that bad. ÊWRONG!! ÊAs I drove into the parking lot, our jaws dropped at the sight of the long line. ÊImmediately, my counterpart said, "Well, I guess we won't be trying Phil's tonight!" ÊWRONG again! ÊI'm not the most patient person, but if I'm promised delicious food, then I'd waiver that impatience. Ê After approximately 35 minutes, we finally got to the counter. ÊPhil's is quite efficient with their service: you place an order at the counter, take your buzzer, find a table, and wait to pick up your food. ÊThis way, there's no waiting for a server nor a table! About 10-15 minutes later, my buzzer buzzed away. ÊWe grinned from cheek to cheek at the beautiful sight of a pulled pork sandwich, cole slaw, baby back ribs, fries, and sweet baked beans. ÊThe baby back ribs were AMAZING! ÊWith a little flick of the fork, the meat literally slid off the bone. ÊMoist, flavorful, and finger lickin' good! ÊI especially enjoyed the cole slaw! ÊCrunchy, slightly sweet and tangy, and very fresh. ÊIt almost reminds me of the traditional cole slaw from KFC, just not as watery. So, after a taste bud duke out between Gorilla and Phil's, I'd have to declare Phil's as the BBQ champ! ÊMeat that literally slides off baby back ribs deserve 5 stars all on its own!

ABSOFANTASTILUTELY DELICIOUS! baby back ribs FOSHO. Whichever one of my friends who told me Phil's BBQ was overrated, we're no longer friends. BEST baby back ribs I've had for awhile that's better than Lucille's. I like the fact that you wait in line for max of 20 minutes, order your food which has individual portions (half baby back ribs with 2 sides), find seats which are pretty easy, and then your order arrives within 5 minutes for you to pick up. I'd frequent this place absolutely, which is completely efficient with its dining structure. Wish I could take some to go before I leave!

Went to Phils tonight because anytime we are over off Sports Arena we can smell the wonderful BBQ aromas and had yet to try it. I certainly have NO clue what everyone is raving about. Had the pulled pork sammy and it was nothing to write home about at all. The quality of the meat is nice but the 'sauce' is really gross. Its more like BBQ grease because for some reason it is transparent. Oh and not to mention how artificial it tastes. Total liquid smoke overload in there. Wasted my carb/fat count for the next week on nasty sauce and an overly sloppy soggy sandwich and am in need of BBQ redemption ASAP.

Great onion rings, but I will never be able to eat BBQ again- not after eating at Phil's. My friend and I got takeout for dinner on the 9th and I was sick with food poisoning until the 12th. I have never been so violently ill. I know it was their pork ribs because I hadn't eaten since breakfast and my friend ate everything that I ate, except instead of pork ribs he had beef. It makes perfect sense after reading other reviewers' stories of experiencing food poisoning or witnessing employees failing to wash their hands after using the restrooms. Note: If you write a negative review, be prepared for the owner to message you- another Yelper mentioned this, too. He'll probably offer you a refund. I hardly think $40 makes up for losing 3 days of my vacation.

Took my Family to Sea World and after a day of crappy theme park food, we yelped a restaurant with high ratings for dinner. It lived up to our expectations! The line was quite long to wait in which was the only downside, but they were very efficiant at making sure it kept moving at a good pace and even offered a beer stand and heaters outside. When we got our food it was easy to see why everyone wanted to come here! The food was fantastic. Hands down the best coleslaw I've ever had and I'm really picky with coleslaw. I ordered a BBQ Chicken sandwich. The sandwich was huge. My husband ordered the ribs and was equally as happy. I wish we could bring Phils back to San Jose with us!

4 star food, 3 star setup and service. I can't stand find your own seating places and this whole pick-up-your-own-food at the counter; yet, I still have to give it 4 stars...why, because somehow it just works. This method keeps cost low and turns tables quickly. I will argue and complain, but at the end of the day everyone just wants to enjoy some good BBQ. The meat is tender fall off the bone tender and the sauce is so freaking good...how good? Its just perfection, I can't say anything more. The sauce is sweet with a hint of vinegar and certain french fries are lucky enough to bath in glory of the BBQ sauce smothered rib. The french fries are good, but are freaking amazing with the BBQ sauce. The only question you have to ask yourself is, when do you switch between Ribs and the groovy sides you ordered? I just don't know.

Best BBQ ever!! Thanks to Man Vs Food. At the end, man won =P I've been wanting to try this place for the longest! Heard so much about this place and we finally came here this past Saturday after a day at the Zoo. We got here at about 730-8PM w/ a group of 15 people. The line was ridiculous! We considered leaving but decided to stay and good thing we did!! I think we probably waited for about an hour and a half..yikes Good thing one of the worker walked by and offered us to try the fries =) yummmmo We ordered the bbq broham, el toro, baby back ribs, onion rings, and fries. All were good! The baby back ribs were the bomb! The meat comes right off the bone..delicious. I liked the bbq broham (pulled pork) better than the el tore (tri tip). The bbq broham comes w/ cole slaw so put that into the sandwich and it's perfect! The meat on the bro ham was tender and not too overpowering and the cole slaw was just right. The el toro was good but I think it had too much bbq sauce so it was a bit overdoing it with the bbq sauce. The onion rings and fries were delicious too. I really don't have anything bad to say about the food cause it was all good. The long wait is really worth it! Must try! We will be stopping by again Êevery time we're in SD ;)

Wow, I can see by reading a good amount of the reviews that I'm not gonna fit in on this one, but here goes: Phil's is overrated and average at best. ÊI'm giving it one star because I had expectations, and they came crashing to the ground in a ball of bland flames known as the BBQ sandwich at this place. ÊI used to live around the corner, and I can smell hickory burnin' from a mile away, so I walked over to Phil's, sat down, ordered a sandwich, and started reading to kill the time. ÊAfter a while my sandwich arrived. And I nearly gagged as I noticed that the bun upon which my sandwhich came Êwas whole wheat. ÊI can't really say much more, I managed to choke it down. ÊIt was nothing special. ÊNot awful, not great. ÊAverage. ÊWhatever. ÊI was just crushed from the start. ÊYou don't give someone a sandwich you're calling a "barbecue sandwich" and have it delivered on a whole wheat bun. ÊYou just don't. ÊI know this is Southern California, but that's just wrong. ÊWonderbread bun. ÊButtered Texas Toast. ÊThose are the only acceptable options. Ê The ribs, never had 'em. ÊWon't spring for 'em. ÊThe burger, not half bad at all. ÊCame back a few times for the burger. ÊBut for a sandwich, I'd rather go to that place up in Encinitas, Big Jim's I think. ÊHalf the hype, a third the price, and just as good. ÊO yah, and none of the crushing disappointment.

Wow! What a huge disappointment! Everyone I know that has eaten here says the bbq is the best they've ever had. ÊWell apparently people in san diego don't know their f@#king BBQ! Having had great bbq from here to kansas and being a self proclaimed baby back rib queen I went into Phil's with low expectaions, ony to be proven right! ÊThe sauce they use is way to vinegary, ribs were under seasoned and although they were tender they did not fall of the bone! ÊI would love to meet this Phil person in charge and challenge him to Baby Back Rib Throwdown!!!!! Ê Ê P.S. Bbq sauce does NOT belong on tri-tip!

I wish someone told me these few things when I was standing more than an hour in line! (1) The minute you reach the patio portion of the restaurant, YOU CAN DRINK. Grab a beer, get a little wasted, makes standing in line THAT MUCH BETTER! (2) Have a party of less than 4 people? GO TO THE BAR! I FUCKING DID NOT KNOW YOU COULD ORDER FROM THE BAR! You can skip the whole line and park your keester there and eat! Why I always decide to eat here on a Sunday, I will never figure out but if I knew these things first it would make my waiting time that much more enjoyable!

Most places that get a high rating will raise my expectations, and I'm usually a little disappointed afterwards. ÊNot so with Phil's. ÊWe were lucky to beat the crowd, so we walked straight up to the counter. ÊThe woman behind the register was EXTREMELY helpful and friendly to us noobs. ÊShe explained everything and made a lot of recommendations. The chicken and ribs were very good. ÊTender, juicy, flavorful. ÊThe sauce had a great smoky flavor without being overpowering. ÊNot sure why other reviewers are complaining about the sides, as I thought they were pretty good too - although I was enjoying the ribs and chicken a lot more than the fries and corn. ÊRestaurant was clean, as were the bathrooms. ÊPrices were a little on the high side in my opinion, but I will pay money for good food every time vs. saving some money to eat mediocre food.

Phil's is kind of played out. Yea its good, not great. The line is long, but usually moves quick. Service is friendly and runs with east coast efficiency but quality has slid a little each time I've returned. Still a huge fan of the paper towel roll at the tables. That is key. I'll be back, just with less enthusiasm this time.

Phil's B-B-Q is D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S!! Wait time is not long at all (compared to another BBQ place...let's say Lucille's) even thoe it was Sunday at dinner time. Come in, place your order at the counter, grab a pager, find a seat. Food was ready fast. Right after I grabbed my drink, my pager went off already. They don't offer a huge selection of meat menu items, but what they lack in variety they hugely Êmake up for in taste! The main items are ribs (pork and beef) and BBQ chicken. The pork ribs were "OMG-fall-off-the-bone-goodness". Covered in a not too sweet yet savory sauce. The chicken was tender and flavorful with a hint of smokiness. Their side dishes were a knock out too! Onion rings were awesome, Ginormous and perfectly golden fried with a side of ranch. I really like the potato salad too with the red potatoes and dill. Baked beans were good. Not too crazy about their fries. Staff was super nice and genuinely friendly. Just they way a dining experience should be. I look foward to visiting sometime again!

My SD friends spoke of this place a couple of times. So finally when I came down to visit em, we hit this place up and I'm glad I did. This place transforms you to a western feel. I felt like such badass cowgirl. My friend and I shared a half rack of ribs and we were both left satisfied. They also give a side of mashed potatoes with bacon bits along with french fries. Their side dishes weren't that great but mainly, the ribs were amazing! Their ribs are AMAZING!! It really does just fall off the bone and it's not just the barbecue sauce you taste. Most places, the barbecue taste dominates the taste of the baby back ribs which is not good quality in my opinion. You can definitely tell they marinate their meats and boy are they yummy. Bathroom: 3/5 Meh.

Seeing the long line outside was a bit reassuring, but almost turned me away. Almost, because who wants to wait in line forever when you're hungry? But I am glad that I stuck it out. Despite its length, the wait wasn't even bad at all. This place was not what I expected at all. I didn't expect to go up to pay and pick up my order, but I can see how that makes things so much faster. People are in and out of there with good turn over times. I ordered the Baby Back Rib Tickler, which comes with 3 ribs, slaw, fries, and two onion rings. I was a bit disappointed that I wasn't able to substitute (which does make sense if they are going for speed, I suppose), as I am not that big of a fan of cole slaw, but when I got my food, I was no longer disappointed. The problem with braces is that it makes eating certain foods rather difficult. Stuff gets all stuck in them and getting the food out is such a hassle. This place did not give me that problem at all. The meat just falls off the bone, so I could just easily get it off with a fork and knife to cut into braces-friendly portions. Seriously delicious food, and what a great deal. The fries were heaping and really good with the cajun seasoning at the table. They sort of remind me of thicker cut In-N-Out fries in texture. I really liked the cole slaw, which is saying a lot because I don't normally like it. The onion rings were crunchy and oily deliciousness. I would give this place 4.5 stars, rounded up. I just wish I could substitute! I've been searching for a good barbecue place and am rather bummed that I would have to come so far to get it, but if I'm ever back in town, I want to come back for sure!

If you're EVER in San Diego visiting from somewhere else - you HAVE to eat here. I lived in San Diego for 4 years and I'm very sad that I did not discover PHil's BBQ the moment I moved there. PHils' BBQ is DELICIOUS and SOOOOOOOOOOO GOOD prices are completely fair and reasonable service is excellent Food is DELICIOUSSSSSSSSSSS and mouth watering and so yummy the only thing that is a slight negative is that there is always a hellllllllllla long wait.

Are you kidding me??? ÊThis has to be one of the best rib places I've ever been too. ÊI went there because I saw an episode of Man vs. Food when they came to San Diego, I read several reviews on Yelp, and I had one of my friends confirm how good this place was. ÊMy wife and I split the El Toro, which is a tri-tip sandwich, a full rack of baby back ribs, and an order of their onion rings. ÊThe meat was very tender and juicy...it just fell off the bone! ÊThe best part is the mesquite flavor that's cooked into the meat, it's kind of spicy, smoky, and definitely has a kick to it. ÊThe onion rings were huge, and the onions were pretty thick and juicy. ÊThe batter was pretty light, but they were onion rings...they're supposed to be pretty oily right? ÊWe also got a few sides like corn and coleslaw which were pretty good too. Try not to be too afraid of the amusement park ride-like lines that you see from the outside. ÊAlthough there were probably around 60-80 people in line, it only took around 30 minutes to get seated. ÊI didn't expect this, but the line leads to a cash register where you put down your order. ÊThen they get your food to you within about 10 minutes or so if not faster. ÊEverything is a lot quicker than you'd think. If you're visiting San Diego, do not miss this place!!

Now, I'm not a big fan of BBQ sauce because it's generally too sweet to me, and Phil's BBQ sauce definitely falls into that category. ÊThat being said, the food was only worth 2 stars to me. ÊWe had the baby back ribs, El Toro (tri tip sandwich), onion rings, and a side salad. ÊHonestly, I think the salad was the best part of the meal, and it was just spring mix with some tomato wedges. ÊNone of it was bad, just not particularly good. ÊI much prefer the Tri Tip sandwich at Firestone's in San Luis Obispo, but I guess that's a different review. Now, the service was 50 times better than the food! ÊI almost want to give this place 5 stars just for the service, but I can't say that "I'm a fan" (4 stars) or that it's "as good as it gets" (5 stars) because I had to wash down that sickeningly sweet BBQ sauce taste from my mouth with tons of water. ÊAnyway, our server, Kenny, was amazing -- the best server I've ever had. ÊSeriously, the best. ÊThe kids described him as "tall, fast, and funny" -- he's 6'9", was quick on his feet, and can charm your pants off. ÊI will definitely look for him if I ever come back. Other notes: -The line was ridiculously long (expected based on previous Yelp reviews), but moves relatively quickly. ÊIt probably took about 40 minutes to get to the counter to order on a Sunday evening around 7pm. -They came around several times asking for parties of 6 or more -- I wonder if that means you get to order first and be seated earlier?? -They came around and offered Otter Pops to the kids while we were in line.

Phil's BBQ...those words always cause my friends to say, "OHHHHH MYYYY GOOODDD I'm craving it, let's go!" ÊThis is where I take all my friends when they visit San Diego. ÊIn fact, it might be the only good thing about San Diego. ÊIt's so good that there is always a line but if you avoid the "rush hour" (around times like 7pm) you shouldn't have to wait too long. Ê I get so hungry and greedy while waiting in line that I always want to order a half-rack but my friends always have to slap me back to reality and make me order the tickler. ÊWith the tickler you get about 4 bones which is enough to satisfy me.. but when I am truly greedy I order the half-rack :P Ê The ribs are so tender that they just seem to fall off the bone. ÊNo utensils allowed! ÊYou must use your hands for everything. ÊYes, even with the macaroni salad. Ê(Jk) ÊBut my favorite sides are fries and macaroni salad. Ê Once I had Phil's 3 times within 5 days. ÊMost people go on a diet before going to Vegas, but if you have Phil's as an option then that's not possible. ÊBe prepared to feast yourself on this delightful meal, you won't be disappointed. ÊPhil's FILLS you up! Ê;)

There's nothing else left to say about this San Diego favorite, so I'll just leave you with a few tips: Check your dining etiquette at the door. Utensils are optional, wet naps are a MUST. Don't take your date here if you're looking for quiet and romantic. Ribless dinner with beans and onion rings - hell to the yessssssss. There is a reason why people will line up around the building as if they're about to enjoy an amusement park ride. ÊIf you haven't been yet, I suggest you get in line.

Barbeque is probably my biggest culinary soft spot. ÊSo when I saw this place featured on "Man v. Food," I knew I had to go! ÊAs an Angelino, I make weekend trips down to beautiful San Diego as often as I can... and Phil's has become my #1 place to stop for lunch just as soon as I drive into town, every time! The tri-tip sandwich, known on the menu as the El Toro, is my hands-down favorite item to eat here. The smoky-tasting meat, char-grilled to perfection and soaked in Phil's own brand of tangy BBQ sauce, nearly reduced me to tears the first time I tried it. ÊAnd the BBQ Broham sandwich is a pulled pork masterpiece that will floor you as well. ÊBoth sandwiches are piled so high with meat that you literally will not be able to see the lower bun! ÊAnd don't miss the baby back ribs... the tender meat just falls off the bone, and you won't be able to get enough. ÊOn every trip, now, I buy more food than I can possibly eat... some for now, and some for later! Between the amazing food and the incredibly friendly staff who work here, you'll find it's no surprise why there is a large line out the front door all day and night! ÊBut never make the mistake of allowing the size of that line to intimidate you into finding another place to eat... the professional staff at Phil's keep that line moving quickly (and never lose their friendly smiles while doing so), and while you may dismay the first time you take your place in line here, you'll be dining on some of the finest (and most reasonably priced!) BBQ you've ever had in your life before you know it, and you'll be heading back for more without a second thought!

Maybe my standards for BBQ are too high being someone who lived in the South, but when my friends took me to "the best BBQ in San Diego" I was not only disappointed, I was still hungry after because I couldn't even force myself to eat my nasty BBQ Chicken. Tasted like Vinegar with Cayenne powder, and the chicken was incredibly dry and the sauce slapped on top (not marinated at all, no flavor in the dry chicken). ÊNot only was my chicken terrible, but whatever side I had was inedible. Ê I got dragged there one more time and had the same experience.

I'm a native San Diegan and all my life I heard about Phil's and how great the BBQ is. ÊPerhaps I should have eaten here before I traveled and ate better BBQ in Florida and even Vegas. I was sadly disappointed, as we have been looking for good BBQ here. This isn't it. ÊThe only good part was the soda's. The meat was not generous nor tender and was overwhelmed with something called BBQ sauce. I'd like to say the service was great, but it wasn't. ÊWhen we walked in we (wrongly) assumed that you get seated first then order. A rude waitress told us otherwise as we apparently violated the sacred rule of ordering first. If you want good BBQ: 1) travel outside San Diego 2) read my reviews!

Seeing the long ass line at 8:30PM blew my mind... Tip: get a spot at the bar and for go the line.. have someone wait in line and have someone stalk the bar like a hungry vulture... throw dem bows if you have to.... They have a cam (smile!) They have an approximate wait time outside They have heaters for those waiting outside in line They have amazing BBQ They have plates of just pure meat fall off the bone goodness They are super speedy with service The prices are ridiculously reasonable for the amount of food you get I got the Baby Back Tickler for two reasons... 1. The name made me giggle 2. It is a really good value for what you get (3 ribs, 2 huge ass onion rings, a huge pile of slaw, a large portion of crispy fries) Others in the party got racks of ribs... these things look like something the Flinstones would eat. They have tons of combos, sandwiches, sides all with some kind of red meat with BBQ sauce... Shout goes out to Louis who was waiting our area. Ê Perfect Friday night.

Okay, so I really want this to be a five-star review, because my wife and I loved this place. There is nostalgia there, and she was able to make it to the new place in Point Loma, so that's cool, too... Christ, Phil. Can you please nail down my all-time favorite? Your delicious onion rings, that is? Come on, man. When I first tried your place out, years ago, during your brawl with your pissy, prissy neighbors, I decided I liked it very much. It was a proud day when I delivered that CityBeat award to you. The ribs and the chicken (of course the sauce) was just part of it, though... The onion rings made you my wife's choice. They were beautiful, golden, tasty, done but not over-fried, crispy but hearty. Then things changed. Why have they turned into armored onion loops of mouth-cutting hatred and vileness? Why? I mean, occasionally they are light and golden with tan highlights, but usually it's just not so. They have mutated into something chunky, brown with very dark brown highlights, the onions dripping not juice but grease. They have become painful maw-scarring bites of hardened disappointment , and mouthfuls of regret. Why do your onion rings have jagged edges? How is that? Regardless, I will return and keep buying your food, even hoping beyond hope for the odds to improve on some decent onion rings with each buy. But I don't know. Volume is king now. Maybe there is just not time to do that awesome barbecue and keep those rings on par. Man, this should be a 5. But I just can't. Despite that disappointment, it really is the best chicken and ribs in the county and likely the state. Try it, folks. *sigh*

Phil's BBQ is great. It is in incredible. It is the best damn restaurant in San Diego. That is, if you enjoy standing in line for 20-40 minutes, ordering your food at a counter, finding a table on your own, filling up your soda at a machine, getting up to get your food from the aforementioned counter, and leaving promptly after you finish. Yeah, if that all sounds like an awesome experience, then Phil's is your place. Unfortunately for me, I hate everything about Phil's except for the food. Call me old fashioned, but when I sit down to gorge myself on BBQ, I want to enjoy myself. I might want to have a conversation with my friends before ordering. I expect someone to show me to my table, and tell my waiter will be right with me. I want that waiter to take our drink order, make some suggestions and then return to take our orders. I want this waiter to bring me my damn food, and clear the plates when I am finished. Yes, when eating at a restaurant, I expect the basics. While the food is great here. If I wanted to wait in line to order, get my food, eat and leave, I would go to In-N-Out, not a restaurant where you pay $25 per person. Phil's food is five stars. Everything else deserves one. My Yelpulator says that equals 2.

UPDATE (3/11/08) MY SECRET IS OUT: ÊYou can no longer order your food to go & roll up & eat it there. ÊThey have rules against it. ÊThis was the only way for me to bypass the long wait 'cause I can't wait that long for Phil's BBQ - I have low blood sugar. ÊI don't know who told, but I'm never telling them another secret again. What's to say that hasn't already been said? Phil's BBQ is delicious. ÊThe sauce is an explosion of sweet, tangy, & spicy. ÊI like to lick the bone because I love the taste of the burned parts mixed with the sauce. ÊI usually order the beef ribs w/ potato salad & onion rings. ÊThe potato salad is very good & the onion rings are to die for. ÊThey're beer battered so that makes them even better. Ê It's always busy here, but ask the staff and they'll find you a seat. ÊThe staff is very efficient at clean tables and finding seats for everyone.

You already know from the bajillion reviews this place has that it's the bomb. If you haven't been here, go. Now. Unless it's a monday, when it's closed. Or unless you're on a diet. But everyone else, no excuses. Here's a really useful hint if you A) Are 21+, B) Are waiting in line during rush hour, and C) Don't mind eating at the bar: When you walk up and see that HUGE line, don't wait. Walk straight up and you'll see an EMPTY line that says "phone in orders." Walk down that area and ask to be seated at the bar. You can then order your food right there without waiting in the huge line. Most people are either with family or want to sit at a booth so there's usually VERY little wait at the bar.

I rated it 2 stars at first, but that was just thinking it was overrated. ÊIt deserves a 3. ÊYeah, the shredded pork is tender. You know what the best way to make pork tender and shredded is? BOIL IT FOR 4 HOURS! Doesn't make it bbq. This little thing called "flavor" is what makes bbq. The white meat chicken chunks are a bit dry. You know why? They're white meat chicken chunks. Healthy bbq? Gimme a break. Grill me a thigh or a drumstick, IF you need chicken. Fries, beans, onion rings, and slaw ranged from decent to yummy. But nothing about any of it screams BBQ. If there wasn't any sauce on anything, I wouldn't know it was supposed to be a bbq place. Here's what I'm tired of. First of all, people who decide San Diego has no worthwhile bbq because the masses say this is the best and it's not too great. Yelp is usually reliable. In this case it's not. To paraphrase another yelper, going here and condemning San Diego bbq is like going to Red Lobster and condemning San Diego seafood. San Diego isn't Memphis when it comes to bbq, but go give a try to Wrangler Family BBQ in el cajon. THAT's good, authentic, smoked (imagine that) bbq. EDIT: Revised from 2 to 3 stars, because I think that's what it deserves. Changed my mind about penalizing them for not living up to the hype. Not their fault. Also upgraded my opinion of the sides.

First off, let's silence some of the detractors and identify what Phil's is not: authentic BBQ. Yeah, I said it, Phil's BBQ, the best BBQ in San Diego, is not even really BBQ. I've been to KC (the city, not the dirty establishment in downtown) and had "real" pit BBQ and yeah, it is amazing. Does that mean Phil's isn't good? No, that just means you are a food snob too high on your horse for your own good. When it comes down to it, call it whatever you want, it's still delicious. That being said, I have been a Phil's devotee for more than 7 years and frequented the small, cramped location in Mission Hills long before they opened in the Sports Arena area. Over the years I have turned on dozens (literally) of friends to the establishment and can't say I've ever had anyone say they were disappointed. As far as the food goes, they have more than maintained the quality from their previous location and I still can't get enough of their sauce. The Ribless Dinner is my personal favorite with tender bites of boneless pork smothered in that sauce. A side of fries to soak up the extra sauce and some baked beans make a satisfying meal. The Sports Arena location is obviously a lot bigger than the old Mission Hills location and is very nice. My only complaint is that they have stopped allowing phone-in orders for dine-in. I always thought that it was a nice way of rewarding the loyal customers, those who knew the ropes, by allowing them to beat the one and a half hour wait. As much as I love the food, I find myself going much less often because I can't find the time to endure the wait. If Phil has made the decision to cater to the tourist crown who will visit once and never again, so be it, but I am afraid it is at a cost of some of his long time repeat customers.

The line looked daunting, around the corner, with 10-15 people behind the sign that says "21 minutes." However, the 4.5 stars and 1600 reviews were backing me, I was ready to conquer. After an hour, my boyfriend and I were ready to order. We decided on the full baby back ribs dinner with macaroni salad and fries $18, as well as the full beef ribs only $18. The portions were with about 5 for the beef and 12 for the baby back ribs. There were also a myriad of drinks to pick from. like, 7 different types of iced tea? i was so indecisive! Food came relatively fast, within 10 minutes of ordering. The portions were a little too much, even for our starved stomach. I did see a lot of people taking them home, but since we weren't gonna take it back to LA anytime soon, we forced ourselves to finish it. The two of us managed to annihilate the meat, and the macaroni salad, however the fries were hardly touched. it was also cold and a little soggy by the time we finished out meat. The baby back ribs were sweet and tangy, eat with hands or knife, the choice is yours. i thought it was a little too saucy and sweet for me, hence both my bf and i preferred the beef. which had a more distinctive smoked flavour, and wasn't sweet. Very juicy and tender meat that slipped out of its bone with a ease. The macaroni salad was a much needed break from all the meat. Unfortunately, the fries were light and nicely browned, but were cold by the time we ate some meat. Ambiance and service were all satisfactory. The seat and table of the booth is a little close together though. *** Tip: Share to try both beef and baby back, unless you are planning to take out, a full with sides and a half is enough for 2 people. beef if you're more savory and pork if you like sweeter tastes. line is about 1 hour long on weekends. The line was still long at 3pm, although it might have only been a 30 minute wait. Favourites: Great quality bbq. the beef. Do not want: long wait. too, too much sauce at times. Last words: If you love bbq, the line is worth it. if you're not a huge fan, try it just once.

Consistent, excellent service and awesome bbq. Portions are delicious. My favorite things here are the beefy bones and onion rings with ranch, and surprisingly, beans.

Best ribs I've ever had.This is the best restaurant I've been to San Diego even though I've only been there a handful of times. When we first arrived, we encountered a huge line. However, the wait ended up not being too bad. The line moved by quite quickly. We even got free fries while waiting in line! Definitely worth the wait. I ordered the rack of baby back ribs with fries and macaroni salad as the sides. The Ribs were amazing. The fries were also good. i sprinkled it with the creole seasoning which maed it even more delicious. The macaroni salad was decent but not to die for. Definitely recommend this place if you're ever in SD!

Most people are inclined to give this place 4 or 5 stars because they think that they're supposed to or something. Or because they waited in some hour long line with freinds of there's who couldn't stop ranting and raving about this "new" place they found. Whatever the reasons, I don't think I'll be joining that elite group of Yelpers. Yes...Phil's was better when it was in that tiny little hole in the wall up in Mission Hills/Hillcrest. The food was fresher, the atmosphere was quaint, and you really felt like you were in one of those tiny shacks you happen upon while taking the 2 day drive through Texas. Now that Phils is in the Sports Arena area, it has lost 75 percent of its quality, 95 percent of its charm, and 110 percent of its character. The employees have ZERO personality. (I apologize if any of you Phils employees are reading this) They all act like they haven't slept for days. The one's that ARE awake spend more time talking to fellow co-workers, and they all kinda have this low frequency mumble dialect they speak in which is hard to hear. The food is mostly prepared to order, but the stuff that isn't, REALLY isn't! The beans, the slaw, the dreadful potato salad, all taste like they are from yesterday or even the day before. The BBQ sandwiches are still good and so are the ribs, but at the prices they are asking, they HAVE to be. The decor is so tired and worn out. Road House Grill, Famous Dave's, Lone Star, Chili's even. They all have that same southern backwoods corregated metal shack look that doesn't impress me anymore. I don't think it ever DID, but back in the early 1990's it was stylish as hell. Should you try Phil's? Sure. You may really like it. But please go in there with an open mind and a critical eye.

I think the reviews are inflated because by the time the customers actually get to eat their food after waiting in line they're starved out of their minds and anything they eat tastes exponentially better. The bbq here is pretty great though. The sauce is sweet and tangy, and the meat falls off the bone so easily. The onion rings are also delicious. Everything goes down so easily when it's oily and bbq/ketchup dipable. Really friendly and helpful staff, despite the long waits. Btw: the "Tickler" = greattt deal. 7 bucks for 3 sizable ribs, 2 onion rings, coleslaw and a heaping load of fries? I'm sold!

Why are these ribs so damn tasty?! Its like these beef ribs come from happy cows, and happy cows only come from California. ÊThe beef ribs are to die for. I have gone to Phil`s multiple times and have tried the beef ribs. Most times they are so succulent that the meat falls off the bone with the gentlest touch. ÊOn the other hand, the baby back ribs are not even on the same level as the beef ribs. These baby back ribs are analogous to good ol` tony romas (which suck). ÊYou can choose 2 small sides or 1 large side to go with your 3 rib dinner. ÊThe fries are mediocre, onion rings are the smooth kind which taste like air (fried nothingness), the best thing to get is the pasta salad and bbq beans. It sucks waiting in a long line but that's all part of the Phil`s BBQ experience. ÊAs your stomach is growling, hunger pains hurting, and mouth is watering, you watch people in the patio like it's a thanksgiving feast from an episode from Family Matters. You can smell the special BBQ sauce smoking out of Phil`s chim chim chimney chim chim charoo. ÊIts a pregame strategy to order with your stomach and not your mind; so by the time you get up to the front of the line you`ll end up ordering the full rack (5 ribs) of beef ribs instead of the 3 rib beef rib dinner. Its genius on Phil`s behalf. When you're feeling for a tangy and sweet beefy fill, Phil`s BBQ got yo baby back (not the ribs haha or not...). If you don't feel like waiting in the long ass line, order ahead and walk past the line of sweat dripping from the tongue peeps to pick up your order. Just don't try to phone in your order and sit down like you waited in line, cuz I did that once and they said not to do it again or you`ll be forever banned from tasty goodness.. jk but they said its ok this time cuz its not busy but whatevers. Great flavor and beef rib tenderness! Phil`s BBQ is on my top 10 eateries just north of the border.

Came here because everyone that I know raves about it. ÊNot really a big fan of sauce based BBQ but that being said I can still enjoy it. ÊPhil's is a sauced based BBQ place that has a bad sauce. ÊFor me that's lose lose. ÊThere is one key tell that is the easiest thing in the world to tell if something is good BBQ. ÊCan you smell it, that is key. ÊIf you cannot smell the smokey, meaty deliciousness then don't bother. ÊI knew better but went with my football team from church and as it was tradition I didn't want to complain. ÊSo here's my complaint: BBQ is meant to be a matter of patience in the cooking process. ÊTheir pulled pork was not smokey, not tender, kinda stringy and smothered in sauce. ÊPulled pork is meant to be rubbed in spices, smoked for 10-12 hours, and served with a light touch of sauce if the consumer is the type. ÊThe pulled pork here had no smokey flavor and texturally seemed like it had been boiled. ÊThe chicken was tolerable since its not meant to be slow smoked, but their tri-tip/ brisket, whatever it is, is not even as good as mine when I cook at home. ÊThe beans were muh, the sauce was like sweet and sour, and the meat was bland and stringy. ÊAvoid this place based on quality. The line is a different story, maybe they are good at marketing, but the quality needs to be there for this line to make sense, and it really just doesn't.

Let me start this out by saying something.... I don't like barbeque sauce. Actually, I really don't like it. I avoid it at all costs. So Wilmar D. told me that he wanted to take me to Phil's BBQ. So I said okay, I like BBQ. We waited in what seemed like a humongous line, but the line went very fast. There isn't a lot of seating on a busy day like Saturday, but we were able to find a table luckily and soon after we were seated, our food was ready (wow, ridiculously fast). I ordered a quarter portion of ribs. To my dismay, it was smothered in BBQ sauce (I don't know why I didn't expect this). But I'm willing to try pretty much anything, even though I had my doubts. um. It was SO good. Yea, I'm not a fan of bbq sauce. But their sauce was tasty and tolerable, for a hater like myself hehe. The meat was REALLY REALLY good and fell right off the bones. It was soooooo yummy. SO so SO so SO delicious. I didn't think I would give this place 5 stars. But it really surprised me (the whole BBQ sauce thing). And their service is very fast. And their meat is REALLY good. Go here. I know I'm gonna come back :)

The Good: Tender, tasty, saucy ribs for a good price including sides that are all awesome! ÊThe place is wide and feels like a real barbeque, filled with music and tv's for sports. ÊThey make it quicker than other rib restaurants and the quality is absolutely better. ÊThe employees are there are also very nice and will do anything to make your meal more enjoyable. The Bad: The wait. ÊSo, once you arrive, be prepared to stand in a line, vaguely resembling something you would stand in for a rollercoaster ride. ÊThe wait averages from 15 to 30 minutes just to get inside and order. ÊBut it's worth it. Try: Baby Back Ribs. (obviously) ÊThat is what they're good at, so go for the ribs. Ê All the sides are also delicious, but my favorites are macaroni salad, baked beans, and cole slaw. Don't Try: Ordering a lot of food just because you're hungry. ÊThey actually give you a lot of food, so you might even consider sharing.

My 2-star review is ultimately meaningless amongst the 960 reviews already here... Anyway, after being on 30' boat for over 24 hours (we caught 12 ahi tuna, 1 yellowtail, and 1 mahi, woohoo) I was stoked to have some hot, delicious food. ÊMy friends were talking this place up, but frankly, I was not impressed. First off, the line didn't look that long, but I was deceived by the sign overhead claiming "wait time from this point, 21 minutes and 40 seconds" or some crap like that. ÊTry almost 40 minutes... Anyway, I got a half rack of baby back ribs and 1 extra beef rib, with baked beans, cole slaw, and onion rings. ÊUpon tasting my food, I immediately wished that I had gotten all beef ribs and no baby backs. ÊThe pork ribs simply were not tender enough... I still had to rip the meat off the bones with my teeth . And their BBQ sauce - ÊWAAY too much of it, and WAAAY too much vinegar in it! ÊThe sauce was overpoweringly sour, and I didn't care for it... I would rather have had no sauce at all. ÊThe baked beans were lukewarm (but tasty) and the cole slaw was great. ÊI must admit, the onion rings were pretty awesome. Ê With the main attraction being the meat, I was not impressed with the food. ÊFor less than $30, I feel like this place is a great value... but if only they did something about that BBQ sauce, I'd actually want to come back.

Okay, maybe it's because my father hails from St. Louis, THE place for ribs...and maybe it's because my dad makes the best ribs EVER, but I don't get it. Don't get me wrong, the BBQ was okay, but mind-blowing? Really? The BBQ sauce just doesn't have the balance of spicy and sweet and tangy that I'm looking for. And the ribs were just a bit too oversmoked. Again-balance. I didn't find that in these ribs. The fries weren't that great, in fact they were kind of soggy/stale and the baked beans were also "just okay", though honestly the best part of the meal other than my iced tea. There was quite a line when we arrived and that line was doubled when we left. We decided to skip it and sit at the bar where the service was alright, but at least much faster.

You know how your driving to Disneyland, and you already know before walking through the gates that you MUST ride Splash Mountain, and then you finally make your way to the line, and it's 10 miles long, but you don't care, because you MUST ride this ride before exiting the park, so you stand in line, with a few (or a lot) of good friends) choppin' it up about random things, playing various hand clapping games like slide and patty cake, tweeting or texting, anything to make the time to go buy, because finally when you get on the ride, and it lasts only 3 minutes after standing in line for and hour and 45 minutes, but it was all worth it because I mean... it's Splash Mountain at Disenyland?! :D Yeah, that's kind what Phil's is in a nutshell. My first time here, the line was RIIIII-DIC!... ridiculously long. I about turned around and went back to my car to head to Red Lobster for some cheesy bread right across the way, but everyone suggested I stayed that it was worth the seemingly endless line that wraps around the building. I'm not going to lie, the food is super delicious, ANND the portions are huge, which work REALLY well with my Samoan nature of eating well over capacity. The ribs fall off the bone, the fries are crisp, ranch is creamy goodness in a little plastic capsule, and the onion rings are one of their signatures, just immaculate conception between batter an onion. I tried the chicken WITH the ribs, and the ribs won in a landslide of BBQ sauce, no joke. If you do the ribs after the chicken, you'll never go back to chicken again. There's no point in keeping your tastebuds unsatisfied. Anyhow, I love this place. The customer service is awesome, there's a tall dude there that always has a smile on his face and is pretty much the face of Phil's when I get there. I'm always hoping to sit in his section, usually if I can't find anything, he assists in finding one for me :D Such a sweetheart. The people are great, it's busy, ALL. THE. TIME. The line sometimes seems intimidating, but once you get a hold of those ribs, it's all glorious wonderment from then on. :)

On a day trip to San Diego, my boyfriend and I researched and through the help of yelp, we decided to check out this joint. We love BBQ so we were sure this place would hit the spot.It sure did. First off, be prepared for long a$$ lines. We waited for a good 20-30 minutes until we were finally seated. To my surprise it's like a fast food joint. You basically order your food and get a number and find your own seat. You get your own drinks and wait for your number to be called. Once it's called, you go and pick up your order. They definitely do not bring the food and serve you like a sit-down restaurant. This wasn't a huge deal to me but I was just surprised that's all. The ribs were alright. I have had better ribs from other joints in the past so these were nit my personal favorite ribs to have. I am not a huge fan of their bbq sauce either. But their chicken was very good and tender and juicy. I was really sad to hear they do not serve mashed potatoes or mac and cheese. I was kinda craving it with my ribs but couldn't have any. BOO! So I ended up getting a turkey BBQ burger while my boyfriend got the chicken and ribs with fries. Everything tasted ok, but just not the best we've ever had. But the major plus is the fact the food is so cheap. I think for 2 of us we spent less than $20. That's a great deal for BBQ food.

Ordered the Beef Ribs... which is to my standards the best test for BBQ. ÊThe beef ribs was so tender that it fell off the bone. ÊAlso the quality of the meat was perfect. ÊWhat I mean by that is, the meat wasn't too fatty, it had the perfect balance. ÊI also got a chance to try some of the baby back pork ribs and hands down the meat was good. Now for the reasons why I only gave it 4 stars. Sauce: ÊSauce was more on the tangy side. ÊI have to admit that I am still a huge Lucilles fan. ÊI still love that sweet and tangy bbq sauce. ÊThe BBQ sause at Phil's BBQ seems like it was drenched on top. ÊWhich felt a little too much at times. ÊSo as you can tell I am definitely basing Phil's BBQ with Lucilles Smokehouse. ÊAnd when it comes to side orders, Lucilles wins my heart too. ÊPhil's BBQ fries were nothing special and nothing really stood out when I was trying to decide on which sides to get. As for Price... It was decently priced especially for the amount you get. ÊCompared to Lucilles which was slightly pricier. Would definitely go again!

Not much can be said about Phil's that hasn't been yelped a hundred times already. ÊThey have some of the best Barbeque in the state, and the lines often reflect that. ÊBaby back ribs, hamburgers, tri-tip, even the damn veggie burger is good. Ê If the power goes out I'd recommend stepping out, it gets really smoky.

With all due respect to the fine employees that serve in one of the busiest restaurants in San Diego, the success of Phil's BBQ seems entirely propelled by the bandwagon mentality of its patrons rather than the quality of its cuisine. Truthfully, after standing in a 30-minute line for a basket of food, most of us would be hard pressed to admit the whole experience simply wasn't worth it. But having been raised on legit southern cooking, I owe it to myself to declare this place the Applebee's of BBQ. Everything is suffocated in sauce, and although fans of Phil's will contest that it can be ordered on the side, the meat really doesn't hold its own. Admittedly, my heart has always had a special place for that smoky Texan flavor, but the goods here are often overcooked and really don't taste like anything. Hence the growler of crimson gravy dumped on every plate. Still, I gotta give credit to the staff members that bust their ass at this joint. I was at the bar until just after they had locked the doors and not one employee seemed to mind. Everyone was really pleasant, despite working in what must be a very tiring environment. Quality service bumps my rating up to A-OK.

I have been to Phil's close to ten times with the first visit being at the old Goldfinch location. ÊOver the years their food has been consistently good and a safe bet for taking family, friends and out-of-towners out for a decent meal. Ê There's only been one time when I felt bad about introducing Phil's to the uninitiated. ÊA couple of friends visited me from Oceanside and happened to be huge pork rib fans. ÊIt was an off-night and the meat was a little dry and to put it nicely, didn't exactly fall off of the bone. ÊBesides this aberration, Phil's has been solid. Ê So far I've had the: pork ribs (http://www.yelp.com/biz_É), Broham (http://www.yelp.com/biz_É), El Toro, cheeseburger, onion rings, fries, cole slaw, beans and bbq chicken chunks (in Chickless meals). ÊUnless the quality quickly slides downhill on my next visit, I'll keep on coming back.

I have one less reason to go to Texas now.... why?! Because I've found a place where their is no other close competitor that comes close to this joint's smokin', gimme gimme more flavored kind of BBQ around this hood. After reading a multitude of reviews of this restaurant and ravings from my fellow foodie friends, I finally decided to make a trip down to SD just to see what the hype was all about. So why am I writing a review even though there's already 1,000 + reviews from die-hard Phil's BBQ fans?! So that I can further contribute to Phil's rating and vouch for this place, hands up. It's crazy crazy good! I'll cut to the chase. Here are my picks: 1) Big Bone Beef Ribs- a MUSTTTTT. I personally preferred these over the classic baby back ribs since the former was way more fork-tender, fall of the bone kind of ribs compared to the latter. I also preferred the sweet, fresh BBQ sauce on this rib compared to the somewhat tangier and sour-er sauce on the baby backs. Did I mention that there's also TONSSSS of meat so that's always a plus!!! Who doesn't like MORE of awesomeness?! 2) ONION RINGS- i was nomming happily and eying the last onion ring the whole meal. That's how much of a fatso and how delicious these things were! Addicting crunch and flavorful, going well sans or w/ ranch dressing. Perfecto!!!! 3) BBQ Chicken-Bok bok! This Chicken was deeelicious! Tender, juicy (even the white mean was delightful) and full of mmm mmmm BBQ sauce glazed over the skin! Next time though, I'll pass on the corn on the cob as it was nothing special. In addition to the good spankin' food, despite the bustling sea of human ants, the service was wonderful! On my visit, the cashier forgot to charge me for an order of fresh cut fries. Since I realized this after I got seated, I went up to the front to notify someone of my sad receipt that was lacking of "fries" and to my surprise, instead of standing in the super long line to re-order and pay for my fries, they kindly apologized and gave me a large side on the house! Free food= happy customers! They know how to make us happy indeed. Lucille's will never taste the same again, friends.

Phil's BBQ is worth just about every bit of hype. ÊFrom the mind-blowing food to the personable and friendliest staff I've ever experienced. The line that awaits you when you arrive to Phil's is intimidating at first, but don't fret, the line moves swiftly... We started around the corner, about half way down to the side of the building and we were in the door in less than an hour. Coming here for the first time, I ordered a full rack of Baby-Back Ribs with BBQ Beans and Coleslaw. ÊMy Girlfriend opted for their Babyback and 1/4 Chicken combo plate with Slaw and Potato Salad. The ribs need no utensils, nor do you need your teeth, really. ÊMy suggestion is to just eat the ribs by digging into them with your lips - this way you can spend time smacking your them around to get enjoy every last bit of their tangy and spicy sauce. ÊThis sauce contains so many different layers of flavors, you just have to check it out yourself to see what I mean. Coleslaw and Beans were great, my favorite of the two being the BBQ Beans (the sauce is just killer). ÊThe potato salad is nothing too special, although everything was more than acceptable. Do yourself a favor and eat here again and again. ÊI nearly came back for lunch the next day while spending a weekend in San Diego. Oh, and before you leave, try a Whoppie Pie. Its like an Oreo Cakester with a moist cake/cookie and a whipped vanilla cream filling. My advice - Order your own... 'nuff said.

I heart Phil's BBQ! I'm a San Diego native (rare thing, right?), so perhaps I don't know what qualifies as "authentic" BBQ. ÊAll I do know is that this stuff is always good, and seriously addictive. ÊEverything I have had is oh-so tasty. ÊI usually order the Rib Tickler, which comes complete with 4 ribs, cole slaw, and 2 beer battered onion rings on a bed of fries. ÊCan we say guilty pleasure? ÊOh my. The new location is awesome because it's large (there is always a crowd, day or night), there are tons of wide screen TVs playing baseball, basketball, soccer, and football, and they have patio dining and a BAR! ÊOh, I almost forgot... blues music! ÊYou can't go wrong with that, and nothing compliments some ribs better than some low down dirty blues. Not only is the food delicious, but the staff is so effing friendly and helpful. ÊIf you go there regularly enough like we do, they greet you by your name and help you find a table. ÊPhil is always there and just about the nicest guy -- go say 'hi'. ÊHe must be doing something right: ÊGreat food + great service = loyal customers Oh, final bonus. ÊThey stay open to like 11pm. ÊWe go there late on a friday and the place is still packed! ÊFinger lickin' good. ÊIn fact, I think I know what's for dinner tonight ;)

THIS TIME, THE LINE WAS OUT THE DOOR AND AROUND THE CORNER ON A SUNDAY NIGHT! PLEASE READ MY PREVIOUS REVIEW. I've gone back 4 times since then but forgot to review it. Pros: -Same great comments as below. As always, they have a great and friendly staff. -Ordered their ribs with sauce on the side, sooooo much better! -Had the, pulled pork sandwich... PACKED with meat and topped with coleslaw. Great smokey flavor. -Also the the El Toro (tri-tip sandwich). The meat is thinly sliced, almost like deli meat. The flavor or aroma was to DIE for! When the sandwiches came to the table, everyone around me couldn't stop looking! Even after they got up, they said, "LOOK AT ALL THAT MEAT"! -BTW, their teas are yummy! -The line is long but it moves quick. Cons: -Pulled pork was very much on the dry side! Sadly, I was expecting a little better. ÊIt was so dry, it was almost like shredded jerky. -Still not very fond of the honey-cinnamon bbq sauce flavor but it's good on the side.

I have heard about Phil's BBQ for years. However, as I am not a huge BBQ fan, I never had the urge to go. But this week is restaurant week, so I thought I'd stop in and try their special. Let me first say that I'm not exactly sure what "BBQ" really means. I mean I know they barbecue the meat and have some special sauce for it. But, there seems to be some synergistic effect of the process of cooking the meat and the quality of the sauce that people are refering to while exclaiming Ê"I love BBQ!" I'm kind of getting it now. But, I don't crave my meat swimming in sweet tangy sauce. Whatever. Their restaurant week special for $20 was: 2 sides, a ton of meat, and a dessert (whoopie or Nestle ice cream cone). I got the Caesar salad and baked potato for my sides: pretty good. The beef rib was awesome, pork rib not bad, chicken good. The "whoopie" in both regular and red velvet was interesting. It was an over sized cookie sandwich with vanilla cream in between (although weirded out by them at first, I ate quite a bit of them). For not being a big BBQ person, the taste of the BBQ sauce was as good as it could have been. The tenderness of the meat was amazing--meat falling right off the bone. Final notes: decent draft beer selection and friendly staff.

The hillcrest location is long gone, I can no longer hang out with my homies. ÊI miss it, but I'll just have to get used to this new location. ÊThis is bigger and more efficient, but doesn't have the same feel. ÊRegardless, the food is the same and it is AWESOME. Any good restaurant will have a wait. ÊIt's just a fact of life and a sign that whatever is on the other side is something spectacular. Best BBQ anywhere. ÊLike best in the world. ÊThe El Torro sandwich and onion rings are what I always get. ÊI take my friends here that grew up in San Diego and they're always amazed at how good the food is and at the fact that they've never been there before.

YES! I loooooove Phil's BBQ. ÊIt doesn't take too much to impress me with BBQ though... I'm kind of a BBQ slut like that... Now that I got that out there, I can go on and gush about what I love at this place that I've been going to since my freshman year at UCSD. Food: baby back ribs: Hell to the yes. ÊI can only down a half rack, if I'm ready for it, but I've seen my friends put away the whole thing and it is impressive. ÊIt brings tears to my eyes. ÊThe sauce is deliciously sweet and I would bathe in it. Fries: Yummmmm... They put some sugar on it and it is amazing. ÊI like to coat them in the bbq sauce. Beans: ÊI'm not too big of a fan. ÊThey're too sweet and syrupy for me. Cole Slaw: ÊThis is a BBQ must have. ÊI need some sort of vegetable in my life when I'm gnawing on some ribs, even if they are coated in mayonnaise. ÊAlthough, these aren't too sauced up - which is a great thing. Ê Overall: Great place to have a hearty ass meal in SD. ÊThe line does get long, but it's worth it. ÊI do, however, recommend planning this one out. ÊYou can't just GO to Phil's, you have to be prepared to down this food... both mentally and physically. ÊNow, go out there and do work.

I don't eat red meat, but I can honestly say that I could live off of Phil's BBQ by just eating the veggie burgers and onion rings. ÊIf you're a vegetarian you know that living off of veggie burgers would be a difficult, if not impossible feat. The line is long but if you're smart you'll call ahead and laugh at all the newbies who have to wait to order their food while you waltz up, grab your buzzer and wait 5 minutes for your dinner. ÊVictory is sweet. And yes, it's not the old school Mission Hills location, but it's bigger and you can drink, so stop whining.

My wife and I where visiting her son in the Navy. ÊThey said before we left we had to try Phil's BBQ. ÊWhen I got there and saw the line wrapped around the building I was not overly eager to wait. ÊAfter a bit of convincing I agreed to get in line, and boy am I glad we did! The line greater, Tamie, was a bundle of welcome energy that saw fit to be sure we meet Phil and his wonderful mother. ÊA quick photo and conversation about both our home state, Ohio (north east Ohio to be more specific), we ordered some grub. ÊThe beef ribs where outstanding but the babyback ribs where simply delicious. We washed our tasty treats down with a pitcher of Stella and enjoyed great conversation with two of the Navy's finest (names withheld for nation security).

Holy cow...or bar-b-qued cow. Whatever. I used to go to Phil's often when it was at it's Hillcrest / Mission Hills location. It was fabulous BBQ, if you're into that kind of sauce laden meat food that makes your mouth start to water when you catch a whiff of the place from two blocks away. The menu isn't very large in terms of selection, but what would you expect from a place that throws meat in some kind of cooker and slaps BBQ sauce on it. It is what it is, and what it is is Delicious. You can get all forms of BBQed Beef and Pork ribs, along with BBQed chicken, or mesquite grilled chicken. Pretty straight forward. And for those of you that turn your noses at eating meat directly off the bone, as an ex-girlfriend of mine was, there's even a meal selection that involves chunks of chicken cooked with the BBQ sauce. No bones about it. What I think it pretty cool about the place is that they're even vegetarian friendly, with salad selections, and various side orders of corn on the cob, steam veggies, potato or macaroni salad, french fries, baked beans, slaw...normal backyard or family reunion type BBQ sides. For those of you than knew Phil's before they moved from their above mentioned location, if you thought to show up mid way through the lunch hour or on a Friday night for dinner....you may very well have been eating your meal standing up, as the venue wasn't that big. But you stayed to eat your meal standing or you got it to go, because it was that good. Now at their Sports Arena location, Phil's can house at least three times the amount of patrons, and they also are sporting a full bar, complete with beer from local micro breweries. Now, my only words of warning are these...the sauce can get everywhere, since they're kinda liberal with using it. ÊAnd, the sauce has a little bit of a spicey taste to it. ÊSo those of you that are overly sensitive to spicey anything may end up drinking a lot of water, beer, etc.

Is it really necessary to write another great review for Phils? ÊI think, sure why not!!!

ÊHave found phils sauce at Costco and has made me verrrrry happy that i can use on whatever i want. ÊThe most unusual thing i have ever done with my leftovers is cut the meat off the rib bones, add some sauce and use it to fill a huge omelet.

Mmmmmm.....love BBQ in November. This place is hopping and the ribs certainly are delicious. Tender, fall off the bone. Wish they went easier on the sauce. Two racks, side of potato salad and sweet beans, just a great lunch. Strange, you order in a line, pay and then they give you a pager. You scramble around to find some seats (which you hope isn't too soiled from the previous customers who munched down their food) and then giddily await the pager to go off. It buzzes and you send someone to grab the grub and chow down. No fuss, no muss, just tasty BBQ food.

Really great BBQ! ÊI didn't expect too much of this place when my cousins and I planned on coming here. I figured, just another BBQ place! ÊI was sure wrong! Upon arriving, I already saw a really long line that seemed to look like it was going to wrap around their restaurant! ÊThe line did move really quickly though. ÊIt looked about 50+ people in front of us and it took us about 30 minutes till we got to the front. ÊNot bad! Ê By the time you get to the front, you order your food and look for your seats.

ÊThe ribs were huge and had a great amount of meat on em! ÊThe BBQ didn't overpower the ribs and were really good! ÊThe potato salad was really good too! ÊRed potatoes! Yum! We also got a large side of onion rings! ÊMmm one of the best onions rings I've had! Also we got a drink! All this for $30! ÊSo for a meal that stuffed us with some leftovers too, we each only paid $10! The service here was great as well! ÊThey are super busy but they come around to make sure often if everything is ok.

This is my fourth time ever going to Phil's and my first time coming back after I wrote my review. ÊI have to say that this time around, the food was exactly what I expected and was exactly like the first time I ever went there. Ê I again got the usual - Beefy ribs and Chickless ($11.95) After my first review, the owner was very kind enough to write a message to me in regards to my experience. ÊHe suggested that I ask for the sauce on the side and that if the fries or the meat burnt/stale, then to ask the restaurant to make it over again. Ê So, I did ask for the sauce on the side and the meal was perfect! I got to really experience the tenderness and the true seasoning of the meat w/ the bbq sauce on the side. ÊIt also appeared that the restaurant really took my experience into consideration. ÊThis time around, none of the meat was burnt and the fries were perfect and soft! Ê As for the service, as always, it was perfect. ÊOur server was amazing and cute! He was the tallest (6' 9 in) server at the restaurant. Ê Thank you Phil's BBQ for a wonderful experience and for the delicious meal!

This is where carnivores go when they die. ÊThis is a meat eaters heaven. ÊOne of the best BBQs I have ever had in my life. Ê 4 1/2 stars for sure. Beef Ribs--Incredible.

I'm a vegetarian and I LOVE PHIL'S. Êthe veggie burgers are good, the onion rings, the fries, the potatoes, anything you name it, its good! Before the move to Sports Arena, Phil used to come into my work a few times a week, and he was always friendly and would give myself and all my coworkers discounts to come by.

There is a reason why I constantly think about Phil's... Thank goodness I live in San Diego and can get my Phil's fix just about any time that I feel like it. Poor brother, who lives in LA, and constantly has to suffer, especially when I send him pictures of me devouring those baby back ribs. ÊI'm so mean. Hey, fast food BBQ that is actually legit, and can cost you about 7 bucks for a tickler (4 BBribs, cole slaw, fries, and two onion rings...which is more than enough for me). There are no words to explain the kind of heaven you realize that you're floating on when you're at Phil's. You just gotta try it for yourself. Yup, I'd consider it injustice if you never get around to trying this. Or maybe, it's a good thing you don't go--then I don't have to wait an hour in line to get my ribs.

Good BBQ grub. Ê I know y'all might hate me for saying this but the sauce was a bit too much tang for my tongue. ÊI'm more of the Kansas City sugar and spice and all things porky kinda guy. ÊBut the ribs, man oh man ladies...BOW CHICKA BOW WOW....WOW....WOW...WOW. So me gets the 1/4 baby back dinner with pasta salad and beans and a beef rib tickler with fries, slaw and onyon rings. Ê Let me just tell ya'll folks that their slaw is...is...pssh...i dont know even know how to begin. ÊJUST MAKE SURE YOU GET THEIR SLAW. ÊCrunchity sweet with a slight bang bang of mustard to take the flavor to another dimension. ÊPasta salad was good, beans good, fries good, onion ringers good. ÊThe beef rib was the size of that thing fred flintstone puts on his car going through the drive thru. ÊPacked with cow , so freakin good! Ê Ordered the broham for my sweet sugar pie back home and the smoke from the pulled pork smoked up the car all the way back to LA. ÊHad it that night and BOW CHICKA BOW WOW...I had to walk down a boulevard listening to "Staying Alive" after that. Ê But to take it all downtown to the underground was their service. ÊSome of the happiest people you'll ever meet working on a Sunday. ÊFrom the host who walked away from the huge line to help me order to the guy who gave me an extra bag for my to go. ÊI wanted to hug them and wipe my BBQ smeared mouth all over their shoulders. ÊThat was a bit gross. but yes, cant lose heeeyah....you cant sit heeyuh....this seaits taken....you can sit heeyuh if you want. Êwhatever, i'm losin it.

There are so many reviews and I don't want to repeat anything that has already been said so, We attended an event at the event center last night during Beer Week San Diego, the event was well attended, great beer was served and samplings of Phil's incredible food. With that said, Phil's needs to be added to your bucket list or to your 1000 + 1 places to eat, see and do in your lifetime. The place is always packed, and the food melt in your mouth, dance in your stomach great!!!

4.5 stars. The BBQ here is awesome and the service is really great too. I can see why there's a line that loops partially around the restaurant! First, the lady taking our order saved us about $6 by recommending us to order a full rack instead of 2 half rack orders so that was cool. And, after we ordered we realized they had onion rings so I asked one of the waiters if I can just go to the to-go line and order it instead of waiting in the LONG line again. The waiter instead let us order the rings from her and she immediately came back with our order and receipt! Talk about good service! We left a very generous tip because they did really deserve it :) For our meals, we ordered a full rack of baby back ribs, beef ribs, and chicken. The sides we chose were corn on the cob, baked beans and potato salad. All the sides were very good and they give you a pretty good amount too. The meats were all very tendor and fell right off the bone. The bbq sauce wasn't shabby at all either. We all def enjoyed our meal. But, this place is comparable to other bbq joints in the Bay so I wouldn't take a drive here from Fremont just to have good BBQ unless I'm in the area.

Phil's BBQ is THE BEST BBQ in San Diego. You can tell from the lines that go out the door and wrap around the side of the restaurant that this is one of the best food establishments in San Diego. Ê Everyone that I have introduced to Phil's BBQ (including my boyfriend, his parents, and many of my college friends) have said that this place is delicious. ÊIf you're dining in for dinner, the wait may be around 30-minutes to order. ÊTrust me folks, its worth it. What is good at Phil's? ÊThe baby-back ribs. ÊThey're the best in San Diego, the meat is so soft its falling off the bones, and its covered in the most deliciously sweet and tangy BBQ sauce, you'll want to put the BBQ sauce on your entire meal. ÊA full rack of ribs comes with two small sides or one large side for $18.95 The other thing that makes Phil's BBQ so good are the SIDES. ÊMy favorite sides are the macaroni salad, cole slaw, onion rings, and baked beans (i never liked baked beans until I had the baked beans from Phil's, now I love them). ÊThe way Phil's BBQ makes their sides is different, and they're the best you'll find anywhere! My boyfriend usually goes for the full-slab baby back ribs meals, but I opts for something "smaller". ÊI've had the BBQ Broham sandwich, which is a heaping mound of large chunks of pulled pork on top of a toasted bun, slathered with Phil's delicious BBQ sauce and top with an equally heaping mound of coleslaw. ÊI get the coleslaw on the side. ÊFor $6.45, this sandwich is very filling and sooo delicious. I've also tried the Phil's baby back Rib Tickler, which for $6.45 is VERY affordable and filling. ÊIt comes with 3 bones, 2 onion rings, slaw and fries. They are very generous with their "3 bones," I had more like 5 bones, which was more than enough for. ÊIt came with a lot of the delicious cole slaw and a big handful of fries. ÊFor less than $7, it's a great deal and it'll get you full! One of my favorite restaurants in San Diego, delicious and affordable! ÊI recommend it to all my friends, and they all agree it's the best BBQ in San Diego.

Well, I guess everyone's had a chance to put in their 2 coppers... now its my turn, "Yay"! What can I possibly say about Phil's that hasn't been said already? ÊFirst off, I cannot believe that no one has ever told me about this place. ÊOn the other hand, I would like to shout out a "THANK YOU" to YOU. ÊYes, you! ÊWhy? ÊBecause without the many excellent reviews from my fellow Yelpers, I would have never ventured out to find good ole Phil's BBQ. ÊYou're the best. Ok, onto the review. ÊThis place is fantastic! ÊI was lucky enough to beat the crowd at around 5:30pm on Wednesday. ÊOh yes, that's correct. ÊA Wednesday. ÊPhil's is so popular that it is hella packed pretty much every night their open; according to the manager. ÊI could smell the sweet aroma of barbeque from way out into the parking lot. ÊThe aroma was so thick that it was like an appetizer before you get into the restaurant. My GF ordered the ribless meat dinner and of course, I had the full rack baby! ÊOh yeah! ÊTheir is only one flavor of barbeque sauce here; Phil's finest. ÊThe sauce is so perfect that there is no need for any others. ÊWe ordered our food, got our little vibrating pager that would tell us when our meal is ready, then proceeded to find our table. ÊI couldn't believe how fast our pager went off. ÊOur food was ready to pick up before we even sat down! ÊSweet! ÊHey Claudine S., you were right. ÊSuper fast service. Our food smelled so good and was so pleasing to the eye that I don't think I got enough camera shots off before I began to devour my food. ÊThe sauce was so sweet, sticky, and delicious. ÊI was so in love with my ribs that I nearly gnawed off one of my fingers because it was dripping with sauce and I nearly mistakened it for a rib. The portions were more than enough. ÊThe GFs ribless meat dinner had quite a bit of meat. ÊIt actually had more than my full rack and costed $8 less. ÊWe pretty much switched plates halfway through dinner. ÊShe was saying how it is much more fun to eat from the rib. ÊThis was okay by me because her monster chunks of pork sloshed in Phil's finest was more than I could handle. ÊOur sides consisted of fries, cole slaw, baked bean and the enormous onion rings. ÊWay too much food for 2 people but oh so worth it. I cannot wait to come here again. ÊThe service was pretty good too. ÊMy GF stopped the manager walking by and asked for a take-out box. ÊI was all like, "Hey crazy girl. ÊThe take-out boxes are just over there. ÊWe get em ourselves". ÊThe manager told us, "No problem. ÊJust enjoy your meal and relax. ÊI'll take care of it". ÊWhoa. ÊThat was nice of him. ÊAfter he came back with our boxes, I watched him bounce around the restaurant helping other customers. ÊI was impressed. This place is definitely a "5 Star" in my eyes. ÊI can't wait to tell my friends and family about Phil's BBQ. ÊBest barbeque in town. p.s. I'm still super stoked over the food at Phil's that I had to edit my typoes and grammar in this review at least 8 times. LoL

"Eh, it was aight," said the tourist. I really don't know what the big whoop is was about this place. ÊI've definitely had better and will more than likely choose to eat somewhere else if I have to wait over 20 minutes to dine. Ê Had the ribs, which yes fell off the bone, but I did not find the bbq sauce to be so great. ÊIt was a bit tangy. Ê When we were in line, the attendant warned us that their fryers were not running, therefore they would not be serving fries or onion rings. Ê No kids menu. BOOOO! None of the sides were too fantastic. Ê AGAIN, for a place that makes you wrap around the building to feast on meat, I would expect A LOT MORE! ÊBring out a dancing, talking pig or something.

I have been to Phil's twice now, because of friends who say "OMG OMG OMG PHIL'S IS AMAZING YOU HAVE TO GO". Let's just say, I expected a lot out of Phil's. Unlike others, the times I went didn't have too much of a line. But I was disappointed to find my food completely drenched in sauce. I could not TASTE the meat... all I got was sauce, and unfortunately, the sauce was way too sweet for my tastes. My boyfriend felt the same. Imagine the looks on our friend's faces when we told them we didn't care for Phil's. Everyone freaked out. Maybe we ordered the wrong thing or came on an off day? I prefer Bulls BBQ to Phils, and really don't get what all of the fuss is about. WITH THAT SAID, now knowing that you can get "sauce on the side", I might give that a try and see if that does the trick. If I do, I will update for sure.

Parking isn't too hard to find. The wait is usually around 20-40 minutes. If you check the website, there's a camera that's pointed at the line, and you can tell how long you're going to have to wait. This place is known for their ribs, so I'd suggest you go for the pork or beef ribs, and skip out on the chicken and sandwiches. In my opinion, the chicken is too dry, and the sandwiches don't satisfy. I usually get the half rack of baby back ribs, with a side of macaroni salad and french fries, but if I'm not that hungry, I get the baby back rib sampler.

Pre-addendum: I haven't been to Phil's in about a year, and I hear now that the wait is INSANE...but even with that, I give it 5 stars. Best. Ribs. Ever. But before I get into that, a little note to the outnumbered people that say Phil's isn't real BBQ. There are many types and preparations of BBQ: grilled or smoked, rolled in rub or smothered in sauce, light and tangy or sticky and sweet, Korean or Aussie---you get the picture. I'm no BBQ connoisseur, but I know that much. I happen to like many varieties of BBQ, but I understand if you don't like Phil's deliciously saucy style: more for me, then! ;) Back on topic here. I'm constantly depressed that I didn't learn about Phil's until long after I moved out of SD. I mean, we have good BBQ in SF, but it's all of the smoky style (Memphis Minnie's, Bro In Laws)...at least that I've found. In fact, I was nearly in tears when the BF went to SD sans moi as I knew he'd be going to Phil's at least once---in fact, I forbade him to speak to me about it, lest he desire some serious harm inflicted upon his person. (Yes, my life does indeed revolve around food...pathetic, I know). So last time I was at Phil's, I got the rib and chicken combo. The chicken was quite good, but OMFG the ribs! Falling off the bone and not fatty at all. And I just love the sauce. We got our food to go and ate in Balboa park. It was nothing short of heavenly.

Seriously, what's the big deal? There's a line out the door. TONS of military folks (not hating- my dad was in the Navy), and a whole lotta raucous. I give them top marks for service: -The line went quickly. -The prices were very reasonable. -The food came out very quickly. -All the staff was very friendly. -Management came by to check on us. But the BBQ is SUB-PAR, people. San Diego, where are your taste buds? Are they up your butt? Have you never been to the South? You know, the place where good BBQ comes from. ÊI'm sorry but, the ribs were not that great-at all. The fries were dry. The slaw was pretty good, but: THIS IS A BBQ PLACE AND THE BBQ SUCKS. I hate to be the biatch, but ewwww gross. The meat was tough, and the sauce was horrible- way too acidic and slathered on the ribs. It's fast food BBQ, and the flavor reflects just that. Sloppy work, Phil. The only reason I'd go back is if my family made me go on account of someone's birthday (just like it was today).

I don't know how I have never written a review for Phil's BBQ but its better late than never! I first popped my Phil's cherry after a brutally drunken night at a beach party, meaning..I was waaay hungover with almost no trace of tastebuds in my mouth. Let me get to my point..I had Phil's BBQ as my "hangover" food and it was STILL AMAZING. I have been hooked ever since and I have been back there repeatedly with countless friends and family for a great BBQ meal. Can't decide between baby back ribs or beefy ribs? Ask your friend to get the other and SHARE. Its all about sharing, people :D Personally, I enjoy the beefy ribs more (although the baby back ribs fall off the bone easier). Best sides? Baked beans and coleslaw, but DON'T FORGET TO ORDER ONION RINGS! The "small" order can still feed several people. Phil's is definitely one of the top restaurants to visit if you are from out of town.

I. LOVE. PHIL'S. Good job, San Diego. I'm surprised there are even other restaurants open within a 5 mile radius. If you don't have time to wait in that long line, you can always bypass it by ordering out and gorging at home. Although then you'll miss out on their fantastic, smiley service.

This is more of a "dog pile" review. How much more can you add to a thousand positive comments? Undisputed best in San Diego? I think so. Pros - BEEF RIBS (Why don't other places have this? ) - El Toro Cons ( and what cost them a star) - With success and delicious food comes the price of being insanely busy at times. Drive by on a weekend and the line goes around the building. Even during the off hours it's hard to find a free table. Please open another location!

for baby back ribs, there is no better place in California than Phils BBQ. in addition to the baby back rib, which is a must have, you must order the onion rings. Both the pull pork and brisket sandwiches are good choices. i personally prefer the pulled pork since it comes with coleslaw. The lines are long but it is worth the wait. it is also difficult to get a table but like i said, its worth the trouble. btw, i really miss the old school location on goldfinch. sure miss the days when phils was a hole in the wall restaurant in a residential area.

All the other reviews say it. From someone who grew up in the south, I am impressed. Real BBQ. The line out the door says it all. ADVICE: If you can manage getting there before seven on a weeknight, do it. If not, check out the menu online and phone in your order. However, the line moves pretty quickly because they have about 7 order takers...and then the food came out quickly.

Phil's BBQ is a good CALIFORNIA bbq joint. ÊI want to emphasize the state because five star bbq is definitely not California's strong suit. ÊHowever I did enjoy it and would recommend it for all to try. The baby back ribs are better than the beef ribs. ÊThey are tender and have sauce on it. ÊI didn't see anything on the menu that gives the customer an option of having them dry, but maybe they do. ÊThe sauce was tangy and a bit spicy which was nice. ÊBut overall the ribs were TOO saucy. ÊI had to scrape some off Êbecause it became overwhelming after a while. Ê For the sides, I enjoyed the onion rings and cole slaw. ÊThe onion rings were crispy, not flakey. ÊYou could take a bite and not end up stripping out the entire onion. ÊDon't you hate it when that happens? Ê The cole slaw was definitely not store bought at like Costco or something. ÊThe veggies were fresh and crisp. ÊIt's not overwhelming with mayo like the cheap stuff you find elsewhere. One thing if you didn't know, there is no waiter service. ÊYou order at a counter and pick up the food yourself when its ready. ÊYou get your own refills too. ÊI didn't mind it so much except when I wanted alcohol. ÊYou have to order your alcohol separately in the bar area, which means you have to get in another line besides the food line.

The wait on a Saturday night? Close to an hour, it seemed. Ê Why is it every location I go to in San Diego had a prerequisite of a minimum of an hour long wait?! With the insistence from my cousin, I waited...and waited...and waited. Ê To Phil's defense, the line did move rather quickly BUT because of my hungry stomach growling in retaliation, the wait seemed unbearable. ÊAfter what seemed like eternity, we finally arrived to the front of the line. Ê The set up was your basic cafeteria style restaurant. 1) You order + pay 2) You grab your designated pager 3) Pick a spot to grub 4) When your food is ready, your pager will ring! 5) EAT!! Between my cousin and I, we got the "Full Baby Back Rib Dinner" + corn on cob + macaroni salad + side salad. At first glance, the amount of food seemed inadequate for my cousin AKA garbage disposal and I, the food-eating savage. ÊLuckily, a waiter happened to stop by and we were able to order - on the spot - another (BIG) serving of macaroni salad. Ê I decided to be a good girl and filled myself up with fresh mixed greens before tackling the big and heavy items on my plate. ÊDamn, why did I do that? The ribs were MIND BLOWING. Soft, juicy, moist, fall-off-the-bone-can't-get-enough, flavorful and the list goes on. The macaroni salad was bomblicious. ÊIt had the right amount of mayo and it complimented the sweet and tangy ribs perfectly. ÊAdd hot sauce into the equation and you just got yourself the best-darn-BBQ- that-got-your-lips-smackin-in-anticipation-for-?your-next-trip-out to-San-Diego-for-these-AMAZING-life-changing-ribs. OK, I don't know about "life changing" but they were good. reallllly good. I only wish they could set up shop in SF and add MAC & CHEESE to their menu! *hint hint*

My first, and definitely not my last visit to Phils. I have NEVER seen a line SO long at ANY restaurant. EVER. ÊBut, that's gotta be a sign that it's THAT good. ÊFunny thing, they have signs for an estimated wait time along certain points of the building.... kinda like an amusement park ride line. ÊI Êwent on a Friday night, it was probably a 45 minute wait. ÊI heard it's ridiculously long on a busy nice weathered weekend. When you get to the front of the line, there are several registers where you order your food, kinda like a fast food restaurant. ÊYou wait at your table and pick up your food at the counter when your pager lights up. ÊYou also gather your own silverware and drinks. ÊIf you want beer or adult beverages, you have to go to the bar and order it on your own. ÊThe beer selection is kinda weak. Basically, you don't have a server, just someone to seat you. I ordered Best of Both: Baby Back Ribs & Chicken - 4 Bones and 1/4 chicken, which includes either 2 small sides or 1 large side. ÊI got it with the veggies. The portions are spot on with the pricing. ÊThe food was amazing. ÊI was able to try the coleslaw, potato salad, onion rings, and fries from our groups plethora of food. ÊI cleaned my plate off. ÊEverything was seasoned and sauced perfectly. ÊThe ribs were falling off the bone, the chicken- juicy and tender... Êboth still steaming from being served so quickly. ÊThe "small sides" were actually pretty large portions. ÊSo if you're not super hungry, its easily shareable. I would definitely recommend this place if you don't mind waiting. ÊIf you can't wait, their take out is pretty quick. If I could I'd give this place 10 stars- it's that good.

My coronary arteries lament the day I was introduced to Phil's BBQ. ÊI must confess I've only tried a few items on the menu, but every time I call in an order my inner fat-boy comes to life. I started out on the BBQ Cheese Burger and BBQ chicken breast for my first few visits. ÊBoth are delicious and could feed a small family. Then I dabbled in the BROHAM. ÊExtra meat, extra sauce, and no slaw = a monstrous pile of pulled pork that borders on sex. ÊI'm passionate about food. The meals and customer service have been top notch every time I've given in to my Phil's urges, but I recommend calling in your order instead of waiting in the insanely long lines to get a table (out the door and around the corner).

I'm a bit ashamed to say I only found out about this place my fourth and final year living in SD, but each time I visit I try to make a stop here. ÊAnd I'm not even a big bbq fan. The star of Phil's show are the baby back ribs. ÊThey are fall-off-the-bone tender with a refreshingly tangy-sweet bbq sauce. ÊTheir beef ribs are good too, but not as tender and succulent as the baby back. ÊMy favorite side is the macaroni salad. ÊGenerous portions and fast service (at least, once you get through the line). Ê And for football fans, there are TVs everywhere to keep you updated on the game in case you pause from licking bbq sauce off your fingers.

I don't know, maybe I just don't get it but I don't love this place like everyone else. ÊThe food is just mediocre to me and the wait is ridiculous. ÊThe food is always drenched in so much BBQ sauce that I can't taste anything but the sauce. ÊThe only thing I've ever eaten here that I've actually enjoyed was an onion ring...go figure. Ê But, my boyfriend loves this place, so I guess I'll continue to be dragged to Phil's and hope that I discover something that knocks my socks off.

Lines out the door 11' o clock in the morning! That's gotta say something about this restaurant. This is actually my second time here. The first time was about a year ago. My friends brought me here and ever since then, when I think of San Diego, this place pops up in my head. What I ordered: BBQ ribs with side of cole slaw and onion rings. The meat on this rib falls off and the taste is just amazing. Every bite is an explosion of flavor. It's kind of addictive.

I waited for an hour and a half for this meal, which was quite unfortunate since it was rainy and cold outside. However, the food made up for it. ÊThe sauce is what makes this barbeque really special. ÊI normally don't care for beef ribs since most places make them dry, but I enjoyed the beef ribs here. ÊI also liked the mashed potatoes, onion rings, and baby backs. ÊI do not recommend the chicken here though.

Broham sandwich you never fail me. So juicy, tender... and... BBQ-ey. And the coleslaw just adds to the whole experience. Don't forget the stack of onion rings. A small stack will satiate 2 people. The boo says the El Toro is good too, but the Broham is more tender and the meat has more flavor. Last time I came here, I arrived 10 minutes before they opened and we were 10th in line. A longer line of about 40 people formed behind us by the time the place opened. Needless to say, get here early if you want to avoid the long lines, although they do move quickly.

Good luck finding a spot around the area while you still have to wait in line. -Wait is approximately 40ish minutes if you're around the corner Perks: -It's worth the wait! :) -Large portions -Clean facility -Decent prices -Savory BBQ baby back ribs, beef ribs and chicken! (baby back was my favorite) -Coleslaw is awesome -Yummy onion rings with ranch! -Combo Ribs & Chicken is good enough to share (unless you've got a big appetite) Overall: highly recommend checking this place out if you are in the SD area!

Wowwie wow wow WOW I'm from Montana and have had "BBQ" maybe 3 times in my life while visiting Texas. So I admittedly do now know my BBQ. My husband and I have walked by so many times and nearly died drooling from the smell, but each time we are around the line is so long and we're usually too starving to wait. We made a special trip to go here yesterday, and we were both thrilled. We had the boneless pork shoulder and each piece of meat was jut flawless. No gristle or fat chunks -- pure perfection. Awesome fries. The portions are just massive. I really loved the sauce. It was an excellent meal and I really want to try more menu items soon.

I mean, the baby back ribs and chicken were good, but not 'wait 30 minutes in muggy irritating heat good'. If I needed a fix and opted for the phone-in and pick up, then it may have been a better experience. ÊBut spending enough time to watch a favorite sitcom at a place where you order up at the register, I was expecting some explosive mind-boggling ribs. Oh, and for you hardcore BBQ eaters, NO BRISKET!

Geez people - have you ever had real barbecue? ÊI understand that San Diego is very limited to this type of 'cuisine' but Phil's is not a 5 star worthy restaurant. ÊNot even close. The new location is far better than the old but it operates even more like a high-production factory. ÊYou can almost see the ribs being assembled in a line by robots behind the register. ÊParking is still just as bad because the lot is packed and shared with 42 other businesses. I'll admit the food isn't awful - in fact I think it is well prepared - but THEN it gets doused in a not so pleasant bbq sauce. ÊThis sauce, though sweet, Carolina style?, is also sour and strangely jelly like. ÊTo me, the most important part of bbq is the sauce you baste over it just before its done and Phil's is just wrong. Ê So yes, I hate the sauce. I hate the long line for a dirty table. I hate the feeling that you need hurry up and eat and get the eff out of there. ÊI hate the location of the soda fountain and did I mention I hate their sauce? ÊTheir onion rings are the kind where the batter doesn't stick to the onion, so you take a bite and the entire onion pulls out. ÊTheir fries suck...probably Safeway brand frozen fries dumped in a deep fryer. ÊTheir slaw is also probably a food service vat kept chilled in the back fridge because it is nothing to write home about (but I guess I'm writing about it here). I would totally give them another star if they had different sauce varieties and didn't make you feel so rushed after waiting 48 minutes for a table. So my recommendation venture away from San Diego for a bit for some real bbq then come back and right your review...I guarantee you won't give it 5 stars. UPDATE: So someone that works at Phil's writes this message: John So much hate....sorry we couldn't live up to your BBQ standards...luckily we did Êfor 800 other yelpers with 5 stars. ÊBTW- fresh cut fries, clean tables, highest quality meats and ingrediants. ÊWe also believe that "real BBQ" tastes great. ÊIf you do venture back try the sauce on the side. Thanks Fred If he has 800- 5 star reviews why does my review bother him so much. Ê Seriously Fred, don't take this so personal. ÊDid you invent the sauce? If so, then yah, you should feel somewhat defeated. Telling me to get the sauce on the side is like telling me to order pizza the next time I want BBQ. ÊWhy not just take my criticisms and consider some improvements? Ê I did say the food was well prepared - except for those fries (Bluck...don't believe they're fresh) and notice he didn't mention the food service vat of cole slaw they serve. (Bluck times 100). ÊCan you really trust a guy that can't even spell ingredients??? Spell check is easy. And no, the tables are not clean, if you are lucky they are 'wiped down'.

Phil's BBQ IS SO GOOD!! People come from all over to eat here. Whenever I have a friend come in from out of town, I always take them to Phil's because they will never be disappointed. Whether you get the chicken or the ribs, it is cooked to perfection and lathered with their delicious homemade BBQ sauce. My usual is the 1/4 chicken dinner (1/2 chicken if I want to have extra to take home). The El Toro (I think that's what it's called) sandwich is a HUGE pile of meat... Props if you can finish it all in one sitting. The beans and the potato salad are both really good sides. The fries are not as crispy as I usually like my fries, but they'll definitely fill your plate and your stomach, Only thing... be prepared to wait. The line does move fairly quickly as long as you don't go at peak dinner time. You can't make reservations, so I don't recommended going here with a large group. If they see that you are a large group, they will find a way to accommodate you, but you will wait. If you live in SD and have never been to Phil's, then you need to get with the times and go to Phil's.

I was so amped up to come to Phil's BBQ after reading all the raving reviews on Yelp, but was completely disappointed after having experienced the restaurant first-hand. I went there after 9pm on a Tuesday night (off night) and while the line wasn't too bad: 15 minutes, it still took us another 20 minutes to get our food After we ordered= wack. Any real BBQ joint in Texas like Rudy's: http://www.yelp.com/biz/É or any of them- you order and you get your food on the spot. It does not mean it's not 'fresh' it just means they prepare for the volume of customers at hand. You would think with how busy Phil's is they would have a more efficient system in place to get your food served and get you out of there. But instead, they try to make it 'fancy' in that they have some busser come around and act as a server and bring you napkins, silverware, etc. but instead of a help, it's really more of a nuissance. Just give me my darn food and let me eat! haha. As far as the food goes- very average. The BBQ sauce had too much of a 'bite' to it: i.e., tangy, sweet. There was only one choice of sauce. And the meat- both chicken and baby back ribs did not have a great taste; at all. The ez-wipes they give you have got to be the cheapest wet naps I've ever seen in my life. They are no greater than 4 inches in diameter and rip at touch=cheapo. All in all my main gripe is the food is just OK and certainly not worth the wait. I've heard they have waits of over an hour most nights= ridiculous. I wouldn't want more than 10 minutes for Phil's. If you never experienced a good BBQ restaurant then Phil's will probably be tasty and fun for you. But if you've eaten quality BBQ then Phil's just doesn't cut it.

MUST-STOP-BY-PHIL'S You know when a joint is crackin when the line to get in runs in around the restaurant outside! Good news is the line goes by fast...because you order your food like a fast food joint and grab your food and find a seat. I believe this is by far THE BEST BBQ I've ever had!

ÊI'm just sad that I live in LA so far away =( Doesn't matter what you order...Baby back ribs, pulled pork sandwich, bbq chicken...the meat is juicy, tender and full of flavor! ÊYou can always tell if someone knows their BBQ by their baked beans- it's not too sugary and served thick. ÊONION RINGS are the bomb over here! ÊSan Diego always has a special batter that you don't find in LA... it was thick and crunchy and worthy of an addiction. ÊMust be the water!

I've been hearing so much hype about this place for many years.. I finally went. In disagreement with most here..I wasn't impressed. This place is overpriced for what was given. The portions are large, but that doesn't make up for it's lacking in quality and flavor..I felt like I was choking on shoe strings whilst eating my my Pulled Pork sandwhich. The meat, extremely dry. The sauce wasn't anything special.. Slaw.. ehhhhhhh.. Êbland BBQ Beans had no real punch to it.. I'm not a fan of fried food.. but the Beer Battered Onion Rings are the only decent thing I had tried, which gives Phil's my Êtwo star rating.

Hmm, what can I say? I can't give a very good review of this place because well.. I'm not a 'barbecue ribs' type of person. Anyhow, I'll do my best. I've only been here two times and both times I have ordered the baby rib dinner(?), sorry I don't remember the name. So yeah I guess it's good, but I don't like how it's spicy. They should give you a choice of mild or spicy. I ordered it with fries and macaroni salad. First off, I've had better macaroni salad and secondly... I LOVE their french/freedom/american/deep-fried potato fries! I think that's the only thing that I truly like/love from this 'establishment'. If you know me, you would know that I usually like my fries like I like my (fill in the blank), and that is thick! That's how I like 'em, but on the contrary, these fries here weren't and I still love them and think they taste amazing! And another thing... I'm not a fan of the onion rings. They're too oily and too much batter was used. As a result, they can be really hard at times. (That's what I said) So yeah, I understand that lots of people love it, but disagree with me if you'd like.

This place really does have either one of or the best American bbq in San Diego. 4 out of 5 San Diegans will tell you the same. After having it plenty of times after school at Mesa College i'm starting to think its a little too sweet. But still though, shit is good when you're craving some barbeque. Portions are always huge and every side i've tried was good, including the onion rings, potato salad, macaroni salad, slaw, and fries. If you're not into white chicken meat, and you like ribs, get the ribs and chicken "best of both." It really is enough for two, but fuck it, why not enjoy the extras for later? shiiieet niggaaaa Finally, i've had both the beef and the baby back ribs. The beef is overall better, a little more tender and is bigger (that's what she said). Too bad they don't do spare ribs or offer rice as a side

Not that Phil's BBQ needs any more referrals, since this place is crazy BUSY, and even more so after being featured on the Travel Channel (Man vs Food). Business was bustling back when it was on Goldfinch St and Washington Ave in Hillcrest (except on when closed on Mondays). I swear that I'm going to try different menu items, but I can't get away from the usual food I love (more often than I should perhaps, i.e. my pic). My only wish list items are: 1) that the fries should be crisp like their onion rings, 2) that they add beef brisket on the menu, and 3) that they relocate in the sports arena to accomodate parking and dining room space for more hungry foodies. This isn't a debate over any BBQ bias from "traditional" areas in the Midwest and Southeast regions. ÊJust understand that people don't mind standing in line for food they really want. The line to place an order for eating in the dining room is out the door and stretches around the building. They'll occasionally check on the line to see if there are huge groups so they can organize tables in advance before the group's food order is taken. The atmosphere is casual and can get noisy at times because of the large crowds and good times being had. Don't want to stand in line to enjoy the full Phil's BBQ experience? If there are barstools available, you can bypass the line and sit down to place your order and eat at the bar. The other option is to call ahead and take it to-go. When you pick up a large catering order, the disposable aluminum pans are stored in stackable styrofoam containers for easy transport, and they are happy to help you load your car. ÊThey'll ask that you return the styrofoam. Everyone there is friendly and the people buzzing around the dining room are promptly clearing off tables. Even though there are no actual table servers, there is always someone around to check on your from time to time to see if you're ok or if you need help with to-go boxes because you ordered too much food, again. The line can move like molasses, so be patient. Enjoying the full Phil's experience with friends is well worth the wait. Don't forget the wetnaps when you're done enjoying the BBQ love.

I have heard a lot about Phil's so decided to give it a try. ÊGuess San Diego isn't much of a BBQ town.

Apparently, based on these reviews, people in San Diego haven't been anywhere else in the county to taste real BBQ. What is real BBQ? Meat slowly smoked over a wood fired pit. PERIOD. Phil's doesn't do this. They cook the meat in an oven then "finish" it on a grill. How can you tell it's fake? - There is no "smoke ring" in the product. This reddish color that can be seen in the first Êinch of the meat, and can only happen if meat is slow smoked over wood or charcoal. It may taste good to folks who've never tried real BBQ, and that's OK, but please don't say this is REAL BBQ. Ê Place is busy, stand in a line, get some semi- OK meat products, slathered in sauce to cover the dry bits.

ÊWe had just walked out of two different bars downtown (Yardhouse - 15 minutes there and we were treated with such attitude by one of the servers and no one even came over to take our order!!! then the crab place next door, 5 minute there and everyone ignored us)...Sick of the downtown vibe we headed to Phils and it was like night and day! Despite it being late, the servers showed us some of the best service I have ever experienced. My beer came ice cold and right away. Fries, onion rings, ribs for my boyfriend all lucsious and amazing. TRIED THE WHOOPIE PIE for the first time - SINFULLY DELICIOUS and actually sooo much more tasty than it looks!!

This place is the place to go for ribs! ÊAs far as BBQ goes this place is the king of ribs. ÊThey dont offer brisket though and their pulled pork doesnt have much menu space, but it is some good pulled pork. Only thing I didnt love were the fries, but there are many other sides to choose from. I went midday on a Thursday and the line was only about 5 - 10 mim. long.

Phil's effin rocks! Before Phil's I couldn't (or wouldn't) eat meat on a bone. Then, after trying Phil's, I fell in love with ribs! People who know me couldn't believe it. I actually thought about getting an "I heart ribs" shirt after eating here. No kidding! I'm also not really a beer drinker but holy crap, put their ribs together with a tasty glass of cold beer while sitting at the bar and I'm in heaven. This place is crazy busy whenever we go on the weekends. The line is literally wrapped around the corner. It's. That. Good. I usually get the ribs and chick-less dinner which is ribs and some delicious, mouth-watering chunks of chicken. All smothered in that wonderful bbq sauce! It comes with 2 sides and all of their sides are yummy! I like the fries and slaw, but they have others to choose from. As other people have pointed out, don't wear white on your trip to Phil's. It won't be white when you leave. This place is great! My mouth is watering just thinking about it. Go, check it out, it's that good. You'll thank me afterward!

It's no Rudy's if you know what I mean. otherwise, its a pretty good BBQ joint.. but no brisket. Baby back, beef ribs, grilled chicken, sandwiches, burgers, tons of sides.. We waited in line for about 15 minutes on a Saturday night at 8:30 PM. I got the half and half with coleslaw and mac salad. My boyfriend got fries and cole slaw and our friend got a burger. We decided to get a small order of onion rings too and it just turned out to be way too much food. HUGE portions everyone! The meats were covered in BBQ sauce. The cole slaw was mmmm. You can tell its fresh and not stinky. Mac salad was great too, except for some reason I always get headaches (?!?) Thumbs up: cole slaw! friendly service. ribs were good. chicken is juicy. all you can drink fountain drinks, sinks for washing of the hands Thumbs down: fries were nothing special. onion rings were battered way too much and made it oily and not crunchy.

We went here for one of my roomie's birthday celebration. ÊThere were about 10 of us, so seating us took a bit considering the line was starting to wrap around the corner of the building. It had been a while since I'd eaten ribs, so naturally, I ordered them. ÊJust a half rack, but they were pretty finger lickin' good. ÊI liked the rolls of paper towels for napkins. ÊThat's about all you need at a BBQ joint. Of course beer was there. ÊBeer is my friend and where there is beer there is a smiley Lahnna. ÊNo Sierra, but Arrogant Bastard took care of me as an adequate carnivorous complement. Ê Tons of fries. ÊBut the real surprise were the flippin' beans! ÊSo so good! ÊLike, wow! So, yeah, here is my wrap up. ÊPhil's BBQ is awesome. ÊMeat eaters, enjoy!

911 reviews? ÊWhat is there to say about Phil's that everyone else hasn't? ÊThat it's the best bbq in town? That the rib meat falls off the bone? That you could drink the sauce by the ladle? Ê Seriously, folks. ÊNothing to see here; get out and experience it for yourself. ÊJust don't get the jones on a Monday, when Phil's is closed. Truly, Phil's is a local institution. ÊIt's crowded as heck, so avoid the rush hours -- though even then, be thankful you have a prayer of finding a seat in the larger Sports Arena digs versus the original Mission Hills shop. And while it's true that there is better bbq to be had in this world, you're not going to find it around here.

Great ribs, great rings, poor value. My friend brought me here in April of 2007 with the intention of introducing me to one of the best San Diego food joints (In & Out was eaten soon thereafter). ÊI had a sandwich (I can't remember which one) and I didn't understand all the ranting and raving for this place. I gave Phil's another try this last Sunday. ÊWe ordered for pickup and were happy when we arrived to see a line of 50ish people extending around the restaurant's corner. Ê We got a full rib combo with slaw, fries and an order of onion rings. ÊThe fries were great and the rings were even better. ÊI was definitely impressed with the taste of the pork ribs but for all that food (not much) it was 25 bucks. ÊI'll be going back but the value isn't there.

Finally came to Phil's BBQ on a Sunday afternoon (~3:30PM) and waited in line for a little over an hour. I've heard so much about this place and did it disappoint? Not at all! My favorite was the baby back rib but the beef ribs were also very good and the meat just fell off the bone. We also got the potato salad side, french fries, and corn. All were good delicious except the fries were just regular fries, nothing special. I deducted one star for the long wait - I know it's not really their fault bc it's just so darn good and popular, but I don't think I'd wait an hour for their food again. Instead, I'll probably phone-in my order and eat elsewhere next time. Definitely a must-try though!

Ê this is my first time here, and i was expecting a reeeeally long wait. well first thing is first, i'm a recovering vegetarian....so i really don't know how to compare this to other bbq places. Êit was good haha, thats all i can tell you. Êbut they need to add macaroni and cheese to the menu.

WOW. From the 45mins+ wait outside you KNOW this place is going to be delicious. However after reading a Quick Tip about seating yourself in the bar, we opted for that and skipped the wait and sat down right away. We were greeted and given menus right away (aka: placemats) by super friendly waiter who you could tell loved his job. I asked if I could get a ribless (meat pulled off the bone for you) Êand chickless (chucks of breast meat) Êcombo with slaw n fries, he said "not on the menu but OF COURSE" , thats what I like to hear!!! Food came out quickly. It was beyond words. This is REAL BBQ. Perfect sauce, perfect meat. I cannot name one downside at all. This alone made me want to move to SD.

Love the BBQ but hate the wait! Last weekend, I dined-in for the first time ever... I have always had Phil's either catered or called-in because the line is the longest I've seen for any restaurant. It was a good thing I had a little snack before coming to dinner because the anticipation, and the smell, of BBQ makes a hungry person go mad. For a mere $12, I had the Best of Both Worlds (why make a girl choose?) - Pork ribs with a quarter chicken (white meat), with a side of cole slaw and potato salad. If you're a fan of corn, I suggest switching the two (small) sides for a corn on the cobb. Now, I eat a lot, especially when I'm hungry and have been waiting 30-45 minutes for dinner, but MAN, I barely touched my chicken (I ate all my ribs first)! Needless to say, somebody had a tasty lunch the next day. Really, at Phil's, you can't go wrong if you enjoy BBQ. If you've got time on your hands, the wait is worth it. Just be sure to not come when you're starving.

I used their catering service for a work event at Mission Bay. ÊThis was by far the easiest event thanks to Phil's BBQ! ÊI called up Sara and let her know when/where and how many and she helped me decide what we would need. All I had to do was show up! ÊThey arrived an hour before our event and set up tables and all the trays. ÊThe food arrived 15 minutes before the event was scheduled to start. ÊSo by the time the first of 120 people showed up - all the food was ready to go and I was working on my tan (okay sunburn). Ê Once everyone was eating the servers walked around cleaning up debris and even wrapped up leftovers for people. Only drawbacks were that the salad and potato salad ran out too fast and they weren't the cheapest option...but they were certainly the easiest and the food was excellent as usual.

I was meeting a few friends for dinner and when I arrived I was stunned to see the line out the door. ÊLuckily, they arrived early so we only waited about 15 minutes for a table. The waitstaff were friendly and extraordinarily efficient. ÊAlthough, if you're a slow eater like myself that efficiency could make you feel rushed. DISCLAIMER: I'm not a fan of BBQ sauce (my friends think I'm crazy & I very well could be) however, I don't let that get in the way of trying something new. I ordered the 1/4 chicken dinner with french fries ($6.75). ÊSmall price for tons of food. Despite of the BBQ sauce, I thought the chicken was perfectly cooked and delicious as it was tender and juicy. Most of my french fries were covered with BBQ sauce and being as how I'm not a fan, I only ate a few of those fries. ÊThe ones that weren't covered I thought to be bland.

This place is dellliccciousss! ÊI found this place on Yelp so decided to give it a try since there were so many good reviews on it. ÊWhen my boyfriend and I got there the line was out the door. ÊWe were about to turn our car around and go somewhere else but we chose to stay and wait since we were already there. ÊAnd plus we're not from SoCal so when are we ever going to come back again to try this place out. ÊWe probably waited in line for about 30 minutes which is not bad. ÊAnd I do recommend sticking it out and waiting because its really that good. This is not the typical restaurant where they seat you and then you order from a waiter/waitress. ÊYou order at the front and then they give you this pager. ÊYou then walk around and look for a seat. ÊWhen the pager goes off you go up to the front and pick up your food. Ê They have a pretty decent selection on food ranging from chicken, hamburgers to your typical ribs. ÊWe went with the Baby Back Ribs since that's what they're known for. ÊI got the quarter rib dinner which comes in 4 bones and 2 small sides or a large side. ÊI went with the 2 small sides of macaroni salad and fries. ÊI also got a large side of corn. ÊMy boyfriend got the half rib dinner (6 to 7 bones) with sides of cole slaw and potato salad. ÊThe ribs were really really good! ÊThe meat was really tender. ÊThe meat just fell right off of the bone. ÊAnd it had this really strong hickory taste to it. ÊI loved it! Ê The atmosphere and the service was above excellent. ÊOur waiter Louis was awesome. ÊAt one point my boyfriend accidentally spilled my cup of water on the floor. ÊLouis came right away to clean up the mess. ÊHe later came back with a fresh roll of towel and also a large cup of water for me. ÊHe's a sweetheart. Ê The price on the food is decent. ÊFor the both of us we spent about $25 which is not bad at all. Ê Loved this place and I hope to come back again soon!

Really, the only reason to give Phil's any less than 5 stars is if you're the type to prefer turkey hot dogs over delicious, delicious ribs. ÊI'm sure there are delicious ribs elsewhere, no doubt, but at the same price and consistent quality, well that's just ludicrous. If Phil were real, I would probably marry him, figure out his secrets to his ridiculously amazing ribs, then divorce him to take half his rib assets. ÊAnd maybe some of the pork and bean assets. ÊOkay, and the rib-kids we would undoubtedly have. RIBS!

If you like BBQ you would like this place. This place has the traditional BBQ pork ribs and but... more importantly it has BBQ beef ribs. So there was 4 of us total in the party. We ordered two dishes. One being the Full baby back ribs and the other being full beef ribs. We selected 4 small sides that came with the ribs. The four being mac salad, coleslaw, fries, and well... I forget the 4th one. But... I have to say... They are all phenomonal. Ê ÊI would have to prefer the baby back over the beef ribs more because of how tender pork was. The beef rib was good that it was big, juicy and quite meaty. ÊThe fries... ohh the fries were excellent. They were like how "mama make it" Ê Well... I don't really know what else to say other than the service is pretty timely and the food is excellent. :) If you crave BBQ in San Diego... come check it out. :)

Oh Phils, how i miss thee.... One of the things i miss most from when i left P.B.... I can still taste their zesty bbq sauce on my mouth... Way back,me and my foxy lady used to go here a lot. ÊI know this is gonna sound really bad, but i am a san diego native and had no clue this place even existed until she kept goin on about "Phils BBQ". ÊSo one day we went, and i fell in-love. Ê Now, 2 years after i learned about the best bbq by far in sd, i still go to Phils whenever im near by. ÊI still order pretty much the same thing, El Toro, Ribs & Chicken, Side of Coleslaw, Beans and Onion Rings, 3 ranches and a bev. ÊThey have great beverages. Ê Phils is awesome, i wouldn't recommend taking a 1st date here, but its a cool place to get some grub and even catch a game. Ê I've ordered almost everything on the menu, i do not like the chick-less (Boneless chicken) its like way super dry, the burger? ÊIts an average burger, not worth getting when your at the best bbq joint in town. All in all, come to Phils, ask Antonio Cromartie, he ate here like 80 days in a row at one time, this is the spot, like down south bbq.

I went there again recently and had a great experience. It was at meal time but it was not on a weekend so it wasn't totally crazy like the time before, where ordering and getting your food was like having to wait to ride on Space Mountain. This time I got the "fast pass" (Another Disneyland reference for those who didn't catch that). We know the system pretty well now so we just call ahead and then go to the pick-up order window and get the food to go, or you can take it to the bar and eat it there. I got the pulled pork sandwich this time and it was pretty mouth watering. I would have bumped them up to yet even another star if the meat could be mouth melting as opposed to just watering. What? You say. What's the difference? The difference is that there is mouth watering good and then there's amazing- want- to-eat-this-meat- for-the-rest-of-my-life-because-it-just-melts-in-?my-mouth good. When the meat is so tender you can have no teeth but still eat it. What the heck am I even talking about? The meat is probably as tender as you will ever find. ÊI'm giving them 5 stars. Their food is friggin awesome. I just don't like the lines, but I have figured my super special secret way around that, (which I just shared with the world wide web on Yelp damn it). Anyways, after not having logistical problems getting my food anymore, and after trying a couple more great entrees and sides, I now conclude that this place pretty much rocks! I love BBQ food and this is the best place I have found in San Diego so far.

When we arrived we saw a long line and weren't sure if I wanted to wait for bbq ribs. ÊBut if you had any doubt just park the car and roll down your windows, the smell of smoke meat greets you and suddenly waiting in line for a rack of bbq ribs don't seem too bad. A long line wrapped around the block and people still smiling at every inch they are closer to that front door. Here's what you need to know: -Casual Dining -You order at a cashier/counter and they give you a buzzer. ÊOnce your buzzer goes off you are to go to the front counter and pick up your meal. -It is dine in with no reservations, this is not a typical restaurant. Ê -Wear a dark shirt -you must try their chocolate whoopie pie (not on the menu but is for sale at the front counter) Their ribs falls right off the bone and their beef ribs have a ton of meat, unlike some ribs you get at other bbq restaurants. Ê Service: ÊO. M. G. Êthat's all I have to say... They were all friendly and so nice. ÊAlways wanting to help and they smile all the time. ÊIt's amazing to have a great meal and there's no lack in service. ÊFrom the counter to the bus boys to the bbq crew (they dont' call themselves waiters) it was a great experience and a must stop in whenever you're in San Diego. ÊTry them out, you won't be disappointed.

The food here is great, and of course the BBQ ribs were the highlight of my dinner. The one quality that meat has to have, in my opinion, is juiciness because if the meat is dry, the flavor isn't as great. And Phil's BBQ ribs are juicy. And flavorful. So juicy that the meat just fell off the bones. I ordered a half rack with a corn on the cob on the side and I really liked the corn too, so bonus points for that!! I love my corn fresh and crisp, so it was perfect. I ididn't have any experience with bad customer service, so my experience here was ace. This place gets CRAZY lines though! Crazy as in it wraps around the outside of the restaurant! I find it funny that there is actually a sign over a certain point in the line indicating that the wait from that point is about 20 minutes. The line does not take ridiculously long to get moving since most people go there in large groups, but it still takes a while, so plan ahead so you don't end up waiting forever!

Finally went there when my friend and fellow Yelper Steve took me there for my birthday. Upon arriving for lunch, the line was super long. There was a minimum 1 hour wait, and we didn't nearly stick out but we decided to stay. So glad we did! While the wait was an hour long, it actually went quickly. Once we entered, placed our order, found a table... in about 5 minutes we got our order. We each had the bbq pork ribs and chicken lathered with tons of bbq sauce with sides of cole slaw and potato salad. Not to forget we shared onion rings. The ribs were perfect. The meat practically fell off the bone! I could have done without the chicken but its still worth trying if you have not yet. The customer service was excellent with all their workers completely upbeat and helpful!

Let's just say that I don't normally like ribs or barbecue sauce. ÊI initially came in here with family (all of whom love ribs and had heard about Phil's legendary meals) and ordered corn on the cob and fries. ÊAt the prodding of my 15-year-old cousin, I tried a bite of her riblets. ÊThey were AMAZING!!!! ÊSoft meat, the sauce so good, I immediately began sneaking bites off of her plate!

All I can base my five star rating on is from my experience of BBQ restaurants I have been to, and growing up in Southern California for the last 28 years. ÊI have never been to Texas, or experienced any of the BBQ you see on the Food Network where they go to these little Redneck towns to secret BBQ locations. ÊSo maybe somewhere out there in Texas, there is better barbecue than Phil's. ÊThis is the best BBQ you are going to experience anywhere around here. Yes, the lines are long. ÊNo, it doesn't get knocked down for that. ÊJust place a phone order before you leave. ÊIt is soooooo easy!!! I enjoy the beef ribs, and the broham.

My first time ever and I have lived in San Diego my entire life!!! I think the reason I stayed away were the rumors I heard about the long lines...but foolish me, a line a mile long would have made it worth the wait. As it was, although the line was long, the wait was short. The restaurant is very organized and as soon as a register is open you are directed to it by a very friendly, very chatty beautiful black lady who is part hostess, part show director and part Phil's diplomat. She was handing out magnets which are very handy for putting on your fridge both at work and home. So unlike most rib lovers, I do not care for pork ribs, I am a beef rib lady all the way to the grave, so I ordered a beef rib plate which came with one fat ass rib, 2 KILLER batter dipped and fried onion rights and some righteous but not sweet cole slaw. Oh yeah, a TON of homemade french fries which were very good but truly dude, there was like half a pound!! The rib was perfectly sauced, as I took my first bite I closed my eyes and thought Êto myself " So this is what some folks mean when they say Ê~heaven on earth~." OMG...tender, somewhat sweet....I wish I could have had ten more but I was at lunch with friends and didn't want to freak them out. The service was excellent, the cashier was very helpful and after you place your order you are given a buzzer which lets you know when your food is ready. Honestly that place was as busy as a bee hive but everything happened in a timely fashion, Êno undue waiting, kudos to the great mind who thought the process through, from standing in line, to waiting for the food at the first open table (and there were plenty.) Dirty dishes are picked up on a regular basis, drinks come from an all you-can-drink fountain including get this...Kool Aid...and there are rolls of papertowels on the table. Outside the bathrooms is a big, long, wide sink with several faucets and lots of soap dispensers and paper towel holders...GENIUS!. The only teeny, tiny little suggestion I would have would be to possibly add another restroom...only two toilets for such a big restaurant? Well, I had to go and I have very little pride so I made like the Europeans and used the boys room. A very handsome young man came over to ask us how our food was and was startled when we told him it was our first time even though we are all natives..(.I was going to insert a joke here about beef ribs but thought against it) Anyway Phil, if you ever read these reviews, please know that you have another customer for life. You guys rock!

Yummy, yummy, yummy, I got love in my tummy! ÊThis place simply has the best BBQ I have ever had! ÊEvery time I step into Phil's, I feel like I've just entered an eating marathon in which I'm not allowed to utter a word until my stomach is hanging over the top of my pants. I normally order the half rack baby back ribs with fries and macaroni salad. ÊI have also tried the beefy ribs and the El Toro sandwich. The baby back ribs are money! ÊSo fine, fresh, and FIERCE! ÊThe meat is so juicy and tender that it just falls off the bones. ÊThe ribs have a nice not-too-heavy coat of sauce on them--I don't like it when restaurants spill excessive amounts of sauce onto their foods and then serve them to customers. ÊFinger-licking good! ÊI can hear angels singing every time I take my first few bites into this heavenly goodness. The beefy ribs are MASSIVE with huge chunks of meat clinging onto thick bones! ÊThey're literally like the size of my forearm! ÊThese have to be eaten using two hands because if you try to lift them up with one hand, you might break your arm. ÊI found these a little dry and tougher to eat, so I do not enjoy them as much as I enjoy the baby back ribs. ÊAlso, have some paper towels nearby; they become handy after your BBQ sauce facial. The El Toro tri-tip sandwich was disappointing for me. ÊMy cousin ordered this, and I tried a little of the meat. ÊIn addition to being cruelly drenched in BBQ sauce, it was overwhelmingly smoky to the point where it tasted a little bitter. ÊIt's like I volunteered to be trapped in a burning room to taste-test some smoke. Now, please excuse me as I wipe drool off my face and go heat up some leftover ribs to eat. ÊNom.

Finally, I get to review Phil's! ÊI had been here a couple of times several years back, but this is the first time I've attended ever since joining Yelp. So, I took my friend Wendy M. G. here for a belated birthday lunch over the weekend. ÊI had warned her about the wait, but even when we arrived at about 1:30 pm, the line was daunting to look at. ÊFor a while, we even considered leaving, but as we were already there and Wendy was really looking forward to going here, we stuck around - and we were glad we did. After waiting in line for an hour, within five minutes of placing our order, we got our food. ÊWe both ordered the 1/2 chicken, 1/2 baby back rib plate with potato salad and cole slaw. ÊAdditionally, we split an order of onion rings. ÊAs always, the ribs were amazing, and the chicken (while a little hard to cut through) was delectable. ÊThe cole slaw wasn't that crisp, but one can tell that it was made fresh in house. ÊThe potato salad, though... mmm, good! ÊAnd the onion rings are simply to die for! The beverage bar is well stocked with various sodas and teas. ÊAlso, Crystal Light is on tap - a fact that surprised and delighted this diabetic who's a bit tired of quaffing his thirst with diet soda. The restaurant itself is clean and tidy, no matter how bustling it is. ÊThe restrooms even have those awesome Dyson hand dryers I went crazy for at Westfield North County Fair. ÊAnd, the staff are helpful and friendly; keep an eye out for the 6'2" staffer who filled the ice in the soda fountain WITHOUT using a stepstool! Great food, great service, and great times here... over a thousand 5-star reviews on Yelp (as the outdoor menu hanging over the entrance states), and now they can add one more to the tally! ÊNo bones about it, Phil's truly is the best barbecue in San Diego!

I LOVE BBQ. ÊAt Phil's, you get the fall of the bone, tender baby back ribs that are so delicious, it will knock your socks off. ÊYou order first and then get seated, not your typical sit down place. ÊBut hey this works and your get your food pretty quickly. ÊAttentive service too. ÊThey got some food beans too. I will definitely be returning to this establishment again.

After all the years of hype and excitement about Phil's BBQ, I finally had the chance to visit the renowned restaurant. And did it live up to the hype? The food was good and flavorful, yes. But maybe since all of my friends had made it seem like THE PLACE for ribs and all things BBQ I was imagining: grade A+++ sauce, tender, moist, fall-off-the-bone meat, and delish side dishes. Soo I must say I was a tad disappointed. I was not extremely impressed by the sauce. It was tangy and sweet, but perhaps a little too tangy for me, or perhaps there was too much sauce on the ribs. The sauce hid the slight dryness of the baby back ribs, and the meat was not as tender as I had imagined. I ordered the fries and baked beans as side dishes, and both were good. Add a few dashes of the Tony's Creole seasoning (found on the tables) onto the fries and you're good to go! The fries were very crispy and I liked how they kept the skin on, which added more depth to the flavor. I tried my friend's macaroni salad, which was nothing to rave about. Plain, creamy, and that's about it. There's always a line (so I hear) but the line moves quickly, so don't be deterred! You might have to walk around the restaurant a few times to find a place to sit during busy hours, but the wait staff are quick and friendly. I'll go back and try the ribs one more time and hopefully it'll be a bit more tender *crosses fingers*. But if you have not yet tried Phil's, it's definitely worth a try and you will probably like it!

I've been to Phils' bbq too many times and I ALWAYS leave this place with a happy belly and a big smile! Ê I'm currently in love with their beef ribs. ÊMac and beans go hand in hand and great when mixed together. ÊOnion rings have the perfect crunch and scrumptious when dipped in ranch. Ê The line can be long and intimidating, but it's worth the wait!!

I'm from LA area so I don't really come to SD that often (maybe twice a year). But when I do I have to come to Phil's BBQ. No fail with baby back ribs and onion rings!! soooo gooooooood. I have to say, I got the smoked Êbrisket sandwich one time and that was not a favorite. My Bf loved it, but it was a bit too smokey for me! and too much sauce! but other than that food is really good! and don't let the lines fool you, it looks long and crazy but it goes by pretty fast. Or you can just order it for pick up and avoid the line completely. the staff is quick on orders and friendly.

Big round of applause for Phil!! He was there saying hi to every customer, came to our table and noticed that one piece my BBQ Chicken looked very burnt. He immediately offered to get me a new piece, and told me to take it home if I can't eat all of it. How cool was that? The BBQ here is superb. Definitely the best I've had in Socal. Their fries and macaroni salad are both very good...and thumbs up for moving into this new location at Sports Arena. We hardly had to wait very long for our order to be ready. Love this place.

First off, this is NOT BBQ. ÊAs a few people say below, BBQ is simply disastrous in San Diego. ÊIf you're from Texas, and your friends are saying "Lets go to Phil's, its the best BBQ you'll ever have!" you'll probably be disappointed. ÊIt isn't BBQ like you know it. Ê That said, if you think of Phil's as a rib joint, it really is quite excellent. ÊBoth their pork baby back ribs and beef ribs are fantastic. ÊThey are very tender and juicy - perfectly cooked in my opinion. ÊTheir sauce is kind of the vinegary, sweet style, probably more Mississippi style than TX, or SE. ÊIts an amazing combo with their fries and beans. ÊThe atmosphere is great too - bluesy music in the background, cool bar area with good beers on task. Ê So why only 4 stars? ÊWell.... its honestly a pain to eat here. ÊThe line on most nights is at least 15-20 minutes long, closer to 30-45 on weekends. ÊYou see a lot of people saving spots in line for big groups too - one time we were behind a couple of people who became an entire football team. ÊThere is something about the system that isn't quite right, and it can be frustrating when you're hungry smelling those heavenly ribs. Take out, which is what their old location mostly was (tiny area inside), doesn't work too well either - its just not as good once you get home.

I must be spoiled. There are over 2000+ reviews for Phil's BBQ, and I just want to say that between the wait and what I got to eat, this place was kind of a disappointment. I have been here before two times awhile ago. Once was sit down, which was probably over 4 years ago and admittedly forgettable and the other was maybe a little over 2 years ago for a To Go order(to cheat the wait). It's like when someone tells you that you have to go see this awesome movie and about how it's the best movie of whatever year and it's worth seeing in the theater. Then it turns into a letdown. Not what you expected. That's how I feel about Phil's. The wait was about 30 minutes in line. Felt like we all were waiting for an amusement park ride. I went with a few friends and my wife and it made the wait faster. You get to the front and then you order from a counter. After you order, they give you a pager and then you head out in search for a table. I got the BBQ Broham(pulled pork sandwich). Again, I have to be fair, because I did not order ribs or the BBQ chicken plates/dinners, so I went with the safe choice. I mentioned I being spoiled earlier. My wife makes a bomb pulled pork sandwich and Phil's did not have me really wanting to come back for it. It was good and the sides were really really good! I got coleslaw and baked beans. Oh, the portion was quite good if you're into portion sizes! I couldn't finish the bottom half of my sandwich cause there was so much pulled pork to eat! I tried my wife's Tri-Tip sandwich and although the meat was of great quality, I felt that there was a bit too much BBQ sauce. It would have been okay if the sauce was a little more subtle, but it overtook the meat easily. In the end, maybe I'm just not so crazy on Phil's, and I know there are tons of reviews of people that say they are. I would go again for sure, but it's not a place I'm really excited about. Parking can suck, so be forewarned.

Wow... AWESOME barbeque! Honestly I'm not even a huge bbq person but this was incredible. We ordered the BBQ Broham Sandwich (Pulled Pork) and this thing was HUGE and bursting with smokey flavors and a tangy bbq sauce. We also got the corn on the cob, onion rings and baked potato which were equally awesome. We had to wait in line for a good 20 minutes but trust me it was well worth it. The staff was incredibly kind and helpful and the food lived up to it's reputation. Enjoy! :)

After my review, Fred, the owner of Phils, replies with this offensive remark to me and to our Military family. Ê "If you got in the military for free food, you are in it for the wrong reasons." All I did was to suggest to Phil's to show some sort of Military appreciation, and he replys with such an offensive remark! ÊI've read through Phil's 1~2 star remarks, and he seems to take it very personally, since he has replied quite vilently and offensively to most of them. Ê All Military members, stay away from Phils!!!!!

Okay, I'd been looking forward to finally eating Êwhatever seemingly super-awesome BBQ caused people to form a line that nearly wraps around the restaurant, and now that I have fulfilled that fat-kid goal, I must ask: WHAT THE #$%^ is wrong with your taste buds, San Diego!? It's safe to assume that the people handing out five-star ratings have never had real BBQ, or for that matter, good BBQ as compared to mainstream BBQ chains that ain't half bad for what they're worth. I ordered the Beefy Rib & Chick-less Dinner, and the meal was average at best. I suppose the prices are fair given the possible portion sizes, but when I sit down to eat a meal I'm paying for, it'd damn well better be HOT, not sorta warm, but HOT if nothing else. Aside from the food, the employees I encountered were all a joy to be around for the seconds we spent together, and the sinks that saved me from having to enter the restroom to wash my hands are this freak's dream come true. So in closing, ÊI love meat, and I love BBQ, but the only way I'd consider getting my chubby jollies off at Phil's again is if it were free, because if there is anything I love more than meat, BBQ, and puppies, it's free.

Phil's never disappoints. I've been to this location and the one in San Marcos several times. If you're a BBQ fanatic then Phil's is your one stop shop for all your carnivorous needs The serving sizes are massive so one should be prepared to wear those extra loose pants or ask for a doggy bag. My girlfriend and I will usually order two dishes and split them. If you're like me and has that one "go-to" item on the menu, then the broham is for you my friend. The pulled pork is very tender and juicy; it doesn't need much BBQ sauce. It has a perfect blend of smokiness and when added sweetness from the coleslaw. It just fusses together well for an enjoyable meal .

Come on San Diego...is this really what you call BBQ? ÊFirst off the OB BBQ house kills this place. ÊSecondly, this place is just crying out to be a chain and that's just lame. The sauce is sweet, which I'm not a fan of but can normally tolerate...definitely can't tolerate it here. ÊThe pulled pork had barely any flavor and the fries tasted as if they just came out of the freezer. Save yourself the trouble...sure it's cheap and it has great reviews (I have no idea why, really), but I'd rather eat a McRib than pretend to call this good BBQ.

What the hell did I know? Prior to this past Saturday - I HATED BARBECUE. ÊI'm from NJ, and BBQ means slapping some burgers and dogs on the grill. ÊMaybe some chicken. ÊMaybe a steak. ÊNot this weird "pulled pork" (REALLY with that name?) or ribs slathered in sauce that tastes like tangy grossness, smoke and dirt. ÊNot my idea of a good time. However, my BF's friend birthday lunch celebration was being held at Phil's, and I figured I would suck it up, give it a try and be a good sport. Apparently I had gone to sub-par BBQ joints in the past, because Phil's was delicious. ÊI was not grossed out by the sauce, or the texture or anything that I encountered. ÊI got the BBQ Broham pulled pork sandwich, as did my boyfriend. We both highly recommend it. ÊThe sandwich is busting out the bun! ÊThe last time I had a pulled pork sandwich it was so dry. ÊNot the case at Phil's. ÊThe meat is tender and slathered in a delicious sauce. ÊAlso, the cole slaw is very tasty. ÊSurprising, since I'm not usually a fan of slaw. Ê I wish I could have finished mine sandwich, but I only got about halfway through and my stomach was about to burst. The BF also ordered the 1 beef rib sampler. ÊI scoffed, thinking "Why the hell is he paying $3.95 for 1 freakin' rib?" ÊLittle did I know that the rib is the size of one of those ginormous turkey legs you can get at the Ren Faire! ÊI have never seen a rib so huge in my life. ÊI tried a bite, and it was also delicious. ÊThe meat is very tender. We also ordered a side of fries (the small, which takes up an entire huge plate!) and a side of onion rings. Ê ÊThe fries are nothing exciting, but the onion rings are insane! ÊHuge, sweet and crispy. Ê As per usual, the BF and I ordered way too much food, didn't even come close to finishing it, and spent the next 3 hours sleeping off the food coma. We arrived at a little after 12 noon, and the line was already out the door, but not terrible. Service at both the counter and from the bussers was great. ÊVery friendly. Ê Barbecue would still not be my first choice when dining out; however, it's good to know that I do not have to avoid this place like the plague.

Get ready to stuff your face and get a little messy while doing so. Phil's BBQ is a San Diego staple... not a classy establishment by any means but a real crowd pleaser with delicious BBQ meals. Once you get to the front of the line order your meal and then find a table to sit at. Wait for food to arrive and then get ready to eat! Might as well get a doggy bag since the portions are big. The beef ribs and pulled pork sandwich are favorites with a side of fries with ranch and bbq sauce to dip.

I either saw this place on yelp or on TV, I'm leaning towards yelp. Instead of waiting forever for a table, we ordered to go. The line to order out was much shorter. The line to eat at a table wrapped around the corner, I didn't even want to see how far it went. We got the half order beefy ribs (3 ribs) http://www.yelp.com/biz_É & half order baby back ribs (6 ribs?) http://www.yelp.com/biz_É. Each comes with 2 small sides or 1 large side. We opted for potato salad (potatoes with skin), macaroni salad, fries, & sweet beans. Out of the sides, I liked the sweet beans the most. Everything else seemed like I could get them anywhere else. The ribs were too saucy, spicy, & tangy for my taste. For 2 people, that was so much food (I think I can eat a lot), even though the items we ordered were each half orders. It's worth it to try this place once, just to see what the hype is all about.

I could not wait to go home for Thanksgiving for a few reasons. 1. See the family 2. Visit my buddies 3. Finally go to Phil's new Sports Arena location Compared to their original Golden Hill "camper shell" location, the Sports Arena location is like a double-wide trailer. ÊOk, bad analogy, the food is far from trailer-trash. ÊI got ribs, chicken, fries, and onion rings. ÊThe donut-sized onion rings were great, I couldn't stop munching on them. ÊAs expected, the ribs were excellent, smoky sweet with just enough spice to keep me licking my fingers. ÊThe chicken sort of surprised me, as I haven't had it before, and it was well cooked, and hell, coat a newspaper in that sauce, I'll eat it. ÊThe fries were blanketed in ribs and sauce, if only In-n-out's animal-style fries were this good... ÊThis place reiterates the fact that Phil's has the best BBQ I've ever eaten. ÊSeriously. The bar is a quintessential addition, beer and meat, you can't go wrong. ÊIt's your own fault if you're a vegetarian prude. ÊYou gotta love the huge open sink for washing hands, though I wouldn't mind wearing that smell for the afternoon. ÊThe decor of the place is just right, thanks Phil's for not going into the Chili's/Friday's zone of hanging stupid tacky sh*t everywhere. ÊKeep hanging those bbq and rib contest trophies, I'm sure there'll be more to come.

I'm actually not a huge BBQ fan, but this place is finger-lickin' good!!! My bf took me here, surprised that I had never been to Phil's BBQ during the 4 years I had lived in SD. I shrugged it off, wondering how great can the ribs be? Boy - was I wrong. Between the two of us, we shared the Half Rib Dinner, which included 6 bones of baby back ribs and 2 small sides (or 1 large side). We got 2 small sides of coleslaw and fries which wonderfully complemented our meal. The Baby Back Ribs were probably one of the best I have ever had. The Mesquite grilled ribs were rich in flavor and the meat was cooked just right. Other places tend to slightly overcook the ribs, which was probably why I never really liked ribs, but this place is simply amazing! Phil's BBQ is probably not the place you'd take your first date because it gets REALLY messy. (Some people were wearing bibs). Don't wear nice clothes and get ready to get down and messy. If you want some really good ribs, this is definitely the place to check out if you already haven't.

Overrated! Seriously, considering the amount of praise Phil's gets from Yelpers, I expected food Mecca but left rather let down. I ordered the beefy ribs and chicken combo with fries and red beans. The chicken was terrible! Super dry and not an ounce of liquid to be found in any of the handful of bites I ventured to try! The ribs were okay. They were smothered with sauce but the meat itself didn't have much flavor - the taste of fat made it hard to taste what flavor the meat possibly had. The fries were pretty good when covered with a more than liberal dash of the cajun seasoning... they do a great job of filling you up just in case the meat doesn't. Red beans were weak! Way too watery! Overall, I don't know if Phil's is worth the drive or the wait and still leaves me without a good barbecue watering hole in San Diego...

Phil's BBQ sauce seems to make people crazy. I called in an order this evening and when I went to pick it up there was a line of hungry barbecue lovers going out the door. Bear in mind this was at quarter of nine on very freakin cold Tuesday night. I could not believe my eyes. I thought they were selling Playstation Threes here or something. But no, it was just that sauce. I'm telling you -- it makes them crazy! I have never been here at peak hours (like dinner on the Weekends) but I imagine it probably looks like that cafeteria scene in Animal House. I mean, they have a handwashing station for customers right in the middle of the restaurant. And rolls of paper towels on every table. And a bib dispencer! One cannot help but wonder if Phil has dealt with a dry cleaning bill or two in his day. I could totally see some lady complaining because she got barbecue sauce on her blouse while commando rolling her way to a second serving of ribs. This place has that effect on people. AV

Saturday Evening (around 5ish) * Dine in: 50+ min wait---the line was wrapped around the corner of the restaurant! yikes! * Phone in Order: they said 15-20 min, but we actually got our order in about 10 min! whoo hooo! With the "bleh" rate we were going w/ Êthe mediocre tasting food joints we had visited earlier in the day, we did not want to take our chances of fighting the looooooooong line--only to be disappointed. Hence, we got out of line and Êmade a phone order and picked up our food within 10 minutes. FOOD: * pulled pork sandwich: LOADED with smokey flavored super DRY shredded pork. friend #1: "tastes like dried squid" friend #2: "yeah, I agree" me: "me three!" * Half rib dinner: - semi "fall off the bone", BUT the sauce was too tangy for me and they over cooked the edges---had to toss out a big portion of the ribs because it was over charred. * Colossal onion rings - good thing we got the small order, it was huge in size(see picture). * baked beans: pretty good * coleslaw: not bad SERVICE: 2 thumbs up Bottom line: another 'must try'.....only ONCE.

This has been the second time I have ever been to Phil's BBQ. The first time I came here was approximately two years ago from now, and my most current experience, I must say, was the better one. I used to groan at the mention of Phils BBQ, but now I actually really enjoy this place. Besides the horrendous line that encircles the restaurant, Phils BBQ is a great place. What I order: 1. Beefy Rib & Chick-less Dinner ($12.45) [2 Bones with chunks of white breast meat chicken seasoned & BBQ'd] -Sides: Coleslaw + Fries -If you want nothing but meat meat meat, definitely get the Beefy Rib. The Beefy Rib is much larger than the baby back ribs. I personally prefer the Beefy Rib over the baby back ribs because there is just so much more meat! Dont be discouraged at the sight of "2" bones, trust me two is more than plentyyyyy. And definitely get the chick-less chicken. It is way better and more flavorful than the chicken with the bone. The boneless chicken is much more tender and juicy than the boned chicken. The meat falls right off the Beefy Rib and honestly, the amount of meat from two beefy rib equals more than the amount of meat on half rack of baby back ribs. If you get a full Beef Rib dinner, which I have seen other people get before, you get sick of the dish after 2 bones anyway. So why not change your taste buds a little and get the best of both worlds! Chicken and Ribs! This is definitely the best combination at Phils and from now on I will always get it this way and nothing else! I really like their coleslaw. Better than a lot of other places to be honest. The fries tasted average, nothing spectacular about the fries. Overall this is a great bbq joint. My advice is to come earlyyyyyy. Especially when you have a large party, definitely come early. For dinner, you want to get here around 5pm because after 5pm, the line gets HUMUNGUSSSSSSS!!! (:

Tangy, fall off the bone ribs. Baby back or beef, they're all good. The line is long, but the wait is worth it. There's a BBQ cam to check it out before you go there. The staff is outgoing and friendly; it all moves very quickly, if you can get a seat. I've gone in large groups, and they've been very accommodating of this as well. Food: Onion rings are awesome. I recommend fries and potato salad. The potato salad is light, and a good balance for that Phil's sauce which can drown everything on the platter.

I made a large order here and never received such great service! When I came to pick up my food, they even let me use their Styrofoam carrying cases and said "just bring them back whenever you have a chance." Since I wasn't from the area, I found this a bit interesting that they would trust a complete stranger to return their probably expensive carrying cases. Anyway, we ended up returning the goods before we left San Diego, but only after we enjoyed racks and racks of ribs, chicken, wonderful beans, onion rings, fries, and corn on the cob! THE ONLY SUGGESTION I WOULD HAVE is this: Have a side of macaroni and cheese available (not the mac salad), because everyone in my party wanted that so we had to go to Bristol Farms and buy a $30 platter of macaroni and cheese that wasn't that good compared to the mouth-watering menu at Phil's. Good thing I also pre-ordered because the line was about 20 yards outside the front entrance. -Matt

This place MUST be good since I trekked all the way from Irvine for BBQ! We arrived at about 6, which is pretty early for dinner, but there was already a line out the door. You order at the cashier first and then grab a seat and wait for your order to be called. I think this is a pretty good set up, because when I'm craving some good BBQ, I don't really care about table service and such, just give me the meat! Since this is far for me, we ordered a lot so we can try everything. Between 4 of us (3 being girls), we got a whole rack plus half rack of the pork ribs, and another whole rack plus half of the beef ribs. For sides we got fries, the baked beans, cole slaw and corn on the cobb. First the meat. The beef ribs were soooo meaty! I ate one and I was already feeling pretty satisfied. I was afraid the sauce was going to be too sweet for my liking, but I didn't mind it, could've been more tangy or spicy, but that's just my preference. The pork ribs were very tender and Êhad a good amount of meat per bone also and it was also very moist. The one gripe about the beef ribs was that while most of the ribs we got were super meaty and moist, there were a couple end pieces where it was more chewy and jerky like, but still, soooo good. Sides were not very good. That's why I couldn't give them 5 stars. The beans tasted like they went a little over board with the "smokey" flavor, maybe too much liquid smoke? The coleslaw was nothing to rave about, the cabbage tasted a little too raw, partly because the cabbage was cut pretty coarse, and the fries were just OK as well, I'd rather have Mcdonalds ones. So come here for the meat, or take out and bring it home and eat it with your own sides. One thing to Ênote, they have a hand washing station near the bathroom area. I like that touch because BBQ definitely can get messy. (We saw a guy in a WHITE SUIT eating there..weird!) BUT, the soap is SUPER strong. I washed my hand before eating, and every time my hand got too close to my face while I was trying to clean my rib bones, I could smell the soap. It's like industrial strength or something. So be wary of that if you don't want to smell soap the whole time you eat, unless you want to be fancy and knife and fork it.

There's a party in my tummy everytime I eat at Phil's. ÊAnd you know that's because I don't overeat (anymore). ÊI started going to Phil's when I lived in Mission Hills, and Phil's was on Goldfinch. ÊI had a special love for that location, but BYGONES! ÊNow Phil has moved up and out--why wait for 7 hours to get a rack of ribs when you can wait 1 hour, a know?! ÊBut you know what? ÊIt's so worth it! ÊMy faves are the pork ribs, fries and beans. ÊAnd you need to have the onion rings with the buttermilk dressing--OMG, to die for!! ÊAnd with a pint of brew! ÊIt doesn't get much better when you're finger-lickin' bbq sauce, my friend! Other things I go for are the Chickless Dinner and the Brougham Sandwich.

Prior to coming here, I had high expectations. The rave reviews and the long lines told me this was supposed to be great barbeque. My first bite took shattered all those expectations. It was even better than I thought it would be! The tenderness of the meat and the full force of the flavor was overwhelming. Phil's was a life changing experience for me. You must get the beef ribs without sauce. Eat it as a dry rib.

I gotta say, the management definitely won me over! After my mediocre review of Phil's, the big bosses there stepped it up :) I am surprised by how willing they are to accommodate & make up for a poor experience there. We went with a group of 4, got complimentary meals, and had quick service. AND THE FOOD..well, that's spoken for already from other Yelpers. Just to reiterate the goodness of the food: both the pork & beefy rib meat just melts in your mouth & the corn on the cob is Êso sweet and juicy (my fave side dish).

BBQ or Steamed? I'm not sure how this place is ranked this high, but have any of y'all tasted real BBQ? ÊWhen you pulled into the parking lot, did you see any grills/smokers in the back? ÊOr did you smell the wood burning to flavor the meat with smoke flavor? ÊI saw or smelt none of these things... ÊSo would you consider this true BBQ? I'm pretty big when it comes to BBQ. ÊWhen I came down, my friends said we are taking you to a BBQ joint. ÊI was excited to see what the hype was about. ÊBut disappointed when pulling up and not seeing smokers or grills in the back for authentic BBQ. The taste... ÊIt was okay, I've been to many BBQ places that definitely tastes better than Phil's. ÊI really don't have nothing else to say besides this is not authentic BBQ. Process of cooking is definitely in the over and then tossing it on the grill to get a last minute char for the BBQ effect. ÊRibs were probably dried rubbed or brined tossed into the over with a thin layer of water and cover with foil to steam it so it stays tender... ÊThen when needed, tossed on the grill to heat it up and char it a little. ÊThen toss on the BBQ sauce. Where is my BBQ with either wood or charcoal? =/

Honestly..do I need to say more??? PHILS IS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS, SAVORY, AND YOU CAN NEVER GET ENOUGH OF IT!!! Honestly, i came into UCSD hearing about Phils and I didn't expect much especially because I felt like it was SO overhyped....damnn I was SO wrong. The very first time I went to Phils, the line wasn't too long! So I was a happy camper. As soon as you walk in the entrance you know the ambiance is great. Besides, the lady at the front of the line who tells you to go sit at a specific table is amazing! She makes my night everytime I go! I usually order half rack (I'm pretty fat) baby back ribs with a side of macaroni salad and beans. MMMMMM-MM-Mm One thing I LOVE about phils is that their food comes out so quick! You never have to wait more than 5 minutes for your food. Another additional yum-factor food they have are their ONION RINGS. Let me tell you this...THEY'RE COOKED TO PERFECTION. You've got to try it with the ranch sauce or usually I ask for an extra case of BBQ sauce so I just dip it and grub away! Your fingers get a little messy but..it's all worth it. The first bite you take into your ribs..i dont think you'll ever ever forget it. it tastes...pretty freaking amazing. It's so tender that when you run your fork through it, the pork just kind of melts off the bone...MMMMMM!!!!!!!!! I usually get a side of lemon and I sprinkle it on top just to give it extra flavor. Once, I was sooooo obsessed with Phils I think I had it 3 times in a week. You've got to try itttttt

I've been going to Phils for 6+ years now, back when they were just a little shack in Mission Hills. Ê When they moved down to Point Loma, I expected that it woudln't be nearly as good, but they are still 100% on top of things at this joint. Ê If you don't like waiting, which most people don't when they're hungry, call ahead, and take your food to go. ÊFind a nearby park or picnic area and chow away. Ê If you don't mind waiting, this place is worth the wait and you will constantly crave Phils and want to come back for more. ÊI won't even go anywhere else, and I've traveled all over the world, and when someone mentions BBQ, I just laugh and say "I'll wait until I get back to San Diego"... ;) Which leads me to my question... Do they put crack in the ribs?!

I love Phil's! Ê In a calorie-free world, I'd order a large batch of onion rings with their buttermilk dressing and that's it... heavenly lightly battered rings of onion goodness! ÊI have yet to find onion rings that I enjoy more than Phil's. ÊInstead I opt to satisfy my onion ring cravings with about 2 onion rings and some form of their rockin' BBQ. ÊBaby Back ribs, chicken, or the Broham. Now, here's the SECRET: Êphone ahead to place your order for pick up to avoid waiting in that inevitable, pesky line that streams out around the front (and often side) of their building. Ê Oh, and the double secret is to go through the side entrance of the bar so you don't have to say "excuse me" a million times to reach the phone line on the left. ÊI really hate the feel of angry eyes who wonder why you're trying to cut in line. ÊIt's like you need a t-shirt that says, "Please move aside folks-I placed a phone order and I'm sorry that you didn't and you've been standing in line for an hour." Ê:)

Finally got to the new Phil's and ordered for pick-up. It was a bland Tuesday night everywhere else except this place - it was hoppin! ÊAlthough there were designated lines for phone orders & walk-in orders posted OUTSIDE, there was only 2 other people in front of me. in the phone-in order line. ÊToo bad for the walk-in orders though - it must have been 30 people deep. ÊAfter paying, I only had to wait 5 minutes for my order. ÊDuring that time, I looked around a bit and saw that about every table was full, but this is no surprise because they have the BEST DAMN RIBS ever! Ê After I picked up my grub, I hightailed it outta there and drove back home to downtown. ÊUnfortunately I got stuck in Padres traffic. ÊFortunately I ordered the onion rings - which I've been told were excellent. ÊBeing the first time for me to get them, I just HAD to try a bite before they got cold. ÊNeedless to say, the rest never made it back home. ÊI ate ALL the onion rings on the way home! Ê If you haven't tried this place, go for the pork ribs & onion rings with ranch. ÊYou'll dream about them afterwards!

I've been to Phil's several times and it's about damn time I got around to writing a review. Easily the best BBQ I've ever had. I have to keep going back..this place is ADDICTING. (I may need an intervention...just so long as it's held at Phil's) I've eaten in the dining room and done the take-out thing. First...the food. I always get the baby back ribs and sometimes get them with the chicken. The menu states that you get 4 bones...but they always give me more than that. (NOT THAT I'M COMPLAINING!!!) the meat ALWAYS falls off the bone and the ckicken is always tender. The BBQ sauce is just incredible and has the perfect amount of heat. I usually switch up the sides and each and every one fo them are tasty tasty tasty. Next...the service. ALWAYS just as good as the food. From the greeter at the door..or the person taking your order, the person filling your order or the person on the other end of the phone, you can always count on quick, happy and most of all accurate service. (most kids of that age group could care less about their job..but Phil's does a great job of hiring the right kind of people. I could go on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on about how good Phils is, but I wont. Only to add one more thing though...whenever a guest comes in from out of town I always make it a point to try to get them over to Phil's and they always say it's the best they've ever had.

Ê They spoke about how the meat falls off right the bones as you sink your teeth into them. ÊI am not a big fan of BBQ, but I have to admit the pork/beef ribs were as good as they said they were.

Overrated! But good. This place is good to go to every once in awhile, but if the wait is too long I'd say it's not worth it. ÊI've been here 4 times, and I'm usually pretty satisfied when I leave. ÊI've had: Their baby back ribs are delicious, sweet tangy sauce and fall-off-the-bone tender. ÊOnly complaint is that it doesn't seem that HOT when you get it. Chicken is alllright. ÊTastes just like the ribs, but in chicken form. Onion rings are decent, but with all that batter it can get gross after awhile. Corn on the cob was a regular corn on the cob, and coleslaw, despite the rave reviews I thought was just alright. ÊBaked potato was decent as well. All in all, it's a good place for ribs (especially for the price), but if the line's more than half an hour I wouldn't recommend it.

Wow. Ê4.5 stars from 900 reviewers? ÊI mean, it was alright, but that's a bit ridiculous. The ribs (baby back) were quite tasty and the bbq sauce had a good amount of bite to it, while still sweet. The sides left a lot to be desired. ÊAt $4 for a small caesar, it was quite a letdown. ÊThe baked beans were par to sub-par. ÊAnd how is this a bbq place that doesn't offer bread of SOME sort?

Beefy or Baby-back. ÊThat is the question. While waiting in line I asked two of the employees what they suggested. ÊOne guy told me that baby-back ribs were like a touch of heaven, while another told me that beefy was the way to go. ÊI ended up going with baby-back and I did not regret it. ÊI ordered the full rib (baby-back) dinner with sides of macaroni salad and fries. ÊMy mouth pretty much dropped when my dinner arrived and I dived right in. ÊThe meat fell off the ribs with just a slight gnaw at the bone, and each rib was slathered with mouth-watering BBQ sauce. ÊThe fries were quite crispy, above average at least, and the macaroni salad was pretty standard fare. ÊWell worth the price of $18.95 before tax and tip. ÊFrom trying my friend's beefy ribs, you cannot go wrong whichever type of rib you choose. The staff was extremely friendly and looked like they were having a great time while working. ÊWhile seated at our table, service was fine and I have no complaints. ÊThe whole atmosphere was very festive; we sat in the enclosed outside area past the bar and the heat lamps were a nice touch.

I wish I could leave 6 or even 7 stars for this place because it is just THAT good!! I'm simply in love with the El Toro (bbq tri tip) sandwich! I get it every time and it is still just as tasty as the first time. However I've also tried almost everything else such as the ribs, chicken, onion rings...and it's all phenomenal! There's usually a line out the door and even around the building a lot of the time, but it moves reasonably quick and the food is totally worth the wait. I've recommended Phil's to numerous friends and family and no one ever leaves dissatisfied. The proportions are huge, so come hungry and leave happy! Enjoy!

Pretty disappointing. I expected that with long lines and people writing such good reviews about this place, that it would be really wonderful. I suppose, that in San Diego, since there is hardly any competition, that this bbq place would be the only one to go to. It's like if you go to a northern state, Taco Bell will be Mexican food. But if you've experienced real bbq from cattle country, this really falls short. SERVICE: Pretty quick; once you get to the front of the line and order, you get a beeper and are paged to go pick up your food. ATMOSPHERE: Packed, loud, can hardly hear anything from the person across the table from you. FOOD: Mediocre. Too much bbq sauce that is rather plain. Nothing special. The pork shoulder was dry. The french fries were hard. The sweet beans and macaroni salad were solid though, and so were the onion rings. OVERALL: Not worth going back. No bbq is better than bad bbq.

I honestly didn't think this place was too good when I first tried it last year. I really didn't understand what the hype was about this place either. However, I did continue to eat here every time I go to SD though, and now I'm hooked! (Or, getting there..) Either I wasn't hungry enough the first time or Phil's BBQ just takes time to appreciate. The ribs are absolutely tender and juicy! *DROOLS* I love the way the meat just slips off the bone.. I didn't enjoy the macaroni too much though. ): I felt that it was a bit fatty. So I didn't feel good eating that along with the ribs. Kinda pricey, but it's waaay better than chilies! Plus they do a great job at marinating. 1-2 ribs can go a long way also. So try it!

ÊThe chicken rib lets, the ribs, the burger, the veggie burger, the pulled pork- anything and everything here is amazing with that sauce.

ÊPretty basic menu of BBQ foods and some accompanying sides like corn on the cob, baked potatoes, french fries, onion rings and so forth all of which are great tasting.

Phil's BBQ, while good, is not five-star amazing. ÊI really think it depends on how you like your BBQ sauce. ÊPhil's sauce is tangy and since I like my sauces sweeter, I don't think it exceeded the hype. ÊHowever, everytime I've gone the employees have been more than friendly, even on days where it's a 45 minute wait in line before you can get your food and the restaurant is packed. ÊThey are very accomodating and helpful, never fake. The pork ribs are very tender and fall off the bone. ÊI also love the macaroni salad, as it is a bit sweet and there is a nice texture to it (some crunch!), and the onion rings, which are always perfectly fried. ÊHowever, the potato salad is sub-par and the fries are sometimes soggy.

Yes the almighty 5 stars! IF you get 1400 reviews with 4 and 1/2 stars then your doing something MORE than right. This is a must visit in San Diego. I can't believe I've never been here before. The food here is the best. They have mastered the technique on making ribs. The wait is like a rollercoaster ride that just came out. But once you get on the ride it's like mind blowing. The experience was well worth it. I ordered the baby back ribs, macaroni salad, potato salad, fries, and colossal onion rings. The onion rings were huge and were some of the best I have ever eaten. The potato salad was just whatever I could a skipped on that. The fries were good after I added the seasoning onto it. They also brought it out with homemade ranch that they make every morning. Delicious! The macaroni salad was so good and I wish we had it like that back home. The highlight of course was the ribs. They just fall off the bone! The flavor that comes from the meat is unmatched. Phils where have you been all my life!? This is top notch bbq at it's finest. The wait might scare you but you will leave happy. This set the bar on what my ribs should taste like. Recommendation: baby back ribs, macaroni salad, and colossal onion rings.

I'm not really a fan of BBQ in general (especially when it comes to waiting 1-2 hours for it), so I was hesitant to try this place, even though everyone seems to love it. Split a small order of onion rings and an order of beefy ribs only with my sister, thinking that was a reasonable amount of food. I was wrong. There was so much deliciously marinated, tender meat on each bone that we were already really full after getting through 2 bones each. I like my onion rings a little more fried/cooked on the inside, hence the 4 stars. Our server was extremely friendly :) They also provide disposable bibs, wet wipes, and a hand-washing station to clean up after all that yummy bbq. If I ever come back again, I'd like to try the baby back ribs.

I love this place! The beef ribs and pork ribs are both amazing. I love how they lather on the bbq sauce (it is not overbearing at all). The bbq chicken is great also since the chicken is so tender and melts right off the bone. The portions are generous and the sides are great also. I like the fries there and the onion rings are enormous in size. A good idea is to call in ahead of time and phone in your order since the lines at Phil's tend to be crazy. It can also be a competition to find a table (there is some outside seating and I would check out there if there are no tables inside.. they have heat sources so it isn't cold outside).

I started going to Phil's when they were that little hole in the wall in Mission Hills. ÊThe thing I hated about that joint was that it was like the size of a shoebox. NOW! Now things are different.... Phil's has the room to accommodate the masses! Not that i'm for being a sheep among the masses. ÊNot at all. ÊBut every American is entitled to good BBQ. Their ribs (both pork and beef) are devine. ÊTheir sides? Amazing. ÊTheir rings? HUGE and yum. Bottomless fountain drinks to wash down that amazing sauce. ÊThey've got a bar too just in case you need some beer. Overall, if you see a long line outside of it, take the opportunity to exercise patience and stand in the line.

First of all, I am really not at all a BBQ fan. ÊI don't like eating meat off the bone and it's just so messy. ÊBut somehow I ended up standing in line for over an hour Sunday night to try this place out... aannd I would totally do it again and again. There really isn't much to say that hasn't already been said. ÊGet the pulled pork sandwich. ÊAnd the onion rings. ÊAnd the ribs... duh.

3.5 stars One serious BBQ joint! ÊI've never seen anything like this! ÊI got here on a Sunday afternoon and the line was out the door and around the corner of the building. ÊHubby and I scratched our heads while contemplating whether or not we should wait. ÊThe person in line in front of us informed us it would be about 30 minutes. ÊI was seriously doubting him, but we stayed anyway. ÊThere was at least 40 people in line ahead of us. ÊSure enough, the wait was a little less than 30 minutes! ÊIncredible! Ê So, let me break it down for any 1st timers. ÊYou wait in line. ÊYou order & pay. ÊYou are given a pager for when your food is ready. ÊYou find a table. ÊYou grab your drinks. ÊThe pager goes off and you & your whole party go to grab your food! ÊSeriously, you'll need a few hands cause their servings are huge! ÊEat, enjoy & relax while you catch a game on their many tv's! ÊFinally, pack up your leftovers & you have a whole other meal! So, here's the damage: $52 before tip included: -1 full baby back dinner w/a corn-on-the cob -1 full beef ribs dinner w/a baked potato -1 small side of sweet baked beans -1 small side of potato salad -1 small order of onion rings The baby back ribs were definitely better than the beef ribs and I generally prefer beef ribs. ÊBoth were meaty and fell off the bone. Ê The bbq sauce was tangy and finger licking good! ÊThe potato salad and beans were just ok! ÊThe onion rings are a must order!

WOW. my sister brought me here when I went to visit her in SD, and that is all I can say. WOW. There was a line to get in, but it moves quickly. The ribs are so good, and they give you so much! I think my plate was bigger than my head. I really enjoy the messy, finger licking, lips smacking, eating with your hands ordeal, so naturally, I enjoyed this place quite a bit.

Thank you Marcus and family for introducing me to this place! I started going to this place at their old location; fell in love right away. I don't know of many places where you will wait in line for 30+ minutes to order and then wait even longer for your food...AND THE LINE KEEPS GOING! that just tells you how amazing this place is. they have sped up quite a bit at the sports arena location; bigger spot, more efficient logistics (couldn't think of a better word, lol!) I always order the Beef Rib dinner (3 ribs not the 6 or 7), two orders of fries, and usually share onion rings with someone. Its just ridiculous. I don't know what they do back there, but its magic. Also, considering how large the place is, the staff are SO friendly. They come by and check on you, and really invest in showing the customer that they care. Please try this place. You will fall in love. Thanks PHIL! Marwan doesn't lie.

Let me start this review with a disclaimer: ÊNo, I have not been to Pappy's, and I'm not a regular customer of Oklahoma Joe's in Kansas City, and yes...I did just google "best bbq". ÊI have, however, been to Lucille's, and have had the McRib, and that qualifies me as a Barbecue Expert. With this bit of information in mind, I decided to take my expertise down south. ÊMy significant other and I went to visit some family members for a day, and they took us to the cool spots in the area. ÊAfter a day romp at the San Diego Zoo, they decided to take us to the #1 choice spot to get some BBQ in the area. ÊIt seems that this #1 choice spot is also the #1 choice spot for all of Southern California. ÊI guess my BBQ knowledge is not as great as I thought. First thing you will notice when visiting this local dining destination is the line. ÊThe line the line the line. ÊDid I say it enough times for you? ÊAs you pull up, it's very possible that you will feel a shade of discouragement which can prompt you to pack up your ideas and take them on down to the next eatery on the street. ÊFight this overwhelming desire to move along, and suck it up! Step into the line, and you'll soon find that time actually passes a lot faster than one would think. ÊWhat's nice is you will be able to wave at the camera, which broadcasts over the internet. ÊAfter braving the line, you will be rewarded with some of the BEST BBQ you can find in California. ÊIt's obvious they take pride in their work, as they obviously stick to the fundamentals of slow and low (that is the tempo). ÊThe slow and low approach guarantees that the BBQ will fall off the bone, and (essentially) melt in your mouth. ÊThe sauce, on the other hand has a character all on its own. ÊIt's the combination of sweet, and spicy, with enough bite to have your senses craving the combination long after visiting Phil's. ÊHere are some of the items you will find here: Baby back ribs - These are a crowd pleaser. Order these, and you're guaranteed to be back for more. ÊAs stated before, the meat is very tender, and will fall off of the bone, and the sauce, and BBQ process lends an excellent flavor to the mild flavor of the meat. Chicken - It really wasn't my favorite, and I could do without it. ÊIt was kind of dry. ÊI would've been happier just skipping this order and going to Costco and picking up some rotisserie chicken. ÊIt's much more tender. Beef ribs - Not everyone's favorite, but I loved them. ÊThe beef has a stronger flavor than the pork, so it stands out more, but it was incredible how tender the meat was. ÊThe sauce wasn't as overpowering on the beef ribs, as it was on the baby back ribs. ÊIt was more complimentary. Onion rings - There's a reason why they're known for their onion rings. ÊThey're really good. Fries - whatever. ÊThey weren't as crispy as I like. Macaroni salad - flippin' excellent. ÊI don't know what it is about this stuff, but I'd buy a jug of this, and have it for lunch every day, if I could. Cole slaw - okay. Êdon't have much to say about it, so that speaks for itself...and yes, I usually love cole slaw. One more thing about this restaurant: They provide their customers with hand wipes, and Êa hand washing trough, so be sure to eat as messily as possible when you're here....you're covered.

Even though I do not like the new location, the food more than makes up for it. I miss the Mission Hills Location because it had 20 times more character and it was closer. I wish that they could have both open. I always order the rib tickler. It is the perfect amount of meat, onion rings, slaw and fries. They have a creamy thin ranch dip that you should ask for at the counter when you pick up your plate. It is delicious on the onion rings and fries. The onion rings are thick with a serious crunch (mmmm...deep fried batter).And if you are addicted to the sauce like me, ask for some extra sauce to drench your meat and dip your fries in. Ê I should say that although I am not a fan of the new space, the employees are plentiful and helpful. There are tons more parking spaces and tables to accommodate everyone enjoying their meat (that's what she said). **** for the vegetarians, they have a bbq veggie burger that i've heard is to die for.

I went here for the first time today. I know, I know: how could I have called myself a native San Diegan for all these years without ever having been to the famous Phil's BBQ? Well, don't worry, I have now seen the light. Seriously though, if you haven't been here before and you like BBQ you really have to check it out. +1 star for very, very friendly staff +1 star for ample portions and great prices +1 star for tender ribs (the meat almost falls of the bone) and zesty BBQ sauce Ê +1 star for a great section of tasty sides, I especially liked the potato salad +1 star for papers towels at your table and big sinks to wash your hands Only downsides: crowded (for a darn good reason) and not really vegetarian friendly (duh).

ÊIt was amazing and I have been searching for it ever since then. ÊUntil today. My visit to Phil's was amazing. ÊIt started off with an awesome greeting from a gal who saw my white shirt and pointed me in the direction of the bibs. Then the price ($7) for a massive amount of amazing pulled pork seemed just right too. I then grabbed an orange beer which was ridiculously good. ÊThe bartender grabbed my food for me when she saw my thing beeping! The food was incredible, the service fast, and now I am headed for a working nap.

San Diego is known for it Fish Taco's, not it's BBQ. However, Phil's is off the hook. I use to frequent this place when I lived in Sun Diego, every chance that I got, I was at Phil's. The ribs were nice and meaty and the portions are worth the sauce on the front of your shirt. I ate there so much, that I \would eat myself sick. YEAH...I lost my dinner in the parking lot once because I ate so much. And that was worth it as well... Five Trans-Fats out of Five.

Update August 4, 2008 Crap and a half. ÊThis place has grown on me. ÊAnd I actually like the sauce! ÊJust not too much of it, but I think that has more to do with me liking dry rubs versus ribs dripping in sauce (again, I am a picky bastard). ÊSince I come here so often with my husband the staff recognizes us, so that in turn makes the service great, because who doesn't love it when you come into a restaurant and the staff remembers you? ÊI always order the same stuff: Beef Ribs, beans, potato salad, and onion rings. Ê But damn it to hell, every time now when I ask my husband if we can go eat at Phil's he gets this "I told you so" look on his face. ERGH! --------------------------------------------------?--------------------------------------------------?------------------------ Ê My fiance loves this place, but I'm not that into it. ÊI think it depends on your taste and what kind of sauce you're into. ÊPhil's sauce is tangy, and I don't like tangy sauce. ÊI always order my ribs dry, with the sauce on the side. ÊOne thing I love are the onion rings, they have the best onion rings. Ê And the wait here is ridiculous sometimes, but it's nice how this place is bigger than the previous one. ÊI don't mind eating here, it's just not my favorite (my fiance is going to kill me for saying this about Phil's).

There's something in the sauce, I'm guessing it's crack. The meat falls off the bone, they've got a bar with a good amount of taps, the food comes out pretty quick and the prices are totally reasonable. Overall - Awesome.

ÊOf course it was very crowded so we phoned in our order and picked up. ÊMan these guys have their system down to a science. ÊThe ordering, wait-line setup, and organization of this place is impeccable! ÊThey even have a line-cam on their website to check out the wait before you get there. ÊSo yah on to the food ... WoW!

4.5 stars. Damn....this place is crazy packed all the time! Pretty much you're gonna find yourself waiting in a longgg line no matter what time you get here. And when I say line, I mean an actual line cuz you're lining up to order your food at the cashier. You seat yourself after ordering. Me and the bf decided to stop by before heading to the Dodgers v. Padres game. We got there at around 3pm, only to find a 45 minute wait ahead of us. Would I wait again? Most definitely, especially since I don't head down to SD that often. Awesome BBQ! It was our first time there and I was pleasantly surprised at how reasonable the prices were. Given how many reviews there are for this place, I'll keep it short and sweet. We got the baby back ribs tickler ($6.45) and the bbq broham sandwich ($6.45). I think the tickler is perfect and definitely worth it. I wanted to try their onion rings but knew we couldn't finish a whole order so the 2 that came with the tickler was enough to satisfy my curiosity. Sooo good! The broham sandwich was pretty good as well. I felt it could use a little more cole slaw because there was too much bbq sauce, but I still thoroughly enjoyed it. I'll probably ask for the bbq sauce on the side next time. I think I read on the menu that you can do that. Overall, a great experience. The line was even longer after we left so bottom line....be prepared to wait!!

The ribs and chicken are juicy and scrumpdiliocious. The meat on the ribs fall off the bone ever so lightly. Mmmmmmmm~ The fries are highly recommended as well as the macaroni salad. To avoid wasting your life by waiting in line, I suggest ordering to-go. That way, you can proceed to the front of the line, pick up your food, and stuff yourself with MEAT as soon as possible.

If you're in San Diego and haven't been to Phil's you are missing out! I had been to the Mission Hills location, but this past weekend when we were in SD, our friends took us to the new Pt Loma location. Umm...yah. Phil's obviously has made bank by the looks of the new digs. The food is so good, I'm wondering why I don't visit SD more often. ;o) Tip: get there early. I mean senior-early-bird early or you will be waiting in line. Kid tip: Great place for kids, but my toddler found the BBQ sauce a bit spicy for her palate, but she enjoyed being able to help finish off a few ribs and fries.

This is a place that's so good, you get random but constant cravings for it whenever. I grew up here in San Diego, and when my old high school friends come back to town, they always want to go to a) a Lolitas-esque Mexican restaurant or b) Phil's BBQ. I always get the half rack of baby back ribs with the large order of fries, though I have tried their chicken (which is pretty damn amazing, but not as fun to eat ;) ). They have the tastiest BBQ sauce I've ever had, and while it does get messy, it doesn't get as messy as ribs can usually get because the meat just falls right off the bone. No annoying gnawing is needed to get those last bits of meat off the ribs. The fries are way bomb as well and are especially tasty with the BBQ sauce. I devour that whole meal like there was no tomorrow. The line is always long, but it goes by quickly. The only real challenge is finding a place to sit, especially if you're going during lunch or dinner hours, but I've never had to wait more than 5 or so minutes to find a seat. The staff is pretty friendly.They're quick about getting your empty plates from you, and they check on you to see if you're doing all right - even if there is no waiting service.

Review #550! ÊYowza! SO...I told my friend I was going to check out Phil's BBQ and he said I HAD to get the chicken. ÊChicken?! ÊI'm going to a BBQ place and he tells me about chicken? ÊTo me, chicken is just that...chicken. ÊNow, I am a RIBS girl all the way so I stuck up my nose, thanked him for the advice and ordered TWO plates of ribs...on the bone and boneless. ÊMy mom ended up ordering the chicken, and that is how my life was changed...ha! Now, the boneless ribs were a bit dry so I don't think I'll get them again, but ribs were good! ÊThe bbq sauce is on the tangy side and I like mine a little sweeter, but the meat fell off the bone and it was delicious. After about 2 ribs, I reached over and took a piece of my mom's chicken. ÊI had to at least try it so that I could tell my friend they were "okay"... so I took a bite and went back to my plate, but then I stopped. ÊI chewed the chicken and it was super moist and tender! ÊI snuck another piece and holy bbq it was mouthwateringly delicious! ÊI was shocked! ÊThe chicken was BETTER than the ribs?! ÊHow is this possible? ÊI looked at my mom and gave her the "daughter" look and asked if we could switch plates, and being the sweetheart that she is, she did! ÊI finished off the chicken and licked the bones clean! ÊNever in my life have I passed up a plate of ribs for a measly plate of poultry, but there's a first time for everything I suppose. Ê(Sorry I doubted you friend!) ÊOh! ÊThe onion rings are great, too. Ê Ê Ê This isn't a full service place, so be ready to do a little exercise (which isn't a bad thing considering you'll be shoveling mounds of mouthwatering bbq into your face). ÊYou order at the counter, find a table and when your buzzer rings, pick up your order. ÊThere's a bar in the next room so you can walk over there and grab a beer while you wait for your food. ÊThe service is great! ÊThere's a friendly hostess at the front of the line to chit-chat with, and she'll guide you through the process. ÊThe cashier's don't seem as nice, but that's because they need to speed you through in order to get to everyone in line. ÊWhile you eat there are some servers who'll check on you and get you water and condiments.

The food here is soooo good. ÊThe ribs fall off the bones, the beer battered onion rings are delicious and the portions are huge. ÊMy favorite (right now) is the El Toro sandwich because it's a great deal at $6 and some change and it comes with enough meat for two sandwiches. I can't give Phil's a 5th star though. ÊThe first time I visited the one on Sports Arena, some friends and I were finishing our meal while chatting and they basically kicked us out because there were other people waiting for a table. ÊI completely understand... had we been done eating! ÊWe went there for a nice, relaxing, casual meal -- and we were pushed out the door! ÊAnd on another visit today, the cooks didn't get our order in the kitchen and we had to wait close to an hour for our meal.

Never come here on the weekends. or even anytime at night. YOU WILL be waiting for an hour or more. This place has a line that's probably a yard long. I went to San Diego for vacation and my lovely lovely cousin surprised my hungry hungry stomach with a line that took us an hour and a half to finish. Mind you, this was a Saturday night. We ordered the baby bbq ribs meal, the pulled pork sandwich, and onion rings. OH LA LA ~ lemme tell. it was like the MOST AMAZING THING i ever placed in my mouth. given that i was on the verge of doubling over in hunger...the overwhelming flavorful BBQ sauce just knocked me over. sweet, tangy. smoky BBQ flavor. yes i steal adjectives. plus, i do not eat onion rings. now Phil's onion rings are the size of a bracelet. they were crunchy and perfect. mmmmmmmm...... i crave for them now~~ X__X anyways, my overall impression was that the BBQ sauce tasted the same as any other BBQ sauce drenched ribs i've tasted elsewhere. the meat fell off the bone in the most tenderous way~~~ Êi wish it had a little bit of a crunch on the outside while also falling off the bone. i would go here again if the line did not go so far out into the street, but i could basically get the same great flavor at other BBQ places. just not as cheap as Phil's. There price range is decent. this is a must go to place at least once in your life if you're ever in the city.

Forget wanting Chili's baby back ribs (I want my baby back baby back baby back baby back...), get Phil's baby back ribs! ÊThey are fall off the bone tender, with a slight char crust from bbq cooking, and coated in a tangy bbq sauce. ÊThere always seems to be a long line here, but it moves fairly quickly, and once you get to place your order, the food itself arrives quickly as well. ÊAs for sides, the beans are decent, nothing to write home about, but the red potato salad is pretty good. ÊIt has a hint of dill in it and it's not overly creamy like how other potato salads can get.

All the rumors are true -- it is amazing. And the line is also amazingly long. For future visits I would definitely call in advance and then just stop by to pick up the order, though standing in the to-go line was not half bad (20ish mins). The line to get seated inside was a nightmare, wrapped around the building and definitely discouraged me from staying. Best part of waiting in line was a server offered us fries/dip as we waited. Such a tease, but so gooood. Ordered the full baby back ribs with a large side of fries as well as another side of onion rings. Since we got it to-go, the ribs and fries all came in one box. Which is not necessarily a bad thing if you like soggy fries. Personally, I am not a fan. So I would order them in separate boxes next time. The ribs were appropriately amazing and delicious, fries also quite good. The onion rings were massive and extremely oily but what do you expect? Gotta indulge every once in a while. Overall very good experience. Staff was also extremely happy and attentive especially considering the flocks of people they have to accommodate on a day-to-day basis. Would definitely visit again, I've heard some of their sandwiches are worth the try!

Being a vegetarian, Phil's isn't my first choice when selecting a place to eat out. ÊThe menu is (obviously) heavy on the meat, with only sides and a veggie burger to pick from. ÊThat and the line is always ridiculously long to order your food. I ordered the veggie burger, baked potato, steamed veggies and onion rings. Ê The onion rings were huge, and had a great crispy batter. ÊDefinitely top five onion rings I've tried. I ordered the potato with cheese and dumped my veggies on top of that. ÊDelcious. The veggie burger was perfectly cooked, not too dry as most places tend to over-cook the patty and I end up with a hockey puck on a bun. Ê Phil's is definitely worth the long lines, even if you're not a fan of the meat.

I went to Phils for the last night of Restaurant Week (last night). ÊOur family of three went and enjoyed sitting in the bar area. ÊHaving Stone IPA on tap was a real plus for me. Two of us ordered the pulled pork/chicken. ÊI got the slaw and fries. ÊMy partner got the slaw and Caesar salad. ÊMy nephew got the ribs, slaw and fries. ÊAll three of us had whoppie pies for dessert. The pulled chicken was good, the pulled pork was not. ÊNuggets of strange meat for sure. ÊMy nephew loved the ribs. ÊThe bbq sauce was noting to write home about. ÊSweet baby Rays, the sauce I measure all others against, held fast to its reigning champs position. The slaw was creamy but not too wet. ÊThe fries were very good. ÊThe Caesar salad was week and used iceberg lettuce, very strange. The whoppie pies were a big miss. ÊThe cake/cookies were stale and hard--not like what Mom would have made. The real hardship came when we headed to bed. ÊPhils used so much MSG (partner and I both allergic) that I was crazy awake all night long. ÊIt was one of the worst reactions to MSG in a really long time. While the food was okay going down, it was terrible throughout the night. ÊI won't go back any time soon.

PHIL'S!!!! Ever since the sister brought me to Phil's, i have never gotten a more satisfying southern food fix than here. Lucille's and baby blue's has got nothing on phil's! the line to order is always so ridiculously long, unless you go once the restaurant opens or in-between meal times, like at 4pm. you may also track the barbeQUEUE to check the status of the line. the service there is awesome... they know southern hospitality. the food is to die for. they use their own barbeque sauce that customers can purchase at the restaurant and the meat falls so easily off the bone. i always get the ribs, my preference siding towards beef ribs. either way, the portion sizes are HUGE.... and relatively inexpensive. all of their sides are nummy... even the fries are fabulous. i love their biscuits and buttered corn. i have had friends who have driven down to sd on a whim for the sole purpose of eating at phil's... it's just that good :)

Best BBQ in town, hands down. ÊThere's always a line and they take the month of January off, but hey, you'll always come back for more. ÊThe staff is friendly and fun and the food is exceptional. ÊPrices are decent, great for what you get. Tip: If you don't like waiting, order on the phone 'to go' and when you pick it up it'll be ready. ÊFind yourself a seat if you can and you're ready to rock and roll. ÊIf the place is just too darn full, take it home or to a park!

I really don't see what all the hype is about. It's your typical bbq, potato salad, french fries, picnic food. I think the hype comes from Phil's being only one location, and of course it's going to be packed full of people. At this point, I'm pretty sure Chili's has the same if not better choices for bbq ribs, and you actually get a server. I wouldn't wait in any line longer than five minutes for this place.

My first review. And for a restaurant with over 500. How original. Ha. The boyfriend and I had been hearing about this place for weeks when we finally decided to go give it a shot. The boy is all about meat. He literally cannot eat a meal without having meat in it, and being BBQ he hasn't stopped talking about this place since his boss told him about it. I, however, was a vegetarian for a good five+ years Êand can be just as happy with a meal sans any sort of meat. I just wanted a good lunch. I read a bunch of reviews so even though it was about 1pm on a Thursday we were expecting a gigantic line when we rolled up. There was no line in sight and we got an amazing parking spot right away. Score! Walking through the parking lot we couldn't get over the smell! It smelled amazing! Like the Del Mar Fair. We walked inside and had at least two cashiers waiting for us to place an order. We sat down after we got our drinks and were immediately greeted by the friendliest, tallest guy I've ever seen. His smile made us both Êchuckle after he walked away, just because it's so nice to actually get friendly service. Then the buzzer went off and the boy went to get the food. He got the pork rib half-dinner with corn and I got the pork rib tickler. After taking the first bite, he seriously did not speak. He started nodding his head and making "mmm" noises a lot though. Usually he will say something after the first bite. He ate at least two ribs before even speaking. And all he really said was "Oh, God yes. Oh Yeah. Yeah. Oh God." My rib tickler was good, but the ribs were smaller and harder to eat without getting crap ALL over your face. I know, I know, it's bbq, but seriously I don't enjoy smearing saucy bones all over my face (or do I?) We swapped ribs and I preferred his to mine immensely. But mine came with the best onion rings I have ever had. They were so good, I can't even pinpoint why, but they were. Like...fair onion rings. The batter was that good. And the fries were those really good crispy on the outside, mushy on the inside fries. I ate them with ketchup and I never eat fries with ketchup. Good ketchup fries, I guess. Even the coleslaw was good, it wasn't too sweet...just the way I like it. Our (server? waiter assistant? Busser?) Came by at least three times to check on us and our drinks and gave us plenty of wetnaps as well as a separate plate for our bones. This guy was just so friendly, literally his smile made us smile. He even asked us if we wanted To-Go cups. We ended up leaving him $5. We actually were going to add it to our credit card slip the cashier gave us, but he stopped us and told us those tips go to the cashiers - not him! I'm so glad he told us...why would you tip someone for just taking your order? Overall this place was amazing. We look forward to going back very soon. Go during the day! We seriously had NO wait.

A 3.5-3.75, I went with the under because there was more "meh" than "wow." The big 2-0-0, woo hoo, I wanted to make this one special, so what did I decide to do? ÊProbably one of the most reviewed restaurants on yelp San Diego- Phil's ÊBBQ. ÊI've been hearing about this place since I came here, and I figured it was time to bite the bullet. The wife and I came out here on Father's Day, figuring more of the fancy places would be busier- WRONG. ÊAs we drove up there was definitely a line winding around the building. ÊWell, they must be doing something right. ÊAfter waiting in line for about 10 minutes, we elected to just order take out- after all it was a beautiful San Diego afternoon, why not? ÊI was told take out would be about 35-40 minutes, oh well, we weren't going any where that day anyways (though in hindsight, it looks like we could've gotten a table if we had waited another 20 minutes or so). Menu is pretty basic, but they cover all their bases. ÊThey have both pork ribs and beef ribs, along with chicken, pulled pork and your typical sides. ÊMy wife and I love pulled pork so we decided to order to broham sandwiches and a half baby back rib dinner with fries and potato salad. Ê40 minutes later our order was ready and we drove over to Mission Beach to grub. The good- baby back ribs were on point no doubt! ÊRibs fell off the bone, and were excellent. ÊThe 1/2 dinner was pretty huge too. ÊAt first we had pondered whether or not we should get a full rib dinner, we're glad we didn't because that would have been entirely too much food. ÊAnd speaking of too much food, their pulled pork sandwiches were HUGE. ÊI'm talking 1/2 lb-3/4 lb of pulled pork. ÊAbsolutely ridiculous. ÊThe fresh cut fries went very well with the ribs as well. The bad- Ok, I won't say bad, but the pulled pork wasn't anything mind blowing. ÊYeah it was good, and had a nice smoked flavor, but it wasn't mindblowing. ÊPlus (and I know it's bbq), but the sandwiches were really messy. ÊEvery time I took a bite, 1/8 of the sandwich would fall out. ÊMaybe I'm just being a bbq diva. ÊThe potato salad could've been from Von's. Overall- Not in my top ten of places to try in San Diego, but If you've never been to one of the bbq capitals in the nation (Memphis, Texas, etc...) certainly worth checking out. ÊBe prepared to wait, especially in the summer on the weekends.

Please don't go here and compare this to any other bbq place you've ever been to. It's not like, southern, Texas or anything you've had "back east". But it does taste like what you'd have if you were grillin' some bone-in chicken or ribs out back with some bbq sauce without the cleanup. Phil's is delicious for what it is. Be prepared to stand in line and no holding tables.

This is definitely the best BBQ I've ever had!! And that's not just in San Diego! I got the quarter rack baby back rib dinner and it was DELICIOUS! It was SO good that I ordered a half rack and the beef rib sampler to go for the next day, but ended up pretty much eating the rest right when I got home with my sister! Both beef and pork were awesomely delicioso, but the beef ribs had so much more meaty deliciousness...made my carnivorous side soooo happy. The sides varied in deliciousness...I would say that the corn on the cob was the best, especially with the seasoning at the table sprinkled on it! Oh! And did I mention it's delicious?! Although the food is THE BOMB (Yes, I said it!), it's not the best thing about Phil's. The BEST thing about this place are the PEOPLE that work there! Everyone is extremely fun and friendly! Which makes the experience there THAT much better! Made me go the extra mile to write my first review on Yelp. You will NOT be disappointed!

Finally tried the famed Phil's BBQ (featured on Man vs. Food)! I came here on a Sunday afternoon, and not gonna lie, after reading review after review on how the line seems long but the wait goes by pretty fast, I did not expect to wait for almost an hour. Nevertheless, with thousands of reviews and an average of 4.5 stars, I knew I had to stick it out and give Phil's a try. And everyone was right - the wait was DEFINITELY worth it. I knew that the portions would be ridiculous, so I chose the Chick Tickler - BBQ chicken with slaw, 2 giant onion rings and a ton of French Fries for $6.45. I wasn't a huge fan of the onion rings because I like them small and not so dough-y, but everything else was so so satisfying and delicious. The BBQ sauce was flavorful with a tangy kick, and the chicken was tender. I also tried a bit of the baby back rib, macaroni salad (my personal favorite side) and potato salad, all of which tasted incredible. So if you're hungry and craving for some BBQ, definitely make a trip to Phil's - you won't be disappointed.

With the thousands of reviews Phil's already has, it probably doesn't need yet another one to ramble on and on about how freaking DELICIOUS this place is! I get the same thing every time because it is amazing every single time- THE RIBS! Half rib dinner with the baby backs, macaroni salad and fries- it doesn't get any better. Of course the only down side is this place is usually always packed and always with a line, but speaking from experience- I have waited about an hour in line and still was happy because of how yummy it is. Not to mention EVERYONE IS SOOO FRIENDLY AND HELPFUL. LOVE!

The moment you step out of the car and take a look at the line forming outside the door at Phil's BBQ, you start to think 'Oh hellz no!" ÊBut then you stop and smell that aroma of saucy meat going into your head and you know you gotta jump on it. Ê Dubbed the Best BBQ in San Diego, the critics weren't kidding. ÊIt's always crowded pack here and there's a reason why. By far, this is the best place I've been to for good ribs. ÊStraight up it's damn good. ÊWhy do you think there's a line forming every night it's open? Ê And if you can muster the excruciating 1 hour+ wait for your food (to order; find a table; and wait) to arrive, trust me, your taste buds will thank you for it. Ê The restaurant may appear tiny from the outside but go inside and you'll notice a rather large dining area with wooden furnishing and that warm cabin-in-the-woods feel. ÊUnfortunately, it's just not big enough to house the hungry folks that pile in. ÊPhil's BBQ makes you wait in line first and order your food before sitting down. ÊAfter you order, then it's off to finding an available table inside which may seem hard at first with, but the wait time for orders will give you plenty of time to find a seat and chillax. ÊDon't make the mistake I did the 2nd time I came here and having my buddies' hold the fort while designating one of them to order for you...that's a no-no. Ê So while you wait for your food, you can play the available board games they have provided or watch the game playing on the TVs. ÊVery considerate of them. Okay onto the food. ÊTheir specialty is obviously the ribs. ÊYou have your choice of pork or beef ribs smothered with the most excellent BBQ sauce you'll taste. ÊBoth choices are excellent and very meaty but I prefer the beef ribs more. ÊPhil's also offers chicken too and there are even half-chicken/half-bbq combo platters which is a good starter choice if you want to get a taste of what they do best. ÊWhatever you order, you can be sure they'll be mouth-watering and juicy. ÊEverything is slow roasted and has that smokey flavor the way real BBQ should be. ÊAnd you have your choice of 2 small sides or a large side to go along with your meal. ÊAll this for about $9 and you got yourself a closer of a deal. And everything is so good, you got to eat it messy. ÊScrew table manners, just dig in. ÊThere's a washing counter that lets you wash down your dirty hands (and face) at ease. Ê Very convenient and ingenious. ÊIf I were to factor in the long wait times, I would actually give Phil's a 4.5 out of a 5 . ÊYes, good food takes time but dammit.. Phil's is a tease to your tastebuds and your hungry stomach the moment you step in. ÊMaking you wait for such goodness? ÊThat's torture!

Perhaps I'm a bit of a bbq snob being from Texas. ÊBbq = brisket...the kind of brisket that has been smoking for two weeks. Ê Phils likes pork, and lots of it. ÊThey have a few beef rib dinners as well as a beef sandwich but still there isn't a brisket plate! Come on Phils! ÊSo, although I really like the chickless dinner and the beefy ribs (they do fall off the bone), I just can't give this place more than 3 stars. ÊI do love their macaroni salad. ÊIt's delicious. ÊI also like that there is a bar area because how can you not have a beer when eating bbq. Ê Just a little note: You used to be able to call in your order and then eat there. ÊSupposedly, if the line is long (around the building long) you have to take your food to go because you've technically cut in line. ÊI almost got in trouble for it last night.

Our first attempt to go to Phil's BBQ for dinner was an epic fail -- one car went to the wrong Phil's BBQ, and the other went to the right one and left because the line was wrapped around the building. (If you didn't catch that, TIP: the Phil's BBQ on Goldfinch Street does not exist. ÊThat's what we get for being too hasty with a Blackberry and Google Maps.) We tried again the next day for lunch, and we got a table (on Superbowl Sunday, no less)! ÊThe place was surprisingly clean for food so messy, and I always love being surrounded by widescreen TVs. Ribs: 4 stars My friend and I shared one full rack of baby back ribs, and we couldn't finish them even though we wanted to. ÊThe meat was tender, and their sauce is really good. Sides: 3 stars Okay, I was pretty disappointed with the sides. ÊWe got a whole assortment of sides, and they were all just mediocre. ÊBleh coleslaw, beans whatever, standard fries. ÊBUT their onion rings are their saving grace. ÊSeriously, those are what all onion rings should aspire to be: thick, crispy, and delicious! Overall, 3.5 stars but I'll round up -- it's a good place to go to break the monotony of eating Mexican food in SD. ÊBut personally, I like BBQ joints for their sides as much as their ribs, and Everett and Jones in Oakland has Phil's beat on both fronts.

Am i the only one that misses Phil's Mission Hills location? Êa) it rhymed b) the food in mission hills was cooked with love, the food in sports arena is cooked with heat c) the atmosphere made me feel fuzzy. ÊThere's a reason you used to have to wait an hour to get food there and now there is not even a 20 minute wait, not that i like waiting but it just goes to show. ÊThe new Phil's looks like a chain restaurant and feels like one to people who knew and loved the old Phil's. ÊPhil, we will miss you, even though i will still go there whenever i want ribs.

But on our last trip to SD, we arrived mid-afternoon on a Friday. guess what? NO LINE. we walked right up to the counter, ordered our food and less than 5min later we were enjoying one of the best meals we've had in recent months. I'm by no means a BBQ expert, hell!

This place is dangerously delicious.... I'd come here anytime I'm near San Diego. The line is long, but it actually moves faster than you'd think if you were here for the first time. Since it was our first time here, we thought it would be convenient to just get the food to go, since our other group got there 30 minutes before us. So we ordered it to go, which took like 5 minutes, and went outside ... and noticed there were some seats. Just a cautionary note, you aren't allowed to get food to go, and eat it there, even if you take it "to go outside." Rhonda (lady controlling the line) did not look happy at first when she saw us eating.... but said its okay since it was our first time there. I just said I was from China....

I used to live in Texas, and I have experienced some of the best BBQ there is... With that said, Phil's BBQ is not a true BBQ place, maybe for city folks who have never experienced a true BBQ. This place is like your McDonalds of fast BBQ. The service is awesome. Very nice people working there. This place is casual, so expect to eat with your hands, otherwise you will not enjoy it. ÊI ate some type of chocolate pie that looked like an oversized Oreo. It was dry and didn't have flavor, so avoid wasting $6.

This restaurant is extremely popular. My sister gave them a call at 11, the time that they opened, to place an order. The receptionist gave us a little bit of an attitude but we got our orders in. When I drove out there to pick up our order, there was already a long line outside the door and looked like it was getting ready to wrap around the entire restaurant. We found the "phone orders" line which was pretty quick. The place was engulfed in the smell of bbq sauce. My sister and I watched as a waiter carried a tray of bbq beef sandwiches. They were loaded with meat, drizzled with sauce and had a huge pile of onion rings accompanying it. If we hadn't already ordered and there was a line, we would have chosen to stay in the restaurant to eat. It had such a homey feel to it. We ordered the full rack baby back ribs with fries and macaroni salads. I was not a huge fan of the fries but the macaroni salad was good. I usually prefer light sauce on my food but the the baby back ribs were extremely good with the extra sauce that dripped off of it as I ate. It tasted even better the next day (we ordered a little too much) :) ÊThe meat itself fell off the bones, was very tender and practically melted in your mouth. I would definitely come here ( whether it is to-go or eat-in) and would recommend it to anyone who loves bbq. I haven't had enough bbq to compare and say this is the best bbq but it is definitely good.

No words are enough to describe how delicious the ribs are!!!

I knew this was going to be a good experience, but I definitely fell short... I can't wait for the day when BF and I go back and get our BBQ faces again :) I also was very impressed about the onion rings (I am the kind of girl that asks for her food sans the onions, but I couldn't resist these humongous onion rings, and I am grateful I didn't skip them!!).

This place is HEAVEN... One of the best BBQ joints iv been to in SoCal! With over 2100 reviews, it is definitely the spot! The line to get in and dine literally wraps around the whole building to tell you the truth! If you come here around lunch time, aspect to wait about 30mins to an hour before you get in. Every meat I tried here is literally mouth watering and delicious... The meats were juicy, smokey, and had just the right amount of flavor. The ribs were fall off the bone and just melts in your mouth. The ribs though were slightly over sauced, so one thing I can suggest is to ask for light sauce. The service and hospitality everyone had there was great. Everyone was very friendly and greeted me with much enthusiasm. I rate this place overall a 5 and I would definitely come back for my 3rd time. :)

There's always that one place in a city that's over the top for BIG FOOD. The place for the biggest, sloppiest cuisine in San Diego has to go to Phil's. Once you walk in you wonder if this is a Disney ride or a restaurant with two lines one for the week kneed take out (phone orders) and the one for the gastronomically adventurous table hunters. The darkened decor of Phil's is emblazoned by the fire pits behind the wall long pass-through as ribs and briskets fly into styrene boxes faster than iPods at a Mac Convention. The smell is enough to make your eyes water as well as your mouth as you feel the tiny morsels of hickory flavored ash forever embeding themselves in your clothes. You can tell right away that the meat is well coated with a wonderful BBQ sauce. ÊThe place is packed by 5 P.M. so maybe the phone call is a better idea. The beef rib is a steak on a skeletal broom handle. ÊThe full order is three meals if you don't belong to a frat house and two if you do. A light sandwich in here is well over a pound of meat so don't go too crazy on your first order. ÊGod knows what the veggie burger looks like. Yes they do have one! The pork ribs are tender and the meat falls off the bone but I like them a little more crispy, thank you. The sides are descent and attribute to lack of a 5th star. ÊAlthough the beans are surprisingly tangy without massive amounts of sugar. ÊThe corn tastes boiled when it should be broiled. Fries are fare but the rings are better. ÊA little more vinegar in the potato salad would be perfect. Expect leftovers for Êa week. ÊYou may also never need nor want an air freshener in your car again.

Hands down, the BEST BBQ joint in San Diego! The food is outstanding, everything from their pork ribs to their BBQ sandwich. The french fries are freshly made and the onion rings are huge. Even their sweetened black tea is good!! You can't loose with Phil's BBQ!! BTW, the best time to go is early evening around 3:30-4:30 because the lines are not as long. Any other time, the line can get extremely long so be prepared to wait.

Phil's, oh Phil's... where do I begin? ÊYou are a fantastic treat and almost always worth the wait. ÊI usually order the Broham with coleslaw on the side and a few french fries (usually pilfered from other plates around me). Ê Ê ÊThis meal is absolutely delicious! To avoid the wait, call your order in, pick it up and go enjoy it at a local park. ÊYou don't need to sit in the restaurant to have an incredible BBQ meal!

Just went back a week or so ago - man, i had forgotten how DELICIOUS you were. ÊThe joint is still as packed as ever and the food more yummy than i remember. Potato salad is "meh" but the beans, cole slaw and BBQ is where it's at. ÊIf only you had cornbread i'd be in heaven. ÊGlad to see the sauce is at Costco - when i cant get my Phil's fix at the restaurant this'll be a good substitute. ÊYeeehaw!

Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm If you watch food commercials and imagine how great its going to taste, then order and receive the food only to be let down... NOT THE CASE! Imagine great ribs, GREAT sauce, great sides. Lives up to the hype. Amazing Ribs, Great Food and Help (not that much is needed anyways) Usually a bit busy but for GOOD reason and definitely WORTH THE WAIT. Will be returning time and time again ps- also has a few veggie dishes as well

Everything has pretty much already been said, so I'm going to keep it short and sweet with a haiku: great food at reasonable price. mouth waters while writing this haiku for Phil's I will comment on the sauce: perfect kick, spices pulling through, and not too tangy or sweet. Perfect compliment to the food as it really accents the meat and smokiness without covering it up.

Yes, it is one of the best BBQ place in SD. Ê I remember way back when Phil's was in Mission Hills tucked away in a little hole in the wall place that they called home. ÊI used to get my hair done around the corner and could smell the wonderful smoke while I was in the salon. ÊLet's just say the saliva trail on my chin did not look pretty (even after an awesome hair cut). Anyway... After moving to the Sports Area, Phil's has really grown (literally and figuratively) into a delish dish joint. Ê Just about everything on their menu is great. ÊI am partial to pulled pork and sausages so those are my go-to grub. ÊA meal is not complete without the onion rings and oh yeah baby wash it all down with some sweet potato fries.

bomb dot com. i had ribs once and i hated it. i ate a rib here and the bone was CLEAN. the chicken dinner was delicious. juicy, and slathered in their BBQ sauce which has a hint of spicyness. the baked potato is OMG worthy. cheese that ooey gooey and melty inside with butter and sour cream? its a heart attack thats waiting to happen and so worth having. the onion rings are delicious. no stringy onion pieces that come out of the batter when you take a bite. you get a good amount of onion in every mouthful and its deeeelicious. they have onion rings that are bigger than some of the bracelets i own! french fries are hot, crispy, and like crack when sprinkled and tossed with the seasoning thats at every table. i didnt even use ketchup!!! come here when you're starving, or with other starving people.

Great Great Food!... Im not gonna take away just because you cant find parking sometimes, there is a long line, and you have to wait. Im rating the food not the wait and parking. Sure its a struggle to find parking, but thats just part of it, once your out of your car you smell them ribs and you head to the line. As you wait you mouth waters and as you get closer, you find out that line is a good thing. Why? well because the have menus outside so you get time to figure out what you want haha. Honestly, its well worth it, finger licking good ribs, delicious chicken, and mouth watering sandwiches. The sides a great too very tasty. Even though there is a line service is usually pretty quick and the staff is real friendly. Honestly, i have never waited more than 40 mins 1 hour tops. ÊI usually go with a group so time passes pretty quick chatting outside. 1 hour is fine for me especially if youve never been their or are with people who have never been their. If you really dont wanna wait, you can always call in and order out. Dont be afraid the line and the wait, this place is guuuuoood!

If there's anything I miss about living in what I used to call the godforsaken black hole (aka San Diego), it would have to be Phil's. ÊI didn't quite understand BBQ until I met Phil, and he then proceeded to show me the world. ÊThe menu is fairly straightforward: pork and beef ribs, and chicken. ÊThere are also a handful of sides to choose from, including potato salad, coleslaw, french fries, and beans. ÊAll of the meat is incredibly tender and juicy, and never fails to be so each and every time. ÊRib meat falls too easily off the bone, much like a silk charmeuse slip off of a French whore in a Godard film. I started going to Phil's at its original location off of Washington, in the Hillcrest neighborhood. ÊAlthough it was a small joint, that was also its appeal. ÊAmazingly the wait would never be too long, and I loved their wash-up stations where you could periodically get up to clean your dirty paws from the extra saucy ribs. ÊFrom my understanding, this location is undergoing renovation, but it seems to be taking them a long ass time to get it together. Ê Now that Phil has decided to expand with that behemoth on Sports Arena Blvd., the restaurant's popularity has soared, like, a million-fold. ÊThe last time I went, the line was practically wrapping around the restaurant. ÊThis bothers me, because anyone who knows understands my disdain for hype. ÊBut for Phil, I GUESS I'll have to make an exception.

I've been to Phil's BBQ a few times. If I could, i would go there every week. But unfortunately Phil's BBQ is too far from LA; why can't they open one in LA?! As you walk toward the restaurant, you can smell the aroma of BBQ..mmmmm..yuummmyyy.. meeaaatttt *drools* The ribs here are so flavorful..so saucy...sooo delicious. The meat just falls out of the bone. Every bite i take is just pure goodness! I normally order their full rack of baby back ribs..and i will devoured all of it in one sitting. The fries here are good too. but mainly i'm here for the ribs, dont care about the side dishes. Man, just typing up this review is making me salivate. I'm not going to say it's the best ribs in the whole world cuz i havent tried that many bbq places, but in my opinion, i think it's better than Lucille's. So if you havent try Phil's BBQ, make a stop there today. I think the only problem i have w/ Phil's BBQ is their seating arrangement. You don't always get a table right away, you have to wait and wait for people to leave. It's annoying especially when u have your plate of food in hands but you're just waiting for a table to sit.

Five minus two stars this time around? Why you ask? Well, this past Saturday evening, an employee forgot to give us a receipt for our order, but still gave us a pager so we can be called. ÊIt didn't occur to us at first that we didn't receive a receipt and after 25 mins of chit-chatter, we realized that our stomachs were still empty, and our pager has still not vibrated. ÊSo two people from our party go up to inquire and low and behold, they ask us for our receipt. ÊWe tell them that we actually never received one so they check with the cashier who handled our order and come back to us saying that the order was in fact NEVER PLACED and that they were going to make our two family rib dinners right away. ÊThey quickly brought our food out (said it would take a minute) but we didn't really receive any apologies in return for their mistake. Ê Mind you, we waited outside in the rain for 45 minutes to place this "lost order" that we paid $50 for. ÊAlthough the food was still good, my entire party and myself were very disappointed that we weren't approached by the manager or any of the staff to express their apologies. ÊIf we didn't say anything about our order taking too long, it wouldve gone unnoticed. ÊOur waiter didn't even notice how long we were waiting. ÊAlso, all the people who were waiting the same time as us, were already done eating by the time we got our food.

Phil's BBQ - the day there isn't a line is the day when it probably closed down for whatever reason. At around 11am, we drove past this restaurant and there was a line, when we actually came back on Sunday at 5pm, there was a line which lasted an hour, when we finished eating and walked out, there was a line which was a bit longer than the 5pm line, and even at 8:30pm on a Sunday night, there was still a semi-line out the door. All I can say is, good job Phil's! My family and my brother's friends came here to celebrate the end of his bodybuilding competition, and we sure celebrated in style. A whole cow and half a pig as well as a few chicken were probably killed that day in honor of us. We needed a table of ten and the workers there were very nice and accommodating. Since it was my first time there, I wasn't sure if they were always like this, or if they were afraid to mess with all these big looking bald dudes. Regardless, the service was great. We tried a bit of everything - beef ribs, baby back ribs, chicken, onion rings, cole slaw, fries (which are surprisingly good for just regular fries) and potato salad. I don't think I have an absolute favorite since everything is pretty dang good, and the price was dang good as well. Even though there was still a line out the door after we were done eating and just sitting due to food coma, the workers did not ask us to leave... again, I wasn't sure if they're just like that to big groups or because there were some intimidating looking guys there. We got a bottle of "Phil's BBQ Sauce" because we answered a question correctly, the worker said it was because we ordered lots of party platters and they just wanted to throw in a little freebie for answering the questions "What city did we originate from?" (answer: Cleveland) correctly. Although the wait was horrendously long, it's well worth it. While waiting in line, they have those signs like Disneyland, "You are 21 minutes away from the front of the line".... awesome! Oh, and it was also featured on the travel channel.

I love this place. Everything about this place I love... well scratch that, the wait I hate... especially that damn sign that says "21 minutes and 14 seconds". I can't pick anything else buy the baby back ribs. Damn those are so dang good. I mean FINGERLICKIN good. The sauce is sweet with the right punches. It changes flavor in my mouth everytime I eat it. I even love eating with my hands. Perhaps its the primal nature about eating bbq? I don't care. It's so good. And while I'm not familiar with the average pricing, the fact that my friend and I could share the full rack of baby back ribs and sides and still have food left for $19 bucks plus tax. Its good. The staff has always been helpful whenever we came there. Here's a tip, you can skip the wait if you are willing to sit in the bar area and you can order at the bar! Next time, I'll order the El Toro... I was meaning to order it but after watching Adam Richman from Man Versus Food eat it, yum. So yes, visit this San Diego staple. Although, I can't wait for it to open in San Marcos!!!!

PHIL'S... DELICIOUS, SCRUMPTIOUS, MOUTH-WATERING. I'm sure by now all the yelp readers know what Phil's bbq offers. I almost always get the half rack with baby back ribs. It comes with about 10-12 ribs which is more than enough for me. It also comes with 2 sides and I always get the macaroni salad and fries. The ribs are just out of this world. The meat just falls off the bone and it is perfectly marinated in their bbq sauce. The sides are also very delicious. After I eat Phil's bbq, I am ALWAYS satisfied and full... and all this for $12! Yay!

Coming from the southeast US, the way to tell if a barbecue restaurant is worth it's salt is how good the pork ribs are. Now a really good pork rib has a rub on it, and is smoked over wood (preferably hickory) so one can taste the smoke. Phil's tries to cover up the fact the these ribs have never even been anywhere near smoke by slathering the ribs up with a sauce. One can do the same thing in a gas oven and get similar results. It tastes good, but it's not barbecue. The sides were tasty, and well prepared.

I love this place. I came here with Wilmar D., Sarah M., and two other friends who aren't on Yelp (what losers). I was apprehensive at first. I'm not a huge fan of eating ginormous portions of meat, and the side dishes that came with were all fried potato and coleslaw. For the record, I have never liked coleslaw. I've always hated it. This place changed my mind. I'm not going to be craving it anytime, but it can be pretty good with good BBQ. Which is what this place serves. Really good BBQ. I ordered the quarter pound ribs. The meat came right off the bone, it was sooo tender. Excuse me while I wipe my drool off my chin. It's a little noisy inside, but it doesn't really matter if you call in your order and just pick it up to eat somewhere else. It's just as tasty. Best BBQ of life.

I can't speak as to whether this is genuine BBQ or not, but I can comfortably say this is the best BBQ I've had in San Diego outside of my own grill. This place gets PACKED. ÊExpect a line that runs out the door and possibly down the sidewalk, but it moved pretty quickly. ÊThe service was prompt as well (they had my food ready within 5 minutes). I went with the ribless / chickless platter, which is basically rib meat and chicken without the bones. ÊBoth items were tender, moist enough and tasty. ÊI got their potato salad and baked beans on the side and they were both good as well. ÊIt was an ample sized meal and definitely filled me up. ÊEverything was covered in BBQ sauce which is typical, and I'd qualify it as sweet. I'm subtracting 1 star because of the lady that polices the front of the line though. ÊNever, never, NEVER give a customer (especially me), under any circumstances, the "evil eye," which she gave to me when I was waved up to the counter by the cashier to place my order. ÊYou stepped away for a minute ... what am I supposed to do, wait until you get back even though the cashier is waving me forward? ÊI think not ...

Decent BBQ, the sauce isn't the best but the meat was perfect. I like my sauce a little peppery, and their sauce is really sweet. Their onion rings are amazing and HUGE! I've had the the broham and the tri-tip sandwiches, and I really enjoyed the tri-tip. Their buns are super tasty as well. Go when they first open for lunch at 11 on weekdays and there is barely any wait. Overall though, good BBQ and service. I wouldn't recommend going when there is a line that stretches all the way around the building, the food isn't that special. It's good, but not worth waiting in line for. Definitely a place to get good BBQ though.

Had a solid man date with my buddy Jon here during spring break. ÊYes, bromance was in the air as we sat down with my combo beef rib and chicken dinner and his full rack of baby back ribs. ÊI got cole slaw and fries for my side dishes and he opted for a whole ear of grilled corn. ÊAnd of course no man date is complete without a pitcher of Arrogant Bastard Ale and two frosted pint glasses. ÊThis was going to be epic. Ê The beef ribs were pretty standard, a little more char than I usually like on my grilled meat, but the sauce was incredible and made up for some of the ashy morsels. ÊMy chicken, however, was awesome. ÊSo juicy and the skin was nice and crispy. ÊBeautiful. ÊJon's baby back ribs were delicious, of course, definitely better than the beef ribs, but you know I always gotta try them. ÊOh we also got an order of onion rings and extra bbq sauce that they give to you warm. ÊIncredible. ÊI should also say that the service here is great, with friendly cashiers and bus staff. ÊThe only thing that would have this place better was if they had Stone IPA on draft. ÊMan that should be a law for any food establishment in San Diego.

5 stars without a doubt! The BBQ ribs here are by far the best ribs i've ever tasted in my life! The sauce, the texture, everything is just so good i don't even know how to describe it! I would just say... the meat melts in your mouth!!!!!!!! i'm not kidding.. I also love their onion rings (they're about the size of your face! HAHA) one bad thing about this place is that everything is self-serve. You have to find your own table, you pick up your own food, you do everything. It's not really a bad thing actually, but i guess it could be a bit inconvenient for some people. the place is usually PACKED and the lines can get really long, so if you know what you want, order ahead of time over the phone! that'll definitely help you save some time! :)

What can I say... I went in starving I came out ready to explode all with spending around 10 dollars *2 thumbs up* Drove by here a couple of times the long lines scared me away but I'm told by my friends that the lines mover very quick even though they look intimidating. Today I went around 9:30 so there was no line, food came quick and boy was it GOOOOOOOOOOOOD. I wish had a picture of me gnawing on the bone like a dog, it was crazy, my face was covered with BBQ sauce and hands covered with it as well. Got the full rack of beefy ribs and split it with my gf, filled both of us up (both of us are fatasses, so this says a lot) overall -happy with the food -happy with the prices -happy with the quick clean up they did of our stuff after we were done -happy with the hand washing sinks in 2 locations -happy with the quickness the food was ready -happy happy happy with that said I felt the potato salad could have had more flavor and the ribs could have ÊA LOT less fat, I felt like i was eating jelly or something cause it was all fat, but I was so hungry that I didn't care. overall a great place and would come back again for sure, but does have some minor areas they could improve upon.

PASS THE BIB! $11.95 = 2 HUGE spare ribs, 1 ENORMOUS quarter chicken, 2 HEFTY portions of sides and 1 MESSY FACE! This plate will feed 2, in my opinion. The ribs and chicken were grilled to perfection--the meat practically melted as I bit into it. VERY DELICIOUS! Their BBQ sauce is one of the best I've tasted and they're not shy about pouring it all over! Call ahead or if you don't mind waiting 20 minutes just to get in the door, CHECK IT OUT!

So I have to write a review for this place because they truly deserve it :) First of the ribs are delicious, i had the baby back ribs and they are bbqed to perfection. ÊThe meat is so juicy and tender, exactly how ribs should be. ÊThe collosal onion rings are also to die for, it is a large order and you'll probably be overstuffed if you're not sharing it with a few other ppl. ÊI've had the macaroni salald which i loveee and the potato salad is just alright. Tip! ORDER TOGO! ÊSo the line at Phil's get's ridiculously long, my friend and I decided to go to the togo line..which had only a handful of ppl versus 30+ ppl. ÊWe ordered togo and my friends Veggie Burger takes longer to make (~ 20 mins), my ribs came out within 5-10 mins. ÊWhile we were waiting in line the store manager noticed that only i had my food and my friend was still waiting. ÊHe graciously, told me that he would take the ribs i had and remake me new ones so that my food won't be cold by the time we got the burger. ÊProbably the best customer service i have received in a restaurant. ÊHe even threw in a few extra ribs for me and upgraded the sides to a large order. Ê Soo all in all, on top of the great food the customer service is also excellent :) ÊSo be sure to make a trip to Phil's you won't regret it ;) and if u don't want to wait, order togo instead and drive out to mission bay park (2.5 miles away) and have a little bbq picnic by the bay on a sunny san diego day :)

We came here for the first time about a year ago and we liked the food. We were not so thrilled with the 45 min wait for our lunch. I was so excited to find out that we were going to Phil's for dinner last night with our friends. When we arrived, the line was out the door, around the building and I quickly developed a bad headache and almost turned into a whiney baby. Finally, after half an hour patiently waiting in line, reading every word on the big menu hung on the wall, we got to the counter and were greeted by a smiling young man who seem genuinely excited to take our order. I was so excited to order the baby backs, beef ribs, corn, fries, baked potato. I remembered that the ribs were really good, but, for some reason, this time, I really didn't enjoy the sauce. I didn't remember it to be so tangy and sour. I didn't like it at all. The sauce on the heavier beef ribs were alright but on the baby back, it was overwhelming and overpowering the tender pork. It's really too bad cuz I was really hoping to enjoy the ribs here. I grabbed my soda cup while sweetie paid for dinner, and I think I perked up with a sip of rootbeer. We found a table and eagerly waited for the vibrating pager to inform us our dinner is ready for pick-up. We ordered beef ribs, baby back ribs and corn on the cob, macaroni salad, and french fries. I started munching on with a few pieces of french fries then went straight into the my big hearty beef rib. I absolutely love it. There was a perfect bite to each bite and the flavor was perfectly savory.

I have been hesitant to review this place because I thought it was so cliche. ÊSo I am going to keep it short and funky! Succulent pork drenched in barbecue sauce is an amazing combination. If you want to get the most meat for your money, "that's what she said," order the Rib-less Dinner! ÊIt only costs 10.95 and includes two sides. ÊYou will get twice as much meat as ordering the full slab of baby back ribs. Short and funky!

We decided to come here after a Padres game, figuring a plate of Phil's BBQ would sweeten up the taste of a loss to those #(*&#$ Giants! ÊBut since the game did take over 3 hours and it took me a while to get out of downtown, I didn't have any big hopes they'd still be open when we arrived at a quarter to 11pm. ÊBut open they were (until 11pm on Friday & Saturday I think) and with no waiting line, we zoomed right in, made our order, and sat easily amongst a still 2/3rds full restaurant. Wait time was the normal several minutes (why rush good food?) and to my surprise, the food was just as hot, fresh, and tasty as it is any other time of the day! ÊWhat's more, the staff was understanding about the time we got in and told us not to worry about rushing to eat before the place closed. As usual, the BBQ cheeseburger rocked with a nice fat onion ring on top, and my wife's beef ribs in the rib dinner just fell off the bone once she dug in. ÊSo once again my view of Phil's is that its simply greatness and my anticipation for the opening San Marcos location is even higher! ÊMmmmmmmmm...Phil's in North County. ÊI'm there!

Everyone and their momma since moving San Diego and learning that I love BBQ, has told me that I have to go check out Phil's BBQ. ÊIt is supposed to be the best BBQ in San Diego and perhaps the whole world. ÊWhile I do not argue that Phil's BBQ is very good, I cannot join everyone else in their hyperbole regarding Phil's Q. ÊIt does not make me jizz my pants - the litmus test for the ultimate BBQ. When my girlfriend and I try new places we order a variety of things so we can get a lay of the land. ÊWe tried Phil's out Saturday and on advice of several people called in our order. ÊAt a good 'Q joint, I think one MUST have some: pork ribs, pulled pork, chicken and sausage (aka hot links). ÊThose 4 things are the four corner stones of any good BBQ joint in my opinion. ÊAfter that it boils down to preparation: sauce vs dry rub or combo, the kind of bbq sauce, smoke, etc. Phil's gets points for good technique on smoking their meats. ÊThe chicken and baby back ribs were smoked well. ÊThe meat portions were huge and they didn't skimp. ÊThere wasn't the prominent tell tale smoke ring usually evident in good Q, but the meat was good. ÊThe meat was lightly seasoned and then bathed in a sweet and tangy BBQ. ÊThe sauce balance in the sauce was off however. ÊIt was more tang than anything else in the sauce. ÊWhoever made that sauce was a little heavy handed with the vinegar. ÊNext time we'll be ordering the sauce on the side. Here are the things I was not crazy about: 1) You know you're popular, so get a bigger place. ÊThe line around the corner seems incredibly unnecessary and just for ego boosting. 2) I didn't see an option on the menu to order pulled pork seperately or with a combo with something else. ÊIt was only available in a sandwich. 3) The prices seemed high 4) The baked beans were not anything to write home about - skip them 5) The potato salad while well seasoned, the red potatoes were woefully undercooked 6) The portions were small for the take-out sides All and all, when I don't want to spend the time making my own BBQ it's good to know there is a viable alternative nearby. ÊAnd oh yea, where are the rolls or bread to sop up the BBQ sauce?? ÊThere were none with our order. ÊOr how about some greens?? ÊMay be I'm just thinking more southern BBQ.

OV-ER-RA-TED!!! I was completely overwhelmed with the ridiculous waits the last couple times we tried to go grab some famous Phil's BBQ. And I thought with all the hype it's GOT to be good. Well, I was wrong. They sure made me look like a fool. 1.) Menu set up is a bit cluttered and confusing. 2.) The following items that make a barbeque weren't on the menu! Such as: Ê-Macaroni and Cheese Ê-Tri-tip Ê-Brisket 3.) There's one choice of BBQ sauce. (And it was a bit too tangy for my taste.) 4.) A bit dry/over cooked. The pieces of chicken and ribs we got were burnt. (Not too happy about that.) And it seemed they didnt put enough sauce on our meals. I'll say, the place most definitely will get you in and I guess you can't knock it 'til you try it. But I personally wasn't too impressed. On a good note, the prices aren't too bad and service is friendly.

After going back a second time I've decided to bump it up another star. I think that their BBQ chicken should pretty much just be ignored because I didn't like it too much the first time I went there and the 2nd time I went there the other people who ordered the chicken didn't really like it either. Just order the BEEFY ribs, all day everyday. It's like the hugest piece of meat ever, and with the barbecue sauce it's basically a giant meat lollipop. Delicious.

Finally tried this place for the first time. I was never willing to wait in a long line Êbefore but bored and not really hungry, I was willing to wait in line on a late Sunday night. This place is good, but I can't really justify the long wait to go again, maybe for to go. This place is worth trying once but there are many other good BBQ places in San Diego also where the wait isn't ridiculous. Great for the owner though!

Just like the 49ers of the 80's NFL and the Florida State Seminoles of the 90's NCAA football, Phil's dominates the rib joint scene. ÊIt's not even close. ÊI'm 29 years old (as of this weekend) and the days of waiting over an hour in line for a meal are few and far between. ÊIf i'm gonna wait that long, it damn well better have happy ending. ÊWell luckily you get a happy ending at Phils. ÊAnd not the illegal kind (I assume, I didn't ask). Ê It took about an hour and 15 minutes to get in on a Thursday, however, the food ordering and serving was relatively fast once your in the door. ÊThe service was OK at best, but to be honest the food was so good they could have punched me in the face at the register and I would still give 5 stars. ÊService is irrelevant. I got the baby back ribs with sides of baked beans and potato salad. ÊThey were extremely tender, drenched in BBQ sauce, and finished off on a grill just enough that the edges are just slightly charred. ÊThis is exactly the way I like my BBQ so for me it was as good as it gets and then some. ÊThe sides were also top notch. Ê The meal was so good in fact that I now have an almost adverse reaction to BBQ joints in SF. ÊPlaces that I used to consider decent I can no longer tolerate. ÊI will be petitioning to have these local mom and pop businesses closed in hopes that Phil's BBQ will consider opening a branch in the Bay Area and eventually become a global conglomerate. Ê Phil's shall become the first food purveyor REQUIRED to be a monopoly by the US government. ÊMuahahahahahahahahahaha!!!!! ÊAlso people who dress up their dogs or jump in pictures would be shot. Nate's BBQ take your crap ribs and get the hell outta the Bay Area!!

If you're in San Diego, you MUST come here. The baby back ribs are TO DIE FOR. Sometimes the wait is long, but I've never been disappointed, even after waiting a long time. The service here is top notch as well. I'm not a big fan of the beef ribs, but many of my friends are, so give that a try if you're game. The best things on the menu (in my humble opinion, of course) are: baby back ribs chicken(both the ribs and chicken meat fall right off the bone and basically melt in your mouth) onion rings (huge battered onion rings) fries (standard, but always good) coleslaw macaroni salad I always get a half baby back rib rack dinner with coleslaw and mac salad. Bathrooms are clean, service is excellent, food is DELICIOUS, what's not to like??

Heard about this place from triple d so we decided to give it a try and would definately call this place a keeper. ÊWe were going to do a take out order and phoned it in to them. ÊThat turned out to be the best thing to do with this place because when I showed up there was a line not only out the door but around the building. ÊThey had a seperate line for phone orders so I was in and out in 20 minutes. Ê The prices are on par with any other BBQ joint with me and the wife getting out for $30. ÊShe had a full rack of baby back ribs and I had a half all white meat chicken, and we shared onion rings. Ê The onion rings came with a thick and crunchy batter that was just to die for. ÊThe ribs were soft and fell off the bone when I at them. ÊThey were also so flavorful that we could have eaten them without sauce if we wanted. ÊThe chicken was moist for white meat and again could have been eaten without sauce. Now because we the meat was good enough to be eaten without sauce doesn't mean that we ate them without sauce. ÊThe sauce was a perfect balance of flavors, it was Êsweet tangy and a little spicy.

The two factors that will probably most determine whether you like Phil's are what you think of their BBQ sauce (since they put in on everything) and how you feel about waiting in line to get in (since you might end up spending more time outside waiting to get in than inside eating). Once inside, you order, receive a pager, get drinks and cutlery, Êand then find a place to sit if a table was not already reserved or selected by one of the hostesses. By this time, your pager will probably alert you that your food is ready. Instead of napkins, each table has a roll of paper towels. The big draw is probably the ribs - but if you want both more meat and a lower cost, I'd recommend ordering one of what they call a "sandwich". Be sure to get a fork, because they give you far more meat than what fits in the sandwich. Phil's has a note to Yelper's at the entrance asking to let them know of any problems before Yelping - so be sure to say something if the restrooms look like they did when I was there....

the old place in Hillcrest was more conducive to a pre-meal curbside hotboxing session. ÊThe hugeness and franchise-sports bar look of the new location speaks volumes on how popular Phil's has gotten. ÊYou can go there for lunch on any given day and find a line out the door (if you're ordering for pick-up it's best to call them to place an order, for easy pickup.) If you're a seasoned bbq connoisseur then Phil's won't get you especially worked up, but as far as bbq in san diego go...it's an accessible spot (read: you don't have to drive to the hood to eat) with all the modern conveniences (espn-hd, local microbrews,) and although it's been given the wal-mart treatment and a dude taking a rip off the bubbler in the parking lot has become an activity less unlikely to be seen, the food is still pretty good. except the onion rings. it's like eating an onion covered in mummy. Êi don't like when my side dishes taste like king tut. i saw an old friend, big mig aka the chupacabra there eating the beefy ribs with a side of onion rings. ÊHe validated my claim by saying, "don't order the onion rings. they is nasty." there you go.

I'm gonna give this place five stars because between you and me, this is the greatest place to get some barbeque anywhere. Being probably the least biggest fan of barbeque in the past, this restaurant was able to change my mind around in a big way. It's the kind of place you'd want to take your friends who are in town for a couple of days and just want some good quality comfort food. Another important note--at first sight, Phil's may look like the longest wait for food ever, especially during any of the peak hours, but they serve their food in a very efficient way which moves the line rather quickly-- so don't be daunted by the Disneyland ride lines wrapping around the restaurant, trust. It'll take you no longer than 15-20 minutes for some of the best bbq you've ever had, so just bear with it (you'll have time to digest whatever salad or mcgarbage you had before, jk...kinda :) ). Anyway, I always get the best of both (which is both bbq chicken and bbq pork ribs or whatever other combinations they have on the menu), because seriously, when do you ever get a chance to get the best of both in anything? Right? Right. Offered at a very reasonable $13-14 dollars, this meal includes two small sides as well. When considering sides I have to recommend the beans, coleslaw, or macaroni salad...but then again, if you're down to spend a couple more dollars, do yourself a favor and indulge yourself in some home-made onion rings made from their OWN batter. I've probably praised this place more than I should, but when I think about how satisfied I am everytime I leave this place, it's more than deserving. Hope this helps any doubters!

ok so i decided to take a little vacay out to SD and a lot of my friends have told me about this BBQ joint. So after all this hype Ive been reading about on Yelp and hearing from friends, it was a must go to spot before coming back to LA. As i pulled up the parking lot i was wowed to see the long the line and how full the lot was. i got out and did my thing and stood in line. As i was standing in line i couldn't help but think, " damn this place has to be good" " and look the line only gets longer, i cant wait". as i approached the front corner of the building i saw a sign on the corner it states " approx 21 minutes from sitting" Êat this point i was like "damn this place better be good and worth my time". As i stood in line and i finally entered the building i saw all the stickers on the window for "nominated restaurant Êfor the years 2004-2010" and i was like damn this is starting to build a lot more hype. The hostess was being funny and entertained the hungry mob for a few minutes. The hostess asked if i ever been to Phils i said no and she explains the whole spiel. so i get to the cashier and they asked what did i want to order so i ordered the baby back ribs and the chicken, with the 2 small order of the baked beans and potato salad. i knew that i would be sharing my meal with another person so i ordered a small side of the onion rings. the cost of the meal wasn't bad considering it was filling for 2 people. Any who, we are here on yelp to rate the facility for the tasting of the food and not the cost . so here it goes. i personally think the BBQ was not as good as what i have had before. the baby back ribs taste like its been steamed cooked or boiled before it was dipped in sauce then bbq-ed, meaning it was double cooked. the chicken was the toughest and driest chicken i have ever eaten. having done bbq's at my own house and for an amusement park, i personally believe that i have cooked better bbq. for a toe to toe comparison of bbq, the bbq at Lucille's bbq is 10 times better. your every day bbq sauce bull's eye or kc masterpiece tastes way better. through and through of my experience, i believe this place is way over rated and not worth the wait line. plus its like a chow line type of deal. anyone that rates this place as being a 3 to 5 stars needs to go over their reviews again and try a different bbq joint because honestly i don't think they have tried any other bbq joints.

We went on a Sunday right around noon, and I have to admit, the line was really intimidating. To our happy surprise, it moved pretty fast. After reading some Yelp reviews, we decided on the Big Broham sandwich with the coleslaw on the side so that we could try more of their side dishes! We also got a quarter order of the baby back ribs with macaroni salad and fries as our sides. I'm not gonna lie just because this place is so highly rated -- I have had better... but that's because I drove cross-country once and had some unbelievable ribs and BBQ at some random place in rural Tennessee and this is what I compare all ribs to. Now THAT was what you call fall-off-the-bones tender, so I find that whenever someone uses this as a description for ribs, they're usually exaggerating. With those Tennessee ribs, I literally would stick the fork in and the meat would fall off. I don't remember Phil's BBQ being as tender as that, but it was definitely tender... just not "meat-falling-off-the-bones" tender like. Way better than overpriced Lucille's of course. Overall, the food, atmosphere, and especially service from a waitress/bus girl in particular, were all great and I would come back again when I'm in the area in a heartbeat. P.S. There was a HOT model looking delivery man, so single ladies -- get your food catered from here!! ;P

Finger-Lickin' Good Typically I usually prefer the veggies over any type of meat (especially nowadays since I have been trying to watch my figure.) However, on this particular Sunday evening, I found that all of my concerns had magically disappeared the moment I stepped out of the car and into the restaurant's parking lot. Instantly, I was surrounded by the aromas of long smoked barbequed meat, mixed together with the sweet and tangy smells of their specialty barbeque sauce. As my friends and I stood in line, (which only took about 15-20 minutes) we were soon to learn that the tantalizing aromas were not the only teaser that Phil's had in store for us. With each moving step towards the door, our eyes were locked on the plates of ribs, fries, and shredded meat that was easily visible through the large glass windows of the restaurant. It was definitely a predator and prey moment, bringing out our deeply buried animal instincts. This restaurant is well aware of its effects, luring in outsiders like us who drove about an hour to satisfy our barbeque cravings. Every second leading up to the moment we placed our orders, contributed to our selfish desires to want to consume more than we could handle. Surprisingly, with the help of two guys and three girls weighing in at about 100 pounds each, we were able to finish our meal of pork baby back ribs, fries, coleslaw, baked beans, corn on the cob, and the Flintstone-sized beef ribs. However, the last bite shared between Diana and I definitely pushed us over the top. The drive home was an agonizing one, each stomach filled to its capacity with pig and cow. (Sigh) What a wonderful experience....

I went here with four of my buddies and we spent the whole meal in silence I think because we were savoring how good it was! There can be a really long wait outside but it goes by really fast, and once you get inside, you realize it was all worth it. ÊThe prices are the most reasonable I have seen for barbeque and its just delicious. ÊYou just have to try it to be in the same boat as me I guess. Everything seems fresh as well. ÊWhen you usually order coleslaw or potato salad with barbeque, it seems like you already know what it will taste like, but I think they make it all fresh here, in house, which is a really nice treat. Ê I loved it and and I can't wait to go back. Awesome. WOO HOO! Nice.

The food is great, the price is fair, and the environment is satisfying. If the food provided me with the daily nutrition I required, I'd probably eat ribs and fries everyday all day. RECOMMENDATIONS: If you've got a large appetite like myself, get the beef rib dinner with fries and coleslaw or the mac salad. I'm definitely a fan of the beef ribs over the the baby back ribs. Fries are a must, especially because they're an entirely different style and caliber from that of standard fast food joint fries. I prefer the coleslaw for the mac purely because I feel like the mac salad is probably worse (health-wise) than the slaw. If you have a smaller appetite, you can't really go wrong with any of their other menu items except the chickless chicken. I advise against the chickless chicken because it's rather dry and unappetizing. ATMOSPHERE: The staff here is very helpful and friendly. There is no outdoor seating, but pretty ample seating inside. The line to get in can get upwards of an hour wait, but I would suggest to call for take-out if you can't stand the wait. The side portion sizes are smaller if you get your meal to-go, but the time you save is worth it. WHY FOUR? Honestly, with the exception of the fries, I really wish that Phils BBQ provided larger sides. The amount that the sides cost for the amount you get is cutting fairness pretty close, but at least the entre makes up for it. The wait can be a turn-off and has caused me to look elsewhere for casual dining, but it's all good if you have a place you can take your food to go. Also, vegetarian options are limited to purely sides, but it's a barbecue joint that focuses on ribs, so I'd say try Êsomewhere else if you can't eat the meat. CONCLUSION: If money and health weren't an issue, I'd probably try to eat at Phils BBQ at least every other day; but this is coming from a rib lover. -TanK

I don't know what people from Texas would think about this, but for a Californian eating at a California BBQ joint, this is incredible! The first thing you'll encounter when you walk up to the restaurant is the line. We came for dinner, and ended up waiting in line for about 40 minutes, but being a Disneyland annual passholder, it didn't feel all that long. The staff was very friendly; they would come out from time to time to greet us and thank us for coming. There's a reason the lines are so long--their food is just delicious! My wife and I shared an El Toro tri-tip sandwich, a baby back ribs and chicken combo, and a small order of onion rings. We ordered the macaroni salad and the baked beans as our combo sides. The El Toro is basically a mountain of tri-tip between a sandwich roll. The meat is so tender and juicy, and slathered in their delicious, tangy BBQ sauce. However, I didn't particularly like the roll, which ended up being kind of flat and chewy; I think a denser roll might hold up better, even though it might mean a heavier sandwich. I ended up just eating the tri-tip with a fork, and leaving the roll on the side. I don't order sandwiches for the bread, though; it's all about the meat for me! The baby-back ribs and chicken combo was amazing! The chicken was perfectly cooked--still moist and tender. The ribs were also fantastic! I bake my ribs at home, so I have pretty high expectations for ribs that "fall off the bone"; these ribs passed with flying colors! I also really liked their baked beans, which were sweet and tangy, and had a wonderful consistency--not watery or thin at all! I'm not big on macaroni salad in general, so I can't really judge this one, but my wife loved it; she was sad that she was too full to finish it. The onion rings were amazing! They use some huge onions for this, and the batter is delicious! Plus, you can always dip the rings in the BBQ sauce, which may be a little weird for those who prefer ranch or ketchup. I'm looking forward to coming back the next time I'm in San Diego!

One of the better bbq places I have been to. They serve chicken, beef ribs, baby back ribs, and pulled beef sandwiches that are smothered in their signature bbq sauce that can be purchased at san diego costcos. Anyways I got the baby back ribs full rack dinner for $21. The ribs were fall off the bone texture and the bbq sauce was very rich in flavor. (the strongest bbq flavor i have ever tasted). Although I got the full rack, it seemed it was still not enough. The dinner also came with 2 sides. I got the baked beans and potato salad. They were both adequate carb fillers to make me almost full. My friends also got onion rings and french fries which I might add were both very good and crunchy and worth trying. They also have separate hand wash stations not in the bathroom for customer convenience. This place can also get very busy and they do not open on mondays. Bottom line: Worth trying and one of the better bbqs that ive been to.

I love this place. ÊIf I could eat here everyday, I would. ÊBut that would mean spending half my life in line and the other half in open heart surgery. ÊStill, almost worth it. Usually I get the BBQ Broham sandwich. ÊSilly name, but one of the better pulled pork sandwiches I've had on the left coast. ÊThe meat is tender and juicy with a nice smoky flavor, and it is HEAPED all over a bun totally inadequate to the task. ÊThats a good thing. ÊNo scrimping at this place! ÊI'm not usually a fan of slaw on my pulled pork, but I like Phil's - especially with a bit of pepper and malt vinegar mixed in, on the sandwich or on the side. ÊTasty. The pork ribs are also very good. ÊLike others have said, the meat does fall off the bone...a little too well. ÊYou can (and I have) literally debone a rack of ribs without so much as a morsel left on. ÊThat shouldn't be - gnawing on the bones and making a mess is half the damn fun! ÊI don't know why - maybe they sit hot for too long? ÊMy father (a Texan) says they probably boil them, but I've never heard of such a thing. ÊEither way, this is a minor quibble - the meat is tender, smoky, and delicious. ÊIf you come from a BBQ-rich region these won't blow you away, but anyone else will like them very much. ÊI ordered the beef ribs only once and wasn't thrilled, but lack the memory and experience to judge them properly. ÊThe real problem may be that I enjoy the pulled pork and pork ribs too much to bother changing up. My girl gets the BBQ chicken or the burgers, both of which are tasty. ÊBut not tasty enough to forgo pulled pork or ribs. ÊFYI, the burgers take a good deal longer than the other menu items, so if you're ordering separately be prepared to watch everyone else chow down. ÊNot good times. The sides: fries are great, onion rings are solid, slaw is unusually good. ÊThe potato and macaroni salads are pretty bad actually. ÊVery bland, by-the-book, mayo intensive mushy food-like products. ÊThe beans are tasty, but the portion is kinda small. ÊOf all the things to skimp on Ê- why the beans? ÊI mean, its beans. ÊFood don't get much cheaper than beans. ÊStill, recommended. Three complaints: the sauce, the cornbread, and the line. ÊIn that order. Ê 1. This is a 4-star review just because of the sauce. ÊI know, I'm a freak. ÊI do not understand the love this BBQ sauce gets. ÊGranted, its better than the other places in town I've had, but still...its waaaay too sugary and not nearly tangy/spicy/interesting enough. ÊI order my meals with the sauce on the side and dip my fries in it; that is all its good for. ÊAll that sugar drowns out the quality meat. ÊSad thing is - outside of a few blessed regions - most people expect KC Masterpiece, and it pays to make most people happy. Ê 2. My biggest problem with the cornbread here is that they don't have it on the menu. ÊI just...I mean...BBQ with no cornbread? ÊFor the love of god WHY? 3. The line is always long. ÊThe staff does a terrific job keeping everything moving and getting everyone seated, but there has to be a better way. ÊDO NOT skip this place just because of the line though. ÊThe wait will be trivial once you get your food. Ê All in all, minor quibbles. ***If you like their sauce try this - throw a bunch of ketchup in a pot. ÊAdd enough molasses to induce diabetes - approx. 1 metric assload. ÊFinish with a tablespoon or two of malt vinegar. ÊBring to a boil, then simmer for 30 minutes, stirring often. ÊViola.

This is the place to be if you're craving some BBQ. The portions here are huge! I usually order the baby back ribs or beefy ribs if i'm craving a lot of meat. The meat is tender and falls right off the bone. The sauce is tangy and had the perfect amount of sweetness to it. Theres always a line here, but it usually moves quickly.

The food is always consistent and very tasty. The customer service is very good and always accommodating. We don't mind the price cause you get a lot for the money.

Never really understood the concept of "the meat just falls off the bones" until I went to Phil's BBQ and tried their baby back ribs. THANKS GUYS! THAT KIND OF CHANGED MY WORLD. But in all honesty, Phil's has the BEST baby back rib's I've ever had. The line can get long at times, but once you get a whiff of that smoky bbq aroma you are trapped. TRAPPED I TELL YOU. Like a moth to a flame. Except instead of burning up, the moth is treated to a really nice meal. The service is ALWAYS great. Everyone that works there is SO NICE. Prices are just right. GAH!

Yummy in my tummy! Got here a little before noon and the line was out the door as usual. ÊBut it was flowing nicely so that was good, I really liked how they put up all the menu's so you can figure out what to order while you're waiting.... instead of having to squint at the board when you get close to the front of the line. Ê for 3 people, we ordered: -Full rib dinner w/ side of Macaroni salad (the meat was very tender and falls off the bones) -Broham Sandwich (this is my favorite-toasted bread covered with a HUGE serving of cole slaw and pulled pork shoulder drenched with sauce) -side of sweet baked beans (this is probably one of my favorite sides here, even though the full portion doesn't seem like a "full size" because they didn't fill it up this time ... that was kinda shady. Ê I think this is the best bbq join in SD so far... I would have -1 star because they forgot our order this time... and we had to wait for over 25 minutes but when I went to check on the order, the manager gave it to me immediately. ÊSo this was the first time something went screwy. Ê I think it was because they were overwhelmed with the celebration of their 10 years anniversary, Ê because the food is so consistently delicious, Phil's bqq deserves 5 stars... my mouth is watering just thinking about it... YUMS! I still "heart" you Phil's bbq

Portions were smaller than i had thought it would be. ÊThe Baby back ribs did not taste like baby back ribs. ÊIn fact, it tasted like ordinary ribs. Ê Note, This place may be haunted. ÊStanding in line while ordering, the server had placed a cup directly in front of my girlfriend and I. ÊSuddenly, without any warning or provocation, the cup went flying at the sever and bounced off the cabinet behind her. ÊSurprised (both the server and I) we looked at each other and confirmed with each other what we just saw. ÊWow is all i got to say. ÊPretty freaky....... In all, i give it a 3 star. ÊSome wait time and small portion just did not cut it for me. ÊBe scared by angry ghosts did not do well either.

Do not go here if you have plans in the next couple hours. You will be bombed out after eating Phil's! We always comment that we need to go lie on a hot rock, like lizards, after filling our bellies with ribs, chicken, more ribs, beer, and ribs! Long lines, but they do move quickly. Although it's not a full sit-down full service restaurant, servers do come around to see if you need anything. They are always so kind. The ribs here are ridiculously good; I love the baked potato side, as well as the fries. I only made the mistake of getting the chicken one time. Not that it's not good, but why waste time with chicken when you can have more ribs? mmm...ribs...

The BBQ Broham pulled pork sandwich is unlike any other I have ever had. The coleslaw at Phil's is perfectly sweet and crunchy. I can't help but devour every morsel of food on my plate, and that is a LOT of food. The fries aren't my favorite, but the beans, corn, veggies, etc etc are WONDERFUL. And the pulled pork... mmmhmmmm. Get a side of sauce. Maybe two.

ÊSure, the line is always too long, but it's a part of the experience of eating at Phil's! ÊI should actually thank Phil's for forcing my friends and I to play ridiculous games like "Never Have I Ever" where we've learn way too much about each other. Ê The food never disappoints. ÊI usually get the beefy ribs tickler which is a steal for how much food you get! ÊI've also tried the chicken and the pork ribs but I love cow. ÊThe meat is always tender and moist and is slathered in their bbq sauce. ÊEven their sides are good! ÊThe potato salad is my favorite. ÊYesterday when I went, we even got Cesear salad. ÊIt was actually refreshing to see some green on my plate! ÊI also can't get enough of their onion rings!!! ÊThe food at Phil's is so awesome, they give you bibs and wet wipes.

I'm not a big meat eater.. so it took me a few years after living in San Diego to try Phil's BBQ. Stood in line for over an hour and ran around the restaurant for a place to sit for another 15 min. Yes the ribs are really good. The bbq sauce is delicious and thier onion rings are extra crunchy. this restaurant is obviously popular for a reason and definately one of the must go places in san diego.. but for the 1.5 hour wait and price? minus 1 star for me!

This place is amazing! The BBQ is one of the best I've ever had and the sides (coleslaw, potato salad) are the perfect compliments; light, crispy, and super, super yummy. The onion rings are amazing! They are so sweet and come in huge portions. My only regret was that I was not hungry enough to finish it all, and so I bought it home only to find it devoured before I could get my leftovers. Doesn't matter; I will be back next time I'm in San Diego! Yes, the line can look long, but it flows by relatively fast. They are extremely efficient as it is. Service is outstanding too!

Phil's BBQ = awesome. As most in San Diego know, Phil's is pretty much the standard for top notch BBQ, and when I went yesterday, I was not disappointed. I got a rack of baby back ribs, and two sides. The ribs were fantastic, fall off the bone, slathered in sauce. Mmm.... Their BBQ baked beans are a little different tasting than normal baked beans.. maybe some sort of BBQ secret? good stuff. Cole slaw was pretty standard. I had a bite of a beef rib as well, and it was tasty... but i'll stick to the baby back ribs. Their awesome sauce will have you licking your fingers. Glad to have them in the Sports Arena location as the Goldfinch spot was too small, and the wait for food seemed too long.

Sure, you can be a dainty little lady and pick at the meat with your fork. Or you can be a PHIL and eat with your hands, ultimately getting a drop or nine of the delicious sauce on your clothes. Me? I'm a Phil kinda girl. I'm also the smarty that accidently wipes her hands on her pants. Hate waiting in lines? INSIDER TIP: If the line is too long for you to stand and you'd rather go home, go grab a menu and phone in your order. You can then skip the line that goes around the building, walk in to the left of it, and pick up your order. The food is the same caliber by the time you get home anyways - just be sure to vent the fries during the ride! Baby back or beef - it doesn't matter. They're both fall-off-the-bone bits of heaven. Grab a side of potato salad to alleviate the flavor in your mouth. I wont go on about the food - it's clearly evidenced in the surrounding Phil's BBQ reviews. Dig in and eat!

I can't believe yesterday was my first tie trying out Phil's BBQ. ÊNo wonder this place is raving and "omgosh!" You can get a decently priced meal with an unexpected amount of food. ÊI got a 1/2 baby back ribs that includes either 2 small sides or 1 large side. ÊBeing a food fanatic I am, I couldn't decide between getting fries and cole slaw OR corn on the cob.

Long ass line around the building but smells really good! Long wait for some meaty food. I have to say this was a meat overload dinner. I'm not sure if I quite liked all the food that i had but it was good overall. The beef ribs were huge and tasty. They were filled with fatty, juicy meat that I could eat right now! I don't think the pork ribs were worth it at all. They were too small and too dry for my taste. The onion rings were yummy. The people were nice and attentive. If you don't mind waiting a long time for dinner, then by all means, come here.

There are 3 things in the world that I have been known to drop anything for: 1) A friend in need. 2) A last minute trip to Vegas. 3) Phil's mother effin' BBQ. I remember walking by this place when it was a small 1 door place in hillcrest. I smelled something good and wasn't terribly hungry... but I decided to grab some food anyways. As they say, "The rest is history." To me, Phils BBQ can't even be compared to other rib or bbq places because it's not even fair. Tony Roma's is good, Outback is nice, Brett's BBQ is decent... but Phil's? It is in it's own category. My usual is a full rack of ribs (pork of course) with coleslaw and fries or a corn on the cob. Their potato salad is also amazing... Actually, you know what, I've never had anything bad here, ever. I am not going to attempt to describe what it tastes like. Nothing I can type, nothing you can read, will do justice to how this food tastes. There is almost always a deceptively huge line out front, but it moves fast. The wait staff keeps busy so everyone gets a seat in a short amount of time, and they have buzzers if you are dining in. Writing this review makes me want to go back and take every other 5 star review I've ever written and make it a 4 star review because Phil deserves 6 stars... Added bonus: He actively endorses local non-profits. I am a Big Brother with the Big Brothers Big Sisters of San Diego County and Phil Pace (owner of Phil's BBQ) put on a huge BBQ/Padres game event for all the Bigs and their Little's!

Being from Texas, I was skeptical about finding good BBQ out in California, seeing as I've had many amazing experiences with BBQ down here. However, due to raving reviews from both friends and Yelpers, we decided to make it a point to try this place out... and it was worth it. The line was wrapped around out the door, and being impatient and hungry as we were, we decided to call in and to-go instead seeing as we were staying at the hotel across the street. Thank goodness! The to-go line was much much shorter and we got our food within 10-15 min. Both the beef and pork ribs were delicious, and I highly recommend their beans and coleslaw. The El Toro sandwich was really good even though I was stuffed by the time I got to taste it. They initially forgot some of our sides, but that wasn't a problem since we just had to run across the street to get it, and they even threw in some extra onion rings for the trouble. Good service and great food!

Best barbeque I've eaten so far. Okay, my cousin and i were on this we-dont-care-if-we-get-fat day so we stopped by phil's. We knew we were there when we smelled the aroma of the bbq. We were sure we were at the right place when we saw a long line along the lot. Too think that it was 4 in the afternoon and a line that long is like..what? So we waited until...bad news for me. Wrong choice of companion, our teacup maltese. It hurt to be deprived of going in. My cousin just took an order to go and we enjoyed the baby back ribs at home. Although i had a heartbreak over there, my heart was easily mended once my teeth sank into those juicy savory ribs. I cant wait to go back. And ps, do not even think of bringing a pet if you want to miss the food to die for.

I've been a fan for years, but hadn't been to the Sports Arena location since they opened (though I've been the beneficiary of several take out orders). Picking up some paint across the street at Home Depot tonight, I realized that it was my big chance to visit the new establishment. Phoned in an order while my paint was mixing, and proceeded to cruise by about 100 (no exaggerating) people that were waiting in line to dine in. Straight to the counter and picked up dinner for the family, and right back past the saps waiting in line. I don't know why it tickles me so, but I love to do this at Fillipi's in Little Italy as well. Long story short (if that's still a possibility), this place is the best San Diego's got, and they've certainly built this iteration to scale. It's huge, and from what I witnessed tonight, amazingly well thought out. There must have been 12 expediters working the counter, and the food was flying out. Quality operation through and through (as evidenced by the fact that they didn't include my onion ring order in the hot window, but rather fired them up when I arrived... nice touch!) Long live Phil's!

I'm feeling a little guilty about some of the negativity in my recent reviews, so I thought I'd re-visit Phil's BBQ for an easy five stars. I have lots of memories of Phil's BBQ, good memories that have been replaced with even better ones. I used to have a regular BBQ partner, and then I didn't, and now I do again! Sweet! Somebody who can put away a massive rack of delicious ribs, somebody to share my love for a side of bomb baked beans and fries slathered in magical BBQ sauce, somebody to entertain me while waiting in the line that sometimes not only stretches out the door, but down the street. I don't know how they do it, but the line really does move quickly, I assure you. There are some places filled with memories that you just can't go anymore, but Phil's is not one of them, for my love for Phil's Ribs and Chickless still burns strong.

It has all been said, but I will just add one more compliment from a true southern girl: the barbecue at Phil's is second best only to Bodacious Barbecue in east Texas. If you are in California, Phil's is the best damn barbecue you can find. And the friendly, professional, efficient service just makes it even better. If I could give 10 stars, I would. God bless you, Phil's. I'll be back again and again.

How good is Phil's? I drive all the way down from Laguna Beach to indulge myself in this best execution of Bar-B-Q in Southern California. Having spent considerable time in the South (particularly in Tennessee and the Carolinas) I can quote you BBQ chapter and verse about "red" vs. "yellow" and the histories thereto. I can also wax poetic about the legendary Rogers BBQ in Florence, SC, Calhoun's in Knoxville, TN, and Jerry Poindexter's monumental BBQ of July, 2001 in Franklin, TN--point being, this particular rave review of Phil's comes from authentic BBQ experiences and references. There's few choices for good BBQ in SoCal, so be thankful that there's Phil's, and quit complaining about the line and wait. ÊYour alternative for BBQ this good is a long plane flight (or an even longer drive) eastward to destinations where you see American cars, sans futile "Kerry/Edwards" bumper stickers still on 'em.

Finger-linkin-GREAT!!! I swear, when we got our food I never looked up. I think maybe to get a sip of my iced tea, While enjoying the savor of the BBQ sauce on my Baby back ribs and chicken..... I was in the zone... Self-serve, cheaper than Chilli's and great atomoshpere to just grub either with your family or friends.

This is an incredibly popular (lines of people consistently standing outside) barbecue restaurant that is just west of the Sports Arena on Sports Arena Blvd. They have indoor and outdoor seating but instead of waiter service, you stand in line and place your order then find a place to sit. As is the case for several barbecue restaurants, they have a variety of sides available. For about $2, you can get an ear of fresh roasted corn on the cob that is still in it's husk. While not seasoned, the corn was very good. They offered a couple of salads, a Ceasar and a mixed greens salad. Both were unimaginative and disappointing but reasonably generously portioned. The dressing for the Ceasar was strongly fishy, ruining an already mushy, not particularly appetizing salad. They offered fresh cut french fries that were available in very generous portions. The fries had skin on them but no salt or seasoning and were undercooked and stuck together (incompletely cut). While the fries could have easily been improved just by cooking them longer or using a little bit of seasoning, they were still very good and vastly better than the frozen fries used at most restaurants.

So here is the thing on their famous "el Toro" trip tip sandwich...there is WAY too much BBQ sauce. ÊIt is too bad, because the meat is so tender and full of flavor, but it is literally swimming in bbq sauce. ÊBy the end it was a chore to eat it, as I was sick of the sauce. The lines were long and the onion rings were great. Ê A small order of rings at Phil's is the equivalent of a XXL order anywhere else.

I've reviewed this place already but had to do an update. ÊI tried the EL TORO sandwich consisting of deli sliced tri-tip drenched in Phil's signature BBQ sauce. ÊWOW. ÊSO AMAZING. ÊThe bread had a nice chew to it and complimented the piles and piles of tri-tip. ÊThe tanginess of the BBQ sauce complimented the mild saltiness of the meat. ÊVery tasty. Ê I've been going to Phil's for years now and this was the first time that I had the El Toro. ÊIf you're not in the mood for a sandwich go for the beef rib tickler. ÊMy girlfriend absolutely LOVES it. ÊIt comes with one generously portioned beef rib with a side of coleslaw and french fries. ÊThe plate is HUGE and is VERY well reasonably priced. I can't wait for Phil's San Marcos to open. ÊIt's a lot closer to my location and I'll be down all the time!

Tough place to review as it is one of the only BBQ places in San Diego, so not much to compare to (at least from what I know - if you know opther good BBQ places, please le tme know!). There is ALWAYS a long line to get in here. ÊThe new location is much better than the old - more seating and easier to move around in. ÊThe Beef Ribs are delish, but a little fatty. ÊI think they should order better raw meat. ÊThe pulled pork is fabulous and Iwould go back for that alone. ÊAll of the sides are great, albeit a bit limited. ÊI guess I hoped for more southern style sides to go along with BBQ - Cornbread, greens, hushpuppies maybe? Ê Good for San Diego but I have definitely had 9and can make ) better.

I've been waiting for a long time to finally try this place out. The first time I went Phil's was closed, but I was able to try out Chickfil'a for the first time, so still a pretty awesome experience. As for Phil's it's a very cozy place. My friend ordered for the 3 of us. Two full orders of ribs with fries, coleslaw, baked beans, and macaroni salad. The ribs were pretty good, the only thing that I kinda didn't like was the excessive amount of sauce on my ribs. So much of the taste was from the sauce which is kinda difficult. Other than that they were pretty good. The ribs fell off the bone easily and were tasty. As for the sides... Fries were fried a little bit more crunchier than expected. Cole slaw was pretty good, very standard nothing special. Baked beans we ok, but i wouldn't recommend getting them again. The Macaroni salad was exceptional. We should have ordered more cause it was the best one out of all the sides we ordered. Overall it was a good first time experience. I love bbq and so if i'm ever down in SD again, I'm gonna give Phil's another visit

AND the baked beans--O M G (we had spoon wars over those too) Only 2 things are missing -cornbread and mac & cheese, you'll notice this while waiting in that long ass line deciding on your order but as soon as you gnaw into a rib ....

Wow, seems like everyone knows about Phil's, especially if you live in San Diego. ÊTook some family members to eat here and they raved about Phil's. ÊThe line was short on a Friday evening at 7:30PM it was only 20 minutes. ÊThere was live music to keep you company while you wait in line. ÊWhile we were in line the Phil's staff came up to us giving us fries to sample...and boy were they tasty. ÊNice way to lure people in :) So you wait in line to order, then you get your own seat and then you go pick up your food...kind of like a cafeteria style. ÊThey had plenty of t.v's around with games on, we were watching the Lakers in teh playoffs :). Ê Anyhow we all ordered the pork baby back ribs, having fries, corn and coleslaw. ÊTheir ribs were juicy, tender and tasty, the fries are amazing and the prices were so great for what you get. Getting the bang for your buck! ÊIf you like bbq you would love Phil's.

The best BBQ joint I have ever had,.. besides my lil broski home bbq grilling haha I came here on a Saturday night after Sea World for dinner around 8pm. This joint had a line wrapped around the whole building. FAIL,. we ended up at sushi restaurant next door ( WHICH WAS GROSS, if you follow me,. you can read the sushi review next ) Phils BBQ didn't take reservations, so we left and decided to come back the following day for lunch. ÊMy friends and I came back the next day when it opened and there was already a mini line x__X ! oh nooooO! Turns out the line outside is the line to order food. ÊYou can have someone walk in and save a table while another waits to order the food. ÊQuick and efficient. ÊThe line moves fast and when you finally reach the front, it's like an ordering service you would do at the mall, order food, give you a buzzard, buzz you when the food is ready, go back to the seat and GRUB! ÊThe staff there is 100% friendly and very helpful. I ended up ordering the full rack of ribs, side of macaroni salad, french fries and onion rings. Also, the trip tip sandwich the El toro that was recommended by the workers. ÊOf course I shared this with another :) The ribs were so good, comes right off the bone, moist and saucy! LOVE IT! The fries were huge, note: it was a side order,. and it can feed up to 3-4 people! My other friend who ordered the rack of ribs to the face, did not even touch the fries at all. The tri tip sandwich tasted good to me,. but I was to full from the ribs to even enjoy the sandwich,.. one of my friends tried it and said its like eating a cigarette, cause it was so smoked?! I am indifferent about the trip tip sandwich. Onion rings were huge, as huge as my face,. although a lot of people recommended the onion rings,. i just thought it was BLEH,. just regular onion rings to me,. WILL NOT ORDER THIS next time,. it was straight fat filler. Next time I come to San Deigo,. I will be back =)

I have been here twice and both times left disappointed. Mabie I was expecting too much but ether way this is definitely not my top place for BBQ. They got there first strike against them when I noticed they did not have Mac and Cheese which in my book is the best side dish with anything with BBQ sauce. It is something about the sauce and the cheese that just tastes right together. Ê So I ordered my fav Beef ribs and when I got then they were over cooked by my standards. I like my ribs to be tender and to be just hanging on the bone where I have to pull it off myself. ÊThese ribs I got the meat was already off the bone lying flat on the plate. ÊThe sauce was ok but my wife couldn't stand it. The best part was the red velvet whoopee pie now that was good. ÊCheck my other review's if you want to see my favorite pick for BBQ.

1. Get there early for dinner. We arrived at 5PM on Friday night and were in a short line, but 15 minutes later the line to get in was Looong. I mean like the Space Mtn. line on a Labor Day weekend, Long. 2. If you have young kids, you won't find much on the menu specifically for them. 3. The best BBQ I've had this side of Mississippi. The Beef ribs were Huge. Lots of meat. Sauce is dark red and has a great kick to it without burning your lips off. And I loves me some well made coleslaw with my ribs. Phil's coleslaw is the best I've eaten. 4. The place is noisy, crowded and it's order-and pick-up-at-the-counter style. So, if you are looking for a lightly populated, sit down place where it's calm and quiet, may I suggest your nearest Denny's at about 7PM on a Tuesday night. I would have rated a 5 Star except for the fact that there is nothing close to a kids menu. Come on Phil, you know we all live for our kids. Show some love to the munchkins.

This place will a ruin a healthy diet but it's sooo worth every bite! The Broham and Onion Rings are the way to go for sure. The ribs are great and all, but the Broham has all that BBQ goodness and no bones. I'll admit it, I didnt even LIKE coleslaw before I ate at Phils- but I am humbled by the wonderous sandwich they call The Broham. BBQ shredded beef, peppery colesalw and lotso' sauce on a kaiser roll. Perfection!

The first time I went was when the only location was on Goldfinch. It took about 1 hour to get our order, but since then, I've been craving it at least once a month. Unfortunately, I moved to San Francisco and I really miss San Diego food (phils bbq, hodads, carne asada fries, salt and pepper chicken wings) which San Francisco doesn't really have. Back to Phil's BBQ: The new location at Sports Arena, is BIG and there's still a good line (which moves fairly fast) at the door, but to me it's well worth the wait. If you really don't like waiting in the lines, you can call in your order before you get there. The meat just falls off the bone and goes straight into my mouth, those ribs are cooked to perfection. haha. The 1/2 rib dinner with sweet baked beans and fries hits the spot. The chicken they have is okay, I havent ordered the chicken since my first visit, because all I want are the ribs. hahaha. I can't wait to visit San Diego just to eat. I would also recommend the BBQ Broham sandwich.

ÊThis is the 406th review for Phil's BBQ so I know this won't make a difference but just so I don't forget to make a stop here next time I'm in town, I'm reviewing it for my own records. The BBQ baby back ribs are HELLA good. Meat, tender. BBQ sauce, tasty. -1 star for the chicken that was a bit dry and needed more flavor, but at least next time, I know to skip out on the bird and go with the pig, fries, and cole slaw.

Writing a review while hungry at work is a terrible idea...I'll have to keep it short so I don't start digesting my own stomach. After hearing all the hype for years, I finally went to Phil's BBQ (Point Loma location) last week. The line seemed long, but it moved pretty quickly. ÊI didn't realize it was an order-at-the-counter and seat-yourself kind of place, but now that I know, I'll probably order take-out to bypass the line. ÊTake-out is so versatile: pair delicious BBQ with your favorite beer in front of your favorite TV show, or surprise your sweetie with a BBQ picnic and lots-o-wetnaps. I ordered the Broham (pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw inside) and snagged some fries from my friend. Delicious. Great BBQ sauce. Great meat. Great bun. That's what she said. The only thing lacking was the coleslaw. The Broham is brilliant in design, but they need to flava up the coleslaw a bit. All in all, I'd definitely eat there again. Like maybe tonight.

I can not put into words how good the food at Phil's BBQ is. ÊI've had my fair share of BBQ and consider myself a huge fan of food but I have never had a bbq meal of such epic greatness! ÊAs we pulled into the parking lot, I could smell the amazing aroma that flowed from the restaurant. ÊI was initially thrown off by the ordering system but after a moment it seemed pretty self explanatory. ÊThere was a line that extended past the door but it went fairly quickly. ÊI ordered the baby back rib and chickless combo while the GF ordered a turkey burger. ÊWe were both starving so the wait for the food seemed never ending but alas our beeper finally started ringing! Ê Simply put, the food was amazing. ÊHands down it was the best order of bbq ribs I've ever had. ÊThe meat was tender, smokey and the sauce had a little zing to it.

Okay, look. Ê I don't even *like* ribs, they don't sit well with me. ÊI don't enjoy coleslaw either, and generally when people get all excited about "OMGWTFBBQ", well, I just sort of sit there. This was before today. Whatever these people do, they're doing it RIGHT. ÊThey don't win those awards for nothin'! Ê Had a piece of chicken (!!!!!!!!!), a rack of ribs (!!!!!!!) , the slaw (!!!!!!!!!!!!) and the onion rings. ÊWhatever they batter the onion rings with is tasty also, a bit greasy but tasty, but it's the sauce that really tops it all off. ÊIt's got this honey-tangy-molasses-y goodness that you just want to pretty much rub your face in. ÊThere's a nice kick that starts up around your last couple bites, and lasts until you wash it down with soda or beer or something that's not water. The meat was done pretty well, it had a nice burnt crispiness to the edges that is just what you'd want when Êyou think about that particular kind of food. ÊIt wasn't heavy. ÊIt was all very filling, of course, but it wasn't that cloying sticky 'ugh' that makes you sort of over BBQ for awhile. ÊQuite the contrary, my friends. ÊI'd eat somebody's arm if it was covered in that sauce. It made me wonder what bacon would be like if they BBQ'd it. *nom nom nom nom nom* All said, definite kudos to the Phil's crew!

I moved here from Tennessee and few years ago, where in any direction I drove, I could find good Bbq. Here, however, people mix ketchup and vinegar, then call it barbeque sauce. I've actually gotten violently sick from eating at some of these places... like the cow was trying to punch it's way back out of my stomach! :( I'd given up my search until my husband dragged me to Phil's!

When it said that it came with 3 ribs, cole slaw, fries and onion rings, I thought there would be a little side of fries. To my surprise, half of the plate was filled with fries. My friend ordered the full slab of baby back ribs. He was pretty full at the end of the meal and for the rest of the day. Both of us didn't finish eating the fries.

Ê Normally when you order a half order of baby back ribs you get maybe 5 ribs and are usually still hungry. ÊWell not at Phils! ÊWhen I picked up my order I was like...Holy Shinigans!!! This is huge. ÊIt comes with two sides. I usually choose. ÊCorn on the cob...yum and the BBQ baked beans. ÊThe fries are good too. ÊYou get a whole bunch of them. ÊThey don't mess around here. I also tried the regular ribs and they were ok. ÊI like the baby back ribs better. Anyway, if you want to eat here come early like at 5...because the line to eat here gets LONG.

Wow.. this place is good! Ê We went on a Friday night, driving from Carlsbad, and the line was wrapped around the building with a wait of 1 hr. Ê(what can I say.. we're newbies!) Since we were starving and the kids were with us, we decided to leave and come back another time. ÊThe smell of the BBQ sauce was so yummy my 5 year old had a fit, and I promised her we would return tomorrow.... making the 25 mile journey once again. ÊI was pretty upset too that was had to leave and was fixated on the smell all night, into the morning. So we came back the next day and were NOT disappointed. ÊIT WAS SOOO GOOD! ÊThe sauce was too spicy for my 3 yr old boy, but he did well with the chicken after the skin was peeled off. ÊMy daughter ate about 7 baby-back ribs, and had sauce all over her face. ÊIt was sort of cute actually. ÊShe was really into them. My husband is normally afraid of beef ribs as they just suck at other places. ÊNot so here. ÊYum yum yum!!! The only downside is that seating is a fiasco. Ê(Hence 4 stars instead of the deserved 5, for the food) ÊWe ended up sitting in the bar. As it was our 1st time, we weren't sure if you had to get back in line to order more food, so we decided to place a phone order, which worked well. ÊHowever, when we got our phone order in the to-go boxes, we were told that if you get takeout you can't sit at a table. ÊWe told the guy that this was seconds, and he said no need to wait in line again if you have already done your time. In short.. I'd go back in a heartbeat and will be asking my husband to "swing by" on the way home so we can reheat and enjoy.

I got the beef ribs. ÊI'm sure someone already mentioned this before, but these bones are HUGE. ÊI was thinking of pork ribs or baby back ribs I guess, so I wasn't sure they'd be big enough. ÊBut I could only finish one! (I also had the chicken). The onion rings are THE best onions rings I've ever had. ÊDon't forget the sauce. Though the beef ribs were good, surprisingly I enjoyed the chicken better. ÊSuper tender. ÊMade me repeatedly crave chicken for the next week or two.

Went to Phil's last night and took my wife and friend Daniel. ÊThey were very intimidated by the line that wrapped around the building. ÊI told them it was worth it. Ê20 mins later we were eating. Ê The pork broham is great, the bread was soft and the contrast of the bbq sauce, cole slaw and pork excited my taste buds into a party! ÊThe onion rings were ok, but once dipped in the buttermilk ranch turned them into rings from heaven. I suggest to avoid the line sit at the bar, next time this will be my move.

There are just not enough words to describe Phil's. ÊA few of the words that come to mind are: mmmm meaty, messy, delicious and amazing. ÊThe food is really great, and everyone that works there is obviously taking happy pills. ÊI don't remember the last place I went to where everyone is so helpful and friendly! ÊIf you haven't been here yet, you are soo missing out! Side note: We just went for the bf's birthday with a group of 16. ÊWe thought there was no way that we could all sit together, at least in the next hour or so. ÊThe restaurant was per usual - packed, but after we waited in the standard line, we waited in the bar for five or so minutes, and they had cleared us a table. ÊAmazing.

Hello July 4th and bbq mm mm, finally I got to try out this place!! The wait was not that bad and the food came out pretty fast, the service was great. Me and my best friends ordered up some baby back ribs and the beefy ribs as well as a large side of fries and baked beans, FREAKING BOMB!! You know when it's good when no ones talking! Savory delicious slap of ribs, satisfaction at its best! Anyways the fries, beans and everything was all up to par. I like them fries with the bbq sauce on the ribssss, ayyii ! plus I only had to pay $10 by spliting the check in three so its always good to share and save!

Phil's is my favorite BBQ place on the west coast. ÊIt's a must have if you've never had decent BBQ. ÊJust be warned though, ÊI don't think they smoke the ribs, so they come off the bones really easily. ÊOne of my friends said that good ribs shouldn't do this. ÊBut who cares, it tastes amazing. ÊAMAZING. Also, i'm not really a fan of beef ribs, but I don't mind eating them here. Ê If you're not interested in waiting in line for an hour, call ahead and order pickup. ÊDrive to your nearest friends house and enjoy ASAP!

I worked in the sports arena area for a long time. Being that we worked long nights and had little time to eat, we usually ate in our offices. Once in a while we'd do a Phil's run. This place has great food. By SD standards, Phil's has pretty good BBQ. I've had North Carolina BBQ so I don't think anything out here in San Diego will ever get more than a 4 star rating from me. I'm a sauce addict and their sauce is great. Only down side is that extra sauce will cost you extra money and it isn't cheap. We'd call in our orders and they'd have it hot and waiting when we came in to pick it up. You saved a lot of hungry IT agents from late night famine. ÊI served our military men and women all over the world and your food helped fuel me. I tip my hat to you Phil :) ... if I were wearing one :D

My first time at Phil's was at their old location and my friend's and I waited 2 hours for carry out! I was so hungry and mad at the wait that I just inhaled my food. I didn't really savored it and thought it was okay BBQ. But there are moments when I just crave BBQ. Whenever I'm in Texas, all I ask for is to eat BBQ. And I get my yummy BBQ. But I'm in San Diego, not Texas, so I decided to try Phil's again. This time I was smart and called in my order at their new location. It was crazy when I arrived! The line just to sit down on a Sunday 2pm was already at a 45 minutes wait but I was able to bypass it since I called in. I waited until I was allowed to pay and watched as they packed my food on the spot. Great and friendly service. It took at most 10 minutes. I ordered the ribs and chicken. The ribs were slow cooked, tender, falling off the bone delicious. The chicken was good but I loved the ribs more. The BBQ sauce is on the sweet side but it was tangy and finger licking delicious. The beans were good too - it was a little sweet but peppery. This is solid BBQ.

The BBQ is some of the best I have eaten on the West Coast, still doesn't stack up to the places I have gone to in Kansas City, KS and Charleston, SC though but it is good.

BEEF RIBS..... If you have a cravin' for beef ribs, this is the joint you need to check out. Im impartial to labeling places as the "best of the best", but i do have to say that Phil's BBQ has some of the best beef ribs that i have ever grubbed on. Ive tried Beef Ribs in Texas, St. Louis, Kansas City, and Georgia, and out of all those places Phil's takes the rib filled cake. A description of their beef ribs is needed. The beef ribs are huge in size and meaty. The meat is tender not rough and falls off the bone with ease. The sauce that is evenly placed on the ribs is just the right amount and is not too spicy or sweet, just right. The beef ribs plates are plenty enough. Rule when eating ribs: Wait until your done to wipe your hands and mouth, go for broke... The 4 stars im giving is a result of their BEEF RIBS. Ive tried other things there which were also grub, however, their BEEF RIBS is what this place is all about for me. Get ready to eat GOD's beef ribs. Its prime..

Overrated. When I say this place is overrated, I mean way too many people rated this place already. So why should I even bother? Even my mom likes it there. No really. The night we ate there it was my brother's b-day so we had a big group. The line was pretty efficient and since we had a big group we already had a table waiting for us. There are menus posted everywhere so it's easy to make a decision by the time you get to the cashier. Customer service was pretty decent considering the cashier seemed hopped up on Starbucks or on crack. Our waitress was fast and very helpful, but it's not like we needed one since we had to get our own damn food and our own drinks. They pretty much clear the tables and get people their doggy bags. The food is nothing amazing but it didn't suck. The sauce is good, but I feel like I could have concocted the same stuff at home. The food came out in like 5 minutes. If you're an average person ordering ribs, I've been told the 3-piece beef rib dinner is sufficient enough to satisfy the average person. But since I'm a beast and I was hungry, I ordered the 5-piece. Good stuff. The atmosphere had that sleazy biker bar feel without the stripper poles and that feeling that I was going to get my @ss kicked.There were numerous flat-screen TV's showing whatever game was on for all you sports fans and a bar to solve life's problems...The prices were fair enough. It's a great place to have a bromantic evening or time with family.

#1580, right here! Phil's is the best place to get your barbeque fixin'. ÊThe ribs are tender and fall right off the bone. ÊI always get the baby back rib tickler which comes a HUGE side of fries, coleslaw, and 3 baby back ribs - all for $6.45!

My go to BBQ spot in San Diego, gotta love this hometown place! Favorites are the beef and pork ribs, but i love to order the tickler, which gives a little meat but a lot for your money with the fries, coleslaw, and two onion rings. Great for people like me who have trouble choosing the side orders sometimes, since this way you get a little of everything. Regardless, the barbeque no matter what option you get, is always tender, flavorful, and nom-nom-nom all the way. Also, best time to go is outside of the normal lunch/dinner hours on the weekend... my favorite time is an early lunch or early dinner on the week days. Everyone there is always happy, so you get great service each time. Probably one of the best spots for customer service even if you're not a big fan of the food!

Now it may seem like rocket science to find an amazing bbq joint, which is reasonably price, and screams deliciousness in more ways than one...but then you just get in line at phil's and its like einstein solved all of your problems. Phil's BBQ is incredible. I went to school in san diego and we would risk a loss of hours studying and potential food coma, to stand in line and enjoy one of the best bbq joints in town. Their ribs are NOT fatty - I doubt there is even a gram of fat on them. They are so tender and delicious, they melt right in your mouth, giving a symphony of flavor on your tongue. It truly is a magical experience. The fries and coleslaw are delicious and if you ask for extra bbq sauce and ranch, and dip the fries in a mixture of both...OH MY LORD! I assure you, you will be blown away. I have introduced many to this place. They see the line and want to turn around, but their curiosity is triggered as their tummy grumbles when they smell the strong bbq scents coming from the building. It is well worth the wait! I mean, there is a reason why there are hundreds of crazy people, salivating, standing in line. I mean I do it all the time, and I'm assuming I'm not TOO crazy! The service is great. Everyone is incredibly friendly and make you feel right at home. It really is a special place, full of laughs and immense enjoyment. I currently live in LA and have no problem making the trip to San Diego just for these bad boys. Phil's definitely a guy I'd love to date! ;] Personal Recommendation = 1/2 Rib Dinner, with Cole Slaw and Fries. And a drink...and the best part? This totals about $17 with tax, and keeps me full for the whole day! Bon Apetit!

the big sis brought back one of the pulled pork sandwiches from Phil's after visiting the lil sis in SD. after a couple of hours in a car ride, one would think it would not, could not, tastes as good as if it was served fresh. to hub's delight, this was not the case -- it still tastes so darned good!

The food at Phil's is actually delicious stick to your ribs comfort food, but getting to the food will be the difficulty. When Phil's moved from their old store in Mission Hills, nearby fans of the place figured that the new bigger Sports Arena location, while not as convenient, would accommodate their crowds better. Nicely, it turns out, that the new place gets WAY too much customers plus the lines are worse. In case you do not like a lengthy wait, you much better not attempt Phils on a Sat or Sun, as there's a line from late morning to late evening. In case you can manage the wait, Phil's comfort food will make you incredibly happy.

5 Stars! ÊCame to Phil's based on the awesome yelp reviews and was glad I did. ÊArrived at 5:30 pm on Wednesday evening, and the line was out the door, wrapped around the building. Ê So...switched to Plan B...take out! ÊFound the take out register (no line) and withint 5 minutes, had my order in hand, ready to walk out. Ê I later learned that long lines are typical and the best time to avoid the line is to arrive between 2pm and 5 pm...a little hint for you folks. Ê Visiting from LA and this being a first time visit, I was amazed at the high energy and the apparently "happy" employees. ÊSo while I was waiting for my order, I chatted with one of the employees. ÊAs a long time employee, she Êspoke highly of the owner, Phil,...it was obvious that he's good to his employees which was such a blessing to know this one successful entrepeneur has chosen to take care of his employees as well as serving great consistent food to his customers. ÊI interacted with three employees and all three were polite and enthusiastic and efficient. Now Êon to the ribs....the meat was fresh, fresh, fresh. Ê So, to sum it up....food was great and better yet, I was happy to patronize an eatery that is successful in taking care of its customers and good to its employees as well.

i'm not sure what the hype is all about. you stand in line, you order at a counter and a few minutes later you pick up your order from the kitchen. the food is average, at best. i came with a large party and we all ordered different things. the consensus was that the portions are generally sized, but in terms of BBQ the food is just OK. definitely not worth the wait, in my opinion -- well over an hour on a wednesday evening.

We live in Tierrasanta and used to drive over to Phil's in ÊMission Hills for take out. And later to his Sports Arena store. ÊThat's about an hour and a half drive time. And well worth the time and gasoline. It was simply the best BBQ I had ever tasted Over time, and after the move to Sports Arena, his food went from fantastic to ordinary then got steadily worse. The chicken developed that warmed over flavor from being refrigerated. ÊThe pork ribs were dry and trasteless. I would think he would notice when the lines grew shorter that something was going wrong.The slaw and fries were still great. Ê The sauce was still excellent. I will try Phil's in a few month's to see if they have improved. PS Stay away from "Joe's" in Santee. Almost $10.00 for a dry, cold , tough and flavorless pulled pork sandwich. ÊNo drink or fries, just a small container of milky coleslaw. ÊWarmed over flavor. I understand that they may be under new ownership. Not going back.

I don't know if Phil Pace reads these reviews or not, but I would like to think that he will see this. I have been a long time customer from since you opened on Goldfinch. I used to come in and everyone knew me and Phil would always come out and say hi. I loved the food and the atmosphere. Since you opened the new Point Loma location your quality has suffered to the point that I am not sure I am going back. The consistency is so hit or miss--some days the food is excellent and some days horrible. I was in on Sunday and my food was mediocre at best, luke warn and thrown together. This is a far cry from what it used to be. I know that you are busy but does that justify lousy food? Phil I look up to you and admire what you have done. You have taken your small restaurant and turned it into an amazing concept; not an easy feat. I have always been excited to hear from you on how things have been and what your future plans are. I wish that your quality control was the same as it used to be. My experiences have turned me into a once a month visitor from a 3 times a week. I know how difficult it is to keep things under control. I have worked in the industry for years, heck I even have a degree in culinary arts. Once things slip they can become the norm and that will make you loose long time customers like myself. I hope that you can find your way back to your roots and put up the same quality from the time you open your doors to when you close. Good luck to you Phil, Concerned Customer

After our food was ready, we ate and realized we wanted more. It was just that good. So we ordered another rack of ribs and a small side of their COLOSSAL onion rings. oh man, THOSE ONION RINGS ARE OH SO GOOD Man, my mom and I loved it; it was really good.

I have been daydreaming about Phil's BBQ sandwich ever since I had one on Saturday. I am from Virginia and I've tried quite a few kinds of barbeque, but this was amazing. The sandwich is HUGE...when you pick it up to eat it an entire 2nd sandwich practically falls out. The sauce is great but even the pieces that weren't covered with it were fantastic, kind of smoky. The baked beans were so-so and the onion rings were pretty much made of a stick of butter each but I am giving this a five because the sandwich far exceeded my expectations. I also want to mention that the staff was super nice and let us go back to the front of the line when we were on our way to wait again after deciding we wanted to add onion rings to our order. I recommend walking inside to the take-out line which is much shorter than the line wrapped around the restaurant waiting for a table.

I'm usually not a fan of anything with BBQ sauce, anything that's overly sweet or tangy just isn't my cup of tea. ÊI've tried baby back ribs at several restaurants and was never impressed...that was until I tried Phil's while I was down in SD this past weekend. ÊTheir baby back ribs are so tender that if you just slighty push the meat it will fall off from the bone.

ÊDefinitely stop by Phil's BBQ if you're ever in San Diego, it's worth the wait.

Pretty damn good BBQ ribs. I have had better (Montgomery Ribs in Ohio!), but these were still pretty close to perfect (the meat was a lil dry). And they're a lot more local than the Midwest. There are all sorts of sides you can order up with them, the corn was yummy! My only real peeve about this place is the wait to get in, I think we stood in line for nearly an hour to try this place. It was worth it to go once, but honestly I'm not sure I'll do it again unless I know there isn't going to be a line for some reason (when are their off-peak days?!). Because of the crowd it can be almost impossible to find somewhere to sit as well (or at least that was an issue the night I was here). Also, is there service beyond the ordering of food? If there is, it sucks. I was confused about that, we ordered and I think other people were getting drinks from a waiter, but no one ever checked on our table. Otherwise, this place is good stuff. Casual atmosphere, almost picnic like. Huge sinks available for hand washing. This weirded me out, it feels odd to wash your hands in a restaurant in front of all the other patrons. Still, definitely a practical idea. Go get you some BBQ!

I went here for the first time a couple of days ago and MAN, was it good! It gets really busy at night, so we decided to go at around 3:00pm on a weekday and it was just perfect... NO LINE! We both ordered the 2 beefy ribs with the bbq chicken. Mmmmm!!! Plus, it came with 2 small sides or 1 large side, so we decided to go with the baked potato (large side)! Just the way I like it! Split down the middle and stuffed with melted cheese! Plus a side of sour cream and butter! I felt my arteries hardening! The meal cost $11.95. Not bad! The service was SUPER fast! We had just sat down, when our food was brought to us! It's a fun place to eat if you don't mind getting your hands dirty. You just can't eat ribs gracefully! Tip: Bring some dental floss. You're going to need it!

Mind blowing. Yes, the ribs, they are that good. Fierce competition to my mom's ribs. I think Phil's will be one of my new regular spots to visit when I'm in San Diego. I rarely give out five stars but I like how this place works, you order your food at the counter and then seat yourself. The place has enough tables and has a good flow of customers going in and out. My boyfriend and I were there on a Saturday night, it was busy but we didn't have to wait very long for a table and food. My favorite part is the separate sink where you can wash up. A star for that! ÊWet naps do nothing for me because I get grimey when I eat ribs. (Cue Dave Attell: Where'd you hide the body?) We ordered a full rack and split that. I could easily dominate a full rack on my own, they're that good. Even the macaroni salad was good! Not too much mayo. I'm sad because I didn't get to try the onion rings. The cutest little girl had a huge plate of them in front of her. I never wanted to steal from a kid so bad in my life. I can't wait to come back!

Best short ribs ever! ÊThe meat is so tender, and it falls right off the bone! ÊThey are not shy with the BBQ sauce, which makes a huge difference. ÊYou'll definitely use a lot of the roll of paper towels they provide for each table as well as the wet-naps. Ê The entrees come with two sides, and I got cole slaw and a baked potato. ÊThe cole slaw was pretty good, and it was a nice contrast to the sauce-drenched meat. ÊMy boyfriend got his ribs served over seasoned fries, which were so good after they soaked up the BBQ sauce. ÊGenius! I love the set-up of the restaurant: you wait in line, order at a counter, and find a seat. ÊThey give you a buzzer, and you pick it up once it buzzes. ÊIt's a fun, rowdy place! ÊThey even have a communal sink in the walkway near the exit. ÊYou'll definitely need to use it!

Wow, This must be the longest line I have ever seem at at BBQ Joint. ÊYou feel like you are camping out for Black Friday Sales. Referred to this place by a friend of mine. ÊThis place is no frills, All-American style BBQ. ÊTheir Baby back rib (Pork) or Beefy Ribs (Beef) and BBQ Chicken are all very hearty in size. ÊTaste is pretty good at a reasonable price. ÊThis place beats Lucilies hands down. I had a full rack of Babyback rib with the corn on the cob! Yum...Very delicious!! People here are all very friendly and eager to help. ÊI agree with others said, order by phone ahead of the time if you can't wait. This place is very close to Seaworld so you can make a trip after a day at the park. Ê Tip:: Find a seat at bar section to skip the line! I skipped my 40+ mins wait :D

We pull up in the parking lot and the first thing I notice is the line. HOLY SH!T. It's literally wrapping around the restaurant on three sides. Wow. I'm like waiting for a new ride at the amusement park especially with all those random signs like "Smile, you're live on the BBQ cam." The wait turned out to be an hour. The second thing you will notice when you enter Phil's parking lot is the smell of bbq in the air. You can't miss it unless you have a cold and your nostrils are filled with boogers. We get up to the counter and order our food. Wait, is this a fast food joint? It sure seems like it. Anyway, they give us a pager and shortly it starts buzzing. The staff was very friendly and always checked up on us. Fountain drinks are awesome. Drink whatever you want, however much as you want. They even had a Crystal Light drink. Too bad they don't have sweet ice tea like they do in the Southern states. The food here was really tasty. I had the ribless plate with the macaroni and beans. The beans were awesome! Definitely a score. The mac was okay. As for the ribs, very juicy and tender. However, I should've just went with the ribs on the bone. I was just lazy at that moment but I think I would have enjoyed it the original way, like an animal picking off the meat and spitting out the bones. We also had the onion rings. These are excellent. Crispy, crunchy batter and soft onions on the inside perfect with the dipping sauce. Few things I noticed they didn't have. Corn bread and/or biscuits! Maybe even mac and cheese but I'm not a big fan of that (I'm sure a lot of people are though). C'mon now! I think my friends and I had a good time here. I'd probably come back when I'm in this area but only if i have the patience to wait for it. Don't be too cool, bust out the bib they give you. Who gives a flying f*ck what other people think. Enjoy it and have a good time.

This is not a waiter service restaurant (you order and pick up at the counter). The portions size here is quite large in which my SO and I each ordered the full size rack of ribs for the pork baby back ribs, and the other 5 beefy ribs. We only able to finish off half of it! The onion rings, even their small size contains 10-12 large onion rings which were quite crispy with a smooth ranch dressing. One small order could be shared a plenty among 4 people, but too much for 2 people. As for the ribs, I noticed that their style of tangy BBQ sauce is vinegar based which I thought complemented the beef ribs, but overpowered the pork ribs. Again this depends on your taste palate, the ribs were tender, but my last memorable experience of great ribs was back in Texas. As for the sides, they were good. Service was friendly, and peppy. For a couple, you can easily just share an order of one full size rib dinner that comes with the 2 small sides, small order of onion rings, 2 soft drinks and be satisfied.

"In search for the perfect ribs" and Phil's BBQ (Phil's) came on top. I love ribs and I love Phil's. I always make it my business to visit Phil's every time I go down to San Diego. It's really hard to find a good bbq place in OC since there are a lot of independent bbq joint and bbq chains (Lucille's, beach pit, etc.). I am still in search for the perfect ribs in OC, but for now, I've found my Phil's ^_^ Anytime I come to Phil's, there's typically a line form outside of the restaurant. I really like the policy of no food no seat. The waiters will direct you to order the food and then you can find your seat. Eventhough it's always crowded and long line on the outside of the restaurant, I never find any problem finding seats for 4, 6, 8, or even 10 people. So their policy no food no seat (simplified terms ^_^) works for me. I always get the full rack bbq ribs while my wife would get the chicken. The meat is very tender and just fall out of the bone. The sauce is very thick and I can taste the BBQ spices. Some people think it's a bit to strong for their taste. But I think it's the perfect compliment to their sweet and tender meat. So far, I'm still searching for the best ribs in OC. For now, Phil's still the best place to go.

Phil's has GREAT BBQ! ÊI've only ever had takeout that the hubby picked up, so I can't comment on the restaurant atmosphere, but the food is so good. The ribs are very meaty, and the meat falls right off the bone (I can't stand messy ribs, so this is a huge plus for me!). ÊThe smokiness is strong, but it doesn't take away from the flavors in the sauce, although the BBQ sauce isn't my favorite. ÊIt is different from any BBQ sauce that I've ever had... extra tangy maybe? ÊThe baked beans are also uniquely flavored with LOTS of pepper and spices. ÊThe fries are so-so; I think next time I might try onion rings instead. The only drawback for me is that there are no desserts on the menu at Phil's. ÊI'm used to Brett's BBQ, so I've come to associate good ribs with bread pudding for dessert!

Regardless of the time you go, you will have to wait in line. ÊThe line moves relatively quickly, but you can expect to wait 45 minutes for dinner. ÊOnce in, you place your order, get a beeper, and seat yourself. ÊIt's self serve, but servers will come around to assist w anything or remove all the napkins from your table. The food is delicious!! I got the baby back ribs tickler (3 baby back ribs, 2 onion rings, fries and cole slaw) for lunch on Saturday. It was ~$6.50 and more than enough food. I'd get the half/full rack for dinner ($11+). I also had a taste of the pulled pork sandwich and the garden burger. ÊSurprisingly, the garden burger was good. Both were less than $7. I also ordered a bottle of bbq sauce to go. ÊI was expecting a pre-filled commercialized jar, but instead I got fresh bbq sauce in a jar. ÊThey even bagged it for me! Also, there's a sink to clean your hands, and the automatic water is warm (vs cold). That tickled my fancy.

I just went to Phil's for the first time today. After hearing and reading all the hype, I don't think Phil's is worth standing in line (in the rain) for 45 minutes. You are herded like cattle to order at a register and then wait for your food for another 30 minutes. The barbecue is good but the pushy wait staff is does not help. I ordered food to-go while my sister ate in the restaurant. I had 2 different people come up to me and ask why I was eating to go in the restaurant and "Didn't you see the big sign our front?" They've definitely let the hype go to their head. I also heard several people comment, while in line, that they were going to leave and go to Red Lobster instead, obviously, Phil's was not worth the wait. Just a note as I eat their Baby Back Ribs--they are WAY over done. I don't know if this had something to do with the amount of people waiting, or if that's just how they are. Stick with the chicken, not too many people can mess that up. Their french fries tasted like In and Out's, so go there, its cheaper.

A Broham and a side will still keep you under $10. Sometimes it's good to start with the basics: Bro: a modifier to imply that something is bigger, more tattooed, and all around bro-ier. Ham: a meat coming from the animal known for being the most Powerful culinary force In the Goddamn universe (PIG). Naturally, a sandwich named "Broham" is better than sex. ÊTwice. I got addicted to this place in college, and it's since shortened my life in the most wonderful way possible: BBQ pork. ÊIt's tough to get better pulled pork without doing it myself, and their equally awesome BBQ sauce makes it well worth it to pay them to put up my arterial roadblocks for me. ÊThey do a standard BBQ style type of pulled pork (no pressure cooker, so far as I can tell), which is a little bit crispy. ÊThe Broham takes an obscene pile of this and puts it on a toasted bun covered in a spicier than sweet sauce and calls itself a sandwich. ÊHowever, I have to fork through the pork for a good five minutes before I can get it into a working sandwich format. I also recommend getting a side. ÊThey're all good, just pick one. The service is really good. ÊEveryone there is on top of their stuff and having lots of fun. ÊThey manage the crowd well while simultaneously being very personable and helpful. ÊI can't think of a time I've gone there and haven't had a two minute talk with an employee while waiting in line, or had someone go out of the way to hold a door open for me as I waddled through it with armfuls of food. Do you want to live forever?!

So hearing my raving friends and reading the great reviews, I just had to get a taste myself. My boyfriend is in town and he loves BBQ, so hey, why not go to Phil's ... even if it is a 2 hour drive. One thing I did miss was that there is a long line. Well, this is expected considering how good it was said to be. So we got in line, it moved fairly fast considering how long it was! We decided to share and get both of the ribs - baby back ribs and beefy ribs. I have always been a baby back ribs fan and love it drenched in BBQ sauce. But my friend insisted on beefy ribs, so we had to get both. The baby back ribs were so incredibly tender. I picked up one rib and the meat just fell off. And the beefy ribs were of a smoky flavor. I loved it because Phil's had their own taste ... there are a lot of places with ribs and bbq sauce, but this is extra special. Seriously, BEST RIBS EVER. If you go with a friend, I suggest getting both and sharing. Their sides are also very good. I got fries and the macaroni salad. My boyfriend got cole slaw and baked beans. Everything was so delicious. The beans weren't too sweet but still really really good. Phil's BBQ sauce is just... good, amazing, delicious, everything a BBQ sauce should be. The employees are great too. There was a guy walking around, entertaining the line. It was my first time there and the lady at the front of the line was really sweet and told us how everything worked. Even the cashier was delightful to talk to. Good service, no complaints. Definitely worth the drive and the wait.

Not much to really say about this place that hasn't already been said. ÊBeen here three times, it's the best BBQ joint in San Diego. The baby back ribs are loaded with flavor and come off the bone real easily. ÊThe chicken is sufficiently tangy and more than filling. ÊAnd the small sides aren't really all that small. ÊSafe to say that you get your money's worth and then some. Sometimes the line is long, especially around dinner time. ÊBut with a place this popular, can you really blame em? Ê And get the BBQ sauce at Costco! ÊIt's really good! (I swear I'm not getting paid by anyone to say this.)

Oh man, loved it! It's gotta be one of my fave BBQ spots of all time now. I love that their menu is simple and they just let the food speak for itself. My BF and I shared the baby back rib dinner with fries and cole slaw and our table shared an order of the onion rings. The ribs were perfect--meat so tender and falling off the bone. Sauce everywhere which is just the way I like it. Get ready to dig in and get messy. My next favorite were the onion rings. The fried batter is just different and definitely worth a try. I think their order and find a seat method is rather efficient instead of being a full on sit down restaurant. Waiters still come around and take plates and offer to get you things like BBQ sauce and wetnaps. Overall, I had a great experience here and would love to go back the next time I'm in SD!

Full disclosure - I don't like bbq. Well, I don't like bbq sauce anyway.... (please don't kill me!) I decided to give Phil's a chance because my friend was raving about how it had almost 2000 yelps and a 4.5 star rating. We prepared for our visit to Phil's by shopping at the outlets, having a very light lunch and arriving at the "off" time of 3:30. Well, even at 3:30 we ended up waiting in line for about 20 minutes, which isn't too bad. Plus it gave me time to contemplate the menu. I ended up with the rib-less dinner with beans and fries, plus onion rings. The rib-less dinner consists of chunks of tender, nicely charred pork shoulder. I was happy with my choice which left me relatively clean and sauce-stain free. I was a little bit surprised by how spicy the bbq sauce is here. It's not like sriracha spicy, but it definitely has a kick. The onion rings were massive and delicious. I love battered onion rings and Phil's did a great job. Portions are huge and our plates were overflowing with food. Check out the pulled pork sandwich which is literally overflowing with meat. I took some of my pork home and I think it almost tasted better the next day cold. If it's your birthday be sure to tell the staff because then you and your party get to cut to the front of the line and I think I heard something about a free moon pie?? I wish I knew that before I arrived, it would have saved us 20 minutes of standing! Phil's basically just has chicken and ribs. I wish they had brisket and burnt ends (my fave!!). But I can't blame them for sticking to what they do best.

What can I say that over 1000+ plus reviews hasn't already mentioned? Their BBQ is out of this world and truly worth the wait. BUUUUUT...if you live in SD and can avoid it, do it! Just make that quick phone call, and do a to-go order. The only reason to ever wait in that line is if you are from out of town, are taking guests there from out of town, OR are testing your patience. As a testimate to how good they are, my husband and I had our rehearsal dinner for our wedding catered by Phil's BBQ. It really never gets old and the cravings never stop.

BEST BBQ I've ever had! Next time I'm in town, I'll definitely be returning here. There was a long line that wrapped around the place when I arrived (wait was roughly 45mins). My friend suggested getting to-go to feed our hungry appetites faster (wait was less than 5 mins). The aroma was amazing. They have delicious baked beans and ribs! The ribs were very meaty and slides right off the bones. The baked beans are a must! Very good deals, I think it's pretty cheap.

As if this place didn't have enough positive reviews. The Misses and I were in San Diego for the weekend. We drove by Phil's during the top of the morning and saw the crazy-long line. Later that night, we drove by Phil's again and I told Êher, "We are eating there. I don't care how long we have to wait." You first make your way to the register and order your food. Then it's open seating, which explains the long lines-- the entire city of San Diego is trying to eat there at the same time. Maybe all of Southern California. We first ordered the babybacks and the chicken dinner. I might I say, winner winner chicken dinner. Everything was good, the ribs, the chicken, the fries, the corn-on-the-cob, and even the coleslaw; I love me some slaw. The most surprising thing to me was the prices. Lucille's full rack = $24+ Tony Romas' full rack = $18+ Phil's...well it's $18. But they're damn good ribs. Soooo...we're fat. We were in town for 3 days. We ate there twice. Second time we got the babybacks again and the Broham Sandwich (i.e. pulled pork shoulder) YUM! Nothing left to say. Everything is yummy. Go eat there!!!

I've been here 5 times already in 3 months and I don't even live in San Diego. I can't give this place an objective review, as I've never been to the South and had "real" BBQ, but this place is as close as it gets in my eyes. The portions are hefty, the prices are slim, and the service is both fast and excellent. Yes the wait is immense but once you order, your food comes within minutes. I'll be moving to La Jolla soon and you can count on me being a regular here! Cheers!

Phil's is a definite local favorite. ÊWe normally stop here before we go to the Sports Arena. ÊThis last time, was Black Friday, we went in the evening and waited about 30 minutes. ÊThey also have a bar, outdoor patio and do phone orders. Usually we each get a sandwich but that has been way too much so we shared a chicken BBQ sandwich and large order of onion rings. ÊWe should have gotten the small because we couldn't eat it all! ÊI ask for the BBQ sauce on the side because there is usually too much on the sandwich for me.

I always take my out of town friends here... It's not the best bbq i've ever had (the best is in Alabama)...but undeniably the best in San Diego. There is a long wait, but if you avoid going during prime lunch time and after work...the wait is not long at all. I like to either order: 1. Pork rib tickler (no substitutes on the sides though) 2. Beef rib tickler (I normally don't like eating beef ribs, but the meat just falls right off the bone!) 3. Side of onion rings (they give a bunch, so its definitely share-able) 4. The Toro 5.

I know quite a few people who likes to order the chicken tickler, but I'm not that big of a fan of dry white meat. But if you are...I heard its pretty good!

Defreakinlicious. Seriously, good bbq. My weapon of choice is usually the beef ribs. I love me good beef ribs and these be some good beef ribs. The meat is just Êso tender and the sauce so...tangy and sweet at the same time. I LOVE that they have Cajun seasoning at the table. Those things are made for fries. I'd knock points off for the wait, but I have a hard time blaming a place for making me wait because their food is so good that 100 (or so...literally) people are willing to wait in line for god knows how long for a taste of their food (true story ladies and gents...happened this weekend).

Great, mouthwatering, fall off the bone barbeque!!! It was my first time at Phil's and honestly, I felt like I was waiting in an ultra super long line at Disneyland. Their line gives you a check point, from this point it is a 30 minute wait. Thank goodness for people to make you forget how long you are waiting and just chatting it up for a good one hour and a half. It was just a really long line! Once we got through the door, it was not the end of waiting. We had to wait till we got to the podium. They first found our group of 9 a seat, then we just got to the front counter to order. We had the baby back ribs dinner, which comes with 1 large side or 2 small sides. We just got it with corn on the cob. My parents had the baby back ribs dinner with large fresh cut fries. Also, a small side of the potato salad and LARGE COLOSSAL ONION RINGS! The ribs dinner was perfect when I shared with my sister. It was a great amount for 2 people, unless you are really famished, then definitely be the beast. Let's talk about the ribs. A lot of meat on the bone, and it just came right off. You didn't need to struggle by nibbling on the bone, it just all came off. It was so flavorful, moist, and tender. I loved their BBQ sauce, it was just a good amount of tangy and not so overpowering. Oh my goodness, it was orgasmic. I loved it so much. (This could be because I hadn't eaten all day and I was extremely huuuunngry!) OR it could be THAT good. The fries were typical fries, it had some skin, I liked the seasoning that you can put on yourself, I forgot what it was. The Large colossal onion rings were extremely HUGE! COLOSSAL! They were extremely crunchy, might I add OILY!. For me, I could only have one of these because it is so oily just too much for me to handle. I normally eat one whole onion ring and the rest I just rip the batter off and just eat the onion. I know... I am strange. They are pretty good and love that CRUNCH, especially with ranch. YUM! The potato salad was also satisfying. The flavors were amazing, you can definitely taste the dill and it was a little lemony (if i remember correctly). I personally would have gotten this as our side because I liked it better than the fries. It did not have too much mayonnaise and the potatoes were not mashed but soft enough to enjoy easily. Corn on the cob was just regular cooked corn with nothing on it. You can definitely just get the simple sweet flavors of the corn. All in all, the food was AMAZING! I can't wait to come again. It was soo good. Lucille's got nothing on Phil's! - Give it a try! MUST TRY! P.S: One thing they are pretty stingy on sauces, I think they give only 1 bbq sauce and 1 ranch. The lady was being really sassy with me. I did not appreciate that. There were nine orders, you expect us to share like 2 or 3 sauces? Come on! anyways, Good luck on the wait but don't be discouraged because it was worth it for me!

I hadn't been to Phil's since it moved to the Sports Arena so I arranged to meet a friend there to talk personal business. ÊGreat call!!! Everything was excellent! ÊThe sauces were great, the chicken, beef and pork were tender and it was good and messy. ÊThe new digs are spacious but, as with any good place, there was a decent size line. ÊThere isn't much to say about Phil's except "GO THERE and ENJOY!" The only thing that prevents it from being one of the very few 5-star places in San Diego is the fact that there is absolutely no service. ÊLet me be clear, it's not that they have bad service, they actually have none. ÊThink of it like a fast food joint when it comes to service. ÊYou order and pay at the counter, they throw you a pager, you scrounge around trying to find a table, and they page you when it's ready. ÊYou walk back up to the counter to pick it up and grab some silverware and wet-naps at the condiment bar. ÊIf they actually served it, I would throw it the final star. ÊAlas, they do not. ÊHowever, I should say that we didn't wait more than 10 minutes for the food and it was some good old fashioned chow. Ê Phil's is definitely worth the wait and the money. ÊBecause it's loud and the food is messy, it may not be the best place for a first date or a business meeting. ÊExcept for those two caveats, run on down and "Git you a plate!"

Phil's is pretty good. ÊI've lived in San Diego for 3 years and this past weekend was my first visit to Phil's. ÊI love bbq, but for some reason I never got around to eating at Phil's even though EVERYONE says how awesome it is. ÊI have my favorite bbq place in Miami and I was hoping that this would compare, but it didn't. ÊIt's a good alternative though. ÊTheir chicken was moist and tender, but the skin on it was slimy. ÊI like my chicken charred and the skin crispy. ÊThat's my main beef with them. Ê I got the chicken and baby back rib combo with fries and cole slaw. ÊThe fries are pretty good especially once they soak in the bbq sauce. ÊI'd like to try their onion rings, they're massive and look delicious. We called in the order at 11:05 for pick up, walked past all the people waiting for sit down service, paid, sat at the bar for a beer and a minute later our buzzer went off indicating our food was ready. ÊWe took it to my mom's house to eat there, but we could've easily sat at the bar and chowed down on our take out while watching football. We at first thought that we'd get there right at 11 on Sunday (when they open) and be the first in line to dine in. ÊI think that's a bad assumption on our part. ÊWhen we got there at 11:15, it was packed! ÊJust a heads up!

I got the best of both worlds with the chicken and baby back ribs. It was good, but they only offer one type of sauce and it's kind of spicy for the kiddos. I wish that they had different types of sauce flavors. It's kind of a cattle call. You have to wait in line to order, and then you have to wait for your food. They give you a beeper that lights up when your order is ready, and then you have to go and pick up your order. We had a party of 11 and were actually seated pretty quickly and one of the staff was really great and picked up our orders for us and brought us out plates. He was awesome. I also had beans and potato salad with my order. It was all very delicious.

I love BBQ and this place IS BBQ! Phil's has the best beef ribs I've ever had. The ribs were big, meaty, delicious, and came right off the bone. The sauce was just fantastic, it's impossible to not have it all over your face! My dish came with five ribs and i was only able to get through 3.5 ribs (and I can eat a lot)! I ordered two side dishes, the coleslaw and macaroni salad. They were okay (I've definitely had way better side dishes), but it didn't matter because the ribs were friggin' awesome! Not only is their meat awesome, but the people who work here are all really nice too. Whenever I find myself at a restaurant which service matches its high quality of food, the restaurant definitely deserves a high mark. I'm definitely coming back here next time I'm in San Diego and I'll be sure to try their sandwiches! In short: Awesome BBQ. Awesome Service. Wait... not so awesome, but totally worth the wait!

YUMMM!!! when i pulled up to this place and saw the line go out the door and around the corner, i thought to myself...."this better be that DAMN freaking good" fortunately enough i had a group of friends that arrived earlier than i did and suffered a 20 minute wait while i only had to put up with about 10 minutes of it. this place is great because it accomodated seating for 10 of us and the food wasn't half bad either...okay, okay, don't pull my arm, the food was delicious. Êthe service however costed them the 1 star, it would've only been half a star if yelp allowed for it, but no....with that set aside, this is a definite place to try out for some good ol' BBQ.

Phil's is just a great place overall. The people are great, the service is great, and the food is well, lets just say that IMO, it's the best BBQ in San Diego. The sauce is the boss as Phil himself says. Its got just the right amount of tangy-ness and saltiness that goes good on anything, even coleslaw. The BBQ Broham is a pulled-pork sandwich with coleslaw and a great start for a newbie. Both the pork and beef ribs are delicious, although you get much more with the beef ribs because they're about five times as big. The chicken is good too but I recommend keeping the bone because the bone-less tend to be a little dry. And a small order of onion rings will be enough for 4 people. The only possible bad thing about Phil's is the line which most likely will be there because all of San Diego loves this place for its longwithstanding tradition of authentic BBQ. But its worth the wait and if you prefer, call in and get your order to go. No waiting for that, just walk in and pick up your order after calling.

Not the biggest fan of bbq but I thought since I'm in SD why not try what people consider the best bbq in southern California. My friend and I shared the quarter rack baby back ribs with fries and macaroni salad. When we got our food we knew instantly that we wouldn't be able to finish it, they gave us generous amounts of the "small" sides. The ribs itself were alright, I'm not a big fan of bbq sauce so to me it was a bit too saucy. The fries and macaroni salad were really good though! They had yummy fries seasoning too. All in all I think this would be a one time visit, it wasn't that great but it wasn't too bad.

Here's what you need to know: Phil's makes excellent ribs. They excel at making BBQ ribs. This means it's PROBABLY a good idea to order their ribs. (to those who complain their other meats aren't as good as the ribs...hmm, I wonder why...) Their BBQ sauce is good, but not great. If sauces are your thing, you won't be amazed with Phil's. Did I mention they're good with ribs (and to some extent the chicken)? They don't have too much variety of meats outside of that so don't expect links, brisket or anything like that. They had a pork sandwich I tried once but was a little dry. Remember you can ask for extra BBQ sauce when you order so don't let your meats go dry! They also lack variety on dessert and other sweet sides. Portions are average, but probably not enough for big boys who come here in groups. Treat yourself right--get a full rack of ribs. Onion rings are big, golden and delicious. Their fries go excellent with a few extra sauce containers. I come here every time I'm in San Diego. If you're in NorCal however, check out Everett & Jones BBQ in Oakland (see my review too :)) which does better in the BBQ sauce and side dishes. Almost every time, I order the full rack of ribs with fries. On the weekends, get there early or be ready to wait 15-30 minutes in line. Parking in the plaza is tight during meal hours. One gripe: Normally, you wait in line, order at the register, get seated, then pick up your food when it's ready. However, one time we were seated first and a waitress took a drink order for a friend who was sitting alone, holding the table. He was supposed to go back to the register when ordering and tell them about the drink he had already received. The waitress later comes back and implicitly calls my friend a thief for not paying for the soda because he couldn't find his receipt with the drink order! Well, at least the manager was nice, who apologetically gave us a complimentary order of onion rings when we complained. This was an isolated incident!

Hate to say it because so many people love this place but I wasn't impressed. Ê First there was a wait midweek, OK..it's popular what can you do. ÊBut then when it was time to order I found the menu confusing (2 sides, 3 sides, large sides, small sides) and the TWO guys helping me at the register only made it more confusing and made me feel rushed. Ê So I had the boneless ribs (with some name that doesn't distinguish them as boneless ribs but I was expected by the cashier to understand) and while the meat quality was good, all I could taste was liquid smoke and it was pretty gross. ÊI didn't even finish them. I'll give it another try if the group wants to go there again, but I won't go there on my own or suggest it. Ê Overall, pretty disappointing.

This place has been reviewed a lot, so I'll keep it short. ÊIt's pretty much been said already. ÊVery good BBQ place. ÊProbably the best in SD. ÊIf your a BBQ aficionado you'll realize this isn't the best BBQ ever, but it is very good. ÊPortions are large for the price, and the sides are very good as well. I thought the beef ribs were better than the baby back. ÊThe beef rib sauce was more my flavor. ÊA 3 beef rib dinner with two sides and two sodas is perfect for my wife and I to share, so the price is very good. It's crowded but it goes quicker than you'd expect.

Probably a waste to even review this place since it's not secret that Phil's has really great yet affordable ribs. The lines can be disastrously long (so long that they even have a sign outside that tells you how long the wait time is) but once you get pass the doors the atmosphere is reminiscent of a BBQ joint in Texas. Phil's should be a secret though because we waited for an hour to get our food! My friend and I shared a full rack of baby back ribs with side of corn on the cob. The ribs were very flavorful and tender--so tender that the meat easily came off the bone. The corn was sweet(I didn't need any butter on it) and complimented the ribs well. It was also a lighter side compared to the macaroni salads and fries my friends ordered. The waiter who helped our table was attentive and because we sat outside, made sure our heat lamps were turned on and was ready to assist us with containers for our leftovers and wet wipes. I thought that was pretty good service for a fast food place.

I first tried this place out when it was at it's old location on Washinton Street, which was small, and cramped, but the food was really great. The new location on Sports Arena is bigger and better, yet somehow it seems that it is as busy or even more so. ÊDon't be afraid of the line--it movies faster than you think, and there is a reason there is a line--the place is bombkies. The chicken is good, the ribs are good (I prefer the fall-off-the-bone tender beef ribs, but the pig-variety are good too), everything is good. Ê You should definitely get an order of onion rings to split, they are the best I've had. ÊThey're not breaded, they are coated in a nice batter, sort of like tempura. As far as sides go, I usually opt for the macaroni salad and the fries. ÊThe cajun seasoning on every table goes well on the fries, and instead of ketchup, I dip them in the delicious barbeque sauce that has generously welled up on the bottom of the basket. ÊThe baked beans are good too. The bar has a good selection of beer and the price is decent. ÊIf I could change one thing, it would be to replace the macaroni salad with macaroni and cheese. ÊIf they're dishing out good soul food, it should come with a good mac & cheese. ÊIt's a minor flaw, and not worthy enough to take off a star. Bottom line--this place rules, and you need to eat there if you haven't already. ÊWhat the hell are you waiting for?

I made the unfortunate mistake of ordering chicken that night. Not that their chicken is bad by any measure, but after coming back again and ordering the beefy ribs, I'm not sure what the hell I was thinking.

This place is one of my absolute faves in SD. Of the almost ten years of living in San Diego, I can say with 100% certainty that this is my most frequented dining establishment. Ê I usually alternate between the 1/4 chicken and baby back ribs combo dinner or the rib tickler (3 baby backs, fries cole slaw and 2 onion rings, but this option requires the addition of a side of the mac salad). The mac salad is so amazing, it has ruined most hawaiian bbq's for me because I can only think about how the mac salad does not compare with phil's. I have also had the BBQ cheeseburger (delicious), the Broham sando (not as delicious as i had hoped , but I'm blaming that on the hangover and will give it another chance), the beef ribs (HUGE and delicious, but i think i prefer the pork). The sides are yum yum also, the aforementioned mac salad, baked beans, cole slaw, corn and potato salad are my choices. ÊI usually have to get 3 sides, not because of the portions (which are plentiful), but because I am afraid I will be sad if I leave something out. ÊEven the fountain soda makes me excited (really good ice and selection). I think I may be the only person in the free world to not like the El Toro (BBQ beef sando), so dont trust my opinion there. and don't forget to order the onion rings with ranch.

As someone who lived in San Diego during my college years, I think that I have a little bit to say about what San Diego has to offer. ÊAnd if someone asks me what they have to see, Phil's is definitely on the list. I remember people telling me that they would make special trips down from Los Angeles just to have the BBQ food at Phil's. ÊI thought that was crazy, but that made it at least worth the effort to try. ÊOn my first attempt, they were unfortunately renovating their previous location. ÊThat was a pretty big disappointment, but some of my friends brought me here for my birthday since they knew that I wanted to try it. ÊWhile I had initially been disappointed because I didn't get to try it on the previous trip, I can definitely say that I was NOT disappointed once I put some of that food into my mouth! Ê At the previous location the seating was pretty bad because the restaurant was so small. ÊHowever the current location on Sports Arena Blvd has plenty more seating. ÊThe old location had, in my opinion, more flavor and character. ÊBut the past is gone, and Phil's is still good. The beef ribs are huge and a much better deal for a single rib (3.95) over a single baby back rib (3.75). ÊPersonally I'm a fan of the baby back ribs, but I can definitely enjoy the beef ribs as well. ÊOpt for the fries (on the firm and crunchy side) along with the cole slaw (fresh and mild compared to most slaw). ÊPut on a plastic bib if you're messy and get ready to dig in. ÊThe sauce is finger-lickin' good. You should definitely put this place onto your list of things to do if you're in San Diego. ÊYou can expect nothing, and you'll receive an awesome meal. ÊBut even if you do come in with some expectations I think that you will leave satisfied. ÊJust don't come at peak hours lest the swarms of people ruin the meal.

We just had a fantastic meal (stuffed to a point of wanting to vomit) and decided to drive aimless up north to get pinkberry.

ÊWe got the tickler (pork ribs with slaw, two rings and fries) and one beef rib to share; all for $11!!! ÊIt's a ton of food that can feed a family of four. Ê The ribs were good; juicy and tender with a tangy bbq sauce that has a slow kick that lingers on your tongue. ÊThe onion rings were meh - really greasy and not crisp, but the fries were crispy and hot. ÊGo figure. Ê What I really enjoyed about this place is that everyone who works there is extremely friendly and hard working. ÊThe place is pretty much self service, but there are bus boys constantly rushing to clean tables for the next guests and they check-in to see if you need anything else while you're eating.

ÊEverything, from the meat, to the fries, to the DELICIOUS onion rings were fantastic. ÊI don't about the appetites of others, but this is a single meal for the entire day. ÊMmm... We also noticed that the crowd dies down around 2:30, if you are one who likes to avoid crowds.

I don't know what I was thinking before, but Phil's BBQ (American BBQ for that matter) is the $h1t! I guess it was just a matter of time before I got over the eating with two fingers and making no mess deal... cause if you're gonna enjoy Phil's, its all about gettin' down and dirty with your food! The line may be a turn-off... but if you're willing to be patient, you won't regret it! Classic American BBQ... regardless of what meat you get, you'll enjoy every mouth-watering fall off the bone bite of it, and their tangy house bbq sauce too! Took my BF here for his first time and I had to give him a taste of everything Phil's got to offer... so we ordered their "Best of Both Worlds": 4 pork baby back ribs + 1/4 mesquite bbq chicken and a beefy rib sampler. Add a side of their amazing Colossal Onion Rings and we're set to go! We also had cole slaw, bbq baked beans, and corn on the cob as our sides... but none of which were too memorable. But Phil's is all about the BBQ... YUM! The beef ribs are considerably larger than the pork baby back ribs!, but that's why there's the price difference. I personally prefer the texture of the pork and how it falls off the bone a bit better, but the beef is also just as good, and comes with a lot more meat! You can try them both for yourself by getting a single rib sampler for $3-$4. The mesquite bbq chicken was also mouth watering - no dry chicken here! We finished up every last morsel, and you can imagine how down right and dirty we we're by the end.... thank goodness for their paper towel rolls, moist towelettes, and ample sinks by the exit! No need to fear getting messy here! If you haven't given Phil's a try... GO NOW! Just the thought of Phil's makes my mouth water... nyommmmm.

Best BBQ on the west coast hands down. Every time I go to San diego, I have to eat here. I even brought sauce back. It amazes me that people line up for long lines. I never wait, but I can see it being worth it. I've had the beef ribs which are amazing and mac salad and fries are awesome as well. I had my friend bring like a crate of ribs for my gfs bday, so its worth the money and worth everything! I'm actually hungry thinking about it now.

Phil's BBQ is to die for! ÊWent here after a trip to the San Diego Wild Animal Park with the bf eating some lower than average burgers and couldn't wait for a nice hearty dinner. ÊMy friend randomly recommended this place based on great reviews on Yelp and this place was definitely worth it! Ordered the half chicken half ribs combo with baked beans and fries, and did not regret it one bit. ÊThe meats are so tender and the sauces are delicious! ÊAlso ordered some onion rings (also a great buy). ÊOnly plate I thought was mediocre was the coleslaw, but it might be to some other people's liking since I'm not a huge coleslaw fan. ÊPortions are quite generous and the pricing is extremely reasonable. ÊThe staff is super friendly and the place is spacious. ÊThis place doesn't take reservations but the line going out the door goes through quickly. Ê Ever since I've eaten here I've been raving about it nonstop. ÊI think I'm due for San Diego trip for more Phil's BBQ! :)

After watching the San Diego episode of Man v. Food, I decided to give this place a third and final try. I guess third time's a charm. This is one of those places where you really need to know the right thing to get. I opted for Adam Richman's choice of the "El Toro" sandwich, and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. The thinly sliced Êtri-tip (hard to find anywhere other than in California) Êwas cooked to perfection. I also learned a way to bypass that huge line, but I'm not giving away any secrets in this review :) Now that I know what to order I will definitely be back.

Phil's BBQ is a mandatory visit for me whenever I come down to San Diego. Don't let the line out the door put you off, it is definitely worth the wait. The line actually moves quite fast and the workers are very efficient and friendly. The prices are quite affordable for a BBQ joint. But the food is the best thing about Phil's. I always get the tickler with baby back ribs which is a steal at about $7. The ribs are juicy, flavorful, fall off the bone, and have the perfect barbeque sauce. The tickler also comes with yummy fries, cole slaw, and onion rings. My bf usually gets the best of both worlds with chicken and your choice of baby back or beef ribs. The sides are delicious also and he loves the baked beans. If you're anywhere in the SD area make sure to stop by Phil's!

Sometimes it's difficult to qualify 'awesomeness' in words, particularly with your mouth stuffed full of Phil's ginormous portions of bbq. ÊWhile I typically had acquiesed to the safe pulled pork sandwich, it wasn't until recently that I tried the baby back ribs - infatuatingly delectable. ÊI have no memories of better ribs - nothing from my childhood days in backwater bbq joints in the southeast resonate remotely close to the memories Phil's baby back ribs instated in my cranial cavity. Word of wisdom to the wise: Êcall ahead and pick up to skip the line as the amazing aroma will test your nerves - unless you want a flavor of what life was like during the Soviet Union bread lines.

Their BBQ is REALLY, REALLY good. Since I've lived in San Diego it's the best BBQ I've had. As other reviewers note, the ribs fall off the bone and melt in your mouth, and the chicken is hellla tasty. I've never eaten inside, so I cannot comment on the lines because I always get my food "To Go," usually by calling in ahead of time. With this method I'm always in and out in under a couple minutes. The people that work there are definitely enthusiastic and friendly, which is rare in a restaurant these days. The onion rings are BOMB, and the only not-so-tasty item I have found on the menu is the potato salad. For the best BBQ in town, hit em up.

Too good. My first review (below) was 2 years ago and I only gave it 4 stars. However, it has become my favorite BBQ place of all time--- to date. I'm still up for suggestions but 5 stars right here for sure: I am stuffed right now from eating at this place so I thought I should review it before my brain forgets how my stomach feels. And the answer is....happy. I really enjoyed this place. I really like ribs and I ordered a half rack. I like how you order it from the counter and wait for your "buzz" to pick it up. For me...here's how I rate this place: The good: friendly staff, good atmosphere, great ribs, large servings, reasonable prices The not so good (reason I deducted one star): baked beans weren't the greatest, ribs and other plates only had one choice of sauce (compared to some places that offer a variety), hmmm....that's all I can think of. Anyhow, I did enjoy the food and the ambiance and will come back again when I'm in town and hungry, however, this isn't my favorite BBQ of all time. ÊI really like to have variety in my sauces (you know...spicy, mustard, etc.) But if you love BBQ, give this a try. Chances are it will win you over.

Let me join the zillions of other San Diegans who recognize that this IS the best BBQ joint in town. there are a bunch of others but to speak plainly...they SUCK. After living in Memphis and eating BBQ around the south, I can tell you this place is v good. I've gotten tired of trying to find a backup for those Mondays when i forget they're closed. I just resign myself to hanging around the place looking stupid like the other half dozen people who inevitably forget they are closed that day. If there's anyplace as good in SD, I want to hear about it. seriously.

When planning this trip, we were deciding whether we should go to SD for the beaches or Texas for the bbq. Because it was hurricane season we decided on SD. After breakfast, with no real destinations for our San Diego trip we decided to cruise and check out our surroundings. We saw Phil's and immediately we knew what we wanted for dinner. It was a sign... I was to get the best of both worlds =) While we were standing in front of the menu, checking out their offerings. A guy came up tp us and recommened a little bit of everything so why not? There was no line and the girl taking our orders was extremely patient with us as we debated on what sides to order. We got the baby back ribs (THE BEST!!!) with potato salad, beef ribs (very tender and falls rght off the bone) with french fries, bbq chicken (breast portion is a lil dry), and pulled pork sammie (we were told it was a must have, but it wasn't all that)... The portions are huge and it only costed $42. I was in heaven, good food and really affordable too. They really need to open one here in the Bay!

When you see the line wrapped outside and around the corner every single day they are open, you know this place has to be good!! BEST BBQ Pork Ribs I've had my whole life!! The meat actually melts in your mouth, and never disappoints. Nothing negative about the food, only about the slightly high prices ($20 for baby back ribs and 2 sides), closed on Mondays, and line is ALWAYS out the door. After trying their BBQ, all other places don't even come close!

Ah, Phil's BBQ... Ê Heard much about it, but never actually been there. ÊI may have stated this in past reviews, but my family is not necessarily the type to go out to a sit-down place for food. ÊSo when my friend decided to meet there for his birthday lunch get-together, I just couldn't pass it up. Ê Right along Sports Arena Boulevard, the aroma of the barbecue is enough to make my mouth water. ÊMy party was already there when I arrived and one of the workers helped my out in ordering my food and bringing out to me when it was ready (major points for service there). ÊI had the BBQ cheeseburger and I was licking my fingers in-between bites just so I can get some of the sauce that trickled off. ÊI actually finished my burger and was very satisfied. ÊI hope that the next time I'm here, I'll order the ribs and perhaps many other things... can't wait to go back!

Phil's bbq has it's pros and cons. Let's start with the goods. I absolutely love their bbq chicken. It's so soft and the meat just peels clean off the bones. It has to be one of the top 3 bbq foods I have eaten. The fries were actually really good too when I added seasoning salt to it. Lastly, the bbq sauce had to be one of my most favorite of all time. The service had it's goods and bads at times. Onto the cons.... The line is extremely long. I understand they have many customers and not enough seating, but I honestly wouldn't wait more than 40 minutes for phils' bbq. The macaroni salad seemed plain and was tasteless to me. The coke there was extremely watered down and tastes gross. I don't know what's all the hype about on the ribs, but it sure wasn't to the point where i wanted to wait 40 minutes for.

When I used to live in San Diego, Phil's used to be located on Goldfinch and Washington. ÊThe wait time at that place was a minimum of 40 min, a two hour wait was not unusual but well worth it. ÊThe BBQ was consistently good, the sauce wasn't spicy hot but it had just enough jalapeno to make the outer lip tingle. ÊReally Great stuff! When they moved I was afraid the BBQ wouldn't be as good as I remembered. ÊI was recently there and was not disappointed, it was just as good but without the notoriously long waits. Ê I am always on the hunt for good BBQ and Phil's is one of the tops in my book. Ê The only BBQ that's possibly better is Ernest Phillips BBQ located at the Sunday WLA Farmers Market. ÊThe only problem with Ernie's BBQ is the quality of meat. ÊSometimes he uses cheaper cuts of meat which is disappointing. ÊIt's hit or miss with this guy but there is no doubt the man can cook. ÊEven when he uses the cheaper cuts, it's always fall off the bone tender. ÊWell back to Phill's, when ever I am in Diego area I always try to make it to Phill's and pick up a full order of pork ribs. Note: ÊMake sure the ribs are hot and not warm when you eat them or else the tingle from the pepper will be hidden.

I review this with a sense of humor because it's Phil's BBQ and not front row seating with Bobby Flay. Let's be honest here, after waiting 60 minutes in line (in front of this loud, nerdy douche bag yapping about engineering and his 2-cents about every aspect of life), I was expecting the food to be piping hot off the grill and succulent meat to fall right off the bone. ÊThe romance died right there. ÊThe meat was great in quantity, but lacked the quality that a 60-minute wait in front of a yapping Asian male-douche-bag would warrant. Ê I'm glad I got this one experience because I'm heading over to Carvers the next time I want ribs the way I like it Ê:)

I love this place. The Best BBQ Ribs in California. Alot of times the line is out the door to get, but when you sink your mouth into those delicious baby back ribs, you will simply forget about the wait. Customer service is really good here. I'm always greeted with a warm welcome when coming here. The meat literally falls off the bone, when you eat them. The price is very reasonable. If I'm willing to drive 1 hour 15 minutes to get to Phil's I think that says alot. Can't wait to go back. Try the Half rib special. Wish there was more location especially in LA.

I wasn't expecting much from a BBQ joint in SD, but all of the yelp hype gave me reason to believe. There wasn't much of a line when we went on a weeknight, but most of the tables were full (with a bunch of college students). I didn't know this restaurant was an 'order at the counter' type of place, so I hastily selected their beef rib and half chicken combo, with coleslaw and potato salad sides. The portion size was good with two pieces of chicken and two hearty beef ribs. Unfortunately, the chicken was overcooked and obscenely slathered in sauce. I could tell it was chicken based on the stringy texture, but the overwhelming flavor was sweet/sour bbq sauce. By comparison, the ribs were much better. The meat was cooked (guessing baked) just right. It wasn't that manufactured super fall-off the bone tender that you find from boiled/prepackaged ribs. They were firm and had a nice smokey flavor. Although they were also sauced by Captain Generous. The coleslaw and potato salad sides were mostly forgettable. Similar to something you'd find from your local grocery-store deli. For the price, I guess I can't complain. I might come back for a quick simulated bbq fix, but I def wouldn't wait in line for more than 15 minutes.

I felt i had to write a review on this place, because almost anybody that's a foodie or used to live around the sd area has told me that if i ever go to San Diego, gotta go get Phil's BBQ cause it was probably the best BBQ they ever ate. They spoke about how it's all ribs on the bone, and when i told them that i'm not really a fan of ribs (fyi, i don't hate ribs, but just never found a place that made it good enough) but WOW, once i started eating the ribs, i was hooked, if i didn't like ribs before, Phil's BBQ made me like ribs again. The atmosphere is very loud, but in a good way where people can sit and eat family style. The place is pretty pet-friendly as well, because 2 of my friends that went with me had their dogs w/ them, and Phil's BBQ has outdoor patio seating, where they Êhave these shades that zip up at night to make the patio area seem like another room in the restaurant. So because we had dogs, we told them if we could take an outside seat, and they were very accommodating to our requests. The place comes with pork ribs, beef ribs, chicken, and a number of different sides that consist of baked potato, friends, onion rings, beans, cole slaw, potato salad and macaroni salad. Personally, i liked the pork ribs better than the beef ribs, but don't get me wrong, the beef ribs was good as well. Overall, it was a good experience and next time i'm in san diego again, must stop by here again, but don't let my review try to convince you, i'm sure once you go here and try their food, you'll be hooked Êyourself.

THE BEST BBQ IN SAN DIEGO!!!! Yes their is always a line but its so worth the wait. If theirs a line from when they open till when they close.... then you know its got to be good. The sauce is outstanding.... and not a thick bbq sauce. No matter what you get, the meat is always tender. All the sides are great also. The onion rings are even better. Onion rings are beer batterd and the best i ever had. Plus... they have sweet tea. Never had a problem with service. You do pick up your food at the front but I always leave a tip. P.s.

Hands down the best BBQ ribs I have ever had. There is not a better BBQ place on the West Coast, believe I have tried to find one and have failed every time, but that's a good thing! If you live in Southern California and more specifically San Diego and haven't tired fills yet, stop reading this right now and head over there and grab some ribs! The Baby Back Ribs are super tender and fall right off the bone. They are smoked for 8 hours and go great with any of the sides they have to offer. The BBQ sauce is just as amazing and even has a little bit of kick to it.

Hands down my favorite BBQ place in San Diego. ÊSeems like most people rave about the ribs, but for me, it is all about the Broham.

The only downside of this place is that the line can get really long, so be sure to get there for an early meal, or during off hours. ÊThe last time my family went, we arrived in the early evening, just as the line was starting to creep out the door. ÊBy the time our food was ready, the line was already heading towards the end of the building and starting to turn the corner. I also found out during that visit that Phil's is a pretty good place to catch a game as well. ÊWe went during the LLWS, and everyone was glued to the television. ÊPretty awesome to hear the whole place erupt in cheers when the boys from Chula Vista were busy hitting bombs.

ÊThe service is fast and after a five minute wait your food should be ready. Ê Good luck trying to find a seat!!! I've had the chicken, beef rack, brisket, and pork rack...all awesome.

We read the good reviews and gave Phil's a try last week. I'm glad we did! We got there around 1:30 PM after the lunch rush, so we only had to wait a few minutes for a table. They don't have a kids' menu, but the "Chick Tickler" (boneless pieces of BBQ chicken, 2 onion rings, and a side) was more than enough for our 8-year old. In fact, it would have been enough for an adult. Our daughter doesn't have much tolerance for spicy food, but she remarked, "When I eat the chicken it's like my mouth is on fire, but it's SOOOO good!" The pork baby back ribs were excellent. I only wish I would have remembered to order a side of onion rings (I sampled my daughter's), but I was so full I'd have had a hard time finishing them. My wife commented that she really liked the cole slaw because it was so fresh and not too sweet, and she doesn't usually like cole slaw very much. Staff members came by the table a couple times to make sure everything was to our liking. The next time we're down in San Diego we're going back.

The food is great!!! Especially their baby back ribs... They melt in your mouth. I just don't like the wait that's why it gets a four. I personally think the hype is a bit too much for the food but they do have a very good sauce which-is what make the food taste good. I just dislike the wait. I would only give secretes to my friends no how NOT to wait in that long line as it was given to me by a the waiter, "Rafa". He told me what to do and No it's not call in your order and eat there. I was impressed and might go back during busy hours since I know what to do now. I saw it done by two boys and it worked so I'll pull it when I go there and probably give it a better rating. It would have received a five but because of the crowd and because they don't let you take a table before your food is there and because there is no waiter it only gets a five from me. But they are better from the first time I was there.

Went one night - HUGE line - can't do that with a 5 year old boy who can't sit still. ÊDecided to go back the next night at like 5:15 got right in no line - woohoo. ÊLine started forming as we were eating. Ribs were amazing - Chicken was awesome. Ê Fries were real good. Beans were good. ÊPotato salad was kinda not that good - wouldn't get that again but no biggie dug into the other food - it was a total hogfest and we oved it. Left full and happy - went to San Diego Padres game afterwards probably still with bbq sauce on our smiling faces.

Ok...I will admit, I like going here. But, its because I live in San Diego and the food quality is poor, unless you want t quick taco. So, for that reason I like Phils because it has decent food that is consistent. HOWEVER, I will back everyone else that this should not be called BBQ. There is no smoker and this food is not BBQ'd. It, in fact, is par-boiled earlier in the day and then quick grilled on the spot before served. That is why the ribs are so often burned or charred. Most people don't notice because of the ridiculous amount of sticky / salty sauce that they call "BBQ sauce." (its ketchup, sugar, molasses) The wait staff is oh so annoying but I'm over being annoyed by them, now I just ignore them...and I would suggest YOU DO TOO! Go to Phils to: 1. A change from the taco shop 2. Ignore the staff 3. Wait in line for a long time 4. Feel bloated after wards 5. Get annoyed by the lack of parking 6. Get annoyed by the COPS ALWAYS PARKED IN THE HANDICAPPED SPOTS 7. Get a headache from the endless tourists (who don't know anything about BBQ either for some reason) 8. Feel like getting away from the Convoy area (but cant seem to even though it is Point Loma) 9. Get annoyed by door dings from the packed parking lot 10. Get annoyed by the long line and END UP GOING TO RED LOBSTER NEXT DOOR!

The only way to do Phil's is takeout or sit in the bar. ÊI'm a die hard barbecue fan but the experience of eating in the restaurant in no way is worth standing in line for an hour and a half. ÊMy friend and I split the baby back and beef ribs. ÊI felt the sauce was overwhelming for the baby backs but was good on the beef ribs. ÊI prefer my ribs dry so I was disappointed not to see that as an option. We got the potato salad and steamed vegetables for sides which were underwhelming. ÊBottom line was that the food was good but not great and no way near justifies the hype. Thanks for your suggestion Fred I'll try 'em dry next time; but I'm still carrying out!

The smell of this place alone will suck you in off the street. It is the best BBQ joint in all of San Diego. Everything on the menu is delicious. I usually order by phone because there is always a line out the door and around the building. If you call in your order you Êcan be in and out in no time. They don't plate your food until you arrive so it's hot when you get home. If you are from out of town and you have a chance to go here, take it! It will definitely be one of the best meals you eat while you're here.

What can I say, I love BBQ. ÊThis place is hands down the best BBQ in a 1,000 mile radius, possibly second only to The Salt Lick. The other reviews sum up the ribs very well, but you need to try the Broham sandwich. ÊSomething about the smoky pulled pork, delicious coleslaw, and roll that blends so amazingly well. This place is usually crowded during peak times, so I try to come after/before peak times.

I ordered the half rack baby back ribs dinner with steamed veggies side. ÊThe portions were generous but I must say that the sauce they use is a little off. ÊI think it is either too sweet or maybe too sour, not sure, but I've had better bbq sauce. ÊAlso, the veggies could have been seasoned better and cooked longer. *EDIT* I went back a second time and found that the sauce sort of grows on you. ÊWhat's great about phil's is the consistent quality of meat along with the low prices. ÊI can definitely see myself becoming a loyal customer.

Best BBQ in the county. Some amazing short ribs here, but what really blew me away were the beef ribs. I've never actually enjoyed beef ribs at any restaurant before. These are not the usual dried-out fatty bones. They also have a nice beer selection here. You can't top a rack of ribs and a pitcher of Arrogant Bastard! I'm not a huge fan of their sides but given the quality of their meat and beer everything else is a non-issue.

I ordered: The Beef Rib Dinner with sweet beans and fresh cut fries. ÊThe meat was tender and easily fell off of the bone. ÊThe BBQ sauce was delicious. ÊIt wasn't too tangy and the sweetness didn't make my teeth tingle. ÊI got 5 ribs with my order and was forced to take 2 of them home to eat later because I didn't have any more room in my stomach.

Phil's is a superior location for no-frills (plastic baskets lined with paper), awesome eats, BBQ. There are actually no reservations and you order at the counter and they call you when your food is ready. Good for family members dining, it has a substantial, open dining region which can get noisy. Food is quicker than when they had been on Goldfinch. Beware of Sports Arena events which seriously makes it busy and the waits long.

Mmmmmm...BBQ Heaven! ÊAfter hearing about Phil's from several locals, I finally ventured out on a Friday night and braved the line wrapping around the building. ÊThe wait was approximately 45 minutes and well worth it! ÊI had the tri-tip sandwich and the boyfriend had an order of the the pork ribs. ÊNow I'm not usually a rib fan since I don't like eating meat off the bone, but these were cooked to perfection and the meat was so tender it was easy to just slide the meat off the bone and enjoy the BBQ goodness. ÊThe tri-tip sandwich was also fabulous, although much larger than I was expecting. ÊPhil's sauce is perfectly seasoned...not too sweet, just the right amount of spice. ÊI'm sure I will be returning to satisfy my BBQ cravings in the future.

It almost feels redundant to write another 5 star review for this place on YELP, but it really is that good. ÊBecause everyone has beaten the deliciousness of this place to death, I'll offer a concise recommendation of what to get. To get a taste of all the goodness, I recommend going and splitting the El Toro (tri tip sandwich featured on Man v Food) and a combo plate of baby back ribs and chickless with fries and macaroni salad. ÊAlso get a side of Onion rings because they are deliciously lightly breaded. ÊMy favorite part of it all is when the fries on the side of the ribs seeps into the sauce and you get the great tangyness of it. If you're looking for something cheaper, they offer baby back ribs plus fries plus 2 onion rings for $6.50 (or so-ish)!!! ÊSo don't think that everything is expensive here. ÊYou get a lot for your money. If you ever feel like making a trek for other BBQ, Firestone's in San Luis Obispo still has the best tri tip sandwich I have ever had. ÊDo what you can to visit this place at least once in your life!! Best tri tip sandwich and seasoned fries. ÊINCREDIBLE! ÊBut, this is a Phil's BBQ review, so just come here and bask in the glory that is Phils.

Since my last review, Ive probably been here 10 times and figured it was a good time to write an updated review. Ê Went here today and ordered a wide sample of everything. ÊAn el toro sandwich, a cheeseburger, a rib tickler and some onion rings. The el toro is always pretty good and was fine. ÊThe ticklers are easily the best value there and give you a little taste of everything. ÊPhils ribs are always tasty and are probably my favorite thing there. ÊThe fries are usually good, as long as they arent undercooked, Êand for whatever reason, I hate mayonnaise except in a lobster roll or in Phils cole slaw. ÊIts the only cole slaw that I have ever liked and its damn delicious. ÊThe onion rings are usually awesome but the last 3 times there, they have been meh.... They either cut the onions too thick, or put way too much breading on them. ÊIf they dont improve the next time I order them, I doubt I will keep getting them. ÊTotally disappointed in them lately. ÊLastly the cheeseburger....disappointed in that too. ÊIt was a plain jane basic burger with a too thick onion ring, small piece of cheese, and some bbq sauce. ÊIt was the second time I ordered it and it will be the last. 4 stars overall for the ribs, sauce, fries, cole slaw and the el toro. I love how they have a big old hand washing sink too. The service is always great at Phils and if you go on off hours, the line is never too long. ÊIf I had to wait in line for over an hour I might suggest something else. ÊThis is easily my favorite bbq in SD still though and Ive never had a bad meal there so that has to count for something ;-).

Oh how I wish there was one in the SFV. I live in Northridge, and everytime I crave BBQ I think of Phil's. YES, the line is LONG. But the wait is MORE than worth it. The line doesn't take as long as it looks. It wrapped around the corner and we maybe waited 30 minutes... which you would wait for at any other restaurant with a buzzer. After we ordered at the counter, we found a place on the heated patio. Very cozy. I was expected to wait awhile to get our food. However, it took maybe 10 minutes for our food to be ready. AMAZINGLY FAST considering there was still a long line. I like how you get your own drinks and serve yourself for bbq sauce, napkins, etc. The food was AMAZING. best BBQ I have EVER had, no comparison. I had the half rack of baby back ribs, with a side of mashed potatoes I believe. can't remember the side. The baby back ribs were SO JUICY and TENDER. They were meaty too. I was considering getting a full rack and was glad I didn't because I was so full I almost didn't finish all my food. There's usually at least one problem I have with the ribs at other place such as not enough meat, dry, chewy, etc. But these ribs were perfection. PLENTY of meat on each bone, fall of the bone tender, juicy, and the sauce was the best part. GO HERE! AND IF THE OWNERS SEE THIS PLEASE MAKE MORE PHILS BBQS!!

Whoa! For a visitor like me seeing that line wrap around the plaza, I bolted! No way was I gonna wait in that line. Who know how long it would take? But the staff there reassured us that the line moves pretty quickly and that it'll be worth it. So we took his word and waited in line. It did move fairly quickly and by an hour or so we ordered, took our seats and began to feast. The BBQ was indeed delicious. The meat fell off the bones and the sauce was finger-lickin' good. I also liked the macaroni salad. And yes, scoop me some steamed veggies so I can at least pretend like I'm eating healthy. So was the wait worth it? Yes, only if you have some good friends to keep you company.

NOT dry at all! * corn on the cob- yummmy and sweeeeett corn * fried- it was soggy since it was sitting with the BBQ chicken but I like soggy fries so it was yummy!! over all, my stomach was satisfied with everything. Be sure to get there early or you will be waiting in line for about 2 hours (this is worst than boiling crab! lol ) we got there before the restaurant even opened and the line was already wrapped around the corner. So, we got to go and went back to our hotel room to eat.

Almost at a 5. So i had the Baby Back and Chickless Half n Half with a side order of fries. The Good Part: Ribs were pretty good, but not AMAZIING but pretty friggen up there. and the Chicless BBQ Chicken Breast Pieces were hella tasty as well. i LOVED the fries. However, there was too much of their BBQ sauce that it just got everywhere. i'm not a fan of mixing my fries with the BBQ sauce. it was far too sweet for me to handle. another thing, the fries got all soggy once it touched the BBQ sauce so that was unpleasant. but the rest was pretty good. i would give it a 4.3 but its too low to round upwards TRY THIS PLACE. either give yourself time to wait in line, OR come at some obscure time. I went on a Tuesday at 5PM

In San Diego, this is one of the best places for BBQ. I could do without the long wait, but I guess it beats driving to Texas. I will add, however, that if you've had BBQ in Texas, you'll probably be disappointed. Go in without too high of expectations and prepared for the long lines, and you're sure to be satisfied.

Mm, Phil's. It takes about 30-40 minutes of standing in line to get your order. You can check how big it is with their all seeing eye on their website. The beef ribs are probably the best value and easy to hold with one hand and de-meat with the other making drinking with a clean hand that much easier. The potato salad is the best side followed by the fries. And after one visit, you won't even need to wear a bib.

I came here a couple of months ago with my best friends, and I must say that I was certainly impressed. Getting there was an ordeal, as Dane Cook was at the SD Sports Arena and the freeway was JAM PACKED. After 45 minutes of waiting to EXIT the 8, we finally got onto Sports Arena and spent another 15 getting to the restaurant. Once at the restaurant, we stood in line for around 30 minutes before we were finally able to order. I ordered a FULL rack of PORK ribs and some onion rings. The onion rings were to die for. Battered onion rings are the shit. Don't give me that breaded crap unless you want a swift one to the face. This place really has the art of battered vegetables DOWN. It's not an easy task to get your batter just right and cook it at the perfect temperature. This batter adheres to the onion rings wonderfully and gives them a nice crunch. I'm drooling just thinking about it. I don't know if their other sides are really that wonderful - but I do know that the ribs were fantastic. I I have a problem with the fact that they're dry cooked and then slathered with sauce before they're served to you. I mean, the taste is great, but there's something about the meat having marinated in the sauce prior to and during the cooking process that makes a huge difference. The sauce here is good, but I do wish it was a little more cured onto the meat. Let us be honest, the half-hour wait to get in aside, my meal was fantastic. Let's be even more honest, I'm going to bitch regardless. They didn't have collard greens. WTF is BBQ without greens? Are you trying to piss me off? This is why I prefer Huffman's. Their bar area was closed off and a little more private. It was filled with your typical SD crowd, and I couldn't complain. They had a Êblueberry hefeweizen that was DELICIOUS. I even got the good girl to have a glass with us. The onion rings made all the difference in my evening. I don't know if I'll have the desire to come of my own volition, but if my friends invite me, I will certainly be delighted to return.

Ok some folks boasted best bbq ever.. I beg to differ if sauce is your main ingredient then this is probably the best bbq place by far, but without the sauce your biting into a tender no smoke, juicy but no flavor rib. I give em 4 if not 5 stars for customer service, food quality not so much, portions are huge which wut all carnivores look for but the quality was a bit low, ordered the combo baby back ribs and chicken with mac salad and fries. ribs ok just over sauced, chicken got dryer and dryer closer you got into the center of the meat again drowned in sauce.. went with a group a folks so we got to pick and taste a lil of everything sad to say if it were not for the sauce this place would be only 1 star, sauce should not make the meal, the meat should haha, sorey been jaded by baby blues bbq in SF a measuring stick for all bbq I eat so far only only one comes close Gorilla BBQ in Pacifica other then that so sad this spot didn't measure up with all the hype.. food *** service **** 1/2 excellent service ambiance *** eh restuarant layout, seats, chairs, sauces, wetnaps haha

My brother: "Hi, can we make a reservation?" Hostess: "No, we don't take reservations. But don't worry, its a good night because we're really SLOW tonight. Come on in." My brother: "ok, great. Thanks." So, we get there and there's a line 10 feet out the door! This is slow?! haha. I guess one time the line was so crazy that it wrapped around the block! You know you got the right place when you hear about lines like these AND you see stickers on the windows from YELP and BEST BBQ IN THE CITY. The line actually went quite quickly and we had our seat in minutes. They give you a buzzer and you go up and grab your food when it buzzzes. Your ribs, chicken and sides ooooze with BBQ sauce and come on a circular plate with sides. They give you a 'Bone Plate' where you can toss the bones you've sucked dry. And they have a whole roll of paper towels for the mess. You're gonna need them! We ordered the 'Best of Both Worlds' baby back ribs and 1/4 of a chicken plus we got corn on the cob AND a gimundo pile of fresh fresh onion rings. I cannot begin to describe how delectable those hot crunchy rings were. I usually try and NOT eat deep fried items but could not pass up on this treat! Use the malt vinegar and ketchup! The ribs and chicken come absolutely smoothered in BBQ sauce. The sauce is thick, slightly sweet but has a great TANG! to it. I probably could drink just the sauce. When you bite into the meat, it just falls off the bone. Its as if the bone was put there just for you to hold up the meat. The sauce gets ALL over your face, on your fingers, on your shirt and in your mouth! But don't use your fork or knife, hands are the only utensils. I don't think i could have this very often because I'd get super fat but will save it for a special treat for when I go down to visit my brother. Great place, with a great atmosphere, a helpful and friendly staff and best of all, speedy service.

Just a great place all-around...I've been coming here for the last few years. It's one of the few places in San Diego that take tremendous pride in their food, and the quality definitely shows. The service is good, the food is good, and the experience is complete. Even though the line might be long on weekends, you won't be disappointed with the food. Since it's BBQ, you have to order the ribs...personally I prefer the baby back ribs to the beef ribs, but that's open to decision. The BBQ chicken was good also, and it wasn't too dry like most places I've been to. My favorite at Phil's has to be the onion rings though...best onion rings I've had in a long time...so I get them every time I come here. Well-deserving of 5 stars.

BBQ is delicious. ÊI always get the broham sandwich with the coleslaw on the side. ÊThey give you more meat and more coleslaw this way! ÊRibs are awesome, Chicken is good, but sometimes dry, El toro sandwich is ok but dry, Onion Rings are yummy. ÊAll the other side dishes are good, but not great. PROS: Quick Service, Take Phone Orders, Has a bar CONS: Gets super busy

It seems I am an utter Johnny-come-lately as a San Diegan who has lived here 23 years of my life and never once been to Phils. ÊA coworker suggested we try them for take-out for lunch yesterday, and after perusing their menu online I ended up just getting what he got. Boneless ribs and chikless chicken, aka a big order of boneless meat and chicken BBQ and covered in delectable BBQ sauce. The sauce was sweet, tangy, peppery, and a multitude of other things I wont' waste space by listing. I called in and ordered, the person who took my order was very helpful and friendly. I arrived and paid, and was pleased to see that they bag your order after you arrive to preserve freshness. My fries were delicious and piping hot, my potato salad used red potatoes YUM!! I could barely eat half of all the food they gave me, (even though I really wanted to) and I was delighted to enjoy the meal again the following day and noticed that like good spaghetti sauce, the BBQ sauce got even better after a day in the fridge. The parking was ample and off-street, the to-go process is quick, and every one of their staff was friendly and helpful and had smiles on their faces. I will be back as often as I allow myself the indulgence. I have to watch my girlish figure after all!

When you think of BBQ you don't really think of San Diego as the place where delicious BBQ exists, but when most San Diegans think BBQ, they think of Phil's! Lines are always long and the wait can be quite lengthy, but I promise it's worth it... The meats, the sauce, the side, oh my...I mean, really, OH MY! To say it's delicious is an understatement and while I'm writing this I am literally salivating on my keyboard. (Ew.) My favorite side is the mac salad...typically I'm immensely disappointed with most place's mac salad, but true to form Phil's mac salad is delish and I could eat the entire LARGE side myself...As for the meats...it's ALLLLLLLL gooooooooooooood. Do yourself a favor and do BBQ like a true San Diegan.

OMG i could've died and gone to heaven right then and there! This place is GOLDEN. I had the combo plate of pork ribs and the chicken. SOOOOO good. This place is barbeque done right and for the right price. The side dishes I got were fries and the macaroni salad - both delish. I normally don't like barbeque sauce, but Phil's sauce was a homerun out of the park. I used my fries to get every last bit of sauce left on my plate. The way this place works is that you line up, order and then find a seat inside somewhere. The restaurant has plenty of room and the wait wasn't terribly bad, especially if you're with good company. If I lived in SD, I'd be obese from eating here everyday! 5 stars...there isn't one bad thing I can say about Phil's. Keep the good food coming, guys.

There's very few words to be said about Phil's. That's the beauty of it. All I can really say is: AMAZING. DELICIOUS. FULFILLING. EPIC. Okay, maybe EPIC is taking it a bit too far, but Phil's BBQ is a must-go establishment in San Diego. First thing you'll probably see is that there is a humongous line that wraps around half the restaurant. Fortunately, I've never waited more than 45 minutes in that line, even when it became astonishingly long. And great food is worth waiting for. Patience is key! But the other option is that you can come after 8 PM and the line will be a lot shorter (probably more like a 10-15 minutes wait instead). Everything on the menu is awesome. The only thing I would suggest staying away from is the chick-less, because every time the chicken Êhas been pretty dry (even though its slathered with BBQ sauce). But the baby back rib meat slides off the bone as you ravenously go through each bone. The beefy ribs are massive and you will resort to barbaric tactics to tear off every juicy piece of meat. Even the sides are solid. I love the cole slaw and mac salad, but sometimes they do put a lot of excess mayo that tends to soak the entire plate. All in all, Phil's is a great place to bring your family and your friends. The people here sure seem like they love working there. They always have a huge smile on their face and sound enthusiastic to introduce you to BBQ nirvana. Service is awesome and attentive. They want to make sure no one is having a bad experience. And in my 10+ times here, I've always had a great time. 5/5

BBQ sauce? good Beef ribs? good Baby back ribs? good Chicken? good What's not to like? ÊI've only been there on weekdays around lunch and the wait is usually 15-20 minutes, but it's always worth it. ÊI always get the baby back ribs, then eat the rest of my party's food. I had to knock off a star because I'm not fond of the fries and onion rings. ÊFries a little too plain and onion rings were a little too oily. ÊAlso, Adam from Man vs. Food may have gotten the tri-tip sandwich, but almost everything else on the menu beats that. Come here hungry and in scrubby clothing because it can get messy!

BBQ, BAR-B-QUE, etc. However you say it, it's all the same thing. I have been going to Phil's since if was located at a shack and still coming back. You can sometimes catch Phil hanging out once in a while and even talking to his customers. When I went here the small restaurant it originally was at could not handle the amount of people it does not in a week! The menu is not that long but that's because it doesn't need to be. Everything I've tried there has been delicious. My favorite thing there is the baby back ribs; a lot of people say fall off the bone good but Phil's is fall off the bone plus just tears away with your fingers! The ribs are just plain tender, juicy, and did I say DELICIOUS? No matter larger or small the fries are served to feed a family. A little tip is ask for a little extra sauce when picking up your food to dip your fries in to make it that much more good. My second favorite dish is the pulled pork sandwich. All because it is a sandwich don't think it is any more cleaner. It is loaded with meat and sauce just as much as a fat kid would like. If I had to die, I'd eat phils beforehand.

Best BBQ Ever! These are by far the best ribs I've ever had. ÊNo ribs can compete after you've eaten here. ÊYou gotta get the baby back ribs, some onion rings, and a good beer (preferrably an Arrogant Bastard by Stone Brewery). Ê This place can get really busy, so it's best to go in the middle of the day around 3pm. ÊOtherwise, you might be waiting by the side of the building for atleast 45 minutes. ÊOne you're in, the service is very fast and friendly. Ê If you want to skip the whole line, you can call ahead for some take out and just pick it up and go. If you're in San Diego and have not eaten here, then you MUST!

Nobody does RIBS like Phil's!! {ORDER} * Full rack for 2 - juicy, tender, slips right off the bone!! (comes with 2 small sides, or 1 large side) * Chicken Tickler combo (comes with onion rings, cole slaw, and fries!) * Onion rings * Fries * Macaroni salad * Cole slaw {DON'T ORDER} * Burgers. The wait is not worth it!! It's a rib joint, so don't order something that they're not really known for! {SERVICE} Although everything is self-service, everyone is very friendly. They'll come by chat with you, take away your dishes, etc. {TIP} * Pour a side of the BBQ sauce and double, heck triple dip, your rib before popping it in your mouth! * Order first, ,then find yourself a table * Once you claim your table, get your dishes and utensils * Go during off hours, or else you're going to be waiting in a long line!

San Diego isn't known for it's BBQ, but there are a few places that don't bring shame to the term "BBQ". All their meats have that pink smoke ring and are extra meaty. Compare to most midwest or southern BBQ joints some of the sides are lacking in creativity and flavor. Don't get the fries, it's not that they aren't good, but you get your BBQ and you dig in and by the time you realize how good the meat and you see other food on your plate is the time the fries are cold. The sandwiches are good, but the breads are subpar and the lines are long. If your a traditional BBQ enthusiast I'd stay away from the sauce, which for most people is good, but still overused. If you've got 1-2 people just belly up to the car as you can order from there rather than wait an hour or more. Where was the sweet tea also? The reason i gave this 4 stars and not 3 like the majority of the review would suggest is that the meat was very good and there was alot of it.

We came to Phils bbq wanting to try everything and I think we almost did. We had the beef ribs, baby back ribs, chick-less chicken, broham sandwich, onion rings and the last thing el toro sandwich. We loved almost everything! What we loved the most were the baby back ribs, chick-less chicken, and the onion rings. Besides the food being great we had awesome service by Tammie, one of the employees. I definitely recommend this place to everyone.

I've only had Phil's catering, so I can't speak for the line at their restaurant, but I know the scent travels alluringly down the block in Mission Hills. The catering was well done. They have a small fleet of trucks all decked out in flames to haul bbq equipment. They brought industrial strength paper plates, and kept the line moving smoothly. The bbq chicken was good, not overcooked and not oversauced. The baked beans were really tasty, sweet and tangy. The potato salad was good, too, no weird stuff in it. I'm not into fancy or unique potato salad, give it to me straight like mom makes! If I get cranky waiting in line at the restaurant, maybe I'll come back and dock Phil's a star, but for now, the food warrants four stars.

It's about time for me to write a review about Phil's. I've been coming here for about 3 years now, but I had a 6 month dry spell before I went here my most recent visit (which was last week). To begin, I'm not a huge BBQ fan, but even Phil's can satisfy my picky taste buds. I'm a huge fan of the baby back ribs, and I usually get a half-rack dinner with fries and macaroni salad. The sides are alright, they serve their purpose of taking a break of the overwhelming BBQ flavor, but they are nothing special. Having said that, the ribs here are super delicious. Really soft and super immersed with flavor, it's not a wonder why I always need to take a french fry break to calm my taste buds down. I feel like each time I come here, once the food comes out, conversation stops and everyone just digs into their fabulous ribs. I've also been getting the colossus onion rings each time I go here and they are pretty good. They are really big though, so if you're a fan of small fried onion rings that you can eat in one bite, you might not like these. Just a few other pointers: 1. The approximate wait time marker outside is a lie. Multiply it by 2 to get your real wait time. 2. Be prepared to get your fingers very very sticky. 3. The serving size is huge so try not to over-order (which I always do) 4. Stick to the ribs. I tried their tri-tip sandwich and it was a huge letdown. If you're a BBQ fan and you're in San Diego. It is a sin to not stop by Phil's BBQ.

EXCELLENT service/food/price! The wait staff always had on smiles and asked us a bunch of times if everything was good. One even came out to the lines and made some good conversation while we waited. I would say the pork ribs were on par with the ones I had in Tennessee!! That says a LOT!! I finished the baked beans and coleslaw, too. I'm not a huge fan of beef ribs but they were good as well. I would definitely come back and wait in line again if I have to. Otherwise, I'd just order takeout and get it much faster. I love the sink near the exit--such convenience! If you order out , don't forget to grab some bibs, wet naps, and plastic utensils. The only thing this place is missing is some strawberry lemonade served in jars and biscuits with apple butter. mmmm

Saturday @ 5PM: Process - First: you line up. DO NOT claim a table without ordering because that's what we did...In that case, I suggested them to put the sign in the patio, not inside when we were about to order. - Second: you wait and wait and wait till you get inside to order, which took us an hr on SATURDAY. - Third: someone will seat you, pick up your food, and munch Food - For dinner combination, whether it's full or half rack, you get to pick 2 SMALL SIDES or 1 LARGE SIDE - Baby Pork Ribs: their ribs are 2 thumbs up, very tender. Love the sauce - Onion rings: it's humongous, the biggest onion rings you'll ever have in your life - Macaroni Salads: not too bad. It wasn't cheesey like most salads out there. - Fries: nothing special about their fries. Service: all the people there are really friendly. Their service is another 5 stars right there. Even the mister that Êkicked us out the table (we got a table without ordering) was nice.

For the hype, length of wait and amount you pay for what you get, they're okay and would probably get three or three and a half stars. ÊI'll go for some bbq with friends b/c they want meat slathered in bbq sauce, large, oily onion rings and what not, but I would never come here on my own or for a "date" or highly recommend this place to anyone. The first time I came here, I probably waited about an hour and a half to order and only got a fountain drink and ribs. ÊThe ribs are pretty good and decently sized, but nothing spectacular nor worth the hype or wait that I had to endure - maybe my expectations were too high for waiting as long as I did. ÊMaybe if there was no wait, I'd come here for their saucy ribs. ÊThey also have sandwiches. I've only tried the pulled pork "broham" which is pretty good but a bit too saucy (too much sauce but not enough flavor with the meat which I felt the sauce was used to compensate) for me. Ê Given that I've only been here two to three times and only tried their ribs, cole slaw, onion rings and pulled pork sandwich (which are supposedly their best/most popular items), I may be willing to go back to try something else if I have friends that really, really want to try it out and I don't have to wait in line. Portion size is decent, though I was a tad disappointed with the ribs. ÊThe place is nice and clean, set-up is great (serves the needs and purposes of a busy bbq restaurant) service is good and the staff is friendly - when I went to meet up with friends but was not able to make it before they ordered, my friends told the cashier and I was able to go straight to the cashier so I could order and receive my food not too long after my friends ordered. If you ask me, I'd say with the service and restaurant as a whole deserves four stars, but for the wait and food alone, probably just three to three and a half.

The BEST barbeque restaurant I have ever tried. No one measures,up to Phils. The barbeque sauce is unique and mouth watering. I also recommend trying the onion rings and fries with their house ranch mixed with Phils barbeque sauce. That is delicious! The portions are great, and the price is even greater! At times you have to wait in line, but it is definetly worth it. The lines go by rather quick, and their friendly staff always offers a smile and will talk amongst customers.

BEST BBQ, hands down. I don't even like BBQ! But annoying to have to wait 45 min every time. The Place - Always boisterous, indoor and outdoor seating as well as a bar area. Nothing remarkable.. The Service - Hit and miss. They're usually friendly, but always busy.. sometimes forgetful. Well, it's not gourmet, whaddaya want? The Food - What hasn't been said? This place is amazing! The line SUCKS, and always will, but you do what you gotta do. Recommended - ÊLadies, one place you can eat BBQ with utensils: the meat DOES fall off the bone. ÊBaby-back is amazing! Give the beans (side) a chance, even if you don't like beans.. ooh, so good. I can't think of anything on the menu I DON'T recommend...except maybe the chicken- why get chicken at a BBQ place??

YOU MUST TRY THIS!!!! Since this place got over 1000 reviews, I knew I must try it during my trip to San Diego. The Baby Back Ribs were sooo good! The meat was soo soft and just ripped apart from the bones. This was seriously the best BBQ I've ever tried. My friends and I shared the full baby back ribs and we were full afterwards. But I think we could've eaten more. We got the large french fries, but couldn't finish them. The price isn't too bad either. For a full sized, it costed like $19. The wait for this place took around 40-50 minutes but it felt faster. The service was great =] I really wanted to bring some back home before I leave! I really wish we have one in San Francisco.

This is the place to go to for BBQ in San Diego. Why? Who else would have a sign outside near the parking lot indicating how long it takes to get to the front of the line. Just like the theme parks when you wait in line for a ride. Seriously good BBQ. The COO of our company (a native Texan) loves this place so much, he had Phil's cater some of our employee events. That's how I found out about this place (when it was still in Hillcrest). The baked beans alone are good. FOOD: You can't go wrong with anything here. There's even a decent number of drinks to choose from. SERVICE: Always friendly! But the line can get long. Tip: Don't go during dinner rush. Show up a little before 8pm.

Get the beef ribs from here!!! Plenty of meat and it falls so perfectly off the bone. I'm not a big fan of bbq or lots of meat, but this place makes me crave it at times. The lines go by pretty quickly and the workers are so super friendly. It's like they love their lives so much just by working there or something!! I usually get the beef tickler. 1 rib, 2 onion rings, fries and cole slaw and I can never finish it. I just love the quality of the meat and how it's cooked to perfection. However, I'm not totally crazy over it because I find it too tangy for my taste. I wish it was a bit sweeter hence the 4 stars.

I really hate to give Phil's BBQ 3-stars, but after much thought, I had to lower my star rating. Let me start off my saying, I am a true Phil's Fan (even from their OG location when not that many ppl knew of Phi's BBQ). I even used to order Phil's togo and take it to the library during finals week hahha. I would get nasty stares from other students as I chomped on my ribs + sides on the 7th floor of Geisel haha. Oh well. Their pork ribs are by far the best, I prefer them over the beef ones even after a few of my friends have said the beef ones are better. I found them to be dry and lacking flavor. The OG location had the best ribs, delicious, fall-off-the-bone tender and foodgasmic in yo mouth! After Phil's relocated to their current location, they were still just as good, but sad to say, I feel Phil's has lost their touch (hence the sad review of 3 stars). I tend to blame it the long lines and it getting more popular. The last 2 times I had Phil's, my ribs were burnt, and not as juicy and tender. I think instead of slow roasting it, they prob just char it and try to cook it as fast as possible in order to please the hungry customers (can't blame them, right?). Don't get my wrong, I LOVE PHIL'S BBQ! I will come back when I'm in SD and have that rib craving! Service + staff Ê- always friendly and helpful. Parking is never a problem. If you want to avoid the long lines during rush hour, I recommend to phone in the order and pick it up (tastes just as good). They have a bar area w/friendly bartenders + tv's to watch sports. Things to get: pork ribs (full rack), potato salad, corn, beans, french fries, tri-tip sandwich (super huge), and some delicious warm bbq sauce on the side!

With well over 2,000 positive reviews I was saying the same thing you are thinking: "How the Hell can it be that good? It has to be all hype". Yes, I heard about this place on the Food Network (which can sometimes lead you wrong), but I just had to try this place for myself. Even if it meant waiting in line for 20 minutes to order. The bottom line is this: Phil's BBQ makes WITHOUT A DOUBT the best f-ing tri-tip sandwich I have ever had in my life!!! I seriously do not have the time to describe in detail how flavorful this thing is. It is called the "El Toro" and ya kinda have to try it! As an added bonus, the onion rings just so happened to kick ass too! This place is worth all the hype.

Yelp says a 3 star rating is A-OK. ÊI say it's JUST OK. Ê2.5 stars. I didn't care for the sauce. ÊThe baby back ribs were not fall off the bone tender. ÊThe sweet baked beans were also decent. Ê Dreaming of Dream Land BBQ which my friend tells me is the stuff...well that dreams are made of.

Went here on a friend's recommendation on places to eat in San Diego. It was also close to Sea World, which was where we were heading, so it kinda worked out. The line is super long. There's even a webcam showing the line. From what I understand, you order then just find a spot to sit. However, we had a group of 20, so they gave us patio seating outdoors. (I think you can do this if you have a group of 7 or more.) The patio had TVs mounted, showing sports. Perfect. Now to the BBQ. Let me say that I have never had good beef ribs before. They always end up overcooked and tough without any flavor. I got the beef ribs because my friend recommended them. They were the best beef ribs I ever had. I also had a chance to try the babyback pork ribs. They were also very excellent. For sides, the cole slaw was ok. I'd probably pass on the beans though. I got the onion rings, which were excellent and HUGE. I recommend giving them a shot. There's also free refills on the fountain sodas. The staff there was also pretty awesome. When they came to pick up our finished plates, they provided toothpicks and wet naps. The place also provides bibs, if you're that messy with your ribs. The lines here a long and with good reason. If you're in SD, give this place a try!

The ratings speak for themselves guys, and it definitely lives up to all the hype!!! Like everyone else said, you cannot go here without trying their baby back ribs! The chicken is also good but not nearly as amazing. Don't let the wait discourage you, it's worth it.

MmMmMmM. Phil's definitely has some good eats. I usually stick with my favorite old faithful (the el toro) but if I'm starvin' like Marvin, I'll order the ribs. The sides aren't the greatest, so I usually just pickup the main entree and grab those elsewhere. The only reason Phil's gets a 4 out of 5 stars is because I wish they still had the Mission Hills location. I remember when they first opened this place, several employees stated over and over that they were going to eventually re-open the Mission Hills place (and it was even on their phone recording). Obviously they haven't and had no plans to. I understand you gotta go where the money is but I know I am not as regular customer as I was before due to the Sports Arena spot and how far it is from my local stomping grounds.

There's something extremely magical about Phil's BBQ. I remember the first time I dined at this fine establishment. The very first bite I took of those crazy tasty ribs overwhelmed me with powerful flavor. So amazed was I by the sheer deliciousness, my past 1000 lifetimes flashed before my eyes in an instant, but none of those memories could top that first bite. Only 1 bite and I was already in ecstasy. My eyes lay upon the entire plate of ribs, a mountain of coleslaw, and a sea of crispy golden french fries. I knew this expedition would be most excellent in every way, and upon its end, paradise awaited. Who can claim they've experienced nirvana, the whole of the universe existing in their very being? The answer: the men who have dined at Phil's BBQ. Because the portions are so ridiculously gargantuan, the very task of consuming an entire plate of ribs likens to swallowing everything that ever was and will be. Kingdoms will fall. Empires will rise. History is always changing. But if one entity deserves to last throughout all eternity, Phils is most deserving of such prestige. Long live Phil's BBQ!!

I'm going to buck the trend here and admit that I don't find Phil's all that great. ÊMaybe it's because I frequently smoke a big fat pork butt or beef brisket in my own backyard pit. ÊMaybe it's because I've had really good Q around the country. ÊI don't know. Ê I do eat there, but mostly because friends want to go. ÊTo me, Phil's is like the Wonderbread of BBQ. Take a recent lunch. ÊThe ribs did fall of the bone, but then that's not really tough to accomplish. ÊThe trick, is to keep just enough body to give them a nice snap. ÊThe meat itself was pretty bland. ÊNo spice, no smoke, nothing. ÊIt's as if they parboiled them, gave them a quick grilling, and then slathered on the sauce. ÊAnd as for the sauce, it's too sweet for my taste and I'd prefer a little more back-of-the-throat heat. ÊYeah, I know. ÊThat's a personal preference. ÊAnd that's why I typically serve dry and then let my guests choose the sauce from several. ÊAt Phil's, there's one sauce. ÊIt's sweet. ÊAnd it's often applied excessively. Along with the ribs came two onion rings. ÊBland onions and bland battering. ÊThe cole slaw is rough cut, a bit on the dry side, but overall not bad. ÊThe fries, however, aren't very good. ÊToo limp and undercooked. The portions are large here and the place is almost always packed, so it's obvious that lots of people enjoy the food. ÊFor me? ÊEh.

For being on the West Coast and in San Diego this is some darn good BBQ. Ê A few months ago I woke up craving BBQ - so I got online to see if any places even existed out here - saw Phil's online - so we checked it out, so glad we did! The line is long... But so worth it... If you sit at the bar you usually don't have to wait as long (why do I give out all of my secrets...??). ÊAnd that is where we always end up so we can have a pitcher of Heifenweizen to wash down the spicy BBQ. ÊThe french fries are yummy too, they remind of In N Out in a way... and we always get their coleslaw for a side too... The peeps that work the bar are always entertaining and the service is great!

*Lines and wait time --- Ridiculously fast for a BBQ joint, Order first then pay, find a seat ( we sat a group of 10 easy on a saturday afternoon) and waited no more than 10 minutes for our food (that's like Chinese restaurant status folks!) *Food --- Large portions. Sauce was not too overwhelming and barbeque-y for the occasional bbq eater. ÊCant go wrong with the half and half combo is my advice. * Sides --- I base the quality of the bbq joint based on sides they offer and hands down Phil's has the best MAC salad. From the mayo amount to the size of the macorni, everything was just in harmony. ÊOnion rings are a must get! batter tasted sweet, and the onions I swear felt like 1cm thick. *Service --- Cashier was cool, understood that i was a noob here and held up the line deciding what to get but she didnt rush me at all. ÊThe table cleaning lady was super fast. The second a guest left, she stormed right to clean up , put our tables together for our large group and called us over. Ê=*) I Value great service. Bottom line: ÊPhils pwns Lucille's

The line was wrapped around the building. ÊAdvice: call in and pick up your order. ÊThat's what we did and the lady who answered the phone said 'Smart move!!'

Phil's has great BBQ... You can tell because the line goes around the corner. A couple friends took me on a Saturday night and we all got the beefy ribs. I'm very grateful that each table is supplied with a full role of paper towels. I definitely needed it. I tried the coleslaw and the potato salad. The potato salad was awesome... The coleslaw not so much. Minus a star for having to wait for over an hour. Next time I'm definitely calling in for pickup. It's not worth the wait on a Saturday.

WOW, Phil's...you're SEX in my mouth. MMMMMMMM I came down to SD this past weekend to visit some friends and they suggest that we try this place out. We came here around 7:30 pm on a Saturday night and WOW the line wrapped around the whole building...always a sign that the place is poppin` right? BTW PARKING SUCKS...lots...small ass narrow (that's what she said! haha) streets with limited parking spots. I was pretty worried about the wait, but my friend said it goes by pretty fast...and boy was she wrong! haha. We waited about 15 mins and we hardly even moved. We decided to just get it to go and head back to eat/pre-party :] We walked in and DAMN the place is huge + there is a bar in the back. There are a bunch of TV's around, but alllllllll of them were playing baseball...except the 2 in the bar playing the LAKERS game...I know it's SD and you don't have a team...but damn its the PLAYOFFS! Anyways, back on topic. I ordered the baby back ribs and chicken dinner combo w/large serving of fries ($13). ÊMy goodness was it fingerrrrrrrr licking delicious. The sauce is AMAZING, just the right amount of spice with bbq tangy-ness. Best sauce I have ever eaten! The meat on the ribs just feel right off and was so tender (& hot even after a 15 min drive home). I didn't think the chicken was going to be good, but I was impressed. The chicken was soft, moist, and juicy...just the way I like it hehe ;] The fries were good, except they were soggy by the time I got home, so it wasn't the BEST. I ate all the meat and about half the serving of fries and I was STUFFEDDDDDDDD. I absolutely love this place, the nice staff, and amazing MEAT!! I will be back forsureeeee. You just can't be the price and the quality/quantity of food you get! Food babiesssssss all day, everyday!

Yelp needs half stars. Let's be honest, this place is over-hyped. It is definitely not delicious enough for the 2 hr wait, thank god I have friends waiting ahead of time for me in the cold. JK that only happen once. A lot of people that go here are students its in the middle of like 3 universities and people love to go out and socialize. We're broke and hoping to spend less then 20 bucks on a decent meal; Phil's BBq answers that call. But there are plenty of other place. I feel like students who go here never tried BBQ anywhere else. I know the south hands down probably has the best BBQ but they don't even smoke the meat here. The BBQ sauce is average, you can taste their attempt to season it because there's a hint of cinnamon in the BBQ sauce. Thats right, the meat isn't smoked and it comes out to quick to believe that it is smoked. But I guess you can't blame them with the amount of traffic that goes through here. They have a deal called best of both. You either get 4 pieces of pork or 2 of Beef ribs and half a chicken. Ask for thigh and leg because the chicken breast is absolutely dry. For 11 bucks you get your fill. Or you can go get a full rack of beef or pork ribs for around 19 bucks. So not exactly cheap if you want your BBQ fill. While the sides here are good, they are not to die for. P.S. what type of place has ribs, but not spare ribs and a tri tip sandwich, but no TRI-TIP? I need to ask them that when I go there. The break down? 3 stars on food 3.5 stars on pricing 4 stars on Service Deduct a point for the 2 hr wait time So bottom line? Go here if you want to fill up your stomach with "the best of both" for 12 bucks. If you want BBQ? Go Vegas, the south, or better yet my personal favorite Lucille's BBQ

I am shocked that San Diegans got this one right! Waited in line for almost 2 hours. I kid you not. It was well worth the wait. Loved the baby back pork ribs. LOVED the beef ribs. L.O.V.E.D the onions rings. Yes, these are the best onions rings. Fries and baked beans topped my list of small sides. What else can I say? Other than, and I repeat, I am shocked that San Diegans got this one right! tip: If you need ranch or extra bbq sauce, ask for it when you get your food and not when you order. It saves you the few extra cents they would charge you.

Yes, I finally made it to Phil's new, mega pig pit on Sports Arena Blvd. Same FANTASTIC ribs and sandwiches, but I have to admit, I liked the cozy, crammed and tiny place on Goldfinch better. Just seemed like you were at a buddy's shack having a good time. The new place does have more space for the old "table turn", so I can understand the reasoning. Line can be long, but moves fairly fast. Besides, half the fun is smelling the smoke and wondering which bone to pick :) Well worth the travel time and the cost of gasoline to get to Phil's. Really is THE best Q in town. Enjoy!

I went there on Thursday Oct 8th just after 9pm. Ê Ordered a full rack of ribs (pork). I have been wanting to go here to see why there is always a line out the front door and sometimes around the side of the building. ÊThere was no line tonight! ÊI didnt realize that you ordered at a register and, then they gave you a number so that you food was delivered, but that works well for me. Ê The ribs were fine, not fantastic. ÊThere was black little crunchy burnt pieces on the outside of the ribs from it being bbq. ÊThe side orders were just ok. ÊI think they might have been from costco. ÊThe beans and potato salad were less than average and the garden salad seemed exactly like the mixed greens you get from costco with three slices of tomato on top. With an ice tea, my full rib dinner was about $24. Ê I was not crazy about the place period. ÊI did have high expectations based upon what I have heard on the street and those crazy long lines I see when passing by.

Our search for tasty BBQ finally brought us to Phil's one evening. I had heard about the popularity of this place, but NEVER could have expected the line that snaked around the building. Wha???? Well, we weren't in any hurry, so we decided to wait, entertaining ourselves with Nate's Charades iPhone App. (If you were in line with us that evening, yes, we are always that entertaining...) Finally, after about an hour and a half-ish of waiting, we entered Phil's, ordered, and DEVOURED. I had the Beef Brisket sandwich with the coleslaw on top; I can't remember what Nate had. Doesn't matter; I loved mine; so much I practically inhaled it. Maybe that's part of the ploy - you make people wait long enough, anything tastes good... Anyway, I must say that, having tried many a BBQ joint in America's Finest City, Phil's is at the top of the heap in my book. -1 star for the wait.

It really is everything you could want in a dining experience. No need to go into details, the hype is TRUE. I've been to Phil's several times (I have love handles to prove it) and it has always been an awesome experience. Sometimes a good product makes up for bad service. Take for example, a Mexican joint in the straight hood. You risk your life eating in the hood, the service never fails to disappoint, but the food is worth the suffering. At Phil's, not only is the food absolutely incredible, the service and atmosphere is always enjoyable. And you have one added bonus, it's not in the hood :)

Split the full baby back rib dinner w/ 2 small sides for $11/person (including tax and tip) and you got yourself a filling, delicious deal. Best ribs I ever had. I LOVE the fries here, and the coleslaw is especially fresh. All the workers here are friendly--even the bussers! The food usually comes really quickly (less than 10 min) but once we waited for 20 min (which would be typical for a regular restaurant) and they gave us a free batch of onion rings :D On the same visit, they were almost closing so they were handing out free coleslaw, since they throw out the leftovers every night. Lots of free stuff that evening (:

Got take-out a couple of weeks ago and it was, as the star rating says: meh. To start on a positive note, the call to place the order was very pleasant. ÊThe woman was very friendly and almost conversational; considering how busy the place was, she never sounded harried and i never felt rushed during the ordering process. ÊNot only did it make me comfortable on the phone, it also made me confident the the order was taken completely and correctly and not just scribbled on a bbq sauce-stained napkin that happened to be by the phone. I got the "chick tickler" -- which sounds vaguely dirty *giggle*. ÊIt was served in a standard 3-compartment foam take-out container. Ê One small compartment contained exactly 5 small chunks of admittedly tender chicken drowning in bbq sauce. The sauce is *ok* but has a heavy synthetic taste to it. ÊThe heat of it was interesting and unexpected, but was overwhelmed by smoke flavoring. ÊBy the line of people waiting to be seated that wrapped almost clear around the building, I'm wondering if they put trace amounts of cocaine in the sauce to keep people coming back for more, but I certainly wouldn't stand in line for hours on end to have it again. The other small compartment was filled with a fair-sized portion of slaw (can't comment on it cuz I'm not a fan of slaw so I didn't eat it). The third and largest compartment was absolutely packed full of limp, flavorless fries. ÊIt's bad enough they were almost inedible, but the portion size being over 5 times the amount of the chicken was an extra slap in the face. ÊOn top of the fries were two large onion rings; easily the best part of the meal. ÊThe breading is a bit over-done, but the onion inside is substantial enough to balance the breading. ÊI didn't feel I was biting into a ring of deep fried air like a lot of restaurants make them. This is actually the second time I've had food at Phil's; the first time I'd gone with a group of friends and ate in the dining room. ÊI wasn't terribly hungry, so I think I'd just gotten an order of onion rings. ÊI do definitely remember a very friendly and gregarious woman who walked around talking with everyone and making sure people were enjoying their meals.

It was raining, and about 5:00. I had read reviews about Phil's and decided to order out instead of taking my 91 year old mom out into the rain. I called my order in, and I am so glad I did. There was already a big line at 5 in the evening. The onion rings were awesome. I made the mistake of ordering the large order, and giving myself a bellyache because I ate so many. If I would have ordered the smaller order of onion rings, it would have been enough. I don't like to eat too much sugar, so I was able to get the BBQ sauce on the side for the ribs. That way, I didn't have to eat the sauce and my mom could add as much as she wanted. The ribs were great! The sides were good, too. For barbecue, and feeding the masses Phil's the way to go. The only potential problem I can see is being crowded, and having to wait in line. If you are starving, you may want to call your order in, and eat it in your car...

Really???? 2000+ reviews; 4.5 stars; 45 minute wait?!!!!!! I couldn't even imagine how these ribs could be THAT amazing...and I was right. After a long wait, I expected these ribs to be RIDICULOUSLY amazing. I was wrong...they were tasty, but not amazing. The sauce was fine and the meat was tender...but isn't that what all ribs are like? With the crazy lines I knew these ribs weren't' going to be drive. the sides were average (got the cole slaw and macaroni salad). Prices were above average. I will not be back again unless the line was super super short, but with this hype and all these reviews, I highly doubt that! ahha

Maaaannn... it seemed like everyone and their MOTHER had eaten at Phil's BBQ - Ê everyone except for Julius and me. ÊCould you blame us? ÊEvery time we drove by the place around dinnertime (starving), the line was wrapped around the building. One Sunday after bargain-hunting at Kobey's Swap Meet, we decided it was the perfect opportunity to see if Phil's BBQ would be less crowded. ÊLo and behold, it wasn't. ÊAs I walked towards the end of the line, I passed by a sign that read "25 minutes from this point." ÊWTF! ÊJulius then told me to check if there was open seating at the bar, so I bulldozed my way through the herd of people, with a Zen-like mindset. ÊI utilized the Law of Attraction and the Power of Positive Thinking to visualize two vacant seats at the bar, and like magic, in the midst of a sea of diners, Êa beacon of light shone over two perfect, empty seats as angels sang the Hallelujah chorus in the background. ÊSarcasm aside, I just couldn't believe my luck! I ordered the Pork Tickler which came with fries (that I doused with malt vinegar) and a really tasty coleslaw. ÊI've heard so many accolades about Phil's BBQ that I was pretty surprised that the meat on my pork ribs wasn't falling off the bone, and the BBQ sauce wasn't anything special. ÊStill finger-lickin' good nevertheless. ÊJulius ordered the Beef Tickler, apprehensive at first because the menu said it came with only one rib. ÊTo his delight, this one rib was like a big brontosaurus rib straight from the Flintstones! Adding to Phil's lively atmosphere was a flamboyantly fun friend from high school that we happened to bump into at the bar. ÊHe and his motley crew of friends kept the Sangria and the slurring that accompanied it flowing. Ê"Sunday Funday!!!" they kept toasting. Phil's BBQ was a fun time, atmosphere scoring higher than the food. ÊNow that we've finally eaten there, we can cross it off the list. ÊYeah, yeah, we may have been the last people in SD to go to Phil's, but you just try beating me at my mad seat-snaggin' skillz... Word to ya MUTHA!

Heck yea I'm a fan! Come on its Phil's. Granted the line gets pretty damn long but you can't say you didn't know cause everybody knows when you go to Phil's expect to wait. And if you didn't know well now you do. You can always go on-line and check out their live cam that shows how long the line is. I think it is worth the wait when those juicy, meaty, tasty ribs make its way in front of you mmm... :) I have ordered the beefy rib dinner (finger licking good!). You can order 5 bones or 3 bones. It includes 2 small sides or 1 larger side. I order 3 bones with either 1 large side of fries or small fries and a small macaroni salad. I have also ordered the el toro sandwich it is thinly sliced tri-tip covered in bbq sauce. They put so much meat you can ask for an extra bun and share with someone or take it home. I have tried the bbq cheeseburger and I thought it was pretty good but I prefer the el toro. The colossal onion rings are tasty. I can only eat like 2 of the onion rings I recommend sharing. I'm not much of a fan of the chicken it was a tad bit dry maybe it was a bad batch. Tip know what you want to order before getting to the register gotta keep the line moving, so listen to the employee at the podium haha. They are not trying to be rude they just want everyone to get served. The employees are nice so just be patient and enjoy the food.

First of all, if you like to stand in a line for up from 30 min. to an hour or several hours, then Phil's BBQ's extensive waiting line will not aggravate you. Not only that, but when I got to eat their so-called famous BBQ ribs, I found out how pathetically overrated they turned out to be. Considering how much red sauce they pour on in piles on your meat, you can't even taste the ribs, only the disgusting sauce. Sure the sauce was good, but would you guzzle down a whole bottle of BBQ sauce or ketchup? It was crowded, food was ruined with sauce trying to mask away the taste of the meat, and the service was so-so. The only thing I'd say that was good about Phil's BBQ, is that they have take-out boxes for you to grab as many as you like, which I thought was convenient, but I didn't grab any because I didn't want to have anymore of their food as leftovers. Overall, an overrated restaurant that is only popular by their name, not their food. Give it a try if you dare, but if not, go and taste the best BBQ in town which is 'Pinnacle Peak'!.

I visited here with my wife because we heard a lot of good things about Phils. I went to the hillcrest or northpark one. The line was out the door so I had really high expectations of this place. However, Phils did not deliver for the following reasons. The wait was terrible and we had a difficult time getting a seat. This made me more hungry than usual. This usually mean the food will taste even better. It didn't. We ordered the pull pork sandwich with coleslaw. The bun and meat etc wasn't what I expected. The ribs were okay but somewhat dry and the sauce was nothing special either. I felt like I was cheated somehow and lied to. It was more on the pricey side also. I guess I have been spoiled by the Wrangler in El Cajon and Everett's and Jones in SF. I originally rated Phils 3 stars but as I was writing this review and thinking back about my experience, I got pissed off and downgraded them to 2 stars. I am not coming back.

I think Phil's is letting me down slowly. Don't get me wrong, I will always love getting my BBQ here, the sauce is what keeps everyone coming back for more. But lately, the meat they've been serving me, is really not all that great. It doesn't easily come off the bone. I have to chew my way in = messy messy. And I've been getting several burnt pieces. Uncool. And also, too many people know about this place so you can expect to wait at least 45min if you come on a weekend night. I don't think it's worth it though. However the service continues with 5 stars. Don't miss your chance to talk to Kenny, he's the cool and funny guy whose over 6 ft. tall, you really can't miss him. You're lucky if he's your waiter! And everyone else is just as friendly. They always look so happy!

Yum! Phil's has some of the best BBQ sauce I've ever had. It's sweet, creamy and goes great with just about everything on the menu. I tried: the BBQ Broham: pulled pork piled high on a toasted bun, smothered with the sweet goodness of Phil's BBQ sauce. I think it's best to order the cole slaw on the side, but you can have it on the sandwich too. the El Toro: tri tip BBQed to perfection, overflowing the bun and covered with its own BBQ sauce. I noticed this sauce was different from the BBQ sauce on the Broham, but it was just as good. Fries: only $1.25 for a small order of fries but it satisfied FOUR of us in addition to our giant sandwiches. Why Phil's is fun: -they have GREAT customer service, so the long line is no big deal. -they give you a free Phil's BBQ pen :) -Extra ranch and BBQ sauce is free -there's a bar where I've heard the sangria is amazing--I had to drive back to LA that night so drinking for me was a no-go. Parking looks like it can be an issue depending on when you go (even though they have a large lot). I've also heard the line can wrap around the building.

My mouth is just watering thinking of their ribs right now. The 2hr wait is worth it. Bring a snack stupid.. if you're hungry and can't wait the wait... then get out of line or dont come. Its expected to wait a long time before actually sitting. However, they are VERY organized about it. Phil (well, a person that worked there) came up to my party (15 people) and asked how many we had and had our table ready when we all finished ordering. Ive noticed there is NO wait after a certain time. I now wait till that time to go so i can just walk in... munch... and boogie happy and full :)

I even wrote to Phil's and asked them if they could open more locations; I really hope they do it. I'm thinking about driving back down to SD just to get these again...!

Wow! ÊI had been wanting ribs for awhile and the only place that I can even think that is worth the money is Phil's. I went here this afternoon and it was just so great I had to share on Yelp. I like beef ribs and not many places have them, or if they do they just don't taste good. ÊAt Phil's the beef ribs are amazing. ÊThe meat, the sauce-everything! ÊMy husband eats pork ribs and he says the same thing. ÊCompletely tender and tasty. Lots of meat on the bones. Ê The sides are yummy too-baked potato, corn on the cobb, cole slaw, potato salad. Ê The only downside is that it can be a long wait to get in. So much so that I don't go there when it's typical dinner hour. ÊBut...they have a live cam on their website, where you can see how long the line is. ÊThe line goes pretty quickly though, so even if it's outside, you may not have to wait for too long. They aren't open for a couple weeks during the Christmas and New Year times, which doesn't make sense to me (although I saw a sign that their new San Marcos location will be open). The best! I can't think of a better place to go for ribs and can't wait for the next time I go!

ÊWe ordered baby back ribs, beef ribs, beer battered onion rings, cole slaw, steamed veggies and caesar salad. ÊThe beef ribs were a bit on the dry side for me, sauce has a little kick to it. ÊThe kids seem to like the baby back ribs. ÊThe onion rings were probably my favorite thing that we ordered. ÊReally crispy, crunchy and had a nice size piece of onion.

I miss you, Phil's Sports Arena! I used to work right around the corner and haven't been back since, only because of the distance. Lunch here was a weekly routine and never disappointed. We learned to call our order ahead of time since there is ALWAYS a lunch rush, no matter what day of the week. However, the BBQ chicken is delish and I can't shovel their fries in my mouth fast enough. Sometimes I would be "healthy" and order a side salad instead of the fries, and even that was great, with a tangy raspberry vinaigrette. I'm a simple girl who likes simple food, and Phil's delivered every time.

I went to Phil's BBQ on a Friday night, that was a bad idea! Packed with lots of people, meaning they have really good food. They also have this new rule that you have to order your food first then find a table to sit at or else an angry black woman will chase you out of your table. So remember to order then find a seat! I got the full rack of ribs with fries and potato salad. The only thing that I didn't like was the potato salad. The ribs are really good along with the BBQ sauce.

Okay so I think if you read enough reviews of this place you'll find that there are two camps, those who love this place for what it is, namely a pretty damn tasty bbq joint in San Diego. Or there are those who hate it for what it isn't, namely, their mom/dad's BBQ in Tennessee. To be sure, there are some things I would change, and I've only had the Broham (pulled pork sandwich) and the Toro (steak). Both are really tasty; whether or not they qualify as southern BBQ is not for me to judge, since I've never had southern BBQ. However, I do recognize that the BBQ sauce is really vinegary and that the meat lacks a bit of seasoning, so to that end, because of it's simple menu and mission statement I'm dropping it a star. Other than that, To the people who give poor reviews: you are expecting an eskimo to make the best chorizo, it's not going to happen, and it shouldn't either.

Since appearing on Man vs. Food this place is packed all the time, everyday...but for good reason! The BBQ is of course fantastic, the ribs, the chicken, the sides, everything is pretty fantastic. Yet I was inspired to write a review to say how wonderful their service is. The no-nonsense order at the front of the line and grab your own table deal speeds things along as much as possible, but I found the staff roaming the seating area to all be so friendly and helpful too. Everything from clearing a table quickly so you can snag it, correcting any mishaps on your order or supplying handwipes and toothpicks when your meal is finished. Phil must be paying these guys well..and rightly so. Just be prepared to wait in line...it's worthwhile!

I need to preface this with the fact that I lived in Texas for five years and have had BBQ in both Dallas and Austin, so I may be a little picky about my pork. ÊSo to speak. That said, I really enjoyed my meal at Phil's. I ordered the BBQ Broham which was a pulled pork sandwich topped with coleslaw on a giant whole grain bun. ÊI also had a side of sweet baked beans. The sandwich was enough to feed 3 people (I've still got at least a half-pound of pork in my fridge). ÊI pulled off half the meat and tried to eat the sandwich, but not only was it just too big, the bun wasn't all that. ÊIt was kind of tough and bland, so I skipped the bun and used my fork to munch on the pulled pork, which was tender and delicious! The coleslaw was good - fresh n' crispy, could have used a slight kick. Ê The baked beans weren't memorable, though... I didn't even finish them. ÊThey weren't bad, just didn't make an impression on me. The sauce was sweet and slightly spicy... good, though I have had better BBQ sauce. ÊI know people can throw down over BBQ sauce, so I really can't say on a scale of sauce how good it is. ÊIt could be award-winning for all I know. ÊI'd eat it again, so it couldn't have been crap. That's the best I can tell you about the sauce. I did have an onion ring from someone else and that was quite good. They were those big-as-your-head size onions with an inch-slice, battered (not breaded) and deep fried. ÊIf you want a heart attack, bad breath and deliciousness all in one food, go for the onion rings. I also had a bite of corn, which while good (how can you mess up corn on the cob?), it wasn't grilled, but boiled. So it was kind of flavorless and mushy, in my opinion. But my friend was really enjoying it so I didn't want to burst his bubble. The staff was attentive, bringing us extra sauce and whatever we needed. ÊThe guy at the counter where you picked up the food barked at us quite a bit, but I figure when you've got that many people asking where their macaroni salad is, you're bound to snap at some point. They cleared tables pretty quickly... which they had to because it was PACKED. We got there at 4pm sharp and by 4:15, there was a line hanging out the door and wrapping around the building. We *just* missed the rush. The atmosphere was similar to many of the BBQ joints in Texas, but it lacked a bit of that authenticity of those places. ÊIt had an ever-so-slight "chain restaurant" vibe to the decor inside, but I think that could just be because it's newer. It lacked that Êiron brands, dusty floor, down n' dirty cowboy feel. ÊYou order at the counter and then they buzz you to come pick up your food, though, which is a fairly typical set-up for BBQ places. Overall, was it the best BBQ I've ever had? ÊNo. ÊWould I go again? Totally! ÊI'd like to try some of their other menu items. ÊThere aren't a TON of BBQ joints in San Diego, so I'd say Phil's is your best choice for authentic southern BBQ.

Food: Thumbs up Service: Friendly Price: Reasonable, about $20 per person All our friends from SD or that have recently visited SD were raving about this place so we had to try it this time around. We had just come from a long day of walking around Wild Animal Park and the Beach so were waiting in anticipation for a belly full-o-BBQ that night. Alas, we arrived at 6PM and the line was out the door and around the building. We heard there was a concert at Sports Arena, hence the extra demand, but we waited FOREVER in that line. 1 hour and 30 minutes, to be exact. And then another 15 minutes for the food after ordering at the counter. What is worth it? I would say yes. We got a full rack of beef ribs and baby back ribs. I liked the baby backs better than the beef - the baby backs were tender and meaty with just enough fat and sauce. The sides included: 1. Corn on cob (nothing special, kinda dry and not that sweet) 2. Baked beans (nothing spectacular) 3. Coleslaw (highlight of the sides - probably the best coleslaw I've ever had. Lightly marinated with mayo, lots of fresh cabbage and other veggies). Look forward to going back, but hopefully we won't have to wait more than an hour next time!

I'm not usually a fan of BBQ, which is probably why I didn't feel the urge to drop everything and run there, but when I finally did make my way out to their new location, smelled the tantalizing aromas of roasted, bbq meat in the air and then sank my teeth into the most tender, moist and flavorful baby back ribs ever, I was hooked. Because we went at 2:30 pm, we only had to wait in line for 15 minutes. Normally, I'm told, the wait is longer and the line usually curves around the entire building and then some. Parking was a bit of a hassle, but we managed to find a spot in the nearby lots. While waiting in line, we were aided with large menu singage to help us make our decision. To ameloriate the chilly weather, they provide space warmers near the entrance. Once we got to the counter, we ordered the baby back ribs dinner, chicken dinner, the best of both worlds plate, a chicken sandwich, onion rings, and for sides we ordered fries, steamed veggies, and potato salad. We were given a buzzer to let us know when our food was ready. After about 15 minutes, our food was ready and that is when the flavored-packed, tender bbq meat eating session began! The baby back ribs were the best I've ever had, with the meat falling right off the bone. My only complaint was I didn't like the dark burnt pieces on the meat, which I picked out and left on the side. The chicken was also great, but not as good as the ribs. The fries were perfect to compliment the saucy and bold flavor of the bbq. The mixed veggies were also a pleasant surprise because of the good portions and that they were not overcooked - al dente. Service was also friendly and fast! Prices were reasonable - for 6 people we spent $55 (tip included). I loved that there was a sink to wash our hands when we were done, right next to the soda fountains. It was obvious that cleaniliness was also a priority here! The decor was also cool - a combination of sports bar meets country-western style. Overall, I had a great experience and enjoyed fantastic food. This is great for families, large groups or couples, a real charmer! Would ÊI Recommend It? Yes, I'll surely be back! Hee-haw!

1502 reviews...WOWZERS!! ÊMy friends and I rented a house at Ocean Beach for Memorial Day Weekend, and since I'm the only one from all 20 of us that Yelp, I was in charge of looking for places to eat. ÊAnd with all the reviews from this restaurant, this was a definite must try in SD. Ê We pretty much had a little of everything: baby back ribs, beefy ribs, BBQ chicken, steamed veggies, baked potatoes, & sweet baked beans. ÊMy favorite was the beefy ribs, and I mean BEEFY, fall-off-the-bone tender ribs! ÊMight I also add that they're huge! ÊI was pretty much a carnivore that day so I didn't try much of the sides. ÊBut I think I'll be dreaming of those BEEFY ribs for the days to come. ÊWe definitely need a Phil's BBQ in LA, or better yet, in the San Fernando Valley. Oh, and one last thing, we ate here Saturday, and because there was still food leftover, I was able to bring some of the beefy ribs & chicken back home to the Valley. ÊWe ate it for dinner last night...boy oh boy was it still finger lickin' good, oh yes it was!

Phil's is a San Diego institution and for good reason. They have awesome BBQ, and I've had Rudy's in Texas and Pieces in Virginia and so on. Long lines at lunch are best avoided by getting there before 11:30AM. We've used Phil's for catering as well, and the catering was on time, piping hot and delivered with great service. At the restaurant, get the El Toro. It's the best. I found it to be a little inconsistent though, sometimes really tender and others a little on the fatty/chewy side. Side dishes like corn on the cobb and moon pies are overall good quality, but the buttermilk onion rings are amazing as long as you get them while their hot. Parking is tough if you go during peak hours, so carpool if you're taking a crowd there.

I was firm believer that nothing beats homade bbq. Umm...I has to go 500 miles away from home in Sacramento to be proven wrong. The baby back ribs and onion rings were straight up the best I've ever had. TO FRICKEN DIE FOR! I am sooooo sad there is not one of these back home, I would be eating there on the REG. I would actually like to propose marriage to Phil, so that our newfound union may never be broken. Fairwell, my sweet sweet Phil, till we meet again my love...

It' s in the magical sauce! Met Phil tonight and that man is as sweet as can be. I have only been to Phils twice and both times have been a wonderful experience. I ordered from the best of both worlds and that is no lie. I had the beef rib & chicken dinner with a side of baked beans and macaroni salad. I love the fries here but decided to try something else. I don't know what Phil does to those beef ribs but they are truly way more wonderful then the baby back I know most would disagree but the super meaty rib meat came right off the bone and was super succulent. I have never had a beef rib that great in my LIFE!! I didn't get to taste my chicken that looked superb because I was done after finishing both super tasty sides and my 2 beef ribs. Organic tropical ice tea is the BEES KNEES!! I discovered a new trick tonight, if you could find a stool at the bar you can order without the wait of the long line for the dining area although it does go fast. Went in and we sat right away didn't have to wait more then 10 mins before we got our food. Our waiter was fast and made sure we had everything we needed. I can't wait for the new opening on Grand ave.

I hate you Phil. ÊYou and your delicious barbecue have cost me precious hours of my life that I will never get back. ÊEver! ÊAnd yet you would keep me coming back. ÊMaking the drive from god knows where; it could be anywhere in SD and if someone would utter the words "oh, I've never been to phil's" then, of course, it was on like Donkey Kong. ÊAnd then the wait when you get there... excruciating. ÊYou can see them grilling your ribs in that fantastic sauce, and the messy grins of the happy patrons that are seated and eating or were smart enough to order ahead. ÊSuch torture! Yet still, 5 stars. ÊIt's that good. ÊI would walk through hell and back for some Phil's. ÊA good choice if you're feeling indecisive is the Rib Tickler or the Chick Tickler (sounds dirty, don't it?). ÊYou get a takeout box full - literally FULL - of crispy fries, onion rings, yummy slaw, and three ribs or chunks of chicken for around $6.99. ÊIt's really a lot of food, and it's all so damn tasty! ÊThey are also nice enough to provide a handwashing station in the middle of the restaurant for dine-in guests.

I didn't really know much about Phil's when I tagged along with a friend and her mother on a trip to their favorite restaurant. ÊAfter scanning the menu, I picked out a chicken dish and a side of corn on the cob, filled up my soda, and sat down at the table to eat. Oh. ÊMy. ÊGod. Can we say heaven in all it's chicken-y goodness? ÊThe first bite of tender, perfectly cooked meat slathered with the tangy-sweet homemade barbeque sauce left me licking my fingers and wishing my stomach could pack in about four more of those meals (although reason stepped in and told me that if I gave into my cravings I would indubitably burst all over the restaurant booth). Ê Phil, you are a genius. ÊAn evil genius.

I don't really want to give Phil's 4-stars because a dinner there didn't incite a "Yay! I'm a fan" reaction in me, but peer pressure (1600+ reviews for this place!) bumps my rating up rather than down. FOOD // I ordered the Baby Back and Beef Rib Ticklers. Yes, it was good, but compared to the BBQ I've had before (Baby Blues in LA is fantastic), it isn't stellar. It's slathered in sauce, it's tender, everything is...good. Do my salivary glands start automatically go into overdrive when I think about their food? No. Am I counting the nickels and dimes in my piggy bank to save up for the next meal there? Nah. And: THEY DON'T HAVE CORNBREAD. WHAT. That's like a Chinese restaurant not serving rice. EXPERIENCE // The line! I think part of the reason people love this place so much is how desperate you get from hunger standing in line while staring at people eat, smelling the aromas, and fantasizing about the combo you're going to get. Denial makes the heart grow fonder. I do like the feel of the place. It's casual, familial, and I believe the manager/owner came by our table to say hello and make sure everything was going well. Good food. Good prices. Good is good, but with a line out the door and around the block, I wanted AMAZING and it just wasn't there. And I can't get over not having cornbread with my ribs. whuck ;(

We are from Los Angeles and we took a road trip all the way down there one Sunday afternoon just to try this place because it was recommended by Man v. Food host Adam Richman on his website. Man, was that trip worth it. ÊWe have never, I repeat, NEVER, had such good BBQ food. ÊMy boyfriend and his buddy are still saying how we need to take a trip down to our "Mecca". I don't know what you do to your food, but the drive all the way down to San Diego from Los Angeles and the over an hour wait in the line was all worth it...once we tasted the food we understood why there was a line. The portions for the price are a huge value. ÊWe had all gotten the BBQ Broham (Pulled Pork) sandwich (they did not skimp on any meat), shared a huge plate of Fresh Cut Fries (and I do mean huge) and the Ginormous Onion Rings (biggest rings I've ever seen), and then ordered a Half Chicken Only (All White) to go. We loved it all and were in hog heaven...can't wait to go again to try more items.

cold Sat night and was itching and craving for some ribs. So made the long trek from oceanside. ÊI arrive in good spirits and starving like a holocaust prisoner and see people standing in a line that went from the front door that wrapped around the side all the way to the back about 100+ft. Aw man was I bummed. Can't stand in the freeze for an hour+ so I called Êand asked for take out. They said yes but there is a separate line for that as well. It was much shorter but I still had to stand in line for 45 min...for phone order wow, lucky phil. restaurants are closing down and look at this place. Ok now for the grades. A- for service even though it was a complete mad house on sat + valentine's day. Food was knockout, even eating from take out carton. And separates phil's from all the other bbq places that has been disappointing are the sides. Here their beans are just right, not too sweet an rich which is the culprit at most bbq's and the fresh cut fries were not dry like in n out burger's. For that amount of volume and quality is unheard of and mind boggling....my 1st 5 stars review. They should def open one up here in N county to relieve some of the massive orders from the main location.

It was nearly a month ago that I was instructed to "get my ass over to Phil's" without any delay, and in the way one does of my adopted San Diego home, I took my time. Three weeks later I made it over to Phil's, and I did so without Sarah and with the full understanding that I was going to get some serious ass kickin' when she learned that I excluded her from the first try. Of course, this also meant that I was gonna have to find some way to make it up to her. And actually, what I like to do is treat her to something real good and when she's riding the high of that... that's when I hit her with the news. Poor form I know, but it seems to work. I had the pulled pork sandwich with a small side of potato salad. That and their beer of the month. The line was a solid half hour long so I darted straight for the bar, ordered and was out of there, mouth abuzz with bbq delight within twenty minutes. GREAT! It's kinda clean. And it's a huge operation. Menu is simple. Food is fantastic. I knew I could take half for leftovers, but I didn't.

I visited Phil's for the very first time several months ago and...oh....my mouth is salivating already just dreaming about it... Get the ribs. Why wouldn't you get the ribs? What type of fool goes into a location like this and does not get the ribs? You know what, if you are going to go here and not get ribs, just give me your $20 instead so I can do it justice. Simply because the ribs are very good. The fries are...ok to fairly very good. My brother can't get enough and raves about them continuously, but they had been just a little much less crisp than I prefer.

Go early, because the line gets pretty ridiculous here. But I would have to say it's worth the wait. Like I said in a previous review about BBQ ribs, I'm not exactly an expert, but I do-so-love the baby back ribs that they serve here. The side of fries is fairly large...I got macaroni salad, too, but it wasn't that good, so just stick with the fries. One thing I do need to mention is the service: EXCELLENT service. They are super duper friendly and they really want you to have a great experience. One lovely worker came by and asked us how we were doing and what not, and then added "Was it PHIL-nomenal?" OKOK it was a little cheesy, but I'm just trying to say that they try really hard to make it a great time for all. =D

I've always wanted to be review #1040. Now is finally my chance! Pork Ribs -- awesome. Half Rack (6-7 bones) with two small sides (beans and slaw) was the perfect amount for me, and I would say most people. = $12.95 They have beef ribs and chicken too, which I'm sure are excellent. 1 star off for not having corn bread. Say WHAT?! Also, I'm a fan of a spicier bbq sauce, but it is still so delicious. Lines can be long, but service is fast. Come hungry!

I called Phil's at around 10AM, asked them if they take reservations (NO) and how busy it is around 6 (VERY BUSY) and when they were the least busy (FROM 2 TO 5, USUALLY). So my boyfriend and I decided to get there at 4:30 and eat an early dinner to avoid the infamous ridiculously long lines. We get there at 4:30, and the line is LONG. But we figure, it's ok, it's four thirty, we have time to spare, we're not hungry yet. So we wait. The line gets longer as we move up in line. And at last, we're at the front! Our wait time was a little more than an hour (!!!!) and we got our food at around 6. Wow. What luck - dinner at dinner time. By the time we got our food, the length of the line outside had probably doubled. If their business is completely constant from at least 4:30 til 8pm every day? That's amazing - the food is probably delicious and they're probably doing everything right. The food was delicious. My boyfriend got a full rack of baby back ribs (with fries and potato salad) and I got the best-of-both with baby back ribs and chicken (with a baked potato). Both were super tender, super delicious. My chicken was drowning in sauce (minus points) but it was extremely tender. Much much better than expected, and I really recommend it. The ribs were also really tasty. I'm rating four stars instead of five because although the ribs and chicken were deliciously tender, their flavor wasn't anything special. The fries were alright. The baked potato was just a baked potato. And the only non alcoholic drinks they have were fountain sodas. Ribs go so well with serious sodas, I don't know what they're thinking! They're missing real bottled root beer. And it almost ruined my meal :( Next time, I would recommend ordering to-go. Unless you have nothing to do for a couple hours, the line isn't worth it, and you can eat it just as messily at home, and wash it down with a root beer float.

ÊI'll grant some artistic license to the place for correlating messy as hell with "homestyle." ÊBut when there's literally no way to handle the sandwich, it gets silly and touristy.

I was visiting Shamu with my family and our friends told us to check this place out. We arrived at 5PM on a Tuesday and their was only 2 people in front of us. The ordering process is similar to Armadillo Willy's where you order at the counter, they give you a pager, and you pick it up. I ordered a full rack of baby back ribs with cole slaw and potato salad. When my order came up I got my paper towels ready and dug in. The sauce has wonderful flavor and has just the right amount of spice to it. The cole slaw and potato salad was also very good. By the time 6PM came around the line was around the corner. I must say if the line is going out the door on a Tuesday, this place must have some good ass ribs!

I've always loved Phil's. You just can't go wrong on their menu. The new location is amazing at moving through the BBQ loving crowds. Service is always fast and friendly. Although I love the baby back ribs, I'd recommend trying something new. The El Toro, tri-tip sandwich is delish! My latest visit reminded me why I love Phil's. My 2 year old son got sick while we were waiting in line outside. The staff came over quickly, helped to clean him and the area around him up, rushed us over to order at the to-go line, gave him a Phil's BBQ shirt to change into, and got us all drinks incredibly fast. This just epitomizes family friendly. On previous visits all the staff chat with my kids and give them tons of smiles. It is refreshing to go to a dining establishment that not only tolerates kids, but enjoys them. Thank you Phils!

DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE LINE! ÊTHE LINE IS NOTHING! This is hands down the best BBQ you can get in San Diego, and probably some of the best I've ever had, period. ÊThe line wraps around the building almost all the time, but the food is well worth the wait. ÊOh, man is it awesome! The baby back ribs are fall-off-the-bone tender, smoked to perfection, and covered (but not smothered) with a tangy, spicy BBQ sauce. ÊThe Beefy ribs are also excellent, and are some of the tenderest (is that a word?) beef ribs this side of the Mississippi. ÊJust delicious. ÊThe chicken is very good, but you'll want to pass on the poultry and just go with the ribs. ÊTrust me, they're the best. Ê The sides are also delicious: I'm partial to the fries (which you use to sop up drippings from your ribs) and cole slaw, while my wife prefers their macaroni salad. If you're wanting a lighter meal, or want to save some money with a less expensive entree, try the BBQ Broham sandwich. ÊIt's a big pulled pork sandwich with sauce and coleslaw. ÊSo good. If you haven't been here yet, you owe it to yourself to try it. ÊSoon, you'll be a Phil's line regular.

I've been to Phil's many many times over the course of my residency in San Diego. It is also the first place that comes to mind whenever friends from out-of-town come down to visit. I had always ordered the Best of Both - beefy ribs, chickless chicken with macaroni salad and fries as sides. DEFINITELY GET THE MACARONI SALAD!! However I've found the chicken to be dry and not as enjoyable to eat, so the past few times I had ordered the Best of Both I didn't touch the chicken and would bring it home and not touch it. This time, I finally saw the Beefy Rib Dinner on the menu which was just $2 more for 3 bones and a choice of 2 sides (got the macaroni salad and fries). However, I was delightfully surprised to find that they had actually given me 4 BONES OF BEEFY RIBS! :O It was most definitely awesome, and no (chicken) food wasted!

Three stars for their food and the fourth for the warm and friendly staff that not only asked us how we were doing, but really went above and beyond to take care of my family and I! But food first. We got two orders of the Beefy Ribs with fries, one order of the Best of Both (a couple of baby back ribs and a quarter of a chicken) with fries and macaroni salad, and the El Toro Sandwich. The BEEFY RIBS were cooked very well, maybe a liiittle overdone. But they were good and had a lot of meat. We were in awe at the size of these things! The ribs were as long as my face and it takes two hands to eat a rib! They aren't something a fork and a knife can handle; we got down and dirty with the ribs. The BEST OF BOTH offered really the best of both worlds. Though the BBQ CHICKEN was charred on one side, the meat past the skin was moist and I actually liked it more than the ribs. It also came with a small rack of BABY BACK RIBS that were perfectly cooked. They're much more manageable to eat than the beefy ribs, too. The EL TORO's tri-tipped beef was drowning in barbecue sauce. Maybe it was because there was so much food already, but the sandwich being drenched with sauce made it an unappetizing choice. My cousin commented on the smoky flavor being overwhelming and I completely agree. For folks who aren't really used to eating so much barbecue at once, I wouldn't recommend this sandwich. The BARBECUE SAUCE was really good. I liked the bit of heat to it the most and it has something unique about it. It's not like any other bbq sauce I've tasted before! Their FRIES were delicious, albeit a bit soggy after being crushed by the ribs on top of them. They go very well with the ranch to add some variety in flavor during the meal. The MACARONI SALAD was okay. It was macaroni, mayo, and bits of celery. I'm not a fan of celery, but the macaroni was alright to eat. It was about a 50 minute wait for us at 8:30pm on a Saturday night. During our wait, we were greeted three times by someone from the restaurant. First time, they gave us our menus so we'd be ready to order. Second time to tell us about how much longer and to see if there were any big groups. The third time was to see if anyone else wanted a menu or wanted to be green and return the menu to the restaurant. When we were eating, a couple of folks came by and asked to see if we needed anything. Someone even offered to help me take my plates to the table. There was ample parking and they take credit card. :) Definitely must try at least once in your life if you're in town.

There are very few restaurants that I absolutely can't get enough of, but Phil's BBQ is a just THAT good. The sauce, to me, is amazeballs. It's the perfect combination of sweet and spicy and it makes everything taste good. I dip everything in that sauce. I've never had anything at Phil's that wasn't good and it's always a treat to be able to go especially since I don't live in SD anymore. They've turned this place into a well-oiled food-service machine since they first started with the hole-in-the-wall they used to be at in Hillcrest/Mission Hills. The staff here is great, super nice and super helpful. The past 2 times I've been here, I've gotten SOMETHING free of charge. First time it was their delicious Whoopie Pie and the second, we got a free basket of onion rings. First time here? Get yourself one of the Ticklers. Definitely the best value on the menu. The sandwiches are also fantastic. What am I saying? just close your eyes and point at something on the menu, you won't be disappointed.

Love this place. I've been here 3 times and 3 times they've impressed. The ribs are delicious! The meat just falls off the bone, the bbq sauce is tasty and doesn't overpower the taste of the meat. The cole slaw was delicious too. But what I was most impressed about was the service. Our waiter was a guy named Corey and he was awesome! Super attentive, accommodating, and truly made our experience great. My girlfriend and I were seated by the door and she was getting cold because of the wind. We saw a seat open up and as we were about to switch tables, Corey notices it and comes right over and helps us move. He was more than happy to take pictures for us. 5 stars for this man. I definitely recommend Phil's. Yes, the line is long, but that just shows you how good the place is. The place is big, so it's not like the line is long because the place is small.

I've eaten a lot of ribs. So many in fact that I'm convinced I will be forced to come back in my next life as a pig. That said, these are absolutely the best ribs I've ever had. Better than my own even. Very tender, fall off the bone pork ribs. They pour a good amount of sauce over them, so if you don't like that, ask for it on the side. The sides aren't anything exciting and the burger was a little weird. My eight year old will eat just about any burger, but wouldn't finish this one. Any good sporting events are only shown in the bar. ÊThey put the "B" games on in the main dining room so that people don't stay too long. The long waits are every night, so be prepared for that, but the staff was very friendly and helpful. I definitely would eat here again.

There's not alot I can say about Phil's that hasn't already been said here in the 800+ reviews. So I'll keep it short. Phil's BBQ has the BEST ribs and onion rings I've ever had. It doesn't even matter if you don't like BBQ - you should try Phil's. It's like a SD culinary landmark (we have few enough of those in SD). I even took my aunt and grandma from San Jose here - two old Vietnamese ladies who eat ribs like once every five years, and even they liked it so much they wanted to come back! Also, for those who have never tried the Beef Ribs, TRY IT. I stuck with the traditional Baby-Back Ribs my first few visits, thinking "what the heck are beef ribs?" But ever since I've taken my first bite into the ginormous Beef Rib, it's been getting harder and harder to go back to the baby-back. Damn, just writing about these damn ribs is already starting make my mouth water. GO TO Phil's!

Best BBQ in San Diego! If you have never been here make it a point to go! The food is AMAZING and the atmosphere is great! The line of people that wraps around the building can be intimidating but know that the line moves very fast and there will always be a seat for you inside once you order. The food is usually ready for you within 10 mins of ordering which is great because I nearly start eating off of stranger's plates once I sit down. The food smells and looks so good ya'll! I always get the 1/2 chicken dinner all white meat with baked beans and coleslaw. My mouth is watering just typing up this review. The chicken is so juicy and the BBQ is sweet and tangy. The beans are also a favorite because they are smokey and they pack a little spicy kick which pairs well with the chicken. The cool and creamy coleslaw round out the entire meal. My family and I usually will order some fries to share and we enjoy eating the with the house ranch which is AMAZING! I have been coming to Phil's for years now and I can say that I have never had a bad experience. The food is always great, the staff friendly, and the atmosphere and blues music playing really makes it a complete dinning experience.

First off, Phils BBQ has no real bbq competition in San Diego. ÊWe waited over 1.5 hours in line outside to give this BBQ place a whirl. ÊSo I was expecting it to live up to my expectations. ÊI lived in Texas for over 2 yrs and experienced the real deal "Texas BBQ" many times. Phil's bbq concentrates only on the bbq sauce and not the meat. ÊYou only taste the thick bbq sauce which is slathered all over your ribs and chicken that you can barely taste the meat itself. ÊPhils bbq cooks its meat twice. ÊBoils or pressure cooks all the meat so its really tender then bbqs it up and slathers sauce on it at the end. ÊThis is why the meat is super tender and falls off the bone. Phil's BBQ only serves chicken, baby back ribs and beef ribs. ÊNo beef brisket!! ÊWhat kind of BBQ place doesn't serve beef brisket or bbq sausage? If Phil's BBQ was side by side next to a real Texas BBQ place like "Rudy's" or "County Line" Phil's BBQ would go out of business for sure. ÊHands down no question! I've experienced way better bbq than Phils BBQ and will not be going back any time soon and waiting in an insane line for below average bbq.

I'm like the one person in SD who's not a Phil's Phan, but today I was converted. The sauce was a perfect blend of sweet and peppery on my delishiously meaty slab of ribs. Wow. I was impressed. Also, my #1 complaint for years has been the boring beans. Today they were zippy, hot, and tasty. Now I'm a fan.

My friend and I went to this place after watching some BBQ special on the food network channel. We took an empty spot at the bar. When we asked the bartender if we could order food at the bar, he informed us, with an arrogant attitude, that we have to wait in line, to order food. I was a waiter and a bartender for many years and I don't understand why some people in the hospitality industry have such a bad attitude. It takes more time and energy to be a rude to a customer than to provide people with good service. Maybe the guy was having a bad day, who knows. Luckily he was finishing up his shift when we got our food and was replaced by a cool bartender. We decided to call in our order and then eat it at the bar. When I went to pay for our food, the counter girl said that she would have to check with the manger to make sure we could eat in the bar (since we phoned the order in). The manager did not have a problem with this and was very friendly. I hate their order at the counter setup and then hunt for a table. Would it kill you guys to get some servers in this joint, sheesh! When we received our food, we were very happy with the portions and quality. I ordered the ribs and chicken which could easily feed two people. Everything was very tasty. It was a great experience other than the first bartenders surly attitude. We got to eat at the bar and beat the system. Ha ha angry bartender! In spite of the rocky start, I would definitely eat here again.

My friend David introduced me to Phil's BBQ and I am in debt to him for this great kindness. Originally I was skeptical, so solicited Yelp's help for a confirmation, then head out to this SD gem. The food was phenomenal the portions we're enormous. There are so many different styles of BBQ and I am not sure if I am correct by saying it is more of a Texas style (sweet and tangy)? The sauce is OK, only because I like dry rub better. My advise is order the beef and pork ribs. On any given night one will be better than another. Avoid the chicken. All of their sides are great, especially the onion rings, slaw and beans. I will give your 2 reasons for going in early, first the lines are shorter early evening, and second, unless the laws of smoked BBQ has changed, the meat continues to cook as time passes. I think this could be the best BBQ on the west coast!

Frequent visitor. Just wow, some of the best baby back ribs I've ever had. If you think you can't handle a full rack of ribs, just order the whole thing, you won't be sorry. Detailed review: I've been going here since this place was on Goldfinch. ÊThe strange thing is, I've never lived in San Diego. ÊI don't even have family in the area. ÊYet I've been here on numerous occasions. ÊI was visiting San Diego once and a friend told me I had to try this place, I'm so glad I did. ÊThey have the best pork ribs I've had at a restaurant. ÊVery tender, very flavorful. ÊEver since my first visit, I've made from NorCal to SoCal just to go to this restaurant, it's that good. The actual restaurant is huge now, but there will still probably be a wait. ÊIn my recent visit, my girlfiend and I arrived 30 minutes before opening and we were second in line. ÊBy the time the restaurant actually opened, the line went around the corner. I can't say much about the other food because I devote all of my stomach to the ribs. ÊThere is one small negative, if you like crispy fries you'll be disappointed.

"Dry w/ sauce on da side," is how I order my baby back ribs here. These are the best ribs in San Diego hands down! They are knock-u-into-a-coma flavorful and ridiculously tender, like Miguel Cotto's face after a Manny Pacquiao pounding. I'm not from the South, nor do I ever care to go there! I have been to every joint, here in America's finest city, that serves baby backs and none of them can compare. Maybe all you transplants need to go back to where ever it is you came from that way I don't have to wait in line as long. Louisiana, Kansas City, Texas who gives a she-I-it bout type or style?!

Quite possibly the best BBQ west of Texas. I'm very picky about my pulled pork sandwiches and Phil's prepares it perfectly. The BBQ sauce is a perfect blend of spice and sweet. The fries were prepared perfectly and addicting. You will not leave this place hungry. Don't worry if you see a line out to the parking lot on some nights. The line moves quickly enough and worth the wait.

The El Toro is one of the best BBQ anythings I've had in life, really. It was nearly obscene how tender this tri-tip sandwich is.

A week later and I'm back at Phil's ÊI took my review and personal curiosity seriously when ordering. ÊI ordered a beef rib and chicken sampler with fries and macaroni salad as well as onion rings. Ê The line this time put our other line to shame. ÊThe line was out the door and around the corner to past where the outdoor patio ends. ÊConsidering the length the scant half an hour it took us to get in wasn't bad. ÊLuckily we also scored a table as soon as we ordered. ÊWhen we later got up to get our food (despite the full sodas covering our table) our table was almost taken TWICE. I have finally found beef ribs I enjoy. ÊAfter spending my entire life loving delicious pork ribs (and nearly every other pork product under the sun) I found delicious and meaty beef ribs which satisfy. ÊUsually you find beef ribs which are greasy, fatty and are mostly connective tissue. ÊThese ribs were low in connective membrane with minor fat deposits. ÊThe beef was rich, flavorful and tender. ÊI contemplated while waiting in line how they can justify charging 4 dollars for a single beef rib and I now know. ÊThe two ribs I ate were quite filling and the bones make a nice pile on the plate. Ê Chicken can be good and chicken can be bad. ÊChicken can also just be plain old chicken. ÊPhil's BBQ chicken is tender with the grain and cooked to perfection. ÊThe flavor is that of a mild chicken covered by a musk of smoke. ÊThe tangy and sweet bbq sauce covered and accentuated it all. ÊI would recommend the chicken (chickless- without bones in this case) to anyone not interested in beef, or who wants to try a combo like I did. The macaroni salad was similar to the potato salad, but more light and refreshing. ÊThere were nicely diced chunks of white onion that pop in your mouth. ÊThe french fries were plentiful and fresh. ÊWhen hot they were of high quality. ÊThe topper of all sides is the "small" order of onion rings. ÊThis "small" order covers an entire plate. ÊThe batter was crisp and crunchy, and the onions inside were tender, thickly cut and oh so deliciously sweet. ÊI cannot stress enough how much of a mistake it would be to eat at Phil's and not get the onion rings.

First and foremost, hands down to the awesome service here. ÊWe were greeted at first by someone standing at the door welcoming us, then another line director who was just as friendly, and then when I came to order, the cashier noticed I had braces on and informed me of the boneless babyback meat! ÊHow nice is that? Ê Anyhow, on to the food: We ordered the babyback dinner combo with two sides (macaroni salad and coleslaw) along with BBQ Broham sandwich with pork. ÊI'm gonna have to say that the best part of the meal was the sides....so that means the main entrees didn't really live up to the anticipation I had of trying out this popular joint. ÊI have to admit, their macaroni salad was pretty darn tasty - just the right consistency, chunky and not watery gross. ÊThe coleslaw was also really delicious - light and not as watery as many coleslaws I've tasted. ÊThe boneless babyback was a bit on the dry side, and so was their sandwich. ÊI drove here from the OC just to try this place, so you can imagine how excited I was prior to eating the meal. ÊIf I had a choice between this and Lucilles, I'd definitely pick Lucille's in a heart beat. ÊNot the best BBQ I've had...that's all.

After a super tiring day at the SDZ Safari Park, we came here and ordered dinner to-go. It was the best BBQ I've ever had in a restaurant. Baby back ribs were delicious and fall-off-the-bone tender. Cole slaw was pretty good, fries and potato salad were nothing to rave about. The onion rings however were amazing, and I'm glad I decided to go with the small instead of the large at the last minute because it was a HUGE portion! I also ordered a pulled pork sandwich but I thought it was little dry. Ordering over the phone was a breeze and I got my order all ready to go within minutes after paying.

The ribs are delish but you have to play the waiting game. Saw and heard of this place from Man vs. Food and the ribs taste exactly like it was described on the show. Sauce was smoky, tangy, and you could taste all the flavor packed into the meat. Their sides could use some work though, the better of them were the baked beans. Also this place has a crazzzzzzzy long dine-in line, over an hour at least? I didn't want to wait in the dark and cold weather. So I walked all the way around to the front of the building again, got in the phone-in line (which was about 20 people deep). Looked up the menu on my phone and called in the order :) They said the food would be ready in 15-20 mins and to anticipate a wait when I arrive because there's a phone-in line. But they actually don't start making your order until you arrive to midpoint of the line. Before you enter the door a staff member will ask for your name and boop boop beep look you up on their phone orders device, click on your name and then send the signal to the kitchen to start arranging your order. Then you step in and wait in another line, but short one, and pay for your food, and then receive a pager to wait AGAIN haha. THEN you finally get your food. Soooo, call it in if you can. Or wait in line foreverrrr for a table.

This place is good.. but I don't know that it is the BEST... I am not from San Diego but I was in town and a friend had heard so many good things so we waited in line around 45-60mins on a Sunday afternoon. We ordered a few assortments of things for the table to try (there were 10 of us) the food was good.. but the ribs didn't fall off the bone as I was expecting for all of the hype. Needless to say I don't think I would wait in line again for this but if it wasn't so crowded I'd give it another shot.

It's okay.. the lines are pretty long but time flies. So far, everything I've tried just wasn't poppin'. The sauce was pretty tasteful but it didn't make much of an impression on me. The ribs I had were pretty dry. Their burgers as well. Yes, the portion is plentiful but it did not satisfy my taste buds. You can refill soft drinks which I like. Oh yeah, even the onion rings were OKAY. They were really greasy and I got sick of it after 1. Good thing I shared it with people. But man.. I rather have the BBQ Ribs my parents make.

The wait wasn't too bad, but then again we were a party of 4, so finding table tops were easier for us than a huge party. ÊThe style of walk up, order your meats and sides and get seated coupled with the the semi-chaotic fun atmosphere added to the novelty of the experience. The fries are crackin! The mac salad, supreme! Even the darn beans were good. ÊA definite must for anyone visiting SD.

I'm a self-proclaimed Q snob. ÊI don't take my reviews of Q joints lightly. ÊHaving been to several of the top rated places in the US, I think I know what I'm talking about. Phil's is not one of the top rated places in the US. ÊIt is a sufficient substitute though when you are in the mood for smoky goodness and can't get to some of the best. I had the pulled pork, baby backs, and beef ribs. ÊStay away from the beef rib. ÊIt was just okay. ÊThe pork and baby backs were well done. ÊI prefer a little more smoke to my pork which I didn't find at Phil's. ÊA good strong smoke coupled with say a Bryant's type sauce is Q heaven. If you decide to do the ribs, ask for them dry with some sauce on the side. ÊThat's probably a better option than allowing the kitchen crew to decide how wet you like your ribs. ÊI didn't do that and found myself sopping the sauce off the ribs. Fries are good. ÊI wasn't impressed with the onion rings. ÊToo much batter. ÊI'm one of the those onion loaf fans anyway. ÊThat seems to be the only way to enjoy rings with Q, at least in my book. For those that complain about the line, try going at off times. ÊWe were there about 2P and waited just a few minutes. ÊI know sometimes schedules don't allow but if you are not stuck on a time frame, this would be an option. We ended up sitting in the bar area. ÊNot sure how beer works in the other part of the dining room. I would return to Phil's if I were in the area.

The BBQ here is definitely good but not mind blowing amazing. The sauce is tangy and the sides are fine. The meat is cooked perfectly, I had the pork ribs and chicken combo dinner. They give large portions of everything and the price is very good. It def. gets a 5 stars in terms of value (price for quality of food).

This place is gooooooooood ... my gf's parents took us here and they weren't kidding about how good Phil's BBQ is. We enjoyed a full rack of ribs - tender and perfectly rubbed. ÊThe sauce isn't overwhelming or drenching as you would find at some other places. ÊVery tasty! The onion rings are probably the best ones I have ever eaten. ÊThe most unique thing is how tasty the batter is and the onion itself is tender where it just rips off when you take a bite instead of dangling and you end up dragging the entire ring of onions - leaving you with just the battered ring. The Broham was pretty good - I was too busy enjoying the rack of ribs that I only took a small bite. ÊThe pulled pork was tender and tasty. The fries were average at best. The next time I am in SD I will have to visit Phil's again to enjoy another rack of ribs ... maybe try the beef ribs, cole-slaw, and mac'n'cheese. One bit of advice, I am glad my gf's parents took us at 11:30am because that is just before the mad dash.

So my last visit to Phil's I had to order to go. The line was long to sit down as usual. I ordered the Broham which is a pulled barbecue pork sandwich topped with coleslaw Êand a baby back rib tickler which consisted of 3 baby back ribs, 2 onion rings and a handful of fries for take out. My Broham was dry, (maybe that's why the cashier asked if I wanted extra bbq sauce on the side) but the ribs on the other hand were delicious. San Diego has a lot of great places to eat.

Overrated, I know it's extremely popular but the bbq sauce just isn't my type. ÊIt's more on the "sour"side, and I like my bbq sauce kind of sweet. ÊThis is just my personal preference. ÊThe baby back ribs were cooked well, the fries are the large cut kind so it's not as crispy as how I would like it. ÊBBQ chicken combo was good. ÊI think we had potato salad and mac salad on the side, mac salad was definately better. ÊThe staff were really friendly and you pay in advance. ÊI left them a really good tip. ÊThey sell their bbq sauce on the side. ÊI came here for a weekend lunch, line was long but fair enough. ÊI like how you can SMELL everything. ÊI don't like how I have to find my own spot. ÊAfter a long wait I still had to battle for seats :l ÊYou'd have better luck with seats on the left side near the bar.

Been here many times. Always great. The ribs here is always great. The meat on the ribs are tender and can easily taken off the bone. The sides, I'm not a big fan of, mostly because you can't top the ribs, thats the main reason why I come here. The service is one the best I have ever experienced. The staff here are friendly and always helpful. Out of all the times I've been here I never had a bad experience wit the staff here. Also, I have never seem them other than happy there. The place is clean and the atmosphere is great. Parking is isn't that bad, the only problem I have is the long line to get in here. But that just tells you how great it is.

The food was about 3 stars, probably not worth all of the hype [But then again, I moved to San Diego from Texas, so I'm used to some pretty badass BBQ]. Worth the 1hr+ wait? Not really ... But the service was excellent :] All the staff members were friendly, well-trained, well-behaved, and efficient. While waiting in the viciously long line, a staff member made sure there was a table available for us when we got inside. Sweet :] And when I sat down, even though the place is a pay-at-the-counter-and-pick-up kind of place, they had employees going around asking how everything was, providing us with napkins, utensils, offering drink refills, etc. Amazing customer service :] That goes well beyond the job-description of any fast food-casual place I've ever heard of. Love you guys! Oh, and the side portions are HUGE. Always get the 2 small sides instead of the 1 large side. The "small" sides are anything but small.

We've been a fan of Phil's since they were up in Hillcrest at that little tiny converted house- we actually miss that location since it was not as crowded before the masses discovered it. The new location is huge and many nights it is operating at Êcapacity. Unfortunately, Phil has decided to become politically active, having thrown fundraisers for the likes of Carl DeMaio- unfortunately that does not work for me- such a shame. I like my restaurants like I like my musicians- do you job and keep your mouth shut about politics- we won't be going back.

Good eats at decent prices. ÊI do think that this restaurant is a bit over-hyped for what it really offers. ÊIt can get busy and the long lines can be a headache if one isn't prepared for it. ÊSome of the staff can be overextended and uneasy with the stress associated with a hectic work environment such as Phil's BBQ but MOST of the staff are quite nice and helpful. ÊAn OK place to go to if you want meaty foods...not a place to go to for salads (as I've experienced first hand lol).

So many fakes out there and theres only one real deal. Phil's is the real deal when it comes to BBQ. It's really annoying to see so many other companies pop up after they made it a mainstream thing. It wouldn't be so annoying if they just served something half as decent. The only other BBQ spot I would recommend besides Phil's is Coop's. They have a new location that has less of a wait which is cool. I was getting tired of coming early in the morning to avoid the lines.

Would have been 5 stars except for the BBQ sauce. The ribs are fantastic, perfectly cook and fall off the bone. I have had tenderloin that wasnt nearly as tender as these baby backs were. The BBQ sauce on the other hand was lathered on and WAY too sweet. If you use some hot sauce that is on the tables it balances it out a bit and makes it tolerable.

This place (original location) was just up the hill from where we lived in SD. I've had a few different things here- the RB sandwiches, pulled pork. But I kept coming back to the ribs.

I feel this place is over rated. ÊI grew up in Indiana right on the Mason Dixon line along the Ohio River and the area is known for having outstanding BBQ. Ê I can remember as a kid going to the yearly church BBQ right before the new school year. ÊThe pits would be dug out on Saturday and several men would stay up all night roasting the meat for Sundays big chow down. ÊAfter a full day of three-legged races, egg tosses, water balloon fights we would grab our plates and be given a generous portion of BBQ....mmm...the sauce, spicy and not Êtoo sweet, drenched on the pulled pork and beef. Ê (please don't wake me from this dream.) Back to reality...Phils is ok, but the sauce taste like it is filled with high fructose corn syrup...way to sweet. ÊAnd they don't have fresh rye sandwich bread on hand. ÊBelieve me, BBQ on rye bread with onions and Êsliced pickles is amazingly gooooooood!

Oh Phil how I love you. You make me happy when skies are blue sunny and glorious. Why does your sauce have to be so yummy. I know it must be the sugar...you have an open invitation to grease me up. Listen I'm a snob I guess. I have pretty much eaten my way around this world....and try my best to grease it up in all the cities I hit in the US - I've lived in the south...this is alright compared. Why...consistency. Every time I hit Phil's its good. Soggy bread, drippy coleslaw and more pulled pork than I want but enough that I still can't stop myself way after I'm full. It's good....trust us.

I'm sorry but I really can't say I'm a fan of Phil's. Ê Perhaps it was the late hour at which we came to eat, and it most certainly is a very crowded place to eat, even around 9 PM. Ê Still... long lines, tragically small side orders, expensive prices... Ê The BBQ ribs were tasty, but they weren't that good. Ê If I compare them with Back Forty, a BBQ joint in Pleasant Hill nearer to where I live, Back Forty dominates completely and utterly. They also close at 10, which is a bit of a drag... ÊWe were a large group on the patio and pretty much were pushed out at 10:15. Ê Of course I completely understand that employees desire not work extra hours, but the owners should probably consider extending their hours on holidays... Then again, 10PM? Ê They probably should consider extending their hours all the time! Would I come back? ÊYeah... the food was good. Ê Still, I don't think Phil's is owed all the admiration and adulation it seems to have garnered.

Came here on a Friday night (around 8:30pm) and the line was out the door. ÊIt took about 10 minutes until I was able to order, so don't be deceived by the long line (its worth it btw). ÊThe place was packed, but my friend and I were able to find seats in the bar area (we wanted to drink beer anyways). ÊFood came out about 5 minutes after I ordered (just enough time to get a beer from the bar). I got the half rack of rib dinner and my friend got half chicken dinner. ÊThe ribs were AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS!! ÊPhil's sure does live up to the reputation that I've been hearing. ÊThe bbq sauce just marinates perfectly into the meet. ÊThe chicken was very disappointing... it tasted like chicken with some bbq sauce on top. ÊThe two sides (I got fries and mac salad) were a good portion... A little too much for me. ÊI would rather have gotten a full rack with 1 side. Ê They had some good beer on tap too and it accommodated the ribs quite well. ÊGet the Yellow Tail Pale Ale for a light and crisp beer (a bit too light for me though). Overall, I'd definitely dine again. ÊJust don't get the chicken.

My work Christmas party was held here this past December. I would give this place 5 stars, but I would never wait in line for more that 15 minutes to eat here, not matter how good the BBQ is here. Before I had eaten here, I had heard that Phil's is the absolute best BBQ in San Diego. That was no lie. It is the best! The San Diego Expo Design Center (which is now shutting down-so so sad) employee committee booked the convention room. For the number of people that attended this location from my store, this room was too small. It only fits about 100 people more or less. We were crammed into the room. Our employee committee knew we had too many people to fit the space, but went ahead with the party. On the positive side, the food was absolutely amazing and the best chicken BBQ I have ever tasted. I was surprised that I actually liked the onion rings with the ranch dressing. Other than that, go to Phil's and go early -even if you have to arrive before the restaurant opens just so you don't have to wait in line. It is well worth it.

My interest was piqued when we saw a line wrapping around the building one night of our recent stay in the area. 9 times out of 10, when doing a cold search for a good place to eat, the line doesn't lie! My outrigger canoe team decided to have lunch here the day after my fiance and I spotted it, and we were overjoyed that we made it before the line had a chance to get longer than a couple people. Wow, you can literally smell this place almost a mile away in your car with the windows rolled up. It's the sweet aroma of meat cookin' and saying, "C'mon! Let me do your taste buds and make it a double!" Service was super, super excellent. From the cashiers, to the busboys, to the bartender. They are really well trained to be this great or just genuinely nice, or both. Our cashier was very patient with us because we had some visually impaired people with us and she didn't bat an eye or show any impatience whatsoever while we described the menu to our friends. The busboys and servers roaming the tables kept checking in on us to see if there was anything they could get for us... and it was packed by the time we got our food and they were still doing this. Amazing! The food is awesome. I got the baby back ribs and chicken combo. Most of the people in our group got the tri-tip sandwich. Everyone was extremely pleased with the quality and quantity of food. The ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender and well-seasoned. The chicken was cooked to perfection and not a bit dry. I had a bite of the tri-tip sandwich and it was no letdown. Even the sides were good: the potato salad had some bite to it and the cole slaw was solid. My fiance wanted me to review this place as being the best BBQ joint in California, but seeing that we haven't tried enough places throughout the state yet, I'll hold off on that for now. Let's just say it's the best we've had so far. Definitely will be coming back!!! Come early or be prepared to face the consequences! You've been warned!

This place actually lived up to all the expectations. Now, I'm currently on a diet, but I had to take a "break" from it to try out this place. Wow, was this a GREAT cheat meal. We walked in around noon on a Tuesday (They're closed on Mondays, btw) and the line was out the door. It was nice to see the signs of their menu around everywhere so you could think of what you wanted to order. My girlfriend and I decided to share the pork ribs plate (working on our portion control) and while we initially ordered steamed veggies (to be healthy), I thought it might be better if we got more "bbq" sides, so we added cole slaw and potato salad. Service - One thing that really stuck out was how friendly everyone was. Usually when a place gets very popular and they know they serve good food, the service suffers. Not at Phil's! From our hostess who greeted us before we were about to order to our server who helped clear out the tables and get us napkins and silverware, everyone was REALLY REALLY friendly. Food - Ok, so the most important part. The BBQ baby back ribs were great. Cooked perfectly soft and just the right amount of bbq sauce on it. The sauce could have used a little more kick, but it was delicious nonetheless. It would have been nice to have an option of spicier sauce. The sides that we ordered were nothing really special. The cole slaw wasn't drenched in the mayo sauce which was ok cuz of our diet and the potato salad was nothing to write home about. I saw that everyone had ordered fries or onion rings, so we'll definitely have to try those or the corn next time. I was a bit surprised that there was no bread to go with the meal. Usually there is some cornbread or just some standard Wonder bread to go with the bbq. Atmosphere - I really enjoyed the casual eating environment at Phil's. It was a very efficient operation with multiple cashiers and many tables for everyone to sit in. It's self server, after you order, you take your buzzer, get your drinks and silverware, and you find a table Êuntil your buzzer goes off. I'll definitely be back here. While the sides were pretty average, the mix of the bbq ribs and the friendly service made this a terrific place.Next time I'll have to try the beef ribs and the pulled pork sandwich!

First thought as you drive up to Phil's BBQ is "WTH? the line wraps around the building?!" The line only looks intimidating but it's actually not all that bad. I think our wait was only like 20 minutes or so. This isn't your typical sit down bbq restaurant. You pretty much order your food, get a pager, grab a table, then chow down. There's a sign that says "no holding tables before ordering," but it wasn't really enforced. The food is okay. I ordered the half chicken dinner with macaroni salad and my friend ordered the half rib with corn. The chicken was juicy and very flavorful and the macaroni salad was just the way I like it...not a lot of mayonnaise. The ribs were good but the sauce on it was overwhelmingly sweet :[ If my review was based solely on food I would have given it a 3, however, the service at Phil's is one of a kind. Darrell our "server" came by frequently to see how we were doing and was very efficient.

Over 900 reviews with a pretty much overall rating of 5/5. What more can I say that hasn't already been said? Visiting San Diego, we were craving something that we didn't have in the Bay Area. Passing by I see Phil's BBQ and the line was around the corner on a Tuesday night. We were hungry and did not want to wait, so we said lets come back tomorrow morning. I go on Yelp that night and see the numerous reviews and high rating and knew we couldn't leave without eating here. So the following day comes around and we go there right before noon. The line is just right out the door, but that's still better than waiting last night when it was around the corner. We start walking towards the entrance and they have the menu, which has a variety of choices yet not overwhelming, plastered everywhere. It's hard to miss. My gf and I decide to share the full rack rib meal, with beans and mac salad. Our other party members got the same thing, but beef rack. Just as everyone before me has mentioned, the rips were nice and tender. Falling off the bone. The beefy ribs were not as tender, but still very good. The full rack was good to share between 2 people. What should be noted is how tasty the mac salad is. Definitely give that a try as one of your sides. The atmosphere wreaked BBQ. There is no mistake to what kind of food was served here. Self serve refillable fountain drinks. You grab your own plates and utensils. There are helpful staff members going around asking if things are ok and if you need anything. They will gladly remove excess plates. Bathroom was clean as well. What's nice is the huge sink that is outside of the bathroom. So if you just need to wash your hands there is no need to wait to go to the bathroom. Maybe if it was only a few reviews you could say this is hype, but after 100 it then becomes the real deal. Now coming close to 1000, believe it, this place has be checked out if you are craving some BBQ.

I'm still dreaming about the baby back ribs. ÊThey were heavenly!!! ÊThey were moist and falling off the bone, the way all ribs should be cooked. ÊI ordered both the baby back ribs and the beefy ribs because I didn't know the difference. ÊHands down, the baby ribs won my vote. ÊThe sauce was perfect, not too sweet and not too tangy. The BBQ Broham pulled pork sandwich was excellent! ÊThe meat was moist with crispy edges and Êthe bread was toasted. I need to fly back down to SD again before the year ends. ÊIt's that good!

I said I would write an update when I finally had their pulled pork sammie. It's called The Brougham....not sure what that means, but who the hell cares! It's THE best pulled pork I've had so far anywhere and again, I'm a Los Angeles food snob. Deelish, smoky, crusty on the ends if you're lucky enough to get them, and the roll it comes on...wow. I usually am disappointed in most breads I get in restaurants...who wants mushy, soft rolls, yuck. Gimmie some texture baby. This one is lightly toasted, a bit chewy and I just eat all of it. There is enough pork on this to actually make two sammies if you are watching your waistline..but why the hell are you eating here if you're watching your waistline...geesh. It comes with coleslaw on it, which I'm sure is good...if you like coleslaw which I don't, so I tell them to leave it off. I actually think I like this sandwich more than their ribs which is hard to believe for this bone freak. But the pulled pork is cheaper than ordering ribs and you get totally filled up. Like $6.50, but nothing comes with it. Another $1.50 for a gigantic order of their very good fries. Ok Phils...you get a bit of redemption from me since I'm not crazy about your sauce. Your Brougham has won this BBQ lover over!!

This is my go-to spot for barbeque. The portions are more than enough and then some. It can get pretty busy; the line can easily file right out the door. I don't like that you can't reserve seats before you order but seats usually become available as people order so it's not that much of a problem. The food always comes out in a timely fashion; faster than the time that the cashier usually gives you. I hate that you have to pick and choose when you go so it won't be as busy as other times. It was definitely an ideal place to go for dinner on Halloween when everyone else was out partying and dressed up like a slutty whatever. There was a minimal-to-nonexistent line and seats were available throughout the night. Despite the long wait, Phil's is always worth it! Come hungry and you will leave very happy... and with food coma.

I haven't been disappointed once yet going to Phil's. ÊEven the line usually moves pretty quickly considering how long it can be. Positives: Extensive selection of dishes. Decent serving sizes. Really enjoy the "boneless" options for the ribs and chicken. They offer a veggie burger and turkey burger. Good quality of food. Negatives: Cant really think of any, have a hard time not comparing them to some of the BBQ from the south and east coast though (why they arent a 5 Star in my book). ÊDo wish they offered some smoked sausage and stuff like that. Lots of meat!

If you like tangy bbq, this is the place to go. ÊUnfortunately, I do not like tangy bbq. ÊThe Baby Back Rib and bbq chicken was very tender and moist. ÊBoth the coleslaw and bbq beans were pretty good. Ê Since we arrived before 12, we didn't have to wait long. ÊWhen we left, there was a line going around the building. ÊPeople love Phil's. ÊIts efficiently run and hostess is very nice. ÊYou line up, go up to cashier, order your food, pay for it, get a buzzer, get yourself a table, get your food, eat, and you leave. ÊIt's a very casual dining experience. Although I didn't like the BBQ sauce, the meat is good. ÊWe also ordered the Pulled Pork Sandwich. ÊThat was also good. ÊMy sisters like this place.

Yay for the best BBQ place in SD! I have to thank a close friend of mine for taking us there while we visited his home town! Baby back ribs.. delicious, tender, juicy, and filled with flavor. Want more? Want something better? Their pulled pork sandwich is probably the best I've ever had. It was like something off of the Food Network or something you would find in Texas or something! The line at this place is always long, especially long during the weekends, but it's worth it. The line wraps around the restaurant. You would think it would take hours to get in but for being towards the end of the line at one point it only took about 30 minutes to order. This place is fast, TASTY and very convenient!!! These are two things most restaurants try to strive for but fall short! Can't wait to go back!

I had Phil's BBQ yesterday and now my stomach is growling as I write this review because it's no longer filled with pork goodness. I came here with a large group of buddies (9 people) which they accommodated well even though it was a busy night. I had the half rack of baby back ribs with sides of fries and bbq beans for ~$12. I've tried to make bbq pork at home before and I will gladly pay someone else to do it! The ribs are tender and the bbq sauce is sweet and tangy (a little TOO tangy for my taste). The portion of fries is huge and filling. The beans were good but nothing amazing; I wish I had gotten the macaroni salad (my friend got it and it was mouth watering). To drink I had a suicide combo of ice tea, lemonade, Fanta, and Hawaiian punch (I survived!). Service here is fast once you order and the busboys are really nice. I come here once or twice a school quarter and never get disappointed (aside from the long lines). Definitely check out Phil's if you want BBQ because it's worth the drive.

Don't be daunted by the long line that will inevitably greet you at the door, it goes by fast! And plus, I'd probably wait hours to get that BBQ in my belly if I had to, it's SO worth it! The food here is, literally, finger lickin' good! The ribs are the absolute best, both the baby back & beef ribs are so meaty & saucy, they're worth every penny. I always have to wear the bib b/c I get BBQ sauce all over my face, haha. Their gigantic onion rings are also very tasty, definitely look homemade rather than frozen, & they have the perfect onion to batter ration. Good pulled pork sandwiches, good cole slaw, good corn on the cob, good everything! I always always order ribs when I come here, because no where else are ribs this good. I usually get the tickers ($6.45 each), which include either one beef rib (huge though) or 4 baby back ribs, 2 onion rings, fries, & cole slaw. A very very generous portion of food, I usually have to struggle to finish it, or accept defeat & leave a few french fries/slaw behind. So come on down & try it! Trust me, I'm from Texas & this BBQ is the good stuff!

I'm going to rate this place based off its other competition in San Diego. First off, you better run a half marathon before coming to this place, because you will leave full and fat. Ê So a friend and I came for lunch on a casual Wednesday and there was a decent line, but not too long. ÊWe ordered a rack with a couple sides, slaw and fries. ÊFood came out, slaw and fries were decent, but really, who's here for sides right? The ribs were pretty good. ÊFall off the bone tender, and extremely moist and flavorful. ÊHave I had better BBQ? ÊYes, but like I said, I am comparing it to its local competition, which is ummm... nobody. ÊOkay, that's the review from a regular person's perspective. ÊHere's the review from a critics perspective. You can obviously tell that the ribs were steamed ahead of time, and thrown on the grill to finish off. ÊThere simply was no smoke ring. ÊIs this bad? ÊBy all means no, but I like the peatiness that comes from that low and slow smoke. ÊAlso, the sauce was a bit too sweet compared to most other BBQ sauces I've had. ÊMaybe they're trying to distinguish themselves? ÊWho knows, just my opinion on it. ÊNext time, I'll get my sauce on the side, though. Now I digress. ÊIf you're from the west coast and visit San Diego, go and try it, you'll enjoy it for sure. ÊIf you're from anyplace east of New Mexico, or have had the chance to try low and slow BBQ, this place may not be for you. ****

We arrived on a Friday evening and found that there was a line around the plaza. Instead of waiting, we decided to call in our order instead. We ordered the full baby back ribs along with baked beans and fries and the full beef ribs. Based on previous reviews, we asked for sauce on the side. Our total was about $40. The beef ribs were really tender and moist - definitely the best beef ribs I've ever had. The baby back ribs were also good, tender, etc. We eat quite a bit of bbq so the ribs didn't seem all that different from other ribs that we've had. The fries were pretty greasy and the beans were not very good. We preferred the beef ribs over the pork ribs. Overall, the food here is good. The restaurant looks like it has a fun atmosphere but I probably would not wait in line just to eat here.

Been going to Phil's since it was in Hillcrest and it's by far the best BBQ in San Diego. It tastes to me like it's a Vinegar-based BBQ like North Carolina style. I'm partial to the broham which is their pulled pork sandwich, but I prefer it with the coleslaw on the side (vice on the sandwich). Price point is good and none of the sides that I've tried have been bad. It does get crowded at times, so I suggest calling in your order and asking for extra BBQ sauce. In short: If you like BBQ and you're in San Diego, you've got to check this place out.

2nd time here and it's still great, maybe better. We went in with a party of 26 and when I thought that it'll be too crazy to accommodate, it's actually the opposite! Apparently they have a policy where if you have a group of more than 6, the other groups may join the first group's that's already in line. So, we all arrived in different times but ended up at the same spot in line and got seated all together. Service was GREAT: We went around 6:00pm on a Wednesday night and the line wasn't too bad actually. While in line, we told the person that takes care of large group that we have a group of 20. 10 Min later, we told him we actually have a group of 26 and he will try to accommodate this change for us and surprisingly, HE DID. We also got our food really quick and servers often come by to check on us and making small funny comments/ small talks as well! Food: was great!! I actually finished everything on my plate and I ordered the baby back ribs/ ticklers. yummm! Will definitely be back here again!

FOOD: 1.) Ribs 2.) Beef ribs 3.) Chicken 4.) Coleslaw 5.) Onion rings = Really big, crispy. Makes me think it's a onion ring inside a Chinese donut 6.) Macaroni salad *I'm sad I'm not giving this place 5 stars after all the fanatic recommendations from friends. I'm sure it has to do with the fact brought it to-go, so could not eat the food completely hot off the grill. But otherwise the taste was good. And for someone who's not the biggest carnivore, I ate a good amount of it. SERVICE: You order and pick up at counter with a pager. They seem professional, and very well organized ATMOSPHERE: Had a sports bar area, covered out door seating. Inside is otherwise casual big chain restaurant feel.

Don't let the long line that wraps around the building scare you off... this place is well worth the wait! What else is there to say about this place that hasn't been said by other Yelpers? If you're die-hard meat eater that salivates over the description of beef/pork/chicken slathered in a sweet, tangy, and smokey sauce... cooked to perfection where the meat just falls off the bone... then you absolutely must go to Phil's BBQ. This place makes the "I-hate-getting-my-hands-dirty" eater in me want to lick my fingers after every bite. They have a wide selection of dishes and offer the "best of both worlds", allowing diners to have both chicken and beef/pork dishes! Their pulled pork sandwich is AMAZING and massive. My brother's appetite is usually insatiable, but that sandwich had him beat. Haha. Their colossal onion rings do NOT disappoint. Unless you're a big onion ring eater, I think ordering just one plate of this is just enough. I came with a party of 7 and that was enough for us! They even offer vegetarian dishes, which I can appreciate, but come on... this place is all about the meat! That being said, you might as well throw out any "I'm on a diet" thoughts in your head when you come here. BBQ lovers, you really cannot miss this. :)

This was my first trip to Phil's after hearing everyone rave about it. We went there on a Saturday night, the line was around the corner and ended up taking us an hour and forty five minutes in line. There was a sign that said 23 minutes from this point, it ended up taking 50. Aside from the wait I enjoyed the Ribs & Chicken. I liked the ribs much more here than up at Joey's Smokin BBQ or Brett's BBQ up in North County. The onion rings were also pretty good, I didn't get a chance to try out the frys. The server was also nice as well. Phil's site also has a web cam outside so you may want to check it before heading down. Very good food but standing 90+ minutes outside is not worth it to me. There is a San Marcos location opening this Fall so will probably visit that one when it opens up.

Phil's BBQ is responsible for killing the Buddhist inside of me. ÊIt was instead replaced by some of the best artery-clogging, sinfully delicious Southern food I have ever eaten. Growing up in the Bay Area, I never had a penchant for "meat" places, let alone Southern dishes. ÊSo when I tried the baby back ribs it was a great surprise to bite into something so succulent and tender. ÊTheir onion rings were also made to perfection- the onion was very sweet, the batter was deep fried to perfection, and their were made in a way that made the crunch feel satisfying without the tendency for the onion to get separated from the batter that often happens. ÊMy favorite side was the macaroni salad- its light taste was in contrast with the juicy meat. Some "mehs" include their chicken- I've had better chicken and this one tasted too dry. ÊTheir fries weren't especially noteworthy and their coleslaw had a little too much dressing for my personal taste. Overall I'd definitely recommend this place to anybody who's in San Diego. ÊI've eaten here twice already and I'm already looking forward to coming back a 3rd time.

Holy cow, over 1500 reviews? I'll keep this one quick, the food here is pretty awesome and it is impressive after moving into a location 10 times bigger than their old spot on Goldfinch, how the line still can stack up outside during lunch hr or on the weekend. Ribless dinner is what I usually get, full of flvaor and quite tasty. Not quite like BBQ in the South, but it is the best in SD. I usually get it go so since I always have a hard time finding a table.

If this is your first time here, order this: Full rack of baby back ribs with sides cole slaw and fries with a Stone Smoked Porter. After you eat this once you'll probably wanna come back and order the same exact thing more than several times. Best bbq restaurant I've eaten at, one of the must do things in San Diego. My second time here on a saturday night. The wait was over an hour and a half; their 21 minutes and 14 seconds mark at a certain point in the line is false - it actually is another 42 minutes.

This is definitely some of the best ribs I've ever had in my life. But I knew it'd have to better than the amusement park seaworld ribs. but i didn't know it was going to be THIS good. The baby back ribs were super juicy with lots of meat the tenderly just fell off the bone, it wasn't difficult to eat at all. The beef bone was just as good! But they were so different from one another it's hard not to choose just one, I'm glad I got to share it. The fries slightly resembled in-out fries, but a little bit better. Some crispy some not as much. Sadly, I didn't get to try the onion rings that I heard were delicious, they looked huge through the looking glass as you're starring in from the anxious line. I will make sure I do that next time I come back. Phil's is a definite must, if you're visiting SoCal. I'm glad we made time for this on my summer vacation. That late lunch, definitely hit the spot and made my day. The wait was probably the worst part. The sign that said 21 minutes & 14 seconds was wrong ): I was a dork and timed it, and it was a little more than thirty minutes before we got to order, but once we ordered, it was a breeeezze. we got our food in like five minutes tops.

So we came here after a day at Seaworld, recommended by someone. The line was long, stretching from the door to around the outside of the restaurant. Insanity! They do serve complimentary french fries while you wait in line! A definite plus! We ordered the food at a counter, sort of like a fast food restaurant. Then they give you a buzzer to let you know when your food is ready. You can get the food yourself or have your waiter get it. I ordered the full baby back ribs with sides of baked beans and macaroni salad. I'm usually not a BBQ person, but it was good! We shared the onion rings and those were amazing! Large onion rings too! The waiter was very friendly and efficient. Don't sit too long after your meal though, because they will politely kick you out as tables are limited. I believe this place was voted the best BBQ restaurant in San Diego...?

Lines, lines, lines every time I go to Phil's. It's okay because I am usually with 7+ friends and we crack jokes while waiting. Also, the food is worth the wait. I've tried better BBQ, but Phil's is up there in competition. I love the well-roundness of the restaurant. You can sit at the bar to watch the game, sit in the big area with family, or take it to go for eating solo. You can pick to eat a big full dinner or order light. Ordered: Full baby-back rib dinner Full beefy rib dinner Chick tickler Fries Onion rings Cole Slaw Potato Salad I especially liked the beefy rib. The chicken was juicy. The baby-back ribs were above the standard. I am a sucker for onion rings. Cole slaw on point. Can't go wrong with fries. Potato salad was standard. I am a pig. When I die, maybe they can serve my ribs there.

Simply the most amazing tri-tip sandwich I've ever had. The baby back ribs are really good and onion rings are pretty good. There is a catch though: the line is freaking insane. Worth the wait and parking is hard to find in the very crowded lot - tho maybe it was cuz it was a Saturday night - but judging from other reviews: it's always full. Their sauce is so good and distinct that SD area Costco's sell them now! The food comes out fairly quickly and you can sort of seat yourself. Or you can order ahead of time and/or take it to go. ÊPretty decent bar area as well. I'll definitely be coming back for more.

Even though the line into the actual restaurant is a long wait, you can make this experience worth it if you go with friends. The food is exceptional with many choices and the service is great! I'm basically writing this review in regards to the service the past time I visited rather than the food. I'll talk about the food first: - Baby back ribs, colossal onion rings and baked beans is about all I get whenever I eat here. The meat on the ribs slide off and is ransacked with savory BBQ sauce. The onion rings have the right crunchy texture as well as the perfect caramelized onion within. Partnered with the dipping sauce, the onion rings are heaven for onion ring lovers. Baked beans are the perfect amount of sweetness to your mouth. This is how wonderful our server was: - When he found out we were keeping some of the baby back rib bones for our dogs, he mentioned that the bones were so soft that they might give our dogs upset stomaches or other health problems (which we didn't know). Seeing how upset we were, he said he'll go in the back and grab a few real-meat bones that were going to be thrown away. We were so grateful! Not only because he showed concern for our dogs, but because he also took the time to get us those bones. If you're reading this, man, my dogs LOVED it and they THANK YOU for it! - Being my cousin's first time there, she saved a few ribs for her mother. The server saw her trying to wipe up the last BBQ on the plate before putting it into the to-go bag and so told her they supply extra sauce to-go for free! We never knew that and were once again grateful he informed us. Once again, great food + great service = WONDERFUL TIME WITH FAMILY AND FRIENDS!

GAH I HATE THE WAIT. BUT, it is soooo worth it. The line is usually wrapping around the restaurant but once you are in and you got a table, the food comes out so fast it makes you forget about the initial wait. I always order the rack of baby back ribs and fries. Their fries are okay, nothing too special but delicious when you coat it with their bbq sauce. I think their sauce is something that really stands out. The meat is very tender and always falls off the bone nicely. I sometimes hate going to this place because it makes me eat soooo much. But, definitely a fun place to go with friends and just pig out. I love it. Definitely need to try it if you are in SD. probably best bbq place in town.

What can I say about Phil's BBQ that hasn't been said already? Ê**sigh** ÊThere are no words that can describe Phil's... All you have to say Phil's and I start salivating and want BBQ that only Phil's can offer. It's different from all the BBQ joints I've been to. The wait was about 1 1/2 hrs, but they serve you Ben & Jerry's Cherry Garcia with cookies (Phil, you know exactly where to get me). ÊThe only bad thing that day was when we got to the hostess, and said we were a crew of 16 :) That's how I roll... I digress. One of the wait staff pulled us aside and said wait here with a bunch of tables that weren't pushed together and left us alone for about 10 minutes. We started to put the tables together, because we might as well do something... However another wait staff yelled at us for moving the tables and said we were supposed to be on the other side. wtf. Then they told us that we all had to order under one cashier. ugh? ok. I would have removed 1 star... but as soon as the food arrived, everything was forgiven. Yes, it's THAT good. I ordered the Tri-tip sandwich with fries and a soda, which is all you can drink. They even have Fresca on tap. woohoo! I had one of the baby back ribs, it was so tender, the meat just falls off the bone. Onion rings... mmm. beer battered onion rings. mmmmmm. I sampled pulled pork from one of my peeps.... mmmmmm. ::drools:: words. cannot. describe. PHIL's. Just be patient, chill, bring some friends... and you'll finally be able to order.

I'm usually not one of those people who have to have meat in every meal to count as a meal, and sometimes even eating too much meat makes me feel sick. Every time I come to San Diego to visit friends though, I always make one trip to Phil's. The line may seem long but it isn't too bad. I went on a Saturday around 1:15 and waited about 20 minutes. While in line, employees will tell you to feel free to grab a cup of water from inside, and they hand out menus to save you time at the front. You order from the front then pick up your food from the counter when they buzz you and you find your own table. Last year when I came I ordered the baby back ribs, which is probably the most basic and popular. Very good, even though I'm not a huge ribs fan. This year I got the El Toro because I tried some of my friend's last year and really liked it. It's a sandwich with LOTS of thinly sliced meat and their bbq sauce. When I say lots, I mean the meat is overflowing. I ordered that and a small side of baked beans and small side of fries. I was basically full off eating the meat that was overflowing from my sandwich plus the side of beans and half the fries. The sides are very sizable portions and a small is definitely enough. Good portion, decent prices, delicious!

I've never been to any other BBQ joint before so I have nothing to compare Phil's to, but my taste buds tell me that it was pretty nom. After a long afternoon at the San Diego Fair and being stuck in the parking lot for 20 minutes on the way out of that darn fair, we were starved, so we decided to call Phil's and order for pickup. Even though we called a good 15 minutes before arriving, we still had to wait for the food. I think it was 10:50PM when we arrived, and the place was still bustling! We had the baby back ribs, beefy ribs, chicken, and two sides of fries. The baby back and beefy ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender, but the chicken was dry. The chicken, I don't recommend cause you'd have to douse it in sauce to make up for the dryness. That's just my opinion though. The fries weren't crispy by the time we got home, which was a tad disappointing. Oh, on the way out, I swear we saw Phil! He even said goodbye to us! I'd never seen him before but one of my friends said it was him. Hahaha, guess I'll never know for certain.

Phil's can make some mean BBQ. Saucy, finger-lickin' good, this is probably the only time I wouldn't mind waiting an hour in line before ordering and another 10 minutes for the food to arrive. Service is great and the workers definitely know how to keep the crowd happy. The line usually wraps around the corner and down the side of the building. If you have a party of 6 or more, they'll let you in ahead as space becomes available. Come with a big appetite because with an entree and the sides, you get a lot of food; this is bang for the buck to the max. The chicken was a bit dry, so I'd stick with the baby back ribs. The ribs literally melt off the bone almost like ice cream off a popsicle stick. Grab a bib, some cold beer from the bar, and chow down. For your convenience, there's a hand washing station on the way out of the exit door so you don't have to leave with sticky hands.

Waited a very long time for this...though my friend said an hour was considered good already! Everything was delicious...fries were a bit plain, but add in that seasoning and BAM! wow so yummy! The ribs could be more tender, but I understand with the amount of people coming in that cook-time can be a problem. Onion rings were greasy and too crunchy for me, but my friends liked it. The biggest WOW-factor came from the bbq sauce, which made the whole meal a party in my mouth :)

Yes. I know that almost all the reviews say that the line is long. And it is true, BUT the line goes by pretty fast. They have an employee designated to just going through the line to make sure that everything runs smoothly, even for large parties. I went with 8 of my girlfriends on a Thruday night around 7pm. I was expecting it to be a disaster in finding a table for us amongst the rush hour, but since the employee knew we were a big party, by the time we ordered our food, they already had a cleared table that fit all of us. They even had an employee inside that was designated to the larger parties. He kept clearing our plates as we were done and brought us ranch, extra plates, etc. Service was absolutely great despite how busy they were. Vegetarians: They have items on the menu for you too! They have vegetarian burgers with their bbq sauce as well. So you still get to try what everyone raves about. Their sauce is simply the best. You will never find anything else out there like it. It is sweet, tangy, and just simply delicious!!!! MUST TRY!!!

Phil's, oh Phil's. ÊI really don't understand some of the ridiculous hype surrounding the place. ÊI read somewhere that people would take trips down from Los Angeles to come down here and eat? ÊThat's a bit far, but I suppose everyone needs something to believe in. It's very, very solid barbecue. ÊThe one redeeming thing about being saddled with teams as unsavory as the Padres and the Chargers is that you can take food like this to-go to watch your sorry San Diego-based sports franchises get pummeled mercilessly. Ê The baby back ribs-- excellent. ÊI mean, pink, charred, vulnerable to the fork, melting at the bite with delicious smoky-pork flavor, and smothered in that delicious, almost-spicy barbecue sauce. ÊThis is Lucille's on steroids. The french fries are a thicker cut of In-N-Out fries, and no, they don't taste good in their barbecue sauce, but if you dine in, they have bottles of Malt Vinegar on hand-- you know, for those of us of a cockney'd persuasion. ÊCount me in. Onion rings-- my goodness. ÊDelicately balanced onion flavor with considerable heft. ÊGiant, olympic-sized hoops of deep-fried glory served with an equally delicate ranch. ÊIf I weren't with the family, I might have gotten myself a Heineken to wash it all down. ÊBut I was. Ê Lots of college students; it's loud, obnoxious, and thoroughly delicious. ÊPhil gets four stars but a full recommendation to at least try once. As for driving down from the Holiest of Holies just to have it? ÊI love Phil's, but I've had better, too.

I knew they had to be good when I drove by and saw a line around the building!!! After that I was for sure gonna see what all the buzz was about. I now frequent them a couple times a month (great for low carbers). They are not the BEST BBQ spot I've ever had, but they are the 2nd :) The baby back ribs are so good! Fall off the bone meat is the best since I don't like gnawing on bones. The sauce is spicy and yummy. I've only tried the BBR, the boneless chicken, potato and macroni salads and the AMAZING whoopie pies!!! I of course don't have the patience to wait in a line that wraps around the building, but the to-go option is awesome :) Definitely worth the wait if you can though.

Most of my friends who are out of town always want to eat at Phil's BBQ whenever they come down to San Diego but I have always avoided the place because it's known for ribs and pulled pork, things I do not eat. ÊFortunately they did have a chicken portion to their menu and I particularly enjoyed the fact that the Chick-less Dinner, which is what I ordered, was made of boneless, skinless chicken breast, my favorite meat. ÊPortion sizes are huge, which prompted the running joke from my large group of friends to call the ribs dinosaur bones. ÊThe BBQ sauce on my chicken was delicious but I enjoyed it better with some hot sauce mixed in it. ÊIt was a perfect condiment to dip my fries in yum! ÊI ordered potato salad as my other side and found it delicious as well. I am giving Phil's 4 stars not just because of the long lines always associated with this popular San Diego establishment but because of the inconsistencies we encountered during our visit. ÊWe had about 15 people in our party and they were very accommodating to us, however, one of my friends had uncooked pieces of french fries in her plate, and another friend (who had her 4 year old son with her) had her order completely left out. ÊShe and her son ended up having to take her food to go because by the time one of the employees had realized her order was left out she and her son had eaten off of my cousin's plate and the rest of our party were almost done eating.

I've always gotten the "Best of Both" and it definitely is the best!! It comes with moist, tasty chicken and baby back ribs slathered with barbecue sauce.. mm-mm mmm! It also comes with two huge sides-- I always get the coleslaw and fries. SO GOOD! Servings are incredibly generous and service is always friendly, all for a great, affordable price!! Make sure you come at irregular eating hours though, or be prepared to wait in the never-ending line. I had to wait 2 hours on a Saturday night once. Totally worth it in the end, though!

I absolutely love Phils BBQ! I ordered the Chicken w/the ribs & a large side of fries! Totally didn't finish my dinner so I had to get a To Go box. Normally there's a long wait outside the building that can wrap around to the exit door (the other patio door) lucky me I barely waited 10minutes and then it was time to order. There's also a bar inside I think it closes at 930pm because my friends and I got in around that time and were looking forward to getting a nice alcoholic beverage but that didn't happend which was ok.

This place deserves 10 stars!!! And sooo worth the wait! Before my affair with Phil's BBQ, I was not a huge fan of baby back ribs only because of the mess (i know, such a girl -_-). But after my first visit, I was in loveee!! Falls right off the bone, cooked perfectly, and smothered in smoky & not too sweet bbq sauce. And suddenly I am not at all concerned with the mess! It's THAT good, haha. They seriously have the best bbq ever in SD and the staff is always so friendly & welcoming! I go here a lot with my boyfriend (who is a HUGE fan) and we always order the full rib dinner with all fries and a side of onion rings. As soon as we pick up our food, we shut the hell up, eat, and look at each other shaking our heads because it's just too good to be true. Serious! BEST BBQ EVER.

Simply the best BBQ in Southern California! They make the best ribs!!! The meat falls off the bone and they are covered in sauce (their BBQ sauce is delicious). The onion rings are large and similar to tempura rings. They also give you lots of fries, which are filling but could be crisper. They have combo meals that are really cheap, too. The only downside to Phil's is the very long line (could be upwards of 45 minutes at times), but this can be avoided by going at off hours or ordering on the phone and picking it up. I highly recommend Phil's for anyone looking for the best BBQ they've ever tasted.

One of our friends looked this up and wanted to try it out one night. We had about 2 other cars following us and when we arrived around 8ish...The line was ridiculous so decided to go elsewhere. We did go the next few days since we were there because of Comic Con 2011. I don't know if there is such a thing as coming in early to line up but we lined up at 5:30pm and the line was still long. After about 1 hour of waiting. It was time for us to order. The staff was very helpful because we had a large group of about 12 and they managed to look for seating for us while we ordered our food. Now to the food! I decided to get the rack of baby back ribs. Man...the ribs are very flavor full and i suggest you get a good side order to combat the taste. The rack is alot and probably was already getting full by half of the way. ONION RINGS!!!! Woot! That was really good...if you have to choose another side. Get the onion rings.

Best BBQ in San Diego!!! Hands down! I only ever order the dinner plate with baby back ribs, potato salad AND macaroni salad... with ONION RINGS! So I can't rate anything else... but what I order is perfect, so why try anything else?? The large plate of onion rings is enough for 4 to share if everyone has their own food, and probably good for 2 if you share a dinner plate with your friend/significant other. Although I've only ever had the ribs, I hear good things about the El Toro sandwich. And I've seen the monstrosity! It has so much meat that it overflows... definitely a great portion for its price! The only downside is the possibility of a long wait, but if you don't mind eating at random hours, you can get lucky and not wait very long, or even at all!

Friendly staff while waiting in line who helped explain the process. The process is similar to a fast food restaurant you order then fill your drink and find a seat. We did not like that we found a seat and then were rudely asked to move because the table was meant for larger parties. The no saving tables policy in thrown out the window for larger groups, which makes it tough for a couple. The food was good.

I think anyone who wants to give Phil's BBQ 4-5 stars is just all for formality's sake since all the evidence (featured in Man v. Food, lines that wrap around outside, etc.) proves that it serves great tasting barbecue. ÊAnd if you decide to review it and give it 1-3 stars, I would be willing to bet money that it's not because Phil's ain't good, but rather because something's wrong with your tastebuds and you probably need to check your temperature. ÊPerhaps you are sick? Anyway, I live in Los Angeles but I would be willing to drive 150 miles south on the 5 to Phil's without hesitation for some barbecue fix. ÊMy wife and I go to SD quite often for family visits and casinos and when we do, we always put Phil's on our list. I've tried the Beefy Ribs, BBQ Chicken, Baby Back Ribs, and their Colossal Onion Rings. ÊI'm not a big fan of their sides. ÊI've tried almost all of them but it's something I can do without. ÊIf you're a pure-bred carnivore like me, you'll never go wrong with their Beefy Ribs. ÊIt's just plain yumster in the tumster. ÊTheir Baby Back Ribs are good too but there was just one time I was there that for some reason, something was a tad off on the texture. ÊThe barbecue taste is there, it's just weird. ÊBut that was forgiven since it's just that one time. ÊThere's nothing special about their BBQ Chicken. ÊI mean it's good, but only because of the sauce. ÊIf you grill your own chicken at home and take home a bottle of Phil's BBQ Sauce and pour it over, it's probably just as good. I'm really not big on Sandwiches so needless to say, I haven't tried their famous El Toro. ÊBut since I've seen it featured in Travel Channel's Man v. Food, I've put the El Toro as my number one priority when I go there next. ÊI just want to see what they hype is about. If you're from the SD area, I'm sure you've tried this place out. ÊBut if you're from the LA area and have plans for some R&R in SD on a weekend, make sure to include Phil's on your list. My $0.02.

Now this place was Da Bomb too!! When we arrived the line was around the building but it moved fairly quickly. This was a full fledge restaurant and it was amazing to see so many people coming to this place, but you know what it was an awesome Beef Rib experience. Out of all the rib eating experiences this is by far tthe best Beef Rib experience ever. The meat basically came off the bone and the meat was so tender. This is the only thing I would recommend in the whole restaurant. We did order baby back pork ribs but they were not as good as I was expecting, but they were still tender. We also ordered their onion rings and the onions were sweet but yet again they were not up to par from past experiences and the chicken well that was nothing as compared to the beef ribs. Essentially this place is a self serve restaurant and it isn't a place to hang out after dinner because they have a line outside full of hungy patrons waiting to savor the meats. One recommendation is to expand their bathrooms because one for a man and one for a woman isn't cutting it.

Terrific BBQ food at very reasonable costs, with quite significant portions too! The baby back ribs fall off the bone; chicken nicely accomplished but jucy; cole slaw fresh and tasty; BBQ sauce tangy. The lengthy lines move quickly. They've got their systems nicely tuned, order at a counter, and a electronic device tells you when to pick up your food (fresh and rapidly). Attentive staff gives utensils and checks back at tables to see in the event you want some thing else. Could not believe the amount of food that we had for a party of four at $60 all included. No wonder it really is so highly rated!

Best BBQ you can have in the area, possibly all of SoCal and beyond. ÊThe meat is flavorful and well cooked. ÊThere's a reason why there's always a line! What I've done more than once is order it to go (you can skip ahead to the to-go line) and order drinks at the bar.

The patrons sitting next to me seemed to like the fact that I am a good eater 'cause they were smilin' and pointin' at me after I finished cleaning my plate.

Seriously great Tennessee-style BBQ. I came here on no particular Sunday...at 3:30PM. The place was PACKED. It's a large establishment, and there was a line out the door and around the building. Unbelievable. Not to mention this is an oddly-industrial sea-side part of town you can't quite put you're finger on. The presence of that kinda crowd was truly impressive. I skipped the massive line and headed straight for the bar, where a few things caught my attention: 1. They had several TVs turned to the NHL Network, and were showing the Calder Cup championship game. This wasn't an accident - they really watch hockey here. In San Diego! 2. The bartender was a guy's guy, with a 'tude to match. But he wasn't mean or anything. He was just a true-blue kinda bartender in a place that appears anything-but. 3. The beer is served in real American style - in super-frozen beer mugs. I had a Karl Strauss amber lager (which is surprisingly similar to Yeungling back east) and it was awesome. That aside, the ribs were great, true smoked BBQ for several hours. Tennessee-style serving slathered in a really great sauce. Not transcendent, but really great.

Let's face it... when people think of BBQ capitals, San Diego is not the first, second, or third (or top 10), place on the average American's mind, but man, does Phils BBQ slap those people across the face. OK so I'm totally not a BBQ expert of any kind, but I do know what I like and I most DEFINITELY LOVE Phils. it's a bit pricy (thus 4, not 5 stars), but it is worth it in portions cause it's A LOT. My personal order is half a rack of pork ribs, 2 beef ribs, an order of fries and macaroni salad (I don't even like mac salad, but that's just how good Phils does it!). - ok... I know that sounds like a lot of food... and yes, it is... but it's so good you'll definitely eat it all, or if you're not a professional eater, you can eat all you can and take some home for dinner/ lunch the next day. seriously though... WOW.

It seems kind of silly to write a review about a place that's already received 1,620 reviews and has damn near five stars. I guess I'm that football player who jumps on the pile even though the guy has already been tackled. Screw it. Why not? There's not much more to say that hasn't already been said. Has anyone mentioned that Phil's is perfect? Probably. Unlike a lot of drugs where people have to chase that first high, eating at Phil's for the 100th time is just as good as the first time you ever tried it. When you take that first bite of food you experience a true state of bliss and a feeling of euphoria that you wish would last forever. But it doesn't. It's all over as soon as you pull back out onto Sports Arena Boulevard. Which is why you keep going back.

I usually hate leaving mediocore reviews for BBQ because it is always a touchy subject with people. In the world of BBQ, people have their favorites and hate everything else - I'm usually not like that. So I saw the line at Phil's and had to try it. Line moves fast, employees were super friendly. The Pulled Pork shoulder sandwich was just totally blah. The baked beans had no bang to them. The onion rings were the only saving grace. Maybe i just don't like the Carolina sweet sauce (but I usually do like that), so I don't know what it was. There was a lot of meat - but it just didn't work for me. I will give it another shot on another day and update. There has to be something better in San Diego than this. I don't really trust a place that is feeding 500 people at the same time.... Seating was hard to come by

What everyone always says you HAVE to try when you go to San Diego. Personally, I am NOT a fan of BBQ. So I went in with little to no expectations. And Phil's BBQ did not disappoint the expectations I did not have. I've been there twice now. The first time I got the Best of Both: Beefy Rib and Chicken Dinner. Second time I got the Best of Both: Baby Back Rib and Chicken Dinner. I will say, the chicken is great! A+ in my book for a BBQ chicken, the amazing Phil's BBQ sauce soaked into the skin and gave chicken great flavor. But for the Ribs, you are better off getting the sauce on the side (which you can order!) since they just bomb your huge plate with sauce. Portions are large and you'll more than likely end up taking some back home, if you order the dinner like me. They give you a lot of french fries if you get that on your plate. The sweet baked beans are great, since I love those (yum yum). Macaroni salad is also good. That's all the sides I've tried though. When I went the second time, I did get some onion rings. They were great with the BBQ sauce, but other than that, I think I prefer fast food onion rings. Unless you're getting a sandwich, or a smaller dinner, don't bother with the onion rings. And finally, here's a tip for all the yelpers. CALL IN YOUR ORDER! It will save you SO MUCH TIME! You can go for the experience of eating at Phil's but I hated the hour long wait I had to go through just to eat. If you don't call in [which you state the time you'll be coming to pick up], and you stand in line, make sure you're not hungry. Though there is a staff offering some french fries to the people in line. I guess that's a plus. Phils is a place you just have to go when you're in San Diego. But once is good enough. It's not a place I would personally eat at all the time.

The food is very good here, but not worth waiting in a line that takes an hour to get through. It's just good BBQ - it's not amazing. I would have expected to be amazed by the food by the number of people that are in line. I don't know how it got so popular. Oh, and parking is really bad because it is so crowded.

Freaking good. Delicious BBQ sauce with something like cinnamon in it. Sounds weird, but it works. The veggie burger comes with two patties and a huge onion ring on top, all smothered on sauce. Yes, I get veggie burgers at a rib joint. The staff must be paid really well or be high on life because they are super friendly. My one complaint is actually trying to eat there is a nightmare with the insane lines. Ok, no worries, you think. I'll get take-out instead. But that will cost you your immortal soul in styrofoam. STYROFOAM! Minus 1 star.

Oh Phil. You make DAMN good BBQ. My mouth is watering just thinking about it... Can't go wrong with the ribs and chicken dinner. The only trouble I've ever had there is trying to figure out which sides I want. Baked beans? Fries? Baked potato? Corn on the cob? It's a tough life for an indecisive Libra like myself. Also, if you ever order from them over the phone (which I recommend because the wait is always crazy long), they'll see your phone number and call you by your name when they pick up. A nice personalized touch that always makes me feel oh-so-special!

Right. ÊI'm gonna pile on with the love for Phil's after 330+ other people beat me to it. ÊI will try. First and foremost, I am a bad ass rib snob. ÊNo one, and I mean No One does ribs like me. ÊI smoke loin backs and I do them dry and they will make you cry. ÊMy ribs will rock your universe. ÊI just don't do ribs at a restaurant. ÊI go for the pulled pork sammich. ÊPhil's pulled pork and onion rings rule. ÊA nice smokey flavor, a zing to the sauce with the traditional coleslaw on top. ÊAnd a generous portion at that. So. ÊI get to jonesing for ribs on my last trip to San Diego and I order the baby backs. ÊMy wife raised an eyebrow. ÊThe "Your Just Setting Yourself Up For Disappointment" raised eyebrow. ÊThe service was rather quick, seems we just sat down and the food was up. ÊThese ribs rule. ÊVery tender and again the sauce that has just a little zip to it. ÊThe meat pulled away from the bones very nicely but not that frickin' fall off the bones BS that corporate BBQ pushes on the uninformed and misguided. ÊNext time, I will ask for dry ribs, sauce on the side. ÊThe beans were spectacularly BORING. ÊThe side of slaw belongs on the pulled pork sammich, not with ribs. ÊPhil's has it goin' on.

One of many reasons I hate not living in San Diego... Talk about hitting spots, bring a pillow with you cuz you may need to take a nap after eating here. I absolutely love everything here but the ribs are my fav. So much sweet tangy smokey flavor all in one bite. The portions are fairly large and I would recommend getting a full rack just so you can enjoy the left overs later! Just thinking about it makes me want to move back to SD! I would pay for the gas if they deliver to San Jose.

This place is awesome. Every time I drive down to San Diego I must always stop by here for lunch or dinner. When you drive in to the parking lot you'll see that there's a long line sticking out at the entrance. The line moves fast so its worth the wait. You order and pay for your food at the registers and then they'll give you a pager and buzzes once your order is ready. You have to seat yourself at any table that is open but all the times I've been here it's packed but we're always able to find a table. But besides all that the food is just to die for. I always get the beef ribs and BBQ chicken. Everything is so amazing. If you're a big fan of BBQ this place is for you.

Going to Phil's isn't just about eating good BBQ, it's about having an EXPERIENCE. We heard about this place from my cousin . . . who is from Modesto! Now if he knew about this place from all the way up there then it has to be good. First time for us in San Diego and at Phil's as well so we really had no idea what to expect other than some great BBQ (as indicated by Yelp). So we get there and there's a small line right out the door. There's big menus posted everywhere and people are looking at them while the line gradually moves up. Finally it dawns on me that we have to order at the counter and then have to seat ourselves. Luckily we figured this out in time and were able to order what we wanted. As the Phil's experience continued we realized that almost everything is self serve--from picking up your food and drinks, to finding seating for yourself, to getting your own utensils and condiments. All the while the servers and wait staff were jovial and helpful with whatever help us noobs needed. Now on to the food . . .Phil's definitely does BBQ right. First off their portions are HUGE! From the sides to the entrees I don't think you'll go hungry at Phil's. Their sauce is right on par as well, not too sweet, not too smokey, not too tangy, but just right. I had the pulled pork sandwich while my companion had the "no ribs" BBQ. For both of our dishes the meat was exquisitely prepared, moist, and not too dry. Needless to say things got messy, but you know a place is good when they have special sinks out in the open for people to clean themselves up with. To top everything off and make our dinner even more special, Phil himself just so happened to be there that night and personally asked us how everything was. Of course we said everything was great--which it was, but we also overheard him talking to other customers as well asking them how their dinners were as well, so we knew he was a pretty sincere guy. All in all a pretty darn good meal at Phil's BBQ, great food, great service, great atmosphere, good parking . . . all the hallmarks of a great restaurant. NOTE: They are closed on Mondays. We almost got caught in this trap.

Anytime anyone mentions San Diego, I always have to say, "OMG have you been to Phil's?!?" I don't like lines, I don't like waiting, I hate anticipation, and crowds make me nervous... but I think I'd forget about all that for Phil's. The reward after waiting in an hour long line would be the deliciously BBQed meat that they have mastered. Sweet, tangy, smokey, and tender ribs. I can never decide between pork or beef... JUST GET BOTH! Leftovers are good too! Along with a side of coleslaw and onion rings. DON'T go here when you're starving because you'll probably have to wait for a bit and DON'T wear a white shirt.

Two words: ONION RINGS. Another thing that makes me smile!! Yeee! I swear, this is just sosososooooooooooooOOooo bomb. Words cannot describe the sounds that came from our mouths that night.. Well, besides those orgasmic onion rings, Phil's is a WONDERFUL place. Our party of 3 came to Phil's seeing a LONGASS line .. one that is of Kogi status. We only waited maybe about 40 minutes?! Not bad for such bombass food. I got a half rack of baby back ribs, and a large side of steamed veggies (cause somehow I wanted to feel healthy that night.. riight). The meat was really good - super tender, fall off the bone. But I didn't really like the sauce, it was good but a wee tangy for my taste. Veggies came with squash, cucumber, cauliflower, broccoli.. carrots, and ranch :D This was about $15.. sooo good/cheap. One of my friends got the full rack (you fatty I swear :P) and a corn on the cob.. my other friend got a pulled pork sandwich, which was SUPER HUGE!! It was good but a wee dry. Price you CANNOT beat though.. oh man. Our waiter was super chill, loved him :D Chris? was his name? My underage friend at the time charmed one of the servers into giving us free cups of soda.. awkward turtle forreal. But yeah.. Phil's, I heart you to the maaaaaaaax.

I sometimes wonder if my tastes are getting too pretentious. ÊI was a little reluctant when my cousin first suggested BBQ: ÊI've had my share of overcooked meats doused in sauce at BBQ places. ÊI'm so glad we came so I could be proven wrong. Glancing over the reviews, I have to agree about one thing with those who give a lower rating. ÊThe wait here was epic. ÊYes, epic. ÊYou could make a modern-day remake of the Odyssey in which Odysseus is returning from the Iraqi War and stops here to get food. ÊHe endures trials and tribulations in line here for 10 years before finally returning home to his wife. I'm sort of giving this place a double standard: I know I'd give it 3 or 4 stars if I lived closer. ÊHowever, being an out-of-towner, I'm more focused on their food quality and not how practical it is to dine here regularly. ÊThe food is divinely complex. ÊI rarely experience what I call flavor-layering: when the food's flavor transforms in your mouth one or more times. ÊI'm writing this review from a month-old memory of this place, but I recall tasting herbal and savory melt into charred and sweet. ÊI tried some of the baby back and beef ribs, both of which were quite delicious. ÊThe macaroni salad was also surprisingly refreshing. If I were in SD on a weekday afternoon, I might try coming back here to avoid the Greek mythology. ÊIf I didn't get the chance, though, I'd still recommend this place as something to try at least once.

What place has the best ribs? There is no doubt that Phil's BBQ ranks the top on my list. I was referred to this place by friends and no doubt their ribs are unlike any other place I've been to. Be advised that the portions are pretty much huge. I ordered the Beefy Rib Dinner (3-rack) and later that week I ordered the (5-rack) because of the amazing serenade of the meat the first time around. I was certainly not disappointed. The potato salad won't be like the ones you order at the store, they use potatoes cut into wedges. The fries are to die for. The onion rings were the best, I didn't know the smallest order of the onion rings would be so huge on the plate! The line for Phil's BBQ can be long so it is advised to get there at least before 5pm. My friends and I arrived before 5pm and we were able to order and get seated particularly fast. Normally the wait is very long with lines going all the way around the store. This is no surprise because of their famous BBQ ribs. Verdict: Next time I make a pit stop in San Diego I will be back here again! They basically take all major credit cards including Discover (which I find rare)

This review is overdue. I came down to San Diego over the 4th of July weekend to see my grandparents and extended family visiting from New York, and the 9 of us ended up coming here for lunch one of the days. SERVICE: They're smart. They found the most efficient way to serve all the anxious people waiting in a 1+ hour line. You wait in a line. Order your food. Seat yourself. And wait for your order to be called. Simple. There's a whole lot of counters with workers taking orders and you can see them working as fast as they can. Dude, they probably get fired if they don't work very fast. So we came here around 11:30 and ended up waiting about 15 minutes. However, when we left around 1, the line wrapped around the restaurant and the wait was probably an hour. FOOD: We ordered a whole bunch of different things off the menu, probably all of the side dishes, caesar, a little chicken, and lots and lots of baby back ribs, but this is what sticks out Êfrom my memory: 1) THE BBQ SAUCE is to DIE for. There's just the right amount of sweetness and spiciness. It isn't overly sweet like most barbecue sauces. 2) The pork falls cleanly of the rib and melts in your mouth. There's none of that rubbery fat on most ribs. You don't have to work to eat your ribs. You can even knife and fork your ribs. First time in my life I didn't have to get my fingers too gross eating ribs. AMAZINGGG. 3) Mango Iced Tea is strangely delicious. They say that the drinks are self-serve, but a busgirl asked us what we would like and brought over our drinks. 4) I don't know why but the order of fries as a side dish is SIGNIFICANTLY larger than everything else (cole slaw, baked beans, etc.) 5) Free pens!! BEST BABY BACK RIBS EVER. I'll definitely be back the next time I visit SD.

It's a different kind and style of BBQ. ÊTheir beefy ribs are huge. ÊI feel like I'm eating a cow's leg or something. ÊAs for the sides, I usually just get fries and macaroni salad. ÊA meal can be split between two people. ÊComes with a full rack, two sides, and some BBQ chicken. I understand how people may dislike this. ÊTheir style is more on their tangy sauce than anything.

I hate to oversell this place, but man this was the best bbq restaurant I have ever had. We actually didn't eat at the restaurant because I heard about how crowded it can get, so we ordered out. It seemed to be a great idea because on a Saturday Morning, I saw the line, it reminded me of Disneyland with the twisting lines that gave you an indication of how long it would take from this point. We ordered the beef ribs, pork ribs and chicken - all were amazing. The rub they used for the bbq was so good, that on our way home to LA we bought the rub and the sauce to replicate the flavor. But beyond just the flavor of the meat, they cooked it to perfection. The pork was so soft and tender that it slid off the bone. The beef had just the right amount of char and bbq too give that wonderful smoky taste. And the chicken was tender and juicy all the way through. When we tried cooking with the sauce and rub at home, it was good, probably better than any bbq sauce we tried, but we didn't quite have the skill to cook it in the perfect way that they do.

The boyfriend and I travelled 140 miles to come back to Phil's. Yes, we drove for almost 3 hrs because the food is just that good. This time we came at 2PM on a Friday and it was only a 10 min wait. What a relief! We got the ribs again but this time we got the full rack. Who knows when we're coming back here?! The ribs were very, very tender and succulent. Nicely seasoned and drizzled with their special bbq sauce. I absolutely loved the tangy, spicy kick to it. I loved it so much I bought a bottle to take home!! As for sides, we got fries, coleslaw, corn on the cob, and onion rings. The fries were super fresh. You can tell they cut and fry them right then and there. It's like in-n-out fries but thicker. Absolutely delicious with ranch, or with the leftover bbq sauce from the ribs. The coleslaw and corn were both very standard but also necessary sides, especially with all the meat and bbq sauce you're devouring. Now the onion rings was the absolute best. They're HUGE rings and the batter is just perfectly done. Not too thick but not too thin. And when you dip it in the ranch, it is just melt-in-your-mouth-goodness. No other way to put it. Be sure to get a small order because these portions are huge! I am a bit relieved that this place isn't closer to me because if it was, I would definitely contribute to the obesity epidemic!

One of the best places for BBQ in the SD area! ÊActually, the only one that I would even consider going to in SD. ÊThis place has the juiciest baby back ribs and a tangy sauce to go with it. ÊIf you go, you also have to try their onion rings. ÊCan't go wrong with giant rings deep fried to crispy and golden bites of goodness. On the weekends, this place gets ridiculous packed.

After having several friends and acquintances tell me of this place, I was itching to try it. Then one day, I had another friend tell me that Phil's ribs were far better than my favorite over at Mr. Cecils. That was it. Now I definitely had to go and taste the competition. Well, as I found out eating at Phil's is a lot more difficult than I thought. The first try was on a Sunday afternoon and the line was down the sidewalk. So we get in line and after about 15 minutes, I decide to walk up to the front and get an update on the wait time. 2 hours? How can that be? Apparently, they sold out of all the ribs and the next batch wouldn't be ready until then. So the first attempt was a failure. After this I was a little nervous, sold out plus a line down the street. Could Phil's be better than my favorite spot? The second attempt was during a visit to the hospital, down the way, where a friend was being attended to. Unfortunately the line, again, was too long and we didn't have the time to wait since we needed to get back to LA. 2 strikes. Man... the food must be really good! Was what I was thinking to myself. Well, third times a charm and I finally got to experience Phil's. This time it was my mom, my brother and I and we ordered the BBQ Chicken and the Baby Back Ribs. Once inside, I realized that Phil's was much larger than it appears from the outside. After 10 minutes of waiting our food was ready. The smells in the air combined with all the people chowing down, my anxiety was building. I couldn't wait to sink my teeth in. The sauce was tangy with a hint of spice. If you love getting down and dirty while getting sauce everywhere, you'll probably like this spot. Think Carl's Jr., " if it doesn't get all over the place, it doesn't belong..." For me there was a little too much sauce. I like being able to taste the meat, then seeing how the sauce compliments it. The meat was tender, but didn't fall off the bone as easily as it could have; which could be a result of how fast they turn over the food. Would I go back? Probably. Is it better than Mr. Cecils? Not even close. Happy me! I have recently heard that Phil's is now located by the Sports Arena. So, I'll have to stop by my next time in SD. Stay posted for a follow up on the new location.

This is the best BBQ Place that SD has to offer period. Im from Missouri and have been to the American Royal in Kansas City many times, so Im pretty picky. I really like the BBQ here: order the babyback for sure and come with an appetite b/c youll want more. :) I dig the small bar they have on the left, good selection of beers & friendly staff. ÊI like how they have the draft handles completely fozen. Im sure they are running the dead lobster next door out of business, maybe they could tare that thing down and expand the sports bar. :-) Its a real treat to eat here, plan forgiving eachother for manners when you visit, its messy, and your lady wont have any fun here unless she has a healthy appetite. Id suggest just bring the bros and let her have a girls night out.

Best ribs I've ever had! ÊThe meat just falls right off the bone, and is sooooo goooood! Beer battered onion rings are great, as well as their fries. ÊTry their buttermilk sauce for dipping. ÊIt's delish. I guess the only con would be waiting in line, but it's so worth it!

I'm from the Bay Area, but I often think of Phil's BBQ to motivate myself to take a trip to San Diego. ÊTheir BBQ is just amazing. ÊThe only negative side is that this place is ALWAYS CROWDED. ÊI can't count the number of times I've driven by and seen a line outside that wraps to the side of the building. ÊI normally call my order in for pick up on my way there to avoid their 45-60 minute wait. Ê Now let's talk about the food. ÊTheir beef ribs have to be my favorite thing on the menu. ÊThe "Fred Flinstone" sized bones they give you is enough to stop your arteries in it's tracks. Ê The reason the portions are huge is because when they cut the ribs, they skip every other bone so it's almost like getting two ribs per bone. ÊTheir sides aren't bad but I wish they would give you bigger portions to accommadate your massive order of meat. ÊPersonally, I go to the Chinese restaurant in that complex and order some rice so I can bring it to Phil's. ÊWhat can you say, I'm truly Filipino! Overall, this is definitely my favorite BBQ spot. ÊI often fly back home with a couple of individual beef bones stashed in my luggage =)

Okay so everyone knows the obvious...Phil's has the best BBQ in San Diego. ÊWhat else can you say about a fantastic heap of ribs and a gigantic side of onion rings/fries. Ê But the best part is the sitting in the bar. ÊHopefully this won't screw up my Friday tradition but have to say it....sitting at the bar is the best way to go at Phil's. ÊIf you sit at the bar, you can order your meal there. ÊIf you sit in the bar at the other tables, you have to order your food in the huge line that everyone else is standing in. ÊOn top of it all, you get to watch all the good games. ÊIf you sit at the bar on a Friday, Johnny will behind the bar. ÊHe's a great guy and if you become a regular, he takes good care of you!!! Ê I also have to give a shout out to Josh, the manager!!! ÊHe is always checking out to make sure that everyone in the restaurant is taken care of. Ê This is a great way to spend a Friday eve! ÊSee ya there.

Let me be Phil's 775th review! LOOOOOOVE PHIL'S. Their onion rings are to die for. The line is not. I went this past weekend and maybe it was because of UCSD's graduations but dammmmn we waited in line for 30-40 minutes to order! But the cashier was so nice and gave us three free drinks for being so patient. Phil's has got their system DOWN! Got a table within 3 minutes after ordering and got our food within about 10 minutes. Love the Half Rib Dinner (comes with 7-8 baby back rib bones + 1 large side or 2 small side) - can easily be shared. Wish I had gone to Phil's more when I was living in SD.

I didn't like it much ..... Not vegetarian-friendly. HAHAHAHAHA. I know. I know. Sounds dumb. But yes, I went out here with my family and I am the only one who doesn't eat meat. So, I ended up eating nothing but fries and mashed potatoes. Good thing I wasn't hungry in the first place. I give it an average rating, because the mashed potatoes and fries were alright. The fries though kinda bland were good with the Creole seasoning =D. And if you buy soda ... it's all you can drink. So I was happy. So, if you're a vegetarian ... you prolly don't want to be stuck here. (One could probably already tell that by the title of the restaurant though ...) =/

Last night we tried Phil's for the first time. ÊActually Phils catered a lunch at my work last year, but I don't remember too much about it so it was a refresher for me. Ê Ê I did a phone order and drove over to pick up the food. ÊMy goodness.....I had no idea the magnitude of operation that is Phils BBQ. ÊThere was a huge line out the door... on a weekday!?! ÊFurthermore, I was given a pager just to pick up the food. ÊThat was a first for me. ÊIt took good ten to fifteen minutes to get my food and I was on my way to feed my hungry wife ( and myself....and Mollie the dog ). Ê I ordered the Beefy rib and chicken combo and wife got the half chicken. ÊRibs were excellent. ÊChicken was....well, it was chicken. ÊUnfortunately, instead of concentrating on the chicken, wifey was more interested in the ribs, and rightly so. ÊThey were pretty bomb. There were enough for leftovers which we had for dinner tonight. ÊFor the portions they give, Phils is a mighty good deal.

No kids allowed ++ 7. Sangria. Beer. Sangria. Beer. 6. Saucy *muah* 5. Chubby guys in miller lite t-shirts. 4. Licking awesome sauciness off beef bones (note: do this in bar area only). 3.

I decided to give this place another go about a month after my initial review. ÊThis time, I brought my gramps along. ÊAnd because I love him and don't want to subject him to the Phil's Friday lunch line, I phone in to dine in. ÊGuess what? ÊIt worked. I can't hate. ÊThey put a lot of effort into service. ÊFrom top to bottom, everyone in this organization is friendly and helpful. ÊEven on a phone in to dine in, you need to find your own seat. ÊBut it's a good thing the busboys are VERY responsive. ÊNot much later after finding a seat, we already had someone cleaning up the previous occupant's mess. ÊIn another five minutes, our food was ready. ÊThey don't screw around here. The food is a lot better than I gave them credit for, though I still maintain I've had better BBQ elsewhere. ÊEverything I've had there is well-prepared, which is impressive given their speed. ÊToo bad the food is a bit overpriced. ÊBut it's still a good establishment if you want BBQ, or something close to it.

I like this place. I found it on Yelp while I was in San Diego and decided to go there on a Monday. But the weird thing is they are closed on Mondays, so I went back on Tuesday for lunch. The line was almost out the door, but it was very fast service. The only thing I didn't like was that they didn't have macaroni and cheese and I wanted that. The sauce for the BBQ was yummy. I would go back if I wanted BBQ in San Diego.

"Bar- B Licious" [First impression] Where's the line?! We beat it! As soon as we got there, the line started building up-- fast! But this place is huge and operates smoothly. The staffs are friendly and open doors for you. With so many great reviews and an extensive menu, it's so hard to choose. You really can't go wrong. It's nice to go with a group of people and have everyone get different things. That way you can share. The portions are plenty so not to worry about not having enough food. [Suggestion] *Onion rings are crisp to perfection! *Have everyone choose different side dishes as well. From macaroni salad to fries to cole slaw-- there's no going wrong here. [Tip(s)] *Come just before the lunch hour to beat the line.

If you live in San Diego there are two things your are going to eventually try: Phil's BBQ Ribs and sufing. This is a San Diego institution and by the looks of the line outside the door and around the corner they are doing 1000 covers a day, and the volume of business they do at the end of the day is about as mouth watering as their pulled pork sandwich. Bottom line is Phil is a rich man. You have to try the beef ribs but if you're not a sauce fan

So after hearing/reading all the hype from San Diegoans and Yelpers, I had to try Phil's and was a tad disappointed. NOT because the meat wasn't good but because the hype had me expecting more. The meat was super soft and it DID fall right off the meat like people claim, but I didn't like how it was drenched it sauce. The half chicken we ordered looked like it took a dive in a bucket of sauce and made its way to our plate. The sides I got (coleslaw, macaroni salad, beans, and fries) were good. I personally love the beans and coleslaw. Nonetheless, my mom, sister and I killed 1.5 rack of baby back ribs and a half chicken. We ate more than the two guys that sat next to us... The wait wasn't too bad. We went around 2:30 in the afternoon and it was still poppin but we got our food in ~15 min, so I can't imagine the wait for dinner! But yea. Unfortunately, the hype knocked a star off for this place for moi.

ÊAll of which were delicious! Beef ribs were my favorite! ÊTender, not tough, left with a clean bone! ÊThe sides got astonishing reviews from friends as well as the tri tip and pork sandies.

I ordered a small fries which are bigger than Mcdonald's LARGE. And one baby back rib because I wasn't too hungry-- though later I stole a friend's rib. The fries are those huge fries that I hate so much! You know? The one with a lot of potato and no flavor or crispiness? BLEH. The ribs were excellent though. It does melt right off the bone and the flavor just bursts in your mouth.Our server was very nice and genuine although he forgot the waters we requested for. Basically if you're a girl, you should share a meal of ribs and fries with each other. Theres no way you can finish it by yourself... I could barely scarf down the 'small' fries'. If you're a boy, well lemme tell you a story: a cashier said that my friend was manly enough to finish a large and Êhe's the one who ended up giving me another rib. :] It's ok, we headed to a bar after where he then proved how manly he was.

Carnivore treat - BBQ RIBS and BABY BACK.. If you like then this place is a must try while your in San Diego. This place has over 1000+ review, so no need me to convince ya'll... I was sold on this place when I first smelt that bbq aroma pulling up to the parking lot... Ê The wait here can be a downer. There is limited seating, and you will wait at least 45min - 1 hr. Incredible fall off the bone texture, and a bbq sauce to match that quality. ÊIt is all about the sauce that really makes this place delicious and unique. ÊThe bold vinegar based sauce that has a real nice spicy untone. Good sides orders too (fries and onion rings) A++ for me. I like, and would recommend Ê=)

For those who love Phil's BBQ, I can see why. The meat on the bones fall off easily. The sides have been well thought out and prepared. The sauce has a tangy familar taste. For those who could care less for Phil's BBQ, I can see why. The meat lacks it's original flavor. The sides... well they're JUST sides. The sauce... that familar flavor is tangy watered-down spiced ketchup. I've have had the baby back ribs, full rack, pork... it falls of the bone with no problems, lacks the full robust pork flavor (maybe they should consider a better choice of cuts), but it maintains the charred flavor well. The half chicken was dry, I seriously don't recommend this unless you just love chicken. The potato salad was good, to be honest the sides didn't make enough an impression on me that I care for them. I still have to try the pulled pork & tri-tip sandwiches. ÊBut I'm a little surprised on the lack of main dishes. If this is San Diego's best bbq... then I'll meet you half way and consider it a staple for bbq in SD.

ÊJudged up against the other BBQ options in San Diego, I'd give Phil's SIX stars if I could. Lots of deliciously tangy sauce smothered all over my meaty ribs? ÊHeck yes.

ÊSucks big time, so call ahead and get your BBQ tastiness to go. ÊThe vibe inside is kitschy as can be, but what BBQ joint isn't?

Be prepared to wait at least an hour in line just to order. The line wrapped all the way along the building, being a non-local I was not prepared for such a large crowd! But thankfully most of the wait is in the shade and they try to be as quick as they can by serving everyone with menus. I thought it was a nice touch that one employee came around with a huge plate of fries for people in line to eat. Got the pork baby back rib half rack with baked potato, and my friend got the huge onions instead. The ribs melted off the bone and was very meaty. The baked potato was so-so, a little irked they had silly little charges for butter and cheese, but who really comes for the sides. My friend and I loved the fries too. Worth the wait.

Came here with a friend for the first time and was kind of surprised that there wasn't that many people. I then realized that we got there a little a early before the lunch rush because when we left the line was around the building. The service here is awesome! Everybody that we talked to was very friend and helpful. They all smile and is always willing to help. An example is one of the employees asked if we needed help find a seat and found us a table, even though this place seems more of a seat yourself restaurant. Also it's self serve drinks but an employee saw that my cup was empty and offered to refill it for me. I ordered the Baby back ribs and the chicken combo with fries. First the bad, the chicken was nothing special, it just tasted like regular chicken with sauce splashed on top of it. The ribs were pretty good compared to some of the other places that I've had. My friend got the tri-tip burger, which i thought was the best thing that we got. It was juicy and was big enough for one person. The environment of this place is a restaurant but also felt like a fast food joint since you have to find seats for yourself and also get your own drink refills. But it also seems like everybody was in a good mood from employees and cos customers. Over all i would come back to Phil's BBQ again but try something different. Also i would recommend this to anybody who's looking for a good BBQ place.

The food tasted just as good as the scent in the air smelled. I was a little worried we wouldn't be getting a table walking up since the line was long. I couldn't of been more wrong. We zipped right thru the line and had a table before we even made it to the front. The food was reasonably priced and tasted delicious. Also all the employees were extremely friendly. I definitely recommend this place.

This place is always packed. I suggest going at an oddhour so you have a seat within a reasonable amount of time. There nothing on the menu i do not like. My parents take me just to see how much meat I can consume in one sitting. So why the three stars? My friend Athena is a vegetarian who considers bacon a treat; it is sort of the same with me. I prefer to eat healthy and not feel blotted after. I know it is my own fault but it is Phil's and I do not go that often. Maybe I should take Athena here?

This is good bbq and I'm from the south so I'm a total snob. The food is great the entrees, the sides, all of it. The portions are very plentiful putting it mildly. It's definitely worth it for the price. My only complaint is the line...as soon as the place opens there's a line around the side of the building that moves at a snail's pace. And there are these little signs are 10 feet or so telling you how much longer your wait is...I feel like I'm waiting to get on a ride at Disneyland. Could you guy's stop being so popular already.

ÊThe beefy ribs are Huge and they are definitely delicious. ÊI can eat a lot and I usually struggle a bit to finish this.

I really like Phil's, but I would never ever actually eat at the restaurant. The line is simply too long, and the place is always packed. I got take out recently and I still had to wait a total of 40 or so mins for my food. I really enjoy the smoky flavor of their chicken and their baby back ribs. The pulled pork was neither here nor there, though the fries were crispy and the coleslaw was really tasty. My suggestion- make your own pulled pork with a pork shoulder and a crock pot, and buy the pack of Phil's BBQ sauce at Costco. I did that this past week and it was delicious and satisfied my craving for a good BBQ meal. I didn't even have to wait in line!

After Years And Years Of Hearing & Reading The Raves, I Finally Decided To Order Some Saturday Takeout At The Sports Arena Location. Good Thing It WAS Takeout, Since The Place Was Full & The Line Out The Door At 11:25, & They OPEN At 11:00!! I Ordered The Half Baby-Back Ribs Dinner W/ Beans & Fries. As I Do With ALL The Take-Out Baby Back Ribs I Order, I Put A Dollop Of Bulls-eye On The Side, Just In Case The Sauce Doesn't Really Measure Up;MY Mistake! They Are Easily THE BEST, Fall-Off-The-Bone BBQ Ribs I've EVER Tasted!! The Ribs Were QUITE Meaty, Barely A Trace Of Fat On Them For Being SO Juicy. & The Sauce Is Perfect, Not Too Spicy Or Too Sweet. & For A "Half Portion" Dinner, They Sure DON"T Skimp!! The Plentiful Fries Were Fries;But The Beans Have A Nice Little Kick To ÊThem, Unique From The Usual Baked Beans Side Fair You Get At A BBQ Ribs Place. As A Natural Bodybuilder, I Can Only Allow Myself A Baby-Back Ribs "Cheat" About Twice A Year; But I'll Know Right Where To Make A Bee-Line For Them EVERY Time, From Now On!!

The world famous Phil's. Shared a full rack of baby back ribs, coleslaw, baked beans and onion rings with my boyfriend. The quality of the meat is the best I've ever had, but the sauce wasn't sweet enough for me. Maybe it's vinegar based or something, but just not my favorite choice in sauce. Baked beans were eh, skip them and get the fries instead. Coleslaw was so good! But the onions rings we SO GOOD...best onions rings I've ever had! Super crunchy batter and HUGE, a must get when you come here. The wait was about 45 minutes on a Saturday night and having to actually wait in line was a bit funny, but it's all part of the experience I suppose.

Seriously one of the best BBQ i've EVER had. The baby back ribs are the best! I've had the beef ribs and it wasn't as tender. Haven't tried the chicken yet so i can't say if that's good. But if it's your first time at Phil's, get the baby back. I normally get the full rack because I don't mind having leftovers for a snack later on or even the next day. Long line!!!! So bring some entertainments. They do phone orders, so you can avoid the line and pick up to go :)

I've waited more than 4 months to go eat here cuz I'm not that close to San Diego and there hasn't been Êa chance to go until last night. SO SATISFIED. Read the yelp reviews and thought the wait was going to be horrible; we got there around 9(they close at 10pm) and only waited for about 20 minutes, not bad at all. I got the baby back ribs and chickless. after tax its a good whole number $13. ÊFood was prepared within 10- 15 minutes and it was one of the best ribs i've tried. I got fries and macaroni salad for sides, and i couldn't finish either cuz the portion was pretty big. I ate all the ribs and the chicken though. The BBQ sauce was amazing too. Next time i'm going to get the coleslaw cuz my friends said it was good! I definitely recommend you guys go check out the place but I wouldn't wait for 2 and a half hours, that's apparently how long the wait was last weekend.

I don't usually like pork but this stuff was so good and the bbq had the best flavor I've ever experienced in the realm of barbecueness. The potato salad was good as well. Lots of dill and red potatoes which I like. I had some of my friend's fries and they might have been the best fries I Êhave ever tasted. Maybe. They were pretty impressive. This meal was pretty cheap too. I would definitely recommend this place but I'm not sure I'd want to wait 40 minutes for it.

Phils BBQ I have been eating here for years when they where downtown , The new location is huge right off sports arena blvd , if you go there for lunch or dinner be ready to wait . El toro sandwich is really good. The BBQ chicken is the best .

Alright San Diego, I know Phil's comes highly rated for bbq, but for your information, this isn't real bbq. Ê I asked for any brisket and the guy stared at me like I was talking chinese. ÊSo I went with the "El Toro". ÊA monster size sandwich with two slices of bread and a ton of sliced tri-tip in between coated with sugar-sweet bbq sauce. ÊNo pickles, no lettuce, no "fixins" between the meat and bread. The cole slaw was okay and the potatoe salad was two thumbs down. The fries were pretty good. If you're ever near Austin, TX there are tons of great places to eat the true best bbq you will have ever had in your life. ÊSpecifically, places like The Salt Lick or Rudy's. Ê Texas, Kentucky, and Tenessee are the three main variations of real bbq. ÊCalifornia....stick to your fish tacos and carne asada fries. Leave bbq to the South.

We finally made it out here. We were always kind of weary to go b/c of parking and the long waits, but it actually wasn't bad at all! I'm used to waiting for barbecue - back where I went to college on the Central Coast, we had a restaurant that had great bbq. We've been trying to find something to compare to it down here. Well - what else can I add with 300+ reviews? We had a great experience. I ordered a Beefy Rib Dinner with 3 bones - boy, was I in for food overload! The meat was tender, the BBQ sauce was flavorful, and the mac salad was great. My husband ordered the Best of Both with ribs and chicken. We definitely had to get to-go boxes, there was so much food! And so - I think the price point is great for what you get!! The servers/busboys/floor people were very attentive too, which really helped with the experience. Next time I'll know what to order - less!

Service: SO GOOD. ÊFrom the first person that greets you at the door, to the few employees that are walking around making sure that you are satisfied while chomping down on some good ol' bbq, service is awesome!

Hit up this place today since im in San diego visiting and my oh my, just stepping out from the car, the smell of bbq filled the air & i was salivating. I ordered the beefy ribs with chicken and 2 small sides of macaroni salad & fries for a very affordable price of $11.95. I was really really hyped of for the ribs because everyone was raving about it, but i was kind of let down when I took a bite. The ribs were ok, but I've had better. Texas Smokehouse in SJ is much more better. The BBQ sauce however was really good. The chicken was ok as well, just enough flavor & not too dry. Another person in our party ordered the rib tickler and that was very tender and good. We also ordered small onion rings & that was really really really oily, crunchy, but oily. I would come to this place for the atmosphere, it's nice and big and service was ok, the food wasn't bad, but i will probably return on my next visit to give this place another chance, seeing that so many other people love it.

This is the best BBQ in San Diego, hands down! ÊThough it's important to note the caveat....in San Diego. ÊThere is far better BBQ out there, in other cities, but here we have Phil's. Everyone I know raves about the ribs, but for my money the BBQ Broham (pulled pork sandwich) is the best thing on the menu. ÊIt's as close to Memphis-esque BBQ as you are going to get in San Diego County. ÊThe El Toro (sliced tri-tip sandwich) also gets high-marks if you are not swine-inclined. The only bad thing I can say about Phil's is when you have a hankering for BBQ the most (say on a weekend afternoon), the line seems to be the longest. ÊThose lines that weave out the door are such buzz-kills when you are cruising down Sports Arena Blvd looking for your fix. Ê The line does move quickly, but then finding an open table is more difficult. Ê And I guess if I'm bitching here, I have to say that old location in Mission Hills was much better in the ambience department. Phil's caters...which is a God-send. ÊIt's extremely convenient and well-priced.

Honestly folks, I've dined at Phil's BBQ for years, primarily because it's been the only "halfway decent" bbq restaurant in San Diego. ÊMy honest opinion of this place is that it's over-rated. ÊDon't get me wrong, the food is pretty good, and the prices (for some items) are reasonable, but having to wait in the line outside just to order, then having to wait in line again inside just to find a table, then having to deal with the noise & chaos (especially at the beverage station) makes it almost not worth it. ÊThis is certainly not a relaxing dining experience, but if you don't mind the lines, the noise, and the wait, then this may be for you. Ê Personally, I recommend the House of BBQ on India St. (near Washington St.). ÊThe food tastes almost the same, the prices are comparable, and you get full service at your table in a much more relaxing environment! But if you do decide to try Phils, I recommend the Broham sandwich (shredded pulled pork on a bun with "average tasting" coleslaw). ÊThe meat is good, though nothing to write home to mother about. ÊI've also had the "Chick Tickler" (3-4 chunks of boneless, skinless bbq chicken breast served with fries, slaw and 2 onion rings). ÊThis is pretty good, though I've always felt the chicken could/should be more tender. ÊAnd I'd like a more tasty coleslaw. ÊTheir's is ok, but again, I think that Kraft dressing poured on shredded cabbage tastes better. Ê I've also had the "Rib Tickler" (3-4 bones of pork ribs, fries, slaw & 2 onion rings). ÊIt's good, but again, I don't think it's worth waiting in line for. ÊI've also had the "Chickless Dinner" (5-6 chunks of bbq chicken breast with choice of 2 sides). ÊOrdering corn on the cob for some reason counts as 2 sides (I love corn, but always feel cheated...corn should only count as 1 side!). ÊThe corn at Phils tastes pretty much liked boiled corn, tasteless, nothing like the bbq corn on the cob you can get at the fair. ÊBut the fries at Phils are fresh cut and pretty good. All in all, I'd say that Phil's is good, but only at times when there is no visible line outside. ÊIt's really not worth the wait, go to House of BBQ about 2 miles away and enjoy the same thing in a much more relaxed ambiance!

It's good here! The workers are nice & friendly. The food is pretty fresh, get ready to get a lil' messy-it's barbecue now! The place a decent menu size, but I was thinking more of Southern bbq before coming to this place, so I was looking forward to mac & cheese, cornbread- but none of that was found. I got the menu item where you get to select two things ribs & chicken, the ribs were fall off the bone good, which I haven't had for awhile, so I was surprise with chickless (boneless & skinless). The chickless was easier to eat. Rubs are always messy. Next time I'm going to eat the potato salad and/or macaroni salad. Both items looked good as I was checking out the others tables. Be prepared to do a little self-serve, which is better because it makes the dining faster, get your own drink, find your own table, nothing too harsh. Although, the line is long outside it moves pretty quick. The reason this place gets a 4, not a perfect 5 is because the food did not seem to be marinated too long the flavor sat on the outside of the food for the chickless, but I understand since there was no skin to absorb the flavor, the ribs were really good & flavorful. Service: 4 Stars, the people are helpful & patient, even if you have questions. Food: 4 Stars, fast & descent flavor. Atmosphere: 4Stars, it's what you expect for bbq. Cleanliness: 4 Stars, the table was a little stuicky when we first arrived, but it was cleaned immediately. Overall: 4 stars, not a bad experience at all. Would I come back? Yes, as long as it's on way to the beach again =).

ÊI've only eaten at the restaurant once (have you seen that line around the building?). Ê The meat is just fall off the bone tender. ÊThe sauce is tangy flavorful wonderfulness. ÊWe order ahead, zoom through to pick up, and leave in 5 minutes flat. ÊWhen you call, they have your information in the system, the staff is friendly, and they give you extra sauce. and then when you've cleaned off every single bit of food and sitting on the couch with a full belly and sinking into a nice food coma.....how could that not be just utter bliss? ÊI am SO GLAD I'm a carnivore.

Oh My Stars! ÊIf you haven't had Phil's then you're definitely missing out! I've been a frequent customer but only just discovered the "Tickler"! ÊYour choice of the chickless, baby back ribs, or beefy ribs with fries, onion rings and your choice of a side. ÊCHEAP! ÊUnder $10 bucks. ÊJust sayin' if you're on a budget, this is the way to go. ÊI can eat so this was the perfect portion with a great price.

BBQ broham for me, Eva had the beefy ribs and chikletts plate, and my kids mowed through the kids meal combo! ÊThis was my second time here, 1st with a review, and what really struck me how good of a place this was when we pulled up last Saturday, it was raining, it was 2pm, and there was a line out the door with a 25 minute wait! ÊAre you kidding me? The reason we went all the way to Pt Loma on a rainy Saturday was exactly because it was raining! ÊI posted a quick video I shot with my flip cam on facebook because I was really amazed that people come from all over the county to eat at this place. ÊWouldn't you be? ÊOh, an hour later, after savoring San Diego's best BBq....there was STILL a line! Good on you Phil!

Reading the reviews I thought that this place was going to be overrated... but it is soooo not! Their food is seriously DELICIOUS. This is what we ordered: BABY BACK RIBS (delicious and very tender) COLESLAW (refreshing and complements the baby backs) CORN (cooked perfectly. my 2 1/2 year old chomped on it like it was her last meal) ONION RINGS ( perfectly crispy.. it was so good with ketchup. liked it better than the ranch they gave with it) Their food is so good that they don't even need good service.... but that is so not the case. I wish that all food establishments were as friendly as Phil's. My family LOVES this place. Every time we go to San Diego, we will definitely make a stop to Phil's!

Only 4 stars, because the line is so long! The line was wrapped around the building... - The baby back pork ribs are so tasty! So flavorful, there nothing you ever had. - The onion rings are gigantic! - The prices are reasonable. - Our waiter was super friendly, and fun. He was very attentive, and throwing jokes here and there. The food is so awesome! It's a must if your in San Diego!

I came here after reading all the 5 star reviews and wanted to experience the OMGBBQAWESOMENESS that everyone's experienced here. Ordered a rack of baby back ribs with a small side of beans and fries. Ê Fries were ordinary. The portion of the small side of beans were so small, it was...cute. ÊI know it's a small side... but still. ÊA friend pointed out how the beans were ordinary as well, "a bbq place should specialize in beans, it's part of the bbq experience". ÊAnd I agree with that statement. Baby back ribs were drenched in sauce. ÊI like sauce on my meat but it was too overpowering. ÊI like tasting meat, and sauce...not SAUCE and meat. ÊCapiche? I did like the fact that the meat just fell off the bone. Ê We know of another place that has more meat on the bone and has meat, and sauce so we'll hit that place next time. Ê Phil's bbq gets an A-OK from me.

This is good BBQ if you've never left San Diego in your life. But if you venture outside of the 92110 zip code, you will find better... First of all, it should be against the law to call yourself a "BBQ restaurant" if you don't serve beef brisket. Who the f**k are these people! When I asked the girl where brisket was on the menu, she looked at me funny and said she didn't know what I was sayin'. Really?! It's bad enough that they don't serve it here--BUT THE FACT THAT THEIR EMPLOYEES DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT "BRISKET" IS MAKES THEM LOOK LIKE FOOLS. This is the way I see it: even though Burger King doesn't serve Big Mac's, I'm sure the people at Burger King know what a Big Mac is. So, since they didn't have what I wanted, and I was beyond the point of no return, I ordered the boneless ribs plate with a side of potato salad and macaroni salad. Pretty tasty, excellent portions, prepared quickly. For those of you who sympathize with my brisket concerns, I recommend BRETT'S BBQ. Excellent brisket sandwiches (if you don't mind driving to RB). Service is always excellent too because the owner is usually floating around the place. If you make eye contact with him, he will introduce himself to you and make friendly conversation.

for my 100th review - phils A+ for the quick friendly service, clean restuarant, hi-quality meat. I had the baby backs and wouldn't say it falls right off the bone (but pretty tender). Also I think the sauce actually takes away from the good meat. way to strong for my liking. but factor everything great place.

Yum yum Love love!!! I love this place, when I move this is going to be one of the places I'm going to miss the most. ÊI always get the baby back ribs with sauce on the side. ÊI'm not a huge fan of bbq sauce so its nice to dip as i eat and get just as much bbq sauce I want. Ê The cole slaw is my favorite ever! its not to mayoie and still has a nice crunch. ÊTheir onion rings are amazing! They are breaded just right and they don't hurt your mouth when you eat. ÊThey also make good potato salad and mac salad too. ÊOh and their corn on the cob is fresh and never over buttered or over cooked! Ê The pulled pork sandwich (broham) is more than enough for one meal. ÊTheir chicken is good, and sometime a little dry but still very flavorful. ÊTheir beef rib is big enough for me to just eat one and be happy. Ê Oh and if you think they might skimp on their salads, nope! They make their Caesar salad dressing and its light and amazing! I sometimes drive there not for bbq but for their salad. Ê I love this place I can't express how much. ÊIf you are planning on going be prepared to wait in line but you can always check out their website because they have a camera showing their line so you know just how long the wait is! They are so smart!!! Oh and if you sign up for their email list you can get to the front of the line on your birthday!!!!

What is there to add to the almost 1500 reviews? I just want to profess my LOVE, along with SO many others.. of Phil's. I LOVE this place. i don't live in the area, but on and off, for the last 3 years, when i make a drive down to SD (from Santa Monica), or i have sisters who do, i will make a point to stop by, or have people bring them back for me. I've tried a variety of menu items, and my favorites are: Beef ribs (HUGE, and satisfyingly meaty), baby back ribs (not falling off the bone, but tender and yum nevetheless), and Chicken (oh so tender and juicy). The sauce is a little spicy, and sometimes it feels more spicy than others. Its a preference. I like it (sometimes, it has too much vinegar after taste that assault my nostrils, and i dont love it so much), some people don't. Just wish maybe they offer a plain non spicy version, to cater to kids or people with milder palette. The place gets packed. Came at 11:30 am, line out the door already. But it moves. So just be patient. And once you are in, the food won't be too long. Seating is self serve, tho the host/ hostess directs you to an area. Get ready to be eat messy, spill some sauce on your shirt, and be stuffed.

Does Phil's really need another review? ÊProbably not, but here it is anyway... Having been thwarted in my last attempt to try Phil's (they're closed on Mondays...whaaat), I was more determined than ever to stick out the wait. ÊAfter all, there's got to be a reason why the line wraps around the building like a Disneyland ride well before the usual dinner hour. ÊAnd with its woodsy decor, the establishment does sort of evoke the Splash Mountain ride...except that the critters are what's for dinner. I came here with a group of seven for Brother's graduation dinner. ÊYou're supposed to find your own seats after ordering, but for larger parties they expedite the search. ÊThank goodness for that because we were HUNGRY and didn't want to think about waiting some more for seats to open up. Thinking that it would take too long for seven orders to cook, we strategized and split up the ordering. ÊIt didn't really matter because the food came quickly enough. ÊAnd onto it... The Good: - Beefy Ribs: ÊBrother raves about these, and he was right to. ÊI'm not usually a fan, as most of the beef ribs I've tried have always been so sinewy, and I'd rather not end the night with half my meal between my teeth. ÊBut these really are the closest you can come to "falling off the bone." ÊI liked it so much I abandoned my own baby backs and helped my mom finish her plate. - Coleslaw: Nothing too special about it, but of all the sides this was the best. ÊThe cool freshness really helps cut through all the heaviness of the meat. - Baked Beans: A tinge of sweet...the small portion was just the right size to avoid a night's worth of gas and indigestion. - Potato Salad: I'm not a huge fan of potato salad, but this was also pretty good. ÊThe potatoes are cut into huge refreshing chunks. The Meh: - Baby Back Ribs: I usually love pork ribs, but these were kind of dry. ÊMy mom commented that she makes them better, and she does; hers are way juicier. - BBQ Sauce: Salty with a kick, it overpowered my baby backs and I couldn't taste the natural flavor of the meat. ÊNext time I'll ask for it on the side. - Macaroni Salad: Bland, like eating plain noodles. - Steamed Veggies: Okay, you order steamed veggies not expecting much, but my mom complained the broccoli was hard. Overall the food was decent, but it definitely wasn't the BEST barbecue I've had (try Bludso's!). ÊI was also missing some of the other BBQ usuals like tri-tip, brisket, and pulled pork (they've got some...but in sandwiches). The best thing about Phil's is probably the value. ÊIt's cheaper than other places and the portions are Flintstones-sized. ÊFor what you pay, the food will do.

Go here. It's the best barbecue in San Diego. I don't eat red meat and I still love it! If you're vegetarian, there are a couple options, mostly side dishes and while not entirely healthy, the macaroni salad is to die for. Only downside: the restaurant's popularity some times results in a long long line out the front door. The line actually moves pretty quickly, but can take up to 30minutes, and the delicious smell of barbecue while you wait in line makes the wait time seem even longer. SO, go early, go often, go barbecue!

This place sure fills your rib cravings, and makes you want to come back for more!! Their baby back ribs were awesome -- with meat falling off the bone, and not too fatty! ÊThe sauce was a euphoria of tastes all coming together-- sweet, tangy, smokey, with a little spicy kick.... yummm! ÊThe sides were just sides (we tried the french fries and potato salad). ÊOnce you enter, you just order and sit down. ÊThey will buzz you when your food is done. ÊThe food is well-priced with decent service, and no place comes close to the quality/taste!! We'll def be back for more!! Ê May I propose a Northern California location?!?! :)

The last time my boyfriend and I were in SD, we headed to Phil's BBQ and were discouraged by the long line that wrapped around to the back of the building. "It must be worth it to stand in a line that long..." But we were so hungry so we decided we will be back another time. This weekend, my boyfriend and I took a mini-trip to SD and the first food stop? Phil's BBQ. 5 pm, Friday evening, the line was just out the door. It is counter service, so when we got to the front of the line, we were ready with our order because it breaks up into about 6 cashiers... ordered, took our pager, got our drinks, sat down and buzzzz pager went off all within a matter of 5 minutes... I hurriedly tie the bib around my neck and I dove in. Bib is optional. I wore white. We ordered chicken and ribs. Sides: sweet baked beans, potato salad, fries and baked potato. The meat is so tender, so juicy, so flavorful. The sauce is sweet and tangy with a tiny tiny kick of spice. The baked beans were sweet and the texture was just right (not too beany, not too saucy). The potato salad was good. Tasted traditional. The fries were good. Normal fries. That BAKED POTATO WAS THE NEXT BEST THING. It was soft and warm and it melted in my mouth... it was soo good. The meal was almost perfect! Personally, I believe a slice of watermelon would have topped it off. Anyway, I was so full. I wanted to come back for Phil's BBQ for dinner the next night but the boyfriend said, "It was good babe, but we should try other foods too since we're here." Okay... :( The next next best thing (after the chicken and ribs and baked potato) was the PRICE! So damn cheap for all this delicious slathered meats. Cheap. Fast. Good. Period. Phil's BBQ. Thank you. We will be back. Soon. By the way, it would be so great if you opened one in OC or LA somewhere... it. would. be. so. great.

Wow, I could smell the hickory scent from Phil's as I pulled into their parking lot. ÊAs I walked closer to the restaurant, I could see the line snaking to the end of the side of their building. ÊTotal wait time ended up to be an hour and 10 minutes to get to the cash register, and another 15 minutes for the food to arrive. Their beef ribs were semi crispy on the outside from being barbecued, yet the meat was still juicy and almost falling off the bone. ÊIt was easy to eat, yet still somewhat messy from the BBQ sauce. ÊTheir was a hint of hickory smoke flavor and tangy BBQ sauce in every bite. Mmmmmm. The BBQ chicken was surprisingly juicy was well, since many places barbecue their chicken pretty dry. ÊNot at Phil's. ÊIt too had a hickory smoke flavor and was slathered in the same tangy BBQ sauce. I had the corn on the cobb as a side, which was large and sweet. I've love to eat at Phil's again, but the wait is just too long. ÊNext time I'll phone in my order for pickup =)

Waited over an hour to get Phil's BBQ but it was definitely worth it! What's great is they have time markers posted throughout the line, so you know approximately how much longer you have to stand in line. We got there pretty late and the line was still ridiculously long, so we knew this place was worth trying. After waiting for so long, you can't help but want to order the entire menu! We had the pork and beef ribs, I definitely liked the pork better. The BBQ sauce is amazing, to the point where you'll find yourself licking your fingers. The beer battered onion rings are delicious!! The corn would have been better if it was roasted rather than just boiled, but it completed the meal. Definitely worth trying and worth the wait!

For years, I've passed by Phil's BBQ and was slightly intimidated by the long lines I've seen this establishment have. After seeing this restaurant being featured on the Travel Channel's "Man Vs Food" (no food challenge - Adam Richman just ate there) and a few friends of mine eating there, I decided to give Phil's BBQ a shot. I got there around 2pm and was at the sign posted "20 Minute Wait"...The wait wasn't that long to my surprise (approximately 16 minutes) and I ordered the Babyback Ribs/Chicken Combo. It didn't take too long for my order to be done so I soaked my teeth into first, the Babyback Ribs...The sauce was excellent and the meat was falling off the bone. I had the same experience with the chicken and the tanginess of the BBQ sause had my taste buds wanting more. I also ordered onion rigs and was I ever into a surprise...a Huge one. The onion rings were gargantuan in size and it didn't disappoint. Now your wondering why I gave Phil's BBQ only 4 stars instead of 5... The truth be told, even though this was excellent BBQ, it's definately not the best. I've gone to quite a few University of Southern California (USC Trojans) Tailgate parties in my lifetime and they make the best Ribs ever...with Phil's BBQ coming in a close second. I highly recommend this place...it has a great atmosphere where friends and family can enjoy. The prices are pretty decent and I see a lot of social activity going on in this place...

There's tons of other reviews for this place so I don't know if there's much I can add. ÊI've gone here twice. ÊFirst time, my fiancee and I had beef ribs and the El Toro, the BBQ tri-tip sandwich. ÊIt was good but not as good as I thought it would be. ÊAdam Richman from Man v. Food described the El Toro as "without a doubt, one of the best beef sandwiches" he has had anywhere. ÊKnowing that Adam Richman has literally had BBQ and other food throughout the country, I had really high expectations. ÊDon't get me wrong - it wasn't bad and in fact it was really good. ÊJust not as good as I was hoping. So why 5 stars? ÊBecause I had the pork baby back ribs and the Big Broham the second time I went. ÊNow THAT was worthy of all the hype and praise in the world (although neither dish was featured on Man v. Food). ÊThe ribs were incredibly tender and had great flavor even without sauce. ÊHeck, it's so good that you really don't need Phil's very tasty BBQ sauce. ÊWith it, however, it goes to the next level. The Big Broham is a pulled pork shoulder sandwich. ÊThe smoky flavor of the pork really stood out. ÊLoved it. ÊGreat. ÊNow I got myself hungry just writing about it but I live 100 miles away. ÊUgh. The long and short of it: go for the pork BBQ!

Phil's is the only restaurant where I would ever subject myself to the torture of an hour and half wait at peak dinner time just to get some food. The hype is real and the baby back ribs are hands down the best you'll get in San Diego. The ribs are fall-off-the-bone good and the bbq sauce is a mix of sweet/tangy/spicy. Don't bother getting anything else besides the baby backs. I've had the broham sandwich, the el toro, and the beef ribs and those were just okay. If you don't want to endure the long waits, try going on a weekday around 12:30pm-1:00pm or on a weeknight (not Friday) around 8:00-8:30pm. It's usually not crowded during those times. Saturday nights seem to be the craziest.

Phil's BBQ is the best barbecue place that I know of. Compared to Lucille's BBQ, not only is it cheaper it tends to taste better! The ribs are nice and tender and will make everyone except the biggest of critics happy. They also give quite a bit of fries which is a nice touch. The only downside is that the waiting line can tend to be quite long! Luckily they serve in a fast food style where you take your order up in the front and pick up everything yourself. I tend to prefer this style for large parties.

phil's is probably the most successful restaurant in san diego. a second location recently opened in san marcos. i usually bring my out of town guests here. one time we decided to estimate how many lbs of ribs get served each day. we figured about 4500 dine-in customers during busy days and 800 takeout. that's a lot of freakin meat, and money. i usually order the baby back ribs. i recommend getting fries and mac salad for the sides. sometimes the ribs are too saucy. i also found the chicken to be really dry. don't get the burger.

Hubby suggested we eat here since he read good reviews on this place and he said he saw this on the Travel Channel. ÊAs we pulled into the parking lot I was shocked to see the line wrap around the restaurant. ÊJust seeing that made think maybe we shouldn't eat here. ÊHubster was adamant on eating there so he decided to wait in line while me & the kids stay in the car. ÊHe called me again once he was near the front of the restaurant. ÊSo the kids & I walked over and waiting in line with him. Ê We ordered: The Full Rib dinner w/ 2 small sides (fries & coleslaw) Half Chicken dinner w/2 small sides(macaroni & potato salad) Colossal onion rings It was simply delish! ÊLoved the way the meat just falls off the bone and the BBQ sauce is excellent! ÊI wasn't much of a fan of the chicken. ÊThe onion rings were great especially dipping them in the BBQ sauce! ÊThe sides were not a disappointment either! Ê Just to make it short & to the point it was good! ÊPlanning to go there again.

Everything here is soo good! The pork ribs fall off the bone, the beef ribs are nice and rich, the chicken is smoky, the beans are sweet, the coleslaw is cooling and is a great balance to the bbq, the fries are absouletly amazing, the onion rings are to die for, and the bbq sauce is tangy, smoky, sweet, and spicy. Best of both is a great choice if you're not sure what to order. Expect a line and a waiit of at least 30 minutes but its worth it. If you're in a rush, call in and order to go. Best BBQ is all of California!!

The wait for us wasn't as long as people said, we waited about 20 minutes and got a seat at the bar. My boyfriend and I shared the babyback ribs and pulled pork sandwich with onion rings and a side of macaroni salad. The ribs were fall off the bone delicious however the pulled pork sandwich wasn't really to my liking. I guess it's because I'm not a big eater of pork but my boyfriend seemed to enjoy it. We were very full and satisfied. I would come here again, and again, and again.

I unfortunately work in the office complex behind where this Phil's BBQ is located. ÊI say unfortunately because I really wish they would go away. Ê My coworkers and I were so excited when they opened the location here, and we all went there quite frequently in the beginning. ÊMy company also holds meetings occasionally at their Events Center. The food is just average, definitely nothing to rave about, but my real beef is with the absolute chaos that the restaurant has brought to the area. ÊThey are the worst neighbors! They took over several prime parking spots with all of their delivery trucks. ÊIn spite of designating so many good parking spaces for their delivery trucks, they still park them illegally next to their building, blocking access to other open, unmarked spaces on our side of the complex. ÊOn top of that, their employees park on our side of the complex, including in a few spots that my company specifically designated for our own clients. ÊOn Mondays when we get to work, we often find empty Styrofoam containers, rib bones, and Corona beer bottles and tops scattered around the parking lot. ÊAlso, since they moved into the area, a few of us have had our vehicles hit in the parking lot, including myself. ÊNot to say that it is the Phil's BBQ employees, but it seems awfully coincidental that it started happening around the same time that the restaurant moved here. I think they just need to move to an area that is much less congested, preferably a larger stand-alone building with its own parking lot. ÊThat way all of the masses of employees and customers have sufficient space. ÊThis little office complex is just way too small.

I've been here many times and there is always a long line, but it moves pretty fast. My usual is from the best of both worlds menu which includes ribs and chicken and two sides. I love the baby back ribs, boneless chicken, and coleslaw. The fries are ok, but I need carbs with my meal. The only thing they are missing is some bread. The meal is pretty large for an average person. I like to share :)

The most delicious thing bbq you will ever eat. I got both ribs sets the pork and beef. The beef are huge, however they are both delicous. You would be a fool to not try them both in your lifetime. They are worth the wait Êeven if over and hour. The meat is tender, falls of the bone and magically passes your teeth and gums as they venture into your tummy for total satisfaction! Love this place!

I always thought the point of good bbq was to so slowly roast meat that it would be soft and tender to the touch. Good bbq falls clean off the bone and doesn't need to be massacred in sauce. Phil's is not quite there. Got there at about 5pm on a Tuesday and ordered their baby back rib and chickless dinner with steamed veggies. My order was done in 5 minutes, and it was just ok. The ribs were tender, but they were absolutely drenched in what tasted like a ketchup-based bbq sauce. The chicken was overdone and dry. At least the ribs had decent burnt ends, but that's about all I can commend about the place. I don't understand the hype.

When i was going in the parking lot my JAWS just dropped because of the long line outside the restaurant. In my mind I was thinking to myself this must be bomb. I finally sat down got my food. When you come and eat here prepare to get your hands and face smouthered with PHils famous BBq sauce. I tried the BBQ broham sandwich, BBQ chicken, the BBQ ribs, and of course the onion rings. Nothing beats phils onion rings. ITS A MUST! out of the chicken and broham the ribs were theeee bestt. very high energy and super friendly employees. no wonder it has so many 5 stars

ÊI don't live in San Diego anymore, but I always make a point to eat at Phil's when I'm back to visit. Ê I love the chick tickler/chickless dinner... the chicken is high quality (never any icky fatty bites), and the sauce is a perfect balance of sweet and spicy. ÊCorn on the cob is my favorite side, and the onion rings are a MUST. ÊMake sure and get buttermilk ranch for those rings, too! ÊThe veggie burger is pretty delicious too, if you're not into the whole meat thing. ÊYUM!

Phils BBQ. This place is AMAZING. Friendly staff members and amazing food. I love this place. I always starve myself the day I plan to have Phils. The pricing is great. It's not expensive for what you're gonna get. I always get the BBQ baby back ribs with fries and cole slaw. AMAZING combo. They give you like 50000K pounds of fries!!! Coleslaw is amazing too. I haven't tried the beef rib yet cuz I know I haven't had ENOUGH of baby-back ribs. LOL. ( I had baby-back ribs like at least 15 times) I never want to stop going to this place. Thank God they're opening 2nd location. Also, here's the con. They're closed on mondays... :( What do I do if i'm craving Phils on MONDAY!!! PEOPLE GO TO PHILS~~ :D

found this place on yelp and told my native sd friend that i was coming here and he was jealous and told me that it was worth the wait. so i had some high expectations upon coming here. it took us over an hour to get through. thank you phil's for putting benches outside to sit on otherwise i would've been grumpy! the setup at phil's is a bit different. once you're inside, you order and pay for your food first and get a beeper. you then find a place to sit (luckily we only had 4 total and were able to find a place to sit rather quickly). when the beeper goes off, you pick up your food and proceed to chow down. we ordered the beef ribs, baby back ribs, onion rings, and potato salad. the beef ribs were humungous!! very tasty and perfectly fatty. however, i am a pork kinda girl so i enjoyed the baby back ribs more because it was more tender and just melted in my mouth. the onion rings were mediocre, but the potato salad was pretty tasty. we split those with 3 people and weren't able to finish the meal. all of that with a soda came to be around less than $20 per person. i will definitely be visiting this place again the next time i go to sd. i'm so glad i tried this place!!

Honestly, I can't think of any reasons why this shouldn't be five stars. ÊPhil's is synonymous with awesome BBQ here in San Diego (at least amongst my friends). ÊThis place can be a little pricey depending on what you get, but the guarantee is that it is worth it's money. Until my first Phil's experience, I don't recall ever having eaten beef ribs. ÊI probably have but I never realized it because I've grown up on baby back ribs (pork for those of you who don't know the difference). ÊThe beef ribs are my personal favorite because the meat is so tender and doesn't stick to the bone like super glue as some other places. ÊThe fries are deep-fried and seasoned perfectly. ÊThe fresh-battered colossal onion rings are the best I've had in my life. ÊThere is no way to describe how much food that is if you get the full beefy rib dinner with fries as its large side and a large order of the onion rings. ÊIt usually makes me VERY full if I share it with only one other person, so I usually suggest sharing that order among three or four people with another order of just ribs. ÊAnd you can never forget about the fantastic barbecue sauce they make at Phil's. The service here is excellent too. ÊThe cashiers work fast here and do their best to keep the line moving because it can get extremely long (note: if you're not patient, this would be the worst possible place to go to if you go at the wrong time; wait times can range anywhere from 30 minutes to nearly two hours sometimes). ÊThe bussers (especially this one black guy) are VERY nice guys. ÊThey are always so kind to bring plates, utensils, and wet-wipes before you get your food and are always asking how you're doing. In the end, you really have to go there to experience it for yourself. ÊAny native San Diegan who has lived there for at least five years and has yet to try Phil's BBQ should be ashamed of themselves. ÊThis place is the standard for great BBQ in my opinion.

THe Best BBQ I ever had! I was also really hungry and it was my first time there, but I just remember my first bite into those baby back ribs I was just like woww this is sooo gooodd!! THe pork baby back ribs are sooo tasty and perfectly tender!! Every bite was tasty, even the parts not covered in bbq sauce, which shows that it's not just mediocre bbq slathered in bbq sauce and the sauce is the only reason it's good. THe meat itself is really tasty, well marinated, and every piece was perfectly bbqed, moist, tasty, and not burnt. Between the two of us, we got a full rack of ribs dinner with fries, a half chicken, onion rings, and a side of macaroni salad. We were sooo full!! We couldn't finish it all. The baby back ribs were definitely my favorite part of the meal! I would come just for the ribs, and the rest of the stuff was just okay, just complements to the ribs. The onion rings (when hot) were really tasty, they have this unique intense onion taste that are much better than other onion rings i've had before. The rings are reallyyy big! BUt once they got cold, they weren't good, so i could've done without it cuz i was soo full already. The large fries that comes with the ribs dinner is pretty large, they were good. But fries are always good so not much to say there. THe macaroni salad was meh. could've done without it. The chicken was good, but chicken is just not tasty liek pork. I'm just not a chicken person, cuz chicken compared to the pork had no taste, i could only taste the bbq sauce. We also got beers. They had Fat Tire! We went on a Sunday around 8 pm, and there was a longggg line wrapped around the whole building!! The price is worth it for what you get. I will definitely come back, and usually I don't like hyped up restaurants, but this one is definitely worth all the hype!

MUST Have's at Phil's BBQ: Baby Back Ribs-- quite simply amazing. Tender meat that falls off the bones... I am not a big meat eater and am not so much into BBQ, but I would convert if all BBQ and baby Êback ribs tasted like this!! Onion Rings-- Their batter is crispy, sweet but thin enough. The onions are layers of thick juicy sweet onions. Each bite is a perfect combination of sweet onion, crunchy salty batter, and the ranch dip is the perfect match for such an amazing onion rings. The small order is pretty large, definitely enough for multiple people to share. Corn on the Cob-- I feel like I am in the middle of summer at a family backyard barbeque eating this corn on the cob. Crunchy, sweet, and fresh. Just like summer. Baked Beans-- Baked beans! Enough said! They are delicious!! Yummy enough: Chickless- breast meat not on the bone but smothered in BBQ sauce. Chicken was a little dry and chunks of breast meat were kind of large, but it was definitely still yummy. Potato salad- red potato salad, with skin, and crunchy celery. Maybe rosemary? It was yummy enough... but not a must-have!

I would love to give Phil's 5 stars, but the few times I've been back, their food has taken a bit of a fall from the first time I took first bite. Lol. I always order the half rib dinner or the half rib and chickless combo, with a side of beans and french fries. ÊI've tried their bbq burger, and it wasn't the best. ÊIf you decide to come to Phil's, do yourself a favor and get a full slab of the baby back ribs, it's in it's own league, not like the nasty Chili's baby back ribs. I've also tried the onion rings and pul pork sandwich, those are also good choices. ÊThe potato salad and macaroni salad aren't that great, but I'm not a big fan of "salads" that use any type of mayo in it. Okay, reason why I gave only 4 stars is because the past 2 times I was there, the ribs were NOT fresh out the oven. ÊThey were room tempurature and the sauce didn't have the "OOMPH" it usually has with it's sweet tang that bites your tongue after each bite. ÊThat's and the line on Friday - Sunday are horrible, especially when you have to fend for your own table and act creepy while standing next to a table while there's still people eating at it, LOL. ÊThey should improve their hostessing and at least try to do table seating. Buy yourself a glass of sangria or pitcher of heffen. and you'll be good to go. ÊWear a black shirt and loose jeans too!

This place is the best! Ribs were unbelievable, as was the chicken. Both were pretty lean, yet very tasty. I would recommend getting the chicken and ribs plate. I also had a pulled pork sandwich which was very good, but not quite as good. Macaroni salad was decent, but baked beans were very good. They also have a good beer selection as well, I had a brown ale from a local microbrew that was outstanding. Atmosphere was good as well. Lots of classic rock music, and they know how to cater to bbq lovers with paper towels and a hand washing fountain. When the waiter cleared my plate he even gave me a moist toilet and toothpick!

I can't believe I haven't reviewed Phil's BBQ before today! ÊThis is one of my favorite places to eat! El Toro! This is a must have menu item in my opinion. El Toro is their deli-sliced steak sandwich. ÊThe meat is always tender and juicy! ÊThe Broham, their pulled pork sandwich is also a fan favorite. ÊI am not a big fan of pork, and even I love this sandwich. Quite honestly, I have not found a menu item that I do not like at Phil's BBQ. ÊI am not sure that is saying much though because ever since I found the El Toro sandwich, I order it EVERY time now. The line can sometimes wrap around the building, but it usually moves pretty quick. ÊIf you have a large party, make sure you send them off to find one of the larger tables before you place your order. ÊIt is seat yourself, so you have to plan ahead a bit. ÊBut all this "trouble" is worth it when you get your food. I may not be a BBQ connoisseur, but I still say this is THE best BBQ in San Diego.

Being that I'm not a BBQ person, I'd have to agree with the majority of these other reviews; their BBQ is by far, probably the most delicious I've had. ÊI've been to the south and I've tasted some fine BBQ, but Phil's comes pretty close with a hint of their own unique flavoring. Ê Though the line to wait for a seat can be a real *bleep* it's all worth it in the end. ÊMy favorite would have to be their Chickless dinner with a side of beans.

Last time I came here i got the lunch special with 1 BBQ beef rib, coleslaw, fries and 2 onion rings. For under $7 it's a great deal. I don't think the beef rib is the best I've had. In fact, aside from being really meaty, I think its average. On previous occasions I had the baby back ribs and I think they are some of the best I've ever had. Warning: There is usually a pretty long line here. If you are ordering to go, it's a good idea to order in advance by phone. The food will be ready in like 20 minutes.

This place is constantly packed with mostly middle aged men, police and navy dudes in their uniforms. They've figured out that this place is relatively cheap and decent food. This being said, maybe they should have been the dead give away that this food is not healthy and if you succeed in finishing your plate, your stomach will writhe from food overload? The drink bar is my favorite. There's over 20 options, this place even carries Crystal Light. -- I appreciate their drink bar, it puts a smile on my face. The atmosphere is awesome. You order at the front and pick up your meal. No waiters which means you don't have to put out extra cash for a tip! I love this place, but I don't love their BBQ sauce, which is unfortunate. Its super sweet and thick. I prefer a vinegar sauce, but thats my preference. Overall BBQ meat is moist, but the sauce is too sweet. The sides options rock! The drink selections are awesome! No wait service -- but employees will stop by to ask if you need anything! Lots of food for little cash! (meals range from $6-$18 with most options in the $6-12 range) Atmosphere is awesome.

Although not the cheapest place, it's where I go for my fixing of baby back ribs and hot corn. The ribs are falling off the bone, slightly burnt, tangy, and saucy, but not overly saucy. The corn, which is still in the husk, is awesome. Simple, hot, buttery. Love it. The sangria at the bar is also pretty good. Perfect to sip on while you're waiting for your order. I hate the wait and sitting at a loud place to eat so take out is perfect! Service here is awesome too...once they forgot to give me my corn and straight up just gave me one just like that. No questions asked. I wish I could see this place on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives.

I could have sworn I already wrote a review for this place, since this is after all one of my favorite places in San Diego. The barbeque is legit. ÊI think supposedly their bbq broham sandwich is supposed to be the item that they are known for. ÊI almost never get that though because their ribs and chicken are so good that I will exclusively get the ribs and chicken combo. Ribs - whether you get baby back pork ribs or beefy ribs they are always cooked to perfection. ÊI dont think I ever had a time where my ribs were too dry or overcooked. Ê Chicken - the chicken is delicious. ÊMany chicken places have issues with cooking chicken and they come out dry. ÊI understand that because I can never cook a chicken at home that is not dry. ÊBut Phils has apparently mastered the art of cooking chicken because it always comes out moist and perfect. ÊThe chickless (boneless chicken), on the other hand, almost always comes out dry, do not get that. BBQ sauce - whatever they do to make their secret recipe, o man it is the best BBQ sauce ever. ÊJust the perfect amount of tangy-ness so that it isnt over powering. Finally, sides - when you order, get the macaroni salad. ÊIt is the best macaroni salad out there. ÊThe fries are good too, but the Mac Salad is where its at. ÊUsually you can order both so this is not a major concern.

Oh, how I love Phil's for my BBQ fix. I understand that there's differing opinions on what "great bbq" can be---smoked? low and slow? it's all about the sauce? NOT about the sauce? etc... I, personally, am a fan of tender, slow-cooked bbq, with a smoky hint of sweetness, and a touch of vinegary-goodness accompanied within the sauce. I am an avid fan of bbq sauce. Phil's has delectable sauce and there baby back ribs are fork tender. I usually get the baby back rib tickler for less than $7.00 includes a large helping of fries, two huge pieces of onion rings and slaw, and three-four baby back ribs. You really can't beat that price and I leave with a full and content stomach. Hubby loves getting a sandwich and adds slaw to it. The reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because the LINE is ALWAYS long and it's sometimes difficult to get seating...but regardless, I will still continue to go here for the bbq fixes.

The only place to go for BBQ in San Diego. I've never been to big bbq cities like memphis or st. louis, but i would imagine that Phil's would even compete with the likes of them. I always bring anyone from out of town to phil's. Pros - I've had both the baby back ribs and the beef ribs and both are excellent. The baby back ribs are tender and fall of the bone, and the beef ribs are pretty massive if you like a little more meet. The only rings are great to. I usually also prefer to get the sauce on the side for the bbq just so I can control how much sauce is on there. The busers there are also really kind and friendly, they go out of their way to help. Cons - If u come around dinner time expect a long ol line.

I would have rather gone with a 4.5 here but there is no option to do so, going to St. Louis has kinda ruined me on San Diego bbq. At any rate you won't find any better bbq in the COUNTY of San Diego then Phil's. ÊIt has great prices, incredible food, great proportions a decent bar... what else could you want? ÊI would recommend every fan of bbq stop in some time and enjoy a wonderful meal.

Great ribs whether you're into pork or beef. GREAT quality/value! GREAT proportions! GREAT selection of sides (although a salad would be nice to balance out with the meat, cole slaw is excellent, but the mayo in it still resides on the heavy side) And they have beeeeeer yay. Definitely a favorite BBQ joint in S.D. The only thing that prevents me from giving it a 5-star is the sauce leans a bit on the sweet side. If it went a little bit more towards the smokier side, it'd be perfect.

OMG PHIL'S BBQ! you have to try it to believe it. I went to school in san diego, so I was around when phil's bbq was still a little hole in the wall in hillcrest. Êafter trying it for the first time, I was a believer! there's not much to say about it, just that it's the BEST meaty-fall-right-off-the-bone-ribs i've had. I like to get the beef ribs, but the baby back ribs and the chicken are just as good! don't forget the onion rings! the sides are amazing tooo... mm i miss phil's. after moving back to LA my friend claimed that baby blue's has the BEST ribs ever, and I gave it a try..only to find that it is FAR from phil's. Ê yeah, it's true about the super long wait, but that only shows that it's THAT good right??

This place has really good BBQ. ÊMy boyfriend and I went here just this past week and we both had the el toro sandwich. ÊIt was our first time ever and we kept changing our minds and adjusting our meals to our liking. ÊDid the person at the register care?! ÊNo. ÊApparently it was his first time working at the register and the manager was helping him out. ÊBoth of them were really patient and changed our orders for us so that we got our "bang for the buck". The portions here are HUGE. ÊThe large fries is ridiculously large and my boyfriend and I couldn't finish it! ÊThe sandwiches were overflowing with savory meat and I had to take some of the tri tip home. Ê The service was excellent. ÊThe bussers that come around are very attentive to keeping the place looking clean and they always drop by with more napkins, hand wipes, and toothpicks. Great food.

I'm not from San Diego (Rep Fullerton!!!), so when I visited my cousin he suggested we go try Phil's BBQ since he himself had yet to try it. Upon arrival, the line had stretched around the corner of the building. Conveniently, there was a sign that said "approximate waiting time at this point: 22 minutes." Straight up, the wait was long, but well worth it. I ordered baby back ribs, which included 1/4 of chicken, cole slaw and macaroni salad. It was a beast of meal, but too delicious to save for left-overs. We also ordered a side of large onion rings. Between 2 guys who eat their weight in food, we had trouble just finishing the onion rings. ÊPhil's BBQ will be the standard joint I dine at each time I visit San Diego. The only thing I had a problem with was the fact that although Phil's BBQ is a dine-in restaurant, you are required to find your own seat. I only expect self-seating at fast-food places. This kind of killed it for me because I had to walk around like a chicken with its head cut off looking for an open table. The food made up for it though. Be cautious though, the line can get VERY LONG. So be prepared to eat elsewhere if you can't wait. Food: +delicious +HUGE portions, worth the money Ambience: -can get really crowded -long line especially at dinner time +worth the wait -/+ you seat yourself so finding a seat might take some time depending how crowded it is +can't wait? then just order take-out. Price: +worth the money because the food is DELISH Overall: Phil's BBQ is too good to pass up, especially if you're hungry. For someone who isn't from San Diego, I'm recommending everyone eat here. You are missing out.

Sunday night 6PM, we called, the girl at the restaurant told us it's about 1 and half hour wait, we ordered takeouts instead. When we got there, we realize we have to wait in phone-order line for about 20 minutes, after we paid, 5 more minutes wait. Back to the hotel, I couldn't wait to try the overly reviewed and praised ribs. I took a bite of baby back and disappointment just flooded in my mind. Right away, I am thinking just another over rated restaurant on Yelp. After the disappointing baby back, I was hoping and wishing the beef ribs would be the highly prized BBQ I was looking for. And BINGO, the beef rib was huge, juicy, tender, very satisfying with every bite. The tangy, sweet, and just a little kick of spiciness BBQ sauce was perfect for the beef ribs. I started looking at the over cooked and flavorless baby back and thinking what the waste of time and money. So I am giving the beef ribs 5 stars, baby back 3 stars which yields 4 stars.

I have to say...Phil's BBQ turned me from a non-bbq fan to a I love and crave bbq ribs. ÊI usually don't like the taste or smell of bbq anywhere near sandwiches and perhaps is why I stayed away from it. ÊBut I am now forever a loyal Phil's BBQ fan. Ê A couple of regulars that we went with recommended splitting the ribs dinner plate for 20 for two and getting one big side dish rather than two side dishes, and they were right! ÊTheir fries and macaroni salad were just as amazing as their ribs were. ÊWe even used most of the fries to clean the sauce off the plate and then lick it off our fingerstips. It's usually the wait in line that kills the reviews for most restaurants, but even though there was a rather long line, it went by really fast and was worth all the anticipation. ÊThe only thing that makes me sad is that there is no Phil's in NorCal!

1165 reviews?! ÊOK, this is for my friends who HAVEN'T been to Phil's or heard of Phil's. I would take out-of-towners here, but the far from exciting location doesn't warrant the drive from UTC to Phil's. ÊStill...if your friends are foodies and you guys have time, make a trip down to Phil's. Ê For my boyfriend and me, take-out was the best decision made on a Thursday evening. ÊThe line was out to the parking lot! ÊFor just over $11 we had two HUGE beef ribs, 3 pieces of pulled chicken with 2 large sides (among choices of baked beans, fries, cole slaw, potato salad). ÊBaked beans and fries were the best I thought. ÊThe pork ribs were also delicious. ÊThe best BBQ.

The only reason I'm even writing this review is to bring this place's average closer to a five than a four-and-one-half. Easily the best BBQ in San Diego. ÊPrices are slightly high. ÊBut the meat falls off the bones of the pork baby back ribs; and usually, the meat on the beef ribs are a perfect balance of lean and fattiness. The BBQ sauce is strong to the point of almost overpowering. ÊBut its almost-over-the-top taste is what makes it special. ÊIt's sweet and sour and smokey and peppery and all that jazz all at the same time. Of course, only eat stuff here if you are ready to call it a night. ÊBecause you will fall into a serious food coma within minutes of having a plate of goods here.

Ok this is my second time to Phil's BBQ and now I am confident to bump it up to 4 stars! We ordered the Beefy Ribs and Chicken combo and it was de-lish!

I've only been here once so I can't say I'm a die hard advocate for the place, but I was impressed. While my pulled-pork sandwich was slightly dry in places, that is my only complaint. The sauce is fantastic. We arrived just before the huge crowd so I can't complain about my wait at all. I'm not usually a coleslaw fan, but the coleslaw at Phil's is delicious. Fries are also good. Parking was easy and prices were fair. Overall, not the best BBQ I've ever had but this is San Diego afterall, what more can you expect.

Got the baby back ribs, 1/4 chicken, cold slaw, mac salad and a side of onion rings. The chicken is so much better than the chickless! so moist and tender.

Phil's got me back! Last time might have been a bad night or something. ÊThis time around, they had just the right amount of sauce on my baby back ribs. ÊRibs were juicy and soft with just the right amount of spice and sauce to it. I went with the Onion Rings instead of the usual fries and beans on the side.

4.0 to 4.5 stars from me. However, I get the feeling that this place can easily be 5 stars on a good day. Briefly, Phil's BBQ is a top-notch place for your rib-eating needs. The modern-day equivalent would probably be a Lucille's. At any rate, Phil's BBQ can easily be seen as gold standard for a ribs/BBQ place. All of the other reviews have it right: you're going to wait in line to get in. It can be a long wait (my group, which was about 20+ people, waited about 30 minutes), but it really didn't seem like it was that long. Finding parking can be a slight challenge, but there always seemed to be a few spots here and there. OK, so what about the food? I got the Beefy Rib Full Beef Rib Dinner (5 Bones) for $19.95 plus tax. It includes either 2 small side dishes or 1 large side dish. I opted for the two smaller ones: 1) fries, and 2) beans (beans at the recommendation of a UCSD friend). The ribs were... tasty, but BURNT... and I'm not just talking about a typical burnt that's tolerable. Trust me, I know what's acceptable, even by my generous standards. The ribs on the night that I went, however, were too burnt. I did end up eating it all (which, I suppose, is a testament to how good the ribs were in terms of taste), but again, the ribs were burnt. This was one of the main reasons I dropped Phil's from an easily-attainable 5-star rating to about a 4.5. The side dishes were good, but not spectacular. The fries kind of tasted like In-N-Out fries (which is a good thing!), but the beans were either too salty or too sweet. I couldn't tell. Haha. As for the service, I thought it was fantastic. Everybody from the cashier to the servers were attentive and very helpful. 5+ stars in the service department. I also liked how there was a multi-person sink located just outside of the bathrooms. It sure beats having to use your oily/greasy hands to open the bathroom door in order to wash your hands. When it's all said and done, Phil's BBQ is an impressive place for ribs. I'm pretty sure I went on a bad day (which still allows Phil's BBQ to get a 4.5-star rating from me). I'm definitely going to give this place a second chance to redeem itself and earn a 5-star review update. That being said, I think it's pretty clear that I'd come back here in a heartbeat.

This is also a must-have in San Diego. :) I've been here so many times with friends and especially friends that drive down 2 hours + just to get phils bbq! WHY? Because Phils BBQ is the bee's knees and you will more than definitely leave with a full stomach and a meal for another time. Despite the occasional 40 + minute wait, it is hard to tell that time has passed when you finally sit down with your ribs. I highly recommend the Beefy ribs 3-bone meal! I get it all the time and I always end up leaving with a lot of it in a to-go box. I generally don't like to get dirty when i'm eating, but the hell with it when I'm at Phil's BBQ! It's okay to get a little messy here! :D Enjoy!

Best BBQ ever! We shared the rib and chick-less combo with beans and fresh cut fries. We also shared the ginormous pulled pork sandwich. We could only finish the chick-less platter and had to take the entire sandwich with us! They are very friendly and helpful. We had never been there and had no idea where to start on their extensive menu. The cashier took her time helping us even though there was quite a line. We sat down and within 7 mins our food was at the table. They come around quite frequently to see if they can get you anything or do anything for you. The food was soooo good. You could smell the smoked hickory scent immediately. All the meat was tender and juicy. The BBQ sauce was to die for. Nice mix of tangyness and smokiness. The ribs were perfectly cooked practically falling off the bone. The chicken was not dry in the least bit and very good quality white meat. The beans were pretty incredible for such a staple item. Fries great too. Thank god they had a huge roll of paper towels at the table cause the food got pretty messy. But isn't that the point? What would good BBQ be without a little mess? CANNOT WAIT TO GO BACK!

Best restaurant ribs, ever. The baby back ribs were as good as the ones I smoke at home. I don't care for beef ribs, but these were meaty and delicious. The chicken was tender and delicious. The colossal onion rings were crispy and delicious. The baked beans were excellent. When we first arrived there, we actually left because of the insane line allllll the way out the door and around the corner and down the side of the building. We ended up going back an hour or so later, and the line had depleted (probably due to it being almost 9pm), so we decided why not? Soooo happy we did. It was fantastic, and we were very, very happy.

So don't come here if you are starving to death! Come before you get hungry and you will get hungry by the time you get your food! They did pass out fries for people waiting in the line once when I came. I feel that they do what they can to accommodate the 4,000 customers they have everyday.

In all honesty I was so excited to go to this place after hearing all of the great things I have heard about Phil's, but I must say I was disappointed.

Phil's BBQ is a really nice place to eat at because they play just about every sports game that is going on during that time. ÊYou have to try to find a table to sit at first. ÊThe ribs are really moist and fall right off the bone and the bbq rings are really big! ÊI would recommend this place to anyone who loves bbq food!

First off, i'm not a fan of bbq sauce, so i'm trying to rate it as best as I can. The meat was DANG GOOD, falls right off, honestly didn't need to use my fingers, i ate it clean with a fork and knife :) Downfall, is the bbq sauce. So if i liked bbq sauce i'd probably give it 5 stars, but since i don't, 4 "yay! i'm a fan!" i think that's a decent rating. The beans were sweet and savory, but heavy for my taste. The place is packed and boasts about their yelp reviews haha. With that many ratings, I can see why :) I like how they try their best to efficiently seat, serve, and cater to people's needs. Pretty awesome restaurant, but alas, I HATE BBQ sauce. Why Phil's... why couldn't you change my mind and make me love it till i die?!

If you need to find the best bbq in San Diego, Phil's is most definitely the place to go to. In my previous Phil's BBQ experiences, I didn't have to wait very long because I'd come at the mere hours of 2-4pm. Last night was the first time I went to Phil's around 8pm and I sure did wait an hour in line with my boyfriend. It was his first time and obviously the long line was getting to him but I told him not to doubt their food because the wait will be worth it. I ordered a baby back full rib dinner with potato salad and fresh cut fries. He ordered a BBQ cheeseburger and a large order of the colossal onion rings. Now, I love baby back ribs very much and I've tried many baby back ribs, but they do not compare to Phil's baby back ribs. Their ribs silde off the bone and they are just too juicy. Their bbq sauce is just one of a kind. Their servings for the fries and potato salad I consider is a lot if you're going to eat the whole full rack of ribs. My boyfriend enjoyed his burger and his onion rings. The onion rings are very crunchy and huge! When we ordered the large order, we didn't think they would give us so much but it got to the point where we had to take some of it home. The staff overall are really nice and really helpful. I've noticed that they always ask if it's your first time there and really seem happy when they get first timers. Other times, they've asked me if I'd want extra bbq sauce for my ribs and willingly of course I'd say yes! At the end of the night, we both left Phil's with our onion rings, smiling faces, and full stomachs.

we decided to try phil's BBQ after seeing 2600+ reviews on yelp. first off, i've tried alot of BBQ in my life from all over the US. i'd like to think i've tried some of the best. phil's was average for me. definitely not worth the hype on yelp. Êthere was a HUGE line but i have to give them props for fast service b/c we only waited 30 mins. their menu is limited meaning they focus more on ribs (pork & beef) which is fine. Êwe ordered a full rack of ribs, potato salad, baked beans & small onion rings. their ribs were fall off the bone, however, i believe they were out for a while or was in the food heater too long b/c the meat was a bit dry. they doused their meat in tons of BBQ sauce to rehydrate the meat so it was difficult to taste the actual meat. the potato salad was not good at all. i know it's a BBQ joint so alot of you are probably saying i should only focus on the meat but i like the whole package when i go to a BBQ spot and the sides have to be up to par. overall, the establishment has fast, great service but the food was average. maybe i was more disappointed b/c of all the hype.

Great BBQ environment. Wooden tables and chairs, TV screens placed everywhere around the room. We had a friendly cashier who was calling my sister a cutie. The food was good, those fresh battered onion rings were to die for, best onion rings I had. Only thing that I didn't like was the wait in line and we had to wait for a table to open.

I didn't read any of the other reviews, so I'm sure I will say things that have been mentioned multiple times, but... Phil's is a true meat lovers Paradise. Everything is cooked to perfection and Phil's sauce is incredible (cue mouth watering). Just driving by this place gets me salivating. I was running down the San Diego River Canal yesterday and could smell Phil's. Why oh why did I have to run within a mile of Phils. The chick-less nuggets are great for those who want some white meat, but for the $ shot, try the broham w/ onion rings (beer battered of course) and a rib tickler for an appetizer. The meat falls off the ribs and the pulled pork of the broham is the best I have ever had. ÊBetter than VA, TX, NC, KC. Unless you are going w/ the family, or live too far away, I recommend calling in and taking it home. Get there a few minutes early for a beer at the bar - you don't have to wait in line. That line is a beast. Arrogant bastard on tap. Only thing I miss is that they aren't going to reopen the Mission Hills locale. But riding by yesterday, they have a Lefty's Pizza sign up, so we got that going for us...

The food is excellent. ÊI don't like their sauce though. ÊIt's a bit too "tangy/bitter" ÊI prefer Baby Back Jack's sauce better because it's a little sweeter. Ê The meat is awesome because everything is so soft and tender. ÊYou can peel the meat off with a fork! ÊI have tried the beef, baby back ribs and chicken and they all were really good. ÊI have to admit that the beef ribs are better than the baby back ribs. The service is great. ÊThey got a lot of people on their staff. ÊOne drawback: Êthe long line. ÊExpect to wait 20-40 minutes for dinner. ÊThe environment is also kind of loud if that's not your thing. You should totally go here.

A family member took us here, and we've been fans since! The ribs are fall-off-the-bone good here, with that authentic taste of BBQ. ÊPortions are pretty good, but I always leave stuffed. ÊThe place gets packed, so I do recommend calling in your order prior to you heading out. ÊBy the time you get there, all you have to do find a table (although I admit, that can get near impossible at the wrong time!). Is it worth the drive out to San Diego from where I live? ÊMaybe not. ÊBut it is a guaranteed stop when we're in town. ÊIf I lived closer, I would definitely be a regular!

Phil's BBQ is definitely one of the better barbecued foods I've had in a while. ÊI ordered the chicken tickler because I didn't want a huge portion, and it wasn't. ÊIt was a good for one, with some leftover fries. Ê The chicken was a little over-cooked to me. ÊIt wasn't tender enough, it tasted a little like when you cook frozen chicken, the overly-soft-crumbles-and-falls-apart-after-one-bit kind of texture, but that's probably because I'm so used to eating fresh chicken. ÊThe taste was nice though, and it smelled amazing, even though it was to-go. :) Ê The onion rings were HUGE, onion-to-batter ratio was good, not overly batter-y. ÊThe fries were good as well, even after they cooled down a bit, they were still good. :) Ê I think their ribs are better, they're probably better at cooking ribs than they are chicken. ÊSo my suggestion, order a slab of ribs, they're a lot more tasty and when you're going for BBQ, definitely a treat!

Huge Tip: Call the order in and eat it somewhere else. I'm too impatient to wait 30-40 minutes for my food. The most amazing thing besides the food is how friendly the staff is even when they are packed and busy from open to close. I have a special assistance dog and have never had problems bring my dog in, and they hook me up with bones all the time. Another Tip: This place is known for its ribs, so you should be getting those, especially if it is your first time. And the french fries are the best side as far as amount of food so the full rack (beef or pork) with fries is your best combo. Do I really need to say anymore? Everyone else already killed it in reviewing this place. You can small the goodness from a mile away, and I am not exaggerating either. That is why they moved, people got tired of smelling amazing BBQ 24 hours a day, probably because it made them hungry all the time.

One of my favorite spots in San Diego. ÊEveryone you know has been there or has heard of it. The prices are reasonable, but the food is finger licking good!

I am a big fan of BBQ Ribs and this place is the best I've had. For comparison in Southern California, I've tried Dinah's, Robin's in Rosemead, Lucille BBQ, Chicago Ribs, Tony Roma's, and Baby Blues. Phil's is to me the best in Southen California. We came at 3:30 PM on Saturday and the line went all the way to the parking lot. ÊSame long line when I tried Phil's for the first time last year. So I decided to come back the next day Ê(Sunday at 11:30) and the line was much shorter. Menu is quite simple: baby back ribs, beef ribs, bbq chickens, and pull porks. You can order each meat as dinner (includes 2 small sides or one large side) or ala carte. The full slab baby back ribs dinner cost $18.95 or $16.95 for the ala carte.

BABY BACK RIBS all the way baby~~~ all i gotta say is, best BBQ in town. i love how the meat just falls off the bone. delicious goodness. almost too good. i get the half rib dinner w/a side of corn. i took my family here, my cousin, and i've gone with friends a bunch of times, the quality is always there. also, line gets pretty long sometimes, but if you have a small party, 2-4 i recommend going over to the bar, you get your food a lot faster, but Shhh..dont tell everyone or else it won't be a secret anymore. they have some pretty good beer on tap as well. their staff is super friendly and always ready to get you some more towels. btw i don't use the bibs, they're for noobs. price is definitely reasonable. will be coming here again soon! i love phils!!!

I should be embarrassed to admit this but I have tried EVERYTHING on the menu and let me tell you, Phils has got it all figured out! They have managed to make me eat things I don't usually like. In fact, the cold slaw is so amazing I order at other restaurants just to see if they can do it like Phils does (better luck on that one). My suggestions for you and a date: full baby back dinner with macaroni salad and cold slaw and a Broham (the best pulled pork sando you ever had!). Sit at the bar and wash down your tasty food with some local brews on tap. LOVE THIS PLACE!

Came here with my cousins and bf. When we got here the line was literally out the door and around the corner. I thought it was going to take forever for us to get in but my cousin assured me that it wouldn't be that long and it was worth the wait. So we stood in line for about half an hour. When we got in I understood why there was a line. Once you walk in you automatically go to the cashier and order and pay for your meal. So it's best to get a menu while in line so that you know what you want. The have a policy where you can't save or do preseating which sucks because then after paying you'll be standing around looking for an open seat. The place is really crowded and from the time we went in to the time we left, the line never seemed to die down. Now off to the food. We got 1 order of the meaty beef ribs with a small side of baked beans and potato salad. That one order was enough for the both of us with 2 left over ribs. The ribs were very meaty and the sauce was great. I would have liked it better if the ribs were completely smoked because there were a few burnt pieces and parts of the meat weren't really as juicy as I would have liked. But overall it was good BBQ. The baked beans were good because it had a little kick to it. Also tried their onion ring and it was good. Not too much batter and just the right size. I would love to come by here again if I'm ever in town. One of the best BBQ places ever.

I'm not a connoisseur of BBQ, not being from a BBQ state or anything, but the two meals I had there were pretty decent. There's no excuse for the line, though; the food is not spectacular.

I absolutely love this place! The BBQ is amazing whether you're eating ribs or a pulled pork sandwich. The onion rings are also delicious. We come here for family gatherings all the time, just be sure to call ahead for big groups to reserve an outside dining area. If just stopping by for a bite to eat, the line can be rather long but don't worry it goes pretty quick. The hardest part would be finding a table after you order, so best to split up and have one person search for a table while the other orders. The service is great, the food is great, and if you don't mind a little noise then you will definitely love Phil's.

1-Don't wait in the HUGE line! Just call ahead and pick it up. You will be out of there in less than 10 minutes. 2-The baby back ribs are fabulous but I also suggest the rib tips too, all the pork goodness but not the fight with the bones. 3-Best macaroni salad ever! 4-If you are not a pork or rib fan no problem. Get the chickless dinner. It is big chunks of white meat smothered in their fabulous BBQ sauce.

this review is solely for the tri tip sandwich: BEST. B.B.Q. SANDWICH. EVER. I tried the pulled pork one and I actually was not that impressed. the sauce didn't strike me as very tasty and the meat tasted a lot like pork. i think i just don't like the taste of pork really. The sauce on the tri tip was sweet and tangy and complimented the meat well. And the meat? MOIST. I'm always afraid of getting tri tip anything because it has the tendency to be dry. but not this sandwich. it wasn't even really a sandwich, but a plate of meat with a bun on top and the other half of the bun hiding under the meat and sauce. delicious. did i already say that? oh and the onion rings? bigger than the bangles on my wrists that i was wearing that day. i'd go back down to san diego just to eat there again.

Here we go, after over 1300 reviews, I too get to write a review for the best BBQ house I've ever had. I've been here 3 times, so I'm still in the experimenting phase in terms of what to order. After reading what fellow Yelpers have to say about the menu, on the third trip, I decided to order the Ribless meal. Hands down, this was my favorite thing on the menu after ordering the chicken and pork ribs twice. With the ribless meal, you get way more meat and way less mess!! I got it with fries and cole slaw. The sides were both good, but nothing to really brag about. The pork pieces were covered in a perfect amount of BBQ sauce and was tender upon first bite. The onion rings are another great thing to get on the menu. They have the perfect crunch. With ranch, they complement each other like lamb and tuna fish. :) The environment is a great atmosphere for friends to get together and have a sit down with the game on any of their many TVs up above. Of course, the worst part of the experience was the wait in line. My last visit on a Sat. night (not recommended, go on a weekday!) took almost an hour. OR maybe the waiting in line is part of the Phil's BBQ experience that should be cherished. Depends on your take of it Overall, a fine San Diego establishment that is a reason for anyone to stay in San Diego. The worst thing that can happen is if this place closes. The second worst thing that can happen...if I leave San Diego. Let me leave with a closing analogy... Phil's BBQ is to San Diego as In N Out is to the Southwestern United States.

I have been eating at Phil's FOREVER* but have just never gotten around to writing a review. I love Phil's. Always have, always will. I love their bbq sauce, and I know a lot of the naysayers don't like it but I put that down to personal preference. The "chickless" is my meat of choice, the spice rub on it is divine. The fries are excellent, made from fresh cut potatos. And the onion rings are to die for if you like 'em big and thick. Also love the bbq cheeseburger, no one mentions how good the burgers are so I'm here to tell you this is one of the best hamburgers in town. Another great item that doen't get a lot of talk is the cesar salad - they make their own dressing and it has a nice peppery kick to it. Something else that doesn't seem to get much mention in the reviews here is the beer bar. Know all those places that claim to have the "coldest beer in town"? Well, Phil's really does. On a good day my pint of Arrogant Bastard has ice crystals in it because it's so cold. The beer selection is very good, a nice cross section of local microbrews and the big names. Oh, and to all you folks who complain abut the line: whatever. I remember when at the old location there were a few times when the wait was four hours. Phi's is worth the wait. Now if I could just get them convinced to bring the fresh made ice cream back... *And if you don't believe my "forever" claim - do YOU remember back when they were in Mission Hills and only had 4 tables? Before the coffee bar and the ice cream? Didn't think so...

Arrived at Phil's at 6:40 pm on a Friday. The line had already wrapped around 2 sides of the building and extended into neighboring property. 8:10 pm...finally got inside and placed my order. I am starving at this point. I ordered the full rib dinner baby back ribs (10-12 bones + 2 small sides of your choice) with extra sauce, corn on the cob, macaroni salad, sweet baked beans, and colossal onion rings. Like I said, i was starving, don't judge! WOW...the meat just fell off the bones. Oh so yummy in my tummy!!! I am not a fan of BBQ but I think they just found themselves a new convert! The sides were also good except for the onion rings. I didn't care too much for the way it was battered and it was slightly undercooked. The wait staff were excellent! The place was packed, yet they still managed to tend to your needs. The wet wipes and disposable bibs were also nice things to have as well. Overall, well played! If I am ever in San Diego again, I'm coming back. ÊI want my baby back baby back baby back baby back riiiiiiibbs.....BBQ sauce...

I've been to Phil's BBQ a handful of times now and I have never been disappointed. They're probably the best BBQ restaurant to eat in Southern California. The only problem is that there's always a long wait with the line often stretching around the corner of the building. Once you make your order though, the wait for the food is not long at all. If you can stand in line for 30 min - 1 hour, then I'd definitely recommend this place. A couple of recommendations: Beefy / Baby Back Ribs - If you're in the mood for ribs, they have a choice of beefy ribs or baby back ribs. I always prefer the beefy ribs. Don't underestimate the portions; the beefy ribs have a ton of meat on them so you'll definitely be satisfied. Something like a Half Order or a Best of Both (combination of ribs and chicken) will definitely do for an average appetite or even just a Tickler if you want to eat light. Broham - Make sure to try this huge tender pulled pork sandwich with bbq sauce. it comes with cole slaw, which I usually ask for on the side or leave it off altogether. El Toro - I wasn't really a big fan of this tri-tip sandwich. I didn't think the marinade went well with the tri-tip. I'd take the Broham over this any day.

I wasn't expecting much when I was told we were gonna get some BarBQ while I was visiting from TX. ÊI had never heard of Phil's before, but I was pleasently supprised when we arrived. The meat was in large portions and covered in their signature sauce. ÊIt can be intimidating walking in because of the large line out front, but it moved rather quickly, and there was seating available. ÊVery reasonable price that left me feeling like a fat kid without much of an impact on my wallet. ÊI have a feeling Phil's will be a regular stop each time I come to SD from now on.

Rather than rehash all the reviews, I'll just tell you a story. So, I took my friend from the midwest here, and I'd hyped it up for some time before that. ÊHe would always say, "There ain't no good BBQ out here. ÊThey only know how to do it in the midwest." ÊFinally, I got him to come down with me. ÊIn a not-too-excited voice, he opined, "It was alright..." Ê Next thing I know, the next weekend, he was texting me. Ê"Guess where I am?" So guess where he was? Ê:) Just the place with the best ribs I've had! ÊAnd wow... Now they're coming to San Marcos. ÊI don't know how I'll handle this. ÊI better get a second and third job... My choice for a meal: ÊFull rib dinner (baby backs) with all fries underneath to soak up that BBQ sauce! Parking sucks, and the line is even worse. ÊI guess that's the price to pay. ÊIf you want a short cut, call in advance, and take it outside to your car to eat. ÊWarning: Êit's messy.

As a hardcore Man v. Food fan, after seeing this featured I knew I had to go since I was within a drive-able distance. So, a friend and I drove over 100 miles to get here (I did all the driving from Arcadia) and arrived here Saturday night at around 8:20pm. The parking lot surrounding the establishment gets filled up quickly (we saw a line that wrapped around the corner from the entrance to the side of the restaurant) but I was able to secure parking without too much trouble. Once you get out of your car you instantly get a whiff of that mesquite smoke smell emanating from Phil's. Stomachs rumbling for a taste of the real thing, we stood in line and waited over 45 minutes before being able to order. Due to the large side windows that allow you to glance into the interior and of customers gorging on their glazed ribs, and the somewhat slow-moving line, I only salivated and felt stronger hunger pangs as the line moved. The mesquite smoke smell when you get out of your car? That smell gets way more intense when you finally enter the restaurant from the front and near the ordering line. You first order your food, then you get your receipt and a "buzzer" signaling that your order is ready (which I thought was a nice touch). There are twin soda fountain machines on both sides of the restaurant and you are welcome to free re-fills for the duration of your stay. (I can't stand establishments that charge you for soda re-fills). You also need to locate your own table/booth which may prove to be a challenge, but we found a booth pretty easily (it was about 9:15pm or so by the time we ordered our food). We ordered the "El Toro" sandwich, which was tri-tip that was grilled simultaneously with their famous sauce, 3 of the beef ribs, and a full rack of baby-back ribs with corn on the cob as a side. The food came out very quickly; it didn't feel as if 3-4 minutes passed after sitting down at our booth before the buzzer rang. The staff were very friendly and helped carry the trays of glistening ribs to our booth. They also provided wet naps and plates. I ate two of the baby-rick ribs first. There's something to be said about the bbq sauce. Slightly sweet and tangy before leaving your tongue with a bit of spicy heat, it was unlike any bbq sauce I've ever had. The ribs themselves were tender and meaty and fell off the bone easily. The tri-tip sandwich was incredible. The Kaiser roll was nicely toasted but not hard to chew and it complemented the juiciness of the meat. The bbq sauce was a perfect companion to the tri-tip and the flavor was indescribably delicious. The beef ribs were only okay for me. They were very meaty and tender but I would prefer to get the baby-back ribs. I was a bit put-off that our full baby-back ribs dinner order (which comes with 2 sides or 1 large one) only came with 1 corn on the cob. I thought it would have came with two but I guess I know now for next time. The corn was pretty decent but for the money you spend it's best to get other sides with your dinner. They do thankfully take credit cards and if you can stand the wait you're in for some of the best bbq ribs around. I can easily say these were the best baby-back ribs I've ever had. For sure I'll be making another 100 mile trek on a random Saturday evening soon.

NOT WORTH THE WAIT, FOLKS. The food here is okay but most certainly not worth standing around for any length of time, much less OVER AN HOUR. There are lines all the time and although there is a big parking lot next to it, you can never find a spot. I know fatties from the Midwest that have eaten here and were appalled at how many people line up for the "food" at this joint...sorry, but BBQ is not a classic food for San Diego (I'd much rather stick to Mexican food). The service is decent especially in the event room next door, but other than that you might as well as just go to Joey's Smokin' BBQ where the food is just as good and there aren't lines around the block. And no, I don't work for Joey's...it's just science (and truth).

I can't come up with enough expletives to describe how good this place is. ÊI admit, my BBQ experience has mostly been with likes of Lucille's and Tony Roma's. ÊI thought they had good ribs but noooooo, after trying both beef and pork ribs at Phil's, I now see the light. As I bit into my first baby back rib, this is what I said, "This shiyet is puckin gooooood!" ÊWhen faced with something this good, only the most down to earth human expressions suffice. Basically a fastfood joint but as you wait in line for minimum of 30 minutes, they ask how many peeps are in your party and tell you to go grab a table if one opens up. ÊThat's pretty nice of them, eh?! Definitely a must go place if you're a meat eater.

Ok, Phil's = good, tender meat in savory sauce, with plenty of sides to choose from. I had the El Toro beef sandwich with fries and potato salad. The meat and sauce was was really tasty, and it came on a huge bun. It was kind of messy to eat, so I decided to make it a fork-and-knife sort of affair. I really liked the fries and they were actually one of my favorite parts of the meal for their crispy goodness. The potato salad was lackluster, with chunks of potatoes and not much seasoning at all. Overall, though, the meal was pretty good. What wasn't so good is the wait to get in. When we arrived the line was wrapped around the corner. I saw a few people in line with chidren, and by the time they got to the door the kids were whiny and cranky. ÊAlthough the line serves to build suspense and anticipation, I didn't think the food lived up to the enormous hype. The only real selections they've got for meat is beef, pork, and chicken (ribs, beef sandwiches, chicken on the bone, and boneless chicken)... I'm used to BBQ places serving hot links and even fried fishas well and I was disappointed when I arrived and there weren't any.

There's really no place like Phil's.. This place is definitely worth the +25 minutes wait on a week night! I love the "Best of Both" half rack of ribs & 1/4 chicken with french fries and sweet baked beans. I'm usually a big fan of potato/macaroni salad, but I don't think it's mayo-y enough for me here haha. The little chickless pieces aren't that bad, but I just prefer the skin with the 1/4 chicken. Plus it's a little bit juicier! That's not to say the chickless pieces are dry, they're really not that bad! The onion rings here are great as well with a side of ranch dip. Haha I sound like such a fatty, but Phil's has the one of the best BBQ sauce I ever tried. It's a perfect mix of tangy goodness that coats the ribs perfectly that's hard to find elsewhere. Definitely a must if you're in the SD area!

Is it weird to bite into a sandwich and hear music? Ê... Cue the Stevie Wonder. ÊI mean seriously ... I don't know quite know how it happened, but a man has stolen my heart ... with BBQ sauce no less. ÊWith moist, charred pulled pork to boot. ÊAnd if it wasn't so frowned upon, I'd go ahead and tell you how I really feel ... I love you ... I love you, you inanimate caricature ... mustached grill master ... hoister of blue-ribbon ribs known to others as Phil ... but to me as my GRUB-amore. ÊBefore this thing between me and Phil gets creeper (wait, really ... too late?) take a journey with me down to SD ... a magical blend of surfer brahs, Shamu fanatics, and BBQ warlords. ÊMy adventure started out on a Monday night ... pulling into Phil's parking lot only to come face to face with the most horrific site these eyes have ever seen ... a half dozen signs crushing my soul with a "Sorry ... we're closed Mondays." ÊSo like any good GRUB-soldier, I picked out a choice spot up front, tilted my seat back ... cried for a little bit ... and camped out for 24 hours. ÊOkay, fine ... some of these facts may be slightly inaccurate ... I cried a lot a bit. ÊSo with an extra day of anticipation under my belt, I headed back the following night and was met with the white-rhino of Phil's BBQ ... only a handful of people in line to place their order. ÊThis might not at first sound impressive, but within 15 minutes of getting there, the line wrapped half way around the building, creeping up to the Disneyland-esque "approximate wait time from this point" sign (and like the rest of the top notch operation Phil is running ... he gives you that wait time down to the second). ÊAs I approached the counter, my mind was pretty much already set. ÊI mean, can you really pass up a pulled pork sandwich called ... The Broham? ÊAs with everything at Phil's, this is a monster of a sandwich ... a crispy, warm, mind-blowing-in-its-own-right bun cradles a bed of cool homemade coleslaw topped off with an un-Godly ... I take that back ... topped off with a Godly amount of never-ending pulled pork overflowing with BBQ sauce. ÊNow, in my mind, the pulled pork is pretty much unmatched by anyone ... unreal juiciness, but with a nice bit of smoky crunch to the edges ... it's pure magic. ÊBut the kicker to this whole dance is the BBQ sauce. ÊLet's just say, I finally get what Champ from Anchorman was going on and on about. ÊIt's straight crack. ÊAnd like all good crack ... it never stops flowing. ÊI was about to get a side order of BBQ sauce for our fries ... and damn was I glad I didn't ... because the amount they loaded onto the Broham was enough for my sandwich, my fries, my coleslaw ... my Mr. Pibb. ÊBut lest you think I'm complaining about the amount of sauce ... it's just the opposite my GRUB-mate. ÊPhil's BBQ sauce is the answer to ... well, everything. ÊPut it on a rash, baptize a baby with it, use it as a mulch in your garden ... and I'm pretty sure if we thought hard enough about it ... it could solve world peace. ÊMatching up with all this mayhem was a "small order of fries"... which translates into ... "giant tray-o-fries" Êand another side order of that perfect BBQ companion ... coleslaw. ÊI've had my fare number of trips down to San Diego to visit Phil, but this was the first I came face to face with his newest temptation ... giant whoopee pies. ÊNow, my little lady has been known to throw down some pretty mean whoopee pies ... and I'll still give her the edge ... but these giant morsels of two chewy oatmeal cookies encasing a center of sweet, pink frosting was the perfect way to top of this GRUB-fest. ÊI don't know how you do it Phil ... but damn am I glad you do. ÊSo join me in my praise ... try it out for yourself ... and may I be damned if you don't start humming ... "I believe when I fall in love this time ... it will be forever!"

Overrated much? Ê My boyfriend and I waited an hour to get into Phil's last night so I was expecting ribs that would knock my socks off. ÊThey didn't. ÊMy ribs were not tough but they certainly didn't fall off the bone, they were a little burnt which left an unpleasant char taste in my mouth, and while the sauce was sweet and spicy in the beginning, after a few ribs it started to taste one note. ÊThe fries were a little dried out and, while my boyfriend enjoyed his pulled pork sandwich, he wasn't blown away. I LOVE ribs and had hoped to find a great place in San Diego. ÊAfter our visit to Phil's, I'm still looking. ÊIf it weren't for the wait, I'd probably go back here for decent but not amazing food, but as it is, the food is definitely not worth the wait or the hype.

Mm, now what can I say about Phil's BBQ? well, it's bomb! i went for my first time after getting 2/2 recommend from two friends and seeing my other friend's review on this place, i checked it out and it was delicious. the sauce had a huge kick to it, really strong in taste. i got the side of fresh cut fries and macaroni salad and they were both a good combination(: i would like to go back and try the other meat :D

OK.. for the record, I hate pork, i'm super sensitive to the smell, i hardly ever eat it.. and I hate ribs, the ones i've had in the past are tough and chewy/rubbery.. so my first time a Phil's i shared with my bf and we got the best of both (baby back and chickless) i mostly ate the chicken then he made me try the ribs because he said they were awesome.. reluctantly I took a bite.. and WOW OMG.. it was love at first bite! the meat was soooooo delicious, no pork smell, no toughness.. it just fell off the bone.. the sauce is awesome! Definitely the BEST ribs EVER.. it's the only place i would ever eat ribs! :) We come back here all the time.. definitely worth the long wait in line!

been dying to try out this bbq joint ever since i saw it on man vs food! Êalso heard lots of high raves about it through some friends. My group of 10 friends came in at 1130 (30 mins after opening) Êon a Friday and the line was already around the corner of the building. Êit was still early, so there was plenty of seats. Êthe line moved relatively fast. Êbut, im sure if we came any later, the wait would be excruciating long! Ê we basically ordered everything off the menu and shared. honestly, there wasn't anything that i would say was "GROSS" the star winner of the meal was definitely the baby back ribs. Êit fell right of the bones with intense flavor. Ê i didnt enjoy the beef ribs as much because it was kinda tough and dry, so i recommend just sticking to the pork. the tri trip and and the pulled pork sammich was great. i enjoyed their BBQ sauce. Êits quite tasty. Ê the sides were cool....mac salad was cool...fries were like in n outs but just thicker in size. their onion rings were pretty good! Êa small is pretty generous. Êwe ordered a small and it was just perfect for us 10. Êthey are hugeee, hot, and crunchy served with ranch sauce. prob one of the best bbq joints ive been to by far. Êthe raves and hype was lived up! Êi was not disappointed. its finger lickin' good. Êgooooo get your baby back ribs! =D

I went to Phil's BBQ on a Sunday night (8:00 pm) and waited about an hour and 30 mins. I have never waited that long before to get food. I wanted to know what the hype was all about...my friend has been talking about this place even a year before I moved to San Diego, so when she came to visit I just had to come here...when our group was finally seated (9:30 pm) there was no more line outside, so if you don't want to wait come late. Overall, it was worth the wait and I will come Êback again when it's not so busy... so here is what I ordered: onion rings, half rack of baby back ribs with two small sides of macaroni salad and coleslaw. I also had a few bites of the bbq chicken, baked beans and potato salad. Colossal beer battered onion rings: they were soooo good...the best I have ever had ;D My favorite of all the dishes..crispy..my mouth is salivating as we speak..a must get!! Baby back ribs: This was good too..the meat was so tender that it fell off the bones, bbq sauce was good but not the best I have had. A little on the sweeter side and not enough spiciness for me Coleslaw: definitively not my favorite of all the dishes and if I come back I will not order it again. Baked beans: I was debating between this and mac salad. So I had the boyfriend order it hehe. I regret not ordering this though because it was sooo good!!! I will order this next time BBQ chicken: on the dry side Potato salad and macaroni salad were delicious!! But I prefer the potato salad, it was different and was super chunky *Small sides are huge and will be more than enough

Oh God...where do I start with Phil's? This place is definitely some of the best BBQ in all of SoCal. You may be deterred by the enormous lines that often stretch around the restaurant, but let me tell you friends, it is TOTALLY worth the wait. You can pretty much expect a line on any day at any time, so be prepared. Once you finally get to order, their menu is quite extensive. Everything on the menu is pretty amazing. I love their pulled pork sandwich. They are extremely generous with the pork as they pile it on the bun...and they top it off with coleslaw. Such a genius combination. Their beef and pork ribs are simply amazing. The meat just falls right off the bone and it's nice and juicy. None of that dry disgusting meat here. The BBQ sauce is perfect. Sweet with a hint of tangy. I can't forget about their sides. The onion rings are HUGE and is probably the best side you could order. It's seriously some of the best onion rings I've ever had. Their baked beans are great along with their macroni salad. Pretty much everything on the menu is amazing. If you love BBQ, this is the place to go to. Oh and you'll usually leave here weighing about 10 pounds heavier. So bring a book or some sudoku as you wait in line. It's worth it in the end.

I'm sure I will be crucified but I found myself not raving about Phils BBQ - it Êwas just okay. Everyone's taste is subjective and for me, their ribs are sugary but extremely spicy. Sauces are good. But the wait time? Its a typical 45min wait to get a seat in. Servers are great and accommodating, they even have some chatting up people in line, as well as ushers already getting tables ready for the parties in queue. The food takes just a wee bit after you order, almost similar to the speed of ordering at a McDonald's (so I'm assuming they are churning out food as fast as they can to eliminate the wait). But when we got our ribs, it went cold fast. Still very tasty and we still finished them all. The first time I ate at Phils it was in December and we were in line for 20-30mins. ÊIt wasn't as busy then so I think I was able to appreciate the food more. But because I recently came from other BBQ places, I was able to compare Phils with another BBQ resto; while the sauces are different and both are delicious, my taste buds were hoping for something a bit less sweet than the ribs at Phils. There is parking a-plenty! but seriously, if you are planning a Phils BBQ outing, come before you get hungry!

ÊI thought the salad was going to be small but it was a generous portion as well and the chicken was cooked perfectly, nothing worse than a dried out piece of chicken *yuck* ÊWe ate around 4pm so luckily we got there before the dinner rush.

No question. If you are in San Diego and you love nice, meaty, tender ribs, then Phil's is THE place to go. My fiancee and I visit SD every few months and we always make it a point to visit Phil's. Without fail, and no matter what day of the week we go, there is always a line to order for dine-in. Always. My friends, it is worth the wait. If we are in a hurry, we order to go and eat in the parking lot, it is that good. I always order extra and take the rest home for a later snack. It is not normal for me to run across a bbq place that I feel compelled to rave about but this is definitely one of those (very few) places.

I'm going to keep it simple. Delicious, tender, mouth-watering baby back ribs at an affordable price? I'M SOLD. I've been here three times and it has yet to disappoint. The quality is consistent (Phil's does BBQ well) and the prices are very reasonable. I like the baby back rib tickler because it comes with 2 onion rings, fries, and coleslaw (which isn't too spectacular, but then again... it's just coleslaw), but it's only $6.45. Yummm. I'd give it five stars but the line/wait/crowd is ridiculous on most days (~60 minute+ waits on the weekends), and that's just too long for any meal-- especially when the thick aroma fills the air as you're stuck in line. Maybe that'll change once the new location is open for business.

What I've been getting lately is a large site of fries with extra sauce on the side and dipping my fries in the sauce. AMAZING!! Their broham sandwich is also a favorite of mine.

I was visiting San Diego this past weekend for my birthday. The only reason I knew about Phil's was because it was literally right across the street from the hotel I was staying in. My bf, who is a huge BBQ fan, convinced me to have dinner there before we left. We knew it had to be good seeing the LONG line of people there every day! The line did take awhile but, once we were seated and ordered, the food came really quick. We got the beef ribs, baby back ribs, and chicken. WOW! There was so much food and it tasted as good as it looked!! The meat was so tender. Bf was in heaven. LOL. He says its some of the best BBQ he's had. The sides were good too. We had plenty of leftovers and left extremely satisfied. Staff was also very friendly and helpful. We will definitely be coming back if we are ever in SD again!

If you' are visiting San Diego and want something truely unique check this place out. I also ordered the onion rings that were Êcrisp, not greasy and were mildly sweet. Come hungry.

Just like most of the reviews I don't like the wait for the BBQ. The wait doesn't justify why one would eat here for. The BBQ is okay, its not the best I ever had to be waiting in a line of such. The sauce is good and just perfect for the flavor they are going after. I just hate the hideous line.

wooohooooo! i convinced my bf to come down here after disneyland to try the BBQ, and maybe go around san diego. we came around 1130am on a wednesday, and can already see a line forming out the door, luckily it wasn't as bad as we thought. parking was easy, and i didn't know the place was that big. we ordered the full rack of baby back ribs dinner with two sides- the ribs were SO GOOOOOOD, juicy, saucy, and even the "dry looking white areas" had flavor..if anyone understood that. my bf whose a bbq junky LOVED it. we got the potato salad and coleslaw, the potato salad was good, actual big chunks of potatoes with good flavor. the coleslaw was good, but im not a fan of horse radish, so it was a little hard for me to eat. still good though and the broham (pulled pork sandwich)- same coleslaw in it i believe, and the pulled pork was tender, soft ,and tasty. we bought the phil's bbq sauce bottles, 2 for 10.95 i think, also available at SD costco LOL. definitely great BBQ and we were quite content with how much we had. we would have ordered more to take to-go, but we thought it'd be better to leave it, too much of a good thing is not always good. haha (that just means we'll be coming back!) there's a sign that says you can't save seats while your party is still waiting in line, but no worries, i think people move around pretty quick, so you can get a table...but i did come at a "slower" time, lucky me!

There wasnt anything here that I didn't enjoy, my boyfriend ordered the El Toro sandwich and it was pretty good the only thing that I didtn't like was the fact that the meat was a little tough to bite into but the flavor was amazing. I devoured the beefy ribs they were like to die for! OMG best thing ever. Explosion of great flavors in your mouth *yummmm I can't wait to come back here to order it again. Oh by the way we got a side of onion rings and boy oh boy they were gigantic and they were delicious :) hehe a MUSTTTTT GO!

The onion rings with ranch dressing are to die for! Baby back ribs are excellent. Had to knock off a star because the last 3 times I went there, they put way too much sauce on the ribs. If you don't like spicy food, the sauce might be too much. I personally like the new location in Vista better. Same food, nicer area, and shorter wait on the weekend than the Sports Arena location.

How much do I love Phil's? It cannot be put into words. Not only is the food amazing, try the chickless dinner or ribless dinner, but the whole atmosphere of the establishment is great. ÊIt is an experience to go to Phil's. Here are a few tips: 1. Give yourself some time when going. ÊIf there is a line, don't despair, you will get your delicious bbq, patience is good. 2. Know your order before getting to the cashier. 3. The Bar area and outside are usually the best places to get seats when they are busy. 4. Have fun and enjoy your amazing meal.

There are millions of people in the South laughing at us SoCal folks right now. ÊThere is probably a taco shop in Memphis that is a step above Taco Bell that all the locals are giving 5-Star ratings to as having the best Mexican food ever. ÊPhil's is our equivalent of a Memphis taco shop. ÊPhil's food is good. ÊThere wouldn't be a line stretching around the building during the lunch and dinner rushes if it wasn't but as far as being the best BBQ of all time??? no. ÊI'm not a big fan of beef ribs but I'd say Phil's are pretty good. ÊThe babybacks are well seasoned and smoked til tender (and the sauce is 4-star). ÊThe chicken is good too. ÊThe brisket is out of this world. ÊOh...wait...they don't have brisket. ÊYou MUST have brisket to be considered a BBQ joint in my book. ÊI am well aware there are many types of BBQ but brisket is a BBQ staple and Phil's ain't got it. ÊI might be low-balling with the 3-star rating as the place is clean, friendly, and the food is certainly good, but I tend to be more of a realist and I honestly don't believe this is 5-star BBQ. ÊIt is a bit pricey but you can get a good value with one of the "tickler" baskets or sandwiches (and news to all of you fat Americans out there, myself included, you don't need a full rack of ribs with fries and baked beans...portion control...portion control). ÊI truly do love this place, but as Yelp ratings state "3-stars is A-OK" and Phil's is exactly that. ÊNothing incredibly special, but A-OK.

Each time I go to Phil's I can never stop the "hhhhhmmmmm"'s and the "yuuuuuummmm"s!! I usually order the baby back ribs. I love soaking it with malt vinegar and sprinkle with Cajun seasoning!!! Yum!! I can practically taste it now!!! ÊBy itself, it is also very tasty and flavorful!! So tender, falls off the bone!

4.5 Stars rounded down only because I tend to round down. I was happy after eating from here =D Our wait wasn't tediously long so no complaints here. I usually come when there's no line so this kind of surprised me. There are benches that wrap along the restaurant so some people in your group can sit while you wait in line. Our food came pretty quick and there people there were attentive to all of the people sitting in the patio (where we had a table). Generous portions! I got a baby back rib tickler and that "tickler" was enough to fill me up (all of it). I got four pieces versus the three I'm supposed to get so I was a happy camper. The baby back ribs were goooood except not every piece for me was tender off the bone (maybe that's why I got an extra piece). That wasn't that big of a hindrance for me--it was still delicious. The tangy-ness of the sauce is something I love. The sauce is more tangy than sweet. The onion rings were MASSIVE and crunchy (I rather have had them a little softer). Two of them were definitely more than enough. I'm a fan of coleslaw and liked their coleslaw. I'm not a fan of salty foods and the fries were perfect for me. I felt like it was a good balance of food. My friends rave about their macaroni so maybe I'll try that next time.

OH MY GOD. This place was REAL TASTY. I really liked their portions, it was more than enough to keep me full. I could not finish it, and had taken home some left overs to munch on. I ordered the half and half (half chicken, half ribs) along with macaroni salad, and french fries. ADD the green seasoning can on your fries, IT TASTES BOMBBBBB! the macaroni salad was good too, but the Red Hot sauce WAS GOOOD! my friend actually put that sauce into his to-go box (yes, he straight up ghetto-ed himself by stealing a $2.50 hot sauce from a bbq joint). but yes, memories were made here. If there was one in cerritos, I would definitely go at least twice a week, and get fat, and die from heart attack, along with death by satisfaction.

I came here on a Friday night with a party of 4. We are all from the Bay area, but I had moved down to San Diego about a year ago. We've all been dying to try this place since it was on my "Man Vs. Food" list. I think for a party of 4, I waited about 35-40 minutes? Service was extremely friendly. One of the workers came out and let my Bf and I try the baked beans and macaroni salad before we decided to order it. Extra Star for her! I ended up ordering the full side of ribs (12 ribs) and got a side of fries and potatoe salad. My Bf ended up ordering the chicken and got a large side of baked beans. The sides are RIDICULOUSLY amazing. I would never order beans as a side but their baked beans are SOO addicting-sweet, tangy, buttery goodness. My ribs were fall off the bone tender with a good amount of BBQ sauce. Fries are like IN-N-OUt but bigger. I would definetly come here again regardless of the lines!

The stars say three, but I want them to say two and a half. I stopped going there. After three or four times in the new place, I just couldn't do it again. Mission Hills was DA BOMB, but sports arena...an over crowded feedery that has replaced excellent food with customer turnover with only profit in mind. I don't want to even go into the details of the food because I really don't want to ruin it for most of the customers. At least they got rid of the stryofoam containers on every meal. Oh well, good bye to Phil's until I need to bring out-of-town guests who are easily impressed and want to see a diverse crowd chowing down.

One word describes Phil's = Amazing. There ribs are the best in San Diego. I first had them at their mission hills location when it was a hole in the wall restuarant. Then then grew and started gettting complaints becuase of the smell. But There ribs, chicken , onion rings, BBQ sauce are one of kind to San Diego's BBQ Food. If you want some great BBQ food for reasonable prices then head over to Phil's at the their new expanded location on Sports Arena Blvd.

Phil's almost lives up to the hype. I've been going to Phil's a few times a year since they were located in Hillcrest. During peak meal hours the people queuing up outside resemble the lines for Space mountain, so avoid that if possible. Is it the best in SD? That depends on your favorite style of BBQ and let's be honest Cali-style BBQ--which this is--never seems to pop up on any top ten lists. That being said, if it's going to be good BBQ then it's gotta be pork and the Broham, a good sized pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw on top is far and away the best thing on the menu. The "Toro," a beef version of the Broham is pretty good too. I've ordered the ribs (both types) a couple of times, but always found there was a little too much char on them for my taste. The chicken... really? ...who cares? All the sides are good, but again there's one true standout: The Onion Rings are phenomenal, and when dipped in the ranch dressing... well I'd go there just to eat them.

I see many of you have reviewed Phil's BBQ and for me, being a San Diego native, Phil's is the Best-Bar-None! If want to Impress anyone with Barbequed Chicken or Ribs Phil's is the best, not only for the large portions of food, but for the atmosphere that is poppin, rain or shine, day or night, doesn't matter. Usually packed, but that's what makes it fun. They have their act together, their roming greeters are the best and are on top of their customers every second. I love em! They make you feel like you are the only group there. Beyond friendly. By the way, don't let the long line fool you, if goes very fast and it will be worth it. Don't forget their water trough during and Êafter you eat, you might need it, I for one make a mess of all the good BBQ Chicken on my hands and face. I need a water trough after I eat.

I've been going to Phil's since the day they opened their doors in Mission Hills, and I was just youngin going to St. Vincent's school around the corner. ÊSuddenly my lunch money was being saved and pooled together for afternoon binges at Phil's. ÊThe food is great, and definitely worth the wait. ÊThese days though, with the line the way it is at the new Sports Arena location I always just call in my order and bring it home. Ê I can't act like I'm not a little disappointed that they decided to close the doors on the Mission Hills location for good. ÊThat was where it all started, and I have a lot of good memories there... ÊBut I got over it as soon as I drove by the new location and smelled that delicious Phil's smell again.

For the price you pay and the amount / quality of food you get....this place definitely hits the spot. Even though this place seems to be always busy, the staff continuously are very friendly. ...from the greeter at the door all the way to the staff cleaning off the tables. ÊI've been here numerous times where the chef comes out and visits tables to see how everyone is doing. ÊSometimes it's another staff member (not your waiter) who does this, but it adds to the down to earth charm and home style setting it tries to achieve. ÊKudos for this extra added customer service. ÊIt's these little things that mean alot to many of us that make us feel at home. ÊThank you! ÊThat's a hard thing to do in a busy place like this and I commend you for achieving it. I first started going to Phil's way back in the original location. ÊI missed that place because it had more of a hole in the wall / home vibe....small and intimate. ÊThis new place sort of loses that charm for me. ÊDecor looks too new and commercial for my liking. ÊI understand the move to a bigger more centrally located area however. ÊI just wish they left opened the original place too. As for the food... Let's just say I always walk away feeling full and with leftovers to bring home! Ê That's a good thing! ÊI always order the Rib-less / Chick-less (half-order of rib-less pork BBQ and half order of boneless BBQ chicken). ÊThis isn't on the menu....the old school people from the original location remember this though! ÊYou can still ask for it. ÊPhil's barbecue sauce makes everything taste so good.....a little bit sweet and spicy and tangy. Negatives: -it's a popular place so expect a long line to get in especially during peak meal hours....expect a wait. -there's no reservations taken here -big groups can be hard to seat...it's possible just be patient Pros: -unlike the old place there's a bar here! Êwoohooo! ÊBBQ and Beer....so good! -the bar is a separate room apart from the main restaurant -patio seating...perfect during a hot day -they take phone orders for pick up! Some advice: -if you wanna miss the long lines try coming here off peak meal hours or during the weekdays. -if it's just you and a friend try grabbing a seat at the bar area...you can order food there too. ÊPlease order a beer or two and don't be a bar hog taking up space and not drinking. ÊI need room when I get there! For San Diego, this place deserves these five stars.

ÊThey were not the pork best ribs I've ever had, but they were damned good. Ê(I don't think they were smoked, since the meat wasn't pink and smokey-sweet, but they might just be the best non-smoked pork ribs I've had.)

900 + Yelpers can't be wrong! I had the baby back ribs, beef rib, onions rings, fries, sweet beans and cole slaw. The ribs were great! I am a fan of the pork ribs which were cooked so the meat almost fell off the bone. Good clean eating! I am a huge fan of the tangy BBQ sauce (hate the sweet stuff) so along with the rub these are very tasty ribs. The onion rings reminded me of the type you might get at a Fair, which could be good or bad depending on your taste. The beans were average as were the fries. The cole slaw was a bit above average. Finally, the price is fair for what you get. The seating arrangement is a bit odd, and you will probably stand in line, then feel rushed to leave so others can sit.. but hey... I'm telling you its worth it!

This is one of the best bbq restaurants I have ever been to. Believe me I've eaten alot of BBQ. This is the way BBQ restaurants should be. You order, sit down, they give you a pager, pick up your food, and devour. The BBQ is so good that I hate beef ribs and their beef ribs are almost better than their baby back ribs. BBQ without the hype (Lucille's). I like Lucille's but this place has reasonable prices and better food. Oh their southern hospitality when you arrive can be felt. They make sure they take extra good care of you. I usually get the ribs and chicken. The onion rings are awesome too! Cool thing is when you are finished, they have a sink right by the drink station so you can wash your hands.

Well after a thousand or so reviews that this place gets, I'm pretty much going to say that this place is by far the best BBQ I've ever had. Yeah, yeah I know preaching to the choir here but hey. I ordered the ribs of course and was more than satisfied. Northern Ca restaurants don't have anything on this place and yes that's where I'm from. A half rack of ribs here is what they consider a full rack up there. Just to give a proportional visual. Now I know why this place is packed during dinner.

An old man standing in line behind me told me that Phil's has the best macaroni salad in the world. I decided to follow his word and ordered a baby back rib full dinner with a side of macaroni salad and baked beans. The BBQ sauce is tangy and savory, once I started eating it I couldn't stop. It was just so good that my mouth already bit onto it before my stomach told my brain that I was getting too full. Being a selfish eater, I tried to keep my girlfriend from stealing my macaroni salad. Cooked to Al-dente macaroni with sufficient mayo, pepper, finely diced celery, egg white and so many other flavors going on in this simple side dish. She thought she wasn't hungry when we got there and ordered a small side of fries for a little over $1, which turned out to be a small hill of crispy and perfectly salted fries. Can't really get better than that. After trying the macaroni salad, my girlfriend decided to go back to the counter and ordered a small side of mac salad for herself Êand the cashier girl nicely offered her a large side instead. Friendly staff is one of the key components that keeps comfort food enthusiasts coming back. Staff always come up to your table and ask about your day, creating a friendly and homely atmosphere. I wish I could describe the deliciousness of the baked beans I had. I finished the sweet, tangy, slightly sticky baked beans in about 4 spoonfuls. It was just so good that I couldn't stop. Phil's, you almost made me tear up about how amazing the food is here.

I don't know what people are thinking giving it four stars, but I absolutely love this place. Yeah the line is sometimes a bit long, but it goes by fast and if your standing with your friends and talking it sure passes the time more quickly. The food is great and the price is pretty cheap. I usually get the Tickler from them which is great because it's a smaller portion of the baby back ribs. ÊTheir BBQ sauce is pretty delicious and they're known for it. I also like their cole slaw and onion rings.

I am not sure what the hype of Phil's really lived up to it's expectations. Ê Don't get me wrong, great BBQ for SD, great atmosphere if you are looking for people/games, hanging out. I really really liked their baby backs, their sauce is above par, but not outstanding. ÊI agree with Glenn R., too much suce, it's almost to the point of wanting meat to go along with the sauce! Definitely come here either really early or really late, or guaranteeded you will be standing in line for a long time. ÊThink Disneyland 4th of July weekend for Space Mountain or Indiana Jones. One of the things I didn't like is that I found that the other meats I could get at Stonefire Grill or another order and sit. In the end, the good baby backs, other decent meats, and the above par bbq sauce doesn't make me want to wait in line for 1 - 1.5 hours. Good, but not good enough!

Best BBQ Experience ever! Came out to San Diego on 3/16/2010 to puchase a car, decided to drop by Phil's after reading hundreds of yelp reviews about how good this place was. I had to give it a try for myself. I came hungry, I ate like there was no tomorrow, I failed to finish everything, so was forced to take the tasty sensation back to Los Angeles with me. Finished it the next day, and still tasted great! I highly recommend the onion rings! They are simply amazing, I have no words to describe how orgasmic these onion rings are!

I don't think I can say anymore than has already been said...but I love this place! We recommend it to friends on a regular basis and accompany them as much as possible. I would say that this is the BEST BBQ place in all of San Diego and LA. You normally have to wait a good amount of time to get in, but I have never been unsatisfied with my meal, it's definitely worth the wait! The meat always falls right off the bone, and the sauce is the perfect blend or sweet and tangy (it has a bit of kick to it, too). If you're not sure you'll enjoy a lot of sauce, ask for it on the side and put the amount you like on yourself. The sides are even something to brag about: my favorites are the fries and coleslaw. You can't go wrong with the slaw! Anyway, I haven't been going here for years, but I've already gone WAY too much :) It's just soooooooooo good!

I'm proud to give Phil's 5 stars. Only once in my life have I ever not finished my food at Phil's and that was the day after I had a cardiac arrhythmia. Fuck it, I wanted Phil's. It's worth the heart block. Yes, there is a line. A line that I enjoy waiting in. Where else can you stand in line, be on a webcam, smell the finest cue this side of the Rockies and daydream about a hunk of cow covered in their sauce? Nowhere. That's where. Wonderful. Here's to many more years of business, Phil!

I can't imagine this being the best BBQ in SD....however, SD is more know for fish tacos so that statement may not be too far off. I got the combo pork ribs and BBQ chicken breast with two sides meal. The pork ribs were tender and full of flavor but the slather of BBQ sauce seemed too be overkill on sweetness. The chicken was on the dry side and the thick layer of sauce didn't help it. Also, other than the fries, I wished the sides were more generous. The service was top notch. Very friendly and very helpful. All in all, I left stuffed and satisfied. I'll be back to try the beef ribs everyone's been raving about. Bottom line: I know there is better BBQ than this....it's probably not in Cali, thou.

What can I say that a thousand people have already said? Nothing really =D It's good bbq but having tried some Texan bbq... it's just not the same. If the owners are reading my review though... IF YOU BRING BRISKET ON THE MENU I"LL EDIT THIS INTO A FIVE. But other than the food, the service is fun an great. There's this lady who stands at the front of the line the last two times I've been there has hugged me and squeezed my arm and given me the loving tenderness only a mom gives to her kid. She makes me smile. but anyways. about the food again. Get the baby back never beef ribs Pulled pork is good but why the hell would you get that when you can get ribs. Chicken is pretty darn good but it's not baby back ribs. Seriously though...get the ribs. If you don't like ribs than ... I don't know try these cause they will make you like them. I've picked up a bone and had the meat slide all off. Crazy kind of tender. Also I would call in advance but I want to see the lady at the front of the line. Seriously, you should try to get to meet her.

Locals will cheer, BBQ snobs will find it reasonably decent. (15+ visits) One of our favorites - the food is great (well, for California), portions are generous without being too big, and the prices are ... well, a little high for a place without waiters, but if you check the omnipresent line at front door you can't say they're priced above what the market will bear. Out the door, you're looking at about $17 per person. Expect to wait 30 minutes on a weeknight, and we've not been so brave and / or desperate to test a weekend. Take-out is always an option - call ahead, eat it at home, and avoid the line (or at least most of it). And yes, they're using real wood smoke to flavor their meat - you can smell it (in a very good way) Êfrom half a mile away. I don't see how people living nearby avoid going slowly insane from this. The meat tends to be leaner-than-average for BBQ; they rely more on the smoke and the sauce for flavor. I actually prefer this - it reduces the impact on the waistline by a few notches. The "Ribless Meal" has become our favorite has - large chunks of very lean meat with sauce. BBQ affectionados (especially from out-of-state) will find plenty to quibble about - the sauce relies too heavily on sugar (actually, high-fructose corn syrup - even worse) and isn't terribly complex, etc. But you don't visit or live in Cali for the BBQ. And as local variants go, this is the best we've found so far.

WHAT. San deezy's #1 BBQ pig-out spot. HOW. Family vacay in sd, less than a mile away from our hotel. And oh.. another man v food feature spot. Geez, what a no brainer. TASTE. Lemme start off by saying.. EVERYTHING HERE IS GOOD. Believe me when i say that. Whether its beef, pork or chicken - rib, pulled or bits - whatever floats your boat. The meat detaches itself from the bones the minute it makes contact to your knife/fork. Then it releases this hypnotizing aroma that is the epitome of bbq greatness; smokey not burnt. Then it melts in your mouth just like butter. To top it off, their home made cole slaw seals the deal by contrasting the meat's flavor with its own dose of freshness and tanginess. Seriously, it doesnt get better than this. SERVICE. Being that popularity exceeds expectations, all is forgiven in the land of phil's. Usual complaints here include long lines, hours of waiting and (hence) jam packed parking. But ask anyone if that was all worth the hassle and dont be surprised to hear a resounding "YES". There are plenty seats to accomodate everyone, a nice bar to get your alchy-side on and servers (my age) here are aint bad to look at either. FYI: they do accept phone-in/pickup orders but if you're stuck in line, no worries - the "bbqueue cam" will keep u busy (a live cam feed streamed to their website). PRICE. Entrees range from $10-20 depending on what and how much of it. Descent at first glance, worth it after the first bite. Overall, Phil's BBQ packs a whole lotta punch when it comes to delivering midwest style barbecue to the west coast. This spot isnt for the veg-minded but is totally meat-lover friendly. So next time when your in town make sure to check this place out.

Oh. My. God. This place has the BEST ribs ever! I don't even understand how it could be so good. Not only are the ribs big and meaty, but the are cooked and flavored to perfection. Even their onion rings were cooked perfectly It's a pet peeve of mine when the onion slides out after one bite, but these onion rings were awesome. Only downside is that there were too many onion rings and I couldn't finish! This place was definitely worth the wait. I hope to make it a habit to eat here whenever I'm in San Diego.

Great BBQ in San Diego? This review is way past due, as this is one of my favorite spots in San Diego. My usual order consists of either a best of both, a Broham sandwich, or an El Toro sandwich. I have never had a bad meal here so I don't think you can go wrong with whatever you choose. The meat is juicy, falls of the bone, and their sandwiches are packed with tons of meat! So much meat I just put the excess on top of my fries. Another thing, the service here is top notch. Everyone is polite and it seems like they always have smiles on their faces. A definite recommendation to locals and anyone thinking of a place to bring visiting guests.

If you don't mind waiting for an hour and listening in on the loud, inane, conversations of sorority girls ("Like OMG that dress totally makes you look like a slut"), then Phil's is the way to go. I ended up getting the "best of both" rib and chicken dinner, which was tasty enough. But take heed! The heavy aroma/flavoring will slightly burn your eyes and your nose if you get too close to it (sue me, I like smelling my food). ÊI'm sure I could have gone with the half dinner and still have went away satisfied instead of ridiculously stuffed.

I wasn't a big fan of Phil's BBQ, I don't think it really lived up to the hype my friends and the yelp reviewers gave it. To begin with I didn't like that you Êhave to find your own seating, the place was super crowded & I had to stalk people who were almost done with there food just so I could steal their table. Next because its so crowded you feel guilty to spending any longer than you have to at your table so another party can finally find a seat. The BBQ was delicious but I think their sauce was lacking, you can't have good BBQ if your sauce if missing that key element. Sorry Phil's I don't think your BBQ is worth that long wait.

All I have to say is El Toro, this delicious sandwich is a Êchar-grilled deli sliced tri-tip topped with their flavorful BBQ sauce. Make sure you grab extra napkins eating this thing, one of my favorite sandwiches but my only gripe is this place is always packed don't expect to get in and out quick even if you call ahead.

I finally caught this place when the line wasn't out the door. ÊI was disappointed in the food. The best thing on the menu was the fries and the chili was great. But the ribs and chicken was pretty average at best. Still wondering why this place is always packed?

I love Phil's! I always get the ribs and a huge macaroni salad, which is some of the best I have tasted I might add, and the onion rings are to die for....But i just wish they would get a bigger location for San Diego, theres just so many people who want Phil's and not enough space. I will wait in line for however long for this BBQ but it sucks when its cold outside haha. I waited 30 mins in the call-in line! But it was worth it but much better sitting down...so Phil's think about moving to a bigger location in San Diego ( just for me :) because San Marcos is so far) ha just kidding...but not really.

After being at UCSD for 2.5 years, I finally went to Phil's BBQ. I had heard all about it and was skeptical that I wouldn't like it and it wouldn't be worth all the rave....boy was I proved wrong. This place is delicious!! My boyfriend and I split the pork ribs. We didn't want to eat too much - just the right amount. But I think that 1. I would definitely be back and 2. I'd try more things. We had the coleslaw which I had no complaints about. But the BBQ sauce....OMG

Best BBQ I've ever had! I spent my whole life in SoCal so I haven't had regional exposure to BBQ, but I've heard that Phil's is pretty high up there as one of the nation's best BBQ joints. I've had almost every item on their menu and everything is delicious, very reasonably priced for it's quality, and largely portioned. All their BBQ meats are juicy, tender, smokey, and seasoned perfectly with their special sauces and spices. Their side dishes (fries, onion rings, potato/macaroni /garden salads, baked potato, corn on the cob, beans, etc.) compliment the rich flavors of the meat entrees perfectly. And the portions are HUGE; their plates are essentially trays! They also have a bar side of the restaurant where people hang out, eat some great BBQ, have a few beers, and watch whatever game is on. Oh and the service at Phil's is GREAT. All the servers are extremely laid back, friendly, and genuinely care about the customers, which makes the casual atmosphere of Phil's so lovable (: The only down side about going to Phil's is the wait; it's always around 30+ minute with an hour plus wait time during dinnertime and weekends, but trust me it's worth it! The combination of large portions, meaty delicious-ness,friendly/casual atmosphere, and cheap pricing makes Phil's a go to place for a hungry hungry student like myself Highly recommended and is a MUST for san diego visits!

I've been here twice and both times I went the line was extremely long. But oh my god was the food worth the wait. Once I sat down, the food was almost instantly ready for me to pick up, and boy was I happy. You get a generous amount of food from what you order. I ordered the El Toro which is a sandwich that just overflows with tri-tip and drenched in their addicting sweet and tangy sauce. You can't go wrong with any sides that you order, they're all delicious. It's also good to mention their humongous onion rings that literally fit around your wrist. All in all, if you are in San Diego and are craving some good barbecue, there's no doubt that Phil's is going to be your number one choice.

Ok, so I generally do not like eating food with my fingers let alone BBQ. Hands down this place has got to be the best BBQ I have ever had. The line was ridiculously long. Off the top of my head I think I waited a little less than 2 hours. The cool thing about the restaurant is that you can drink in line. The two hours went by relatively quickly only because I was pretty drunk by the time I hit the front of the line. This place is awesome, the food is dirt cheap, big portioned and really good. I ordered their RIBS, FRIES, and ONION RINGS. With BBQ you can not go wrong there. If you go to SD this is a restaurant that you will want to try out. ENJOY!

Do you know the signs of good eats? Long lines. Check. 2,000+ review on Yelp. Check 4.5 stars average. Check Walking into the place and see local 5.0 eating here. Check Extremely friendly cashier and making sure your order is right? Check Do you think my order got swapped out by one of those "secretly swapping" commercial restaurants who says their product is better than yours? Perhaps. I was going to pee in my pants when the above checks were in place when I had received my food. ÊI had called in advance and waited in the line to the left, bypassing most everyone else. What was nice about this place is that price is super modest and that they don't bag your food until you arrive. So immediately, I opened the boxes and started to eat on my 100 mile trip home. I had the baby back ribs, and the 1/2 chicken dinner. Tried some of the sides, including the beans, cole slaw, and fries. Well, just a small tidbit about myself, I do smoke my own meats at home with applewood chunks. ÊEven though the baby back ribs is fall off the bones goodness, I did not taste any smoke nor did I see any smoke rings on the meats. ÊYes, the sauce was a bit much for me as well, as I tasted more sauce than the ribs. The beans were a bit overdone as was the fries. Both items to me, tasted a little sugary. The cole slaw, however, was pretty damn awesome. It was not vinegary or did it have too much mayo. Probably the best damn cole slaw I've ever had! However, I didn't come here for this. I wondered if my to go choice had made an impact to the food, but looking at the food promptly put in container prior to eating within five minutes, there shouldn't be anything wrong with my order. I know I'm going to get slapped for giving them 3 stars, but I would come back with any friends one day to have a sit down experience when the line is not long.

Long story short: Pretty killer BBQ. ÊDefinitely worth the wait in line. Long story long: When I went to San Diego for a mini vacation on one of my days off from work, I was looking for a place to go to lunch when I got there, and it wasn't long before I came across this listing on Yelp. ÊI had heard about it and heard it was pretty dang good BBQ. ÊI love BBQ and I'm sure nearly 1900 people can't be wrong. When I pulled up at the peak lunch hour that was 12:30, I noticed a line coming out the door and going along the front of the building. ÊNot one who likes waiting a long time for food, I initially was considering going somewhere else, but my problem was I was not familiar with the area and knew I would end up just wasting time trying to find a place that I wasn't originally planning on having, so I just decided to park and brave the line. ÊI got in line and I was hearing that from where I was, it was about 20 minutes to just get inside, and being by myself, it wasn't like I could get out of line to see how long the line was inside. While waiting in line, I was starting to think back to my marketing class in college. ÊThe reason being is they had a couple of employees floating around the line, informing people how long the wait is as well as chit-chatting with them. ÊThat's a type of marketing. ÊI will be making several references to that throughout this review, I warn you. ÊOh, they had a large menu board hanging, so you could decide what to get before you even got inside I eventually got to the door and got a look inside. ÊThe remainder of the line from that point was only about 15-20 people deep. ÊAt that point I had been waiting for about 15-20 minutes, so I figured it would only be a few more minutes. ÊInside, there is the bar area to the left, the kitchen straight ahead, and a large, casual dining room to the right. ÊThere is a little bit of outdoor seating on either side. ÊAnd just when you get inside, along the line, a TV which cycles essentially an informercial highlighting the restaurant's background as well as the banquet and catering services. ÊAgain, I thought back to my marketing class. I definitely wanted to get some of their ribs, but I for whatever reason also wanted to try the bbq chicken, so I decided to get one of their combinations, which they label "The Best of Both". ÊAs for their ribs, they offer either baby back or beef ribs. ÊAll of their combinations come with either 2 small sides or 1 large side. ÊI decided to get the fries (I love french fries) and the bbq baked beans. ÊI mean, when having BBQ, what better side than BBQ baked beans? ÊThey're like pea and carrots. ÊOnce I ordered, the cashier (who was nice) gave me one of those buzzer do-hickeys, to which I noticed on one side had the restaurant's logo... or I think it did. ÊI can't quite remember. ÊBut if it did... marketing class.... just sayin' After a few minutes, the buzzer went off and I went to go retrieve my food. ÊIt looked and smelled really good. ÊI grabbed a bunch of napkins, some water, and headed outside to one of the covered patios. I sat down and dug in. ÊI tried the sides and they were both good. ÊThe baked beans weren't watery and pretty flavorful, but the fries were average at best. ÊI got most of those out of the way before I got to the ribs. ÊNow, I'm no BBQ expert or pitmaster, but I still love my BBQ and these ribs were probably one of the better ribs I've had. ÊIt was quite tender and very flavorful. ÊI kind of wish I had order just the ribs. ÊI tried the chicken and while it was still good, I determined I would just stick with the ribs. ÊThe sauce was pretty nice too. ÊThick, not too vinegary or heavy on one flavor. ÊWhen I finished, I was satisfied, yet not stuffed. ÊWhile I was waiting for the buzzer to go off, one of their employees had come around and was passing around business cards that had a number to text and he said if we win, they would cater a party for up to 25 people. ÊOr something like that. ÊI've since thrown the card away. Would I come back? ÊUnless I was in a rush or had to be somewhere, I would definitely come back again.

I've been here a few times ~ once during the lunch hour, not much of a wait ~ and another time for the dinner rush. OKAY, let me just say that I didn't particularly enjoy that part ... but I did LOVE the food. The Onion Rings are scrumptious and the prices are pretty decent.

Despite of the looooooong waiting line and the stuffy environment, I still visit Phil's BBQ whenever I have a chance to go to San Diego. They have the BEST BBQ! The baby back ribs are so tender that you don't even need a knife. And you will be drooling so bad just smelling the smoky flavored chicken. Did I mention that the onion rings and the steamed veggies are good too?

I love BBQ and this place is really good. ÊNot the best I have ever had but still pretty good. ÊThe reason I gave 4 stars is because of the variety of food they served. ÊThe really good BBQ places also have sausage and brisket (and more), not only ribs and chicken... We had the baby back ribs and sampled a beef rib. ÊBoth were really good. ÊWe also had the fries, beans and onion rings. ÊThe fries were so good that my gf barely ate any ribs because she loved the fries so much! ÊBeans and onion were good but not memorable. Yes we did have to wait in line but it only took about 10 mins to order. ÊWe went on a Sunday around noon and we just beat the Church rush by 30 mins. Ê Keep that in mind if you head there on Sunday. However, it's the best BBQ place that I have been to in So Cal!! ÊTexas BBQ ftw!

One of the best places for BBQ in Southern California. Although, after trying a bunch of stuff on their menu, I was only a big fan of the baby back ribs. I found the chicken dry, but they deserve 5 stars due to the fact that their slightly tangy ribs were nothing short of delicious. The ribs were moist and tender. I don't know what else you could ask for.

Solid. ÊThat's the first word that comes to mind. Having lived in the South and spent a lot of time in North Carolina, I've had my fair share of good BBQ. ÊWhile I do prefer the North Carolina style of vinegar based BBQ sauces, I do enjoy a good slab of ribs from time to time. I ventured here tonight and noticed the long line of people as I entered the place. ÊUsually I might have left, as I just wanted a quick bite. ÊI decided to try my luck ordering at the bar, which they allow you to do if you sit AT the bar. I had the half rack of ribs with small sides of the baked beans and the potato salad. ÊThe ribs did fall right off the bone and were very tender. ÊWhen it comes to BBQ, though, everyone knows it's mostly about the sauce. ÊThe sauce was definitely solid, but I can't say spectacular. ÊI did think the beans had a great flavor. ÊHowever, my biggest complaint about the beans was that they were mostly sauce with a few tiny beans. ÊI generally expect the beans in baked beans to be a bit larger. ÊIf you're going to use small beans, at least feature more of them. ÊI'm fairly picky when it comes to potato salad and would say this one was about average. Ê I can definitely see why this place gets such high reviews in San Diego. ÊI feel like it's mostly because San Diego doesn't have a lot of comparable places. ÊFor fans of vinegar based BBQ NC style, this is not the place for you. ÊFor those who want a solid slab of ribs, give it a try. Is it worth waiting an hour or more for? Probably not. However, if you're able to find a seat at the bar on a busy night , it's a solid bet.

Upon first arriving around 7:30pm on a Friday evening, the line circled around the side of the building. We returned around 9pm and waited only five minutes! So go super early or late to avoid the crazy wait. Overall, it was reasonably priced and a fun environment to dine in. Baby Back Ribs- Good El Toro sandwich- Good Onion Rings- Great Sauce- Too Tangy Interesting points about Phil's: A. After waiting in line, you walk up to the register and order like @ fast food places. B. After you order, you have to find a table- which can be difficult when it's super crowded. So have someone go stake a table while you order. C. You receive a pager that alerts you when the food is ready. It gets really chaotic at the pick-up counter because it's small and it seems like everyone orders the same things so verify that you are actually picking up what you ordered! Only one major problem- the wait for the food! Someone "accidentally" picked up our order and they still made us wait a while to pick our order. The manager was totally unapologetic about the mix-up. So we ended up waiting over 25 minutes for our food when people who ordered after us were served first.

I live in the South Bay and it's definitely worth the drive to this place. Like: Beef ribs. End of story. Dislike: The long wait, but that's what happens with popularity, right? Personal note: I've waited in line for a table and although the food is great, sometimes you're so hungry that the long wait can just wear on you -- almost to the point of outright leaving. I highly recommend calling it in and eating the awesome BBQ someplace where you can just get messy with it.

They really drown their ribs with the sauce. I'm from Texas so I'm a bit disappointed that they don't have brisket and the bbq is definitely different but I'm not gonna disrespect a place just because it's not like Êhome. I just don't get that because when in Rome you do as the Romans do. Geez. Lines are long so if you don't like waiting avoid the irritation and phone in an order and do take out. It's San Diego, I'd rather eat by the beach! FYI, the ribless dinner does have more meat. It's still flavorful but not as moist as the pork ribs. The meat is not the same. I'd rather get the pork ribs next time and just get my hands dirty. The onion rings are excellent. The corn tastes awesome when you slather it with butter and barbecue sauce. It's good stuff.

Was down in San Diego and a friend suggested that we go to this place for BBQ. He had discovered it the day before and he liked it very much. Now, I'm a big fan of BBQ, but I don't know about waiting 20 or 30 minutes! Luckily on the day that I went the line wasn't that bad. It was about a 5 minute wait but they tried to throws us to the bar. We walk up to the bar and their is no place to sit! The young woman was nice enough to recognize her mistake and let us go ahead infront of the line. We ordered our food and found a place to sit. Won't complain about the food because it was delicisous. Very tasty Pulled Pork Sandwich. Can't say it was the best I've ever had but I rank it towards the top. If you're hungry ... pack a snack for the wait.

Phil's is the best. ÊI've been going to them since they were up at their old location in Mission Hills. ÊYes, there is often a line, but they are pretty darn effiicent with it and get you through it as quickly as possible. ÊFood this good is worth the wait! My faves: Onion rings that can make your knees buckle The Broham -- pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw. ÊBrilliant! Baby back ribs -- kind of pricey, but simply delicious. Phil's is not great for groups. ÊIt's just too busy and hard to get a table for a large gathering. ÊI wouldn't recommend it for any group of more than 6, especially if you're ordering separately. The restaurant itself is very kid-friendly, doesn't mind a mess and is so noisy that no one cares (or notices) if your kids make a minor racket. ÊBUT the line and wait can sometimes be long, so I guess your own personal enjoyment depeneds on how patient your kids can be :-) Overall, two thumbs way, way, WAY up.

Best BBQ in San Diego... well, best baby back ribs at least. Though I haven't tried much else, and why would you after tasting them, the baby back ribs are delicious. ÊTender, lean, and smothered in BBQ sauce. This place is always busy (line out the door), and seating is a self-serve free for all, but the hassle is definitely worth it. I recommend going either very early, or very late on a weekday. ÊGet the baby back ribs. ÊDon't wast your time on the chicken or turkey burger (they are dry and take an exorbitant amount of time to prepare... punishment I suppose for deviating from their specialty). One more thing... skip lunch on a Phil's night... you will want the extra room... trust me!

Best BBQ around, and prices won't kill you. Little bit of a drive for me, but worth it. Lines can be a bit long, and seating sparce, so come during off-times. The service is A-1, portions BIG, and the BBQ is great. Not gourmet food, but "real" BBQ fare that will leave your hands and face dripping & asking for more. Onion Rings are good, but they take a second to Wahoo's onion rings. (Sorry Phil)

I have lived lots of places that are known for their BBQ from Texas to Tennessee but Phil's puts them all to shame. There is not a lot that I can say that hasn't already been said by others but I recommend this place to anyone who has never had it. The baby back ribs are as tender as they get and the sauce is perfect. To be perfectly honest I have never had anything else on the menu because it would be a waste of a meal to not have at least a half rack. For those that appreciate diversity though, they do have meal options with both chicken and ribs. Get their early to find parking and avoid a long wait (though it is worth it if you are not so lucky).

This past weekend I had the wonderful t opportunity to try Phil's BBQ. And all I have to say is...AMAZING. When I arrived at the restaurant Sunday afternoon, the place was PACKED. I thought to myself..is this even worth it? But once I started chowing down on those delicious baby back ribs it was most definitely worth the wait. This is probably one of the best ribs I've had in awhile. The portions are great. One large meal of BBQ ribs was enough to satisfy me and my boyfriend. As for sides, I had the potato salad which was quite yummy as well as the baked potato which wasn't that great. As far as appetizers, I'm obsessed with the onion rings. They're a must have! Overall, I really enjoyed Phil's BBQ. Great food. Fast service.

DONT BE INTIMIDATED BY THE LINE! Oh Phil's how i have missed you! You are still good! I may not live there anymore, but your still near and dear to my heart! ÊI lived in SD for years and was an original Hill Crest Patron. Was disappointed to see it close, but excited when it opened up in Sports Arena at 10x the size. The lines were always big, but it seems like every time they grow, the lines get longer! lol ÊThe lines were long at Sports Arena, back then. Ive been gone for 2 and the line was jaw dropping BUT they move quick. Even when its to the back of the bldg, its still only 30min. You'll do that next door at Red Lobster. Good job to the people working the lines, you are good comedy and keep the people entertained while waiting. To the lady that works the front of the line before you get to the register - you are awesome! My mom loved you every time we went. She always remembered you and even though she has passed, she would be happy to see you're still there entertaining! What to know before you go: If the line is TOO big when you arrive. and can't wait in line, call in a to go order, and pick it up immediately. DO NOT try to take a table, just go to the beach and eat it, its less than3 min away!

I go the full rack dinner meal (kinda pricey) but was so worth it! A lot of food too...ate it 3 times (dinner, lunch, dinner)... CONS: I advise you to get it for take out because the wait is always long! There's literally a line that forms out the door and wraps around one side of the restaurant!

Absolutely the best BBQ ever. ÊI won't eat ribs any where else after having been to Phil's. ÊEven though I have moved a half hour away I still make the Êtrip down a couple times a month. Expect a line if you go at dinner time or the weekend! ÊBut, worth the wait!

Just got back from here and wish I could find word to describe it. All I can say that the whole experience and food was amazing!!! Can I give it 6 stars? Maybe 10? Anyone who has not been needs to go. I got the baby back ribs and fries. They say 6 ribs yet I got 9 so even better. The meat and sauce was as good as you can get. The pork was falling off the rib and the sauce was to die for. There may be better BBQ out there in the world but in San Diego you cannot get any better, The crew that works makes the experience even better as well, they are truly there for you and it shows. I cannot wait to get back there again and again.

Is Phil's good? Yes. Is it great??? NOOOOOO. The bbq isn't "real" bbq (be it texan, north carolinian, or st louis style) but it's still good enough to go there (though I've never waited more than 5 min here. I don't think I'd wait more than 10 minutes for this food). It's basically meat flavorless meat covered with tasty sauce, which is fine but let's not kid ourselves here... I've had the pulled pork sandwhich a number of times, and it's decent. I'd rather get the ribs though. The sides are also ok (good, but not great). I do think the fries are above average though. Overall, Phil's can fix your craving for bbq, but it is by no means a knockout restaurant on the SD dining scene and in my eyes does not deserve the insane amount of 5-star reviews found here.

OMG the portions are huge! I ordered half a dinner baby ribs and I wasn't disappointed. Now I'm from LA so I'm not a BBQ expert, but hey I had a great time and the line was quick! I had to wait in line for about 30 minutes but it seems lesser than that because how fast the line shortens. The ribs I had was awesome, and huge portion of fries. Parking was not a problem, and it's not the best BBQ i eaten but its pretty good to me because I got a free meal! lol ;p

The only way I figured to celebrate the end of the school year is to be here at Phil's BBQ. I ordered the half baby back ribs and 1/4 chicken dinner with fries and sweet baked beans. I think I fell in love with the baby back ribs! They were tender and literally fall off the bone. And usually I don't like saucy things but the sauce was absolutely delightful! The chicken had a good smoky flavor that I liked. The fries took half my plate and they were the small order! Also I had ordered a small order of their Onion rings and boy, are they big! They are breaded nicely where over time they don't turn soggy as your meal goes by rather they were nice and crispy. I've never tasted onion rings so crisp! Phil's, makes my list of good BBQ and it is a real gem in SD! Plus when you park outside the air smells of BBQ; so awesome!

May I recommend phoning your orders in to avoid lines on busy nights, otherwise, plan on waiting 20-40 minutes to get in at peak hours. Ribs here are fantastic, plenty of meat that slides right off the bone and the sauce is the best I've tasted. I recommend the beefy ribs myself, and ordering a batch of battered onion rings the size of your face is almost a necessity every time. If you choose to eat in, the staff are as friendly as they get and the drink selection is the largest I've seen at a family joint.

This BBQ spot never fails! The occassion was for my job promotion, so we went on Friday around 6pm. Oh my, The line was long! It was my parents first time here so they were getting second thoughts. I told them the wait is worth it. Me and my little bro waited in line while the others chilled in the car. It took us 1.5 hours to reach the front of the line and we waited around 10-15min for our food. From baby back ribs, beefy ribs to their sloppy joes. The portion of each entree was phenemonal. The prices were affordable too. My little brother got that 7 dollar tickler and that already was too much for him. Expecting their small sides to be skimpy, it was not! It seemed like their small sides were large and their large was jumbo. The family & I were satisfied and recommend this spot to all. ÊA+++ for this joint.

A San Diego landmark for sure. I tried the baby back ribs, BBQ chicken, and the beef ribs. Both the baby back and beef ribs are very good, cooked to perfection, and falling off the bone. The sauce is awesome. The BBQ chicken was good, but I don't the chicken absorbs the bbq sauce as well as the slow cooked pork and beef ribs. There was a huge line, but it is well worth the wait. Must try if you're down in San Diego.

People in California wouldn't know good BBQ if it slapped 'em in the face. I don't see why people rave so much about this place. I mean, it's okay, but it's not that great. Everything is slathered in too much sauce & although it's not terribly expensive, I'd rather just go to a buffet for mediocre food.

Voted Americas best BBQ for the last 100 years or so. Phil is a genius. Anyone that ever said that their mom was a better cook is a liar. If you are thinking about opening a BBQ in San Diego, forget about it. People would drive by your crusty shack on the way to Phil's. I've seen Ninjas eating their, real ninjas! Vegetarians become carnivorous after only a few short moments in Phil's. If you wanted to meet God all you would have to do is go to Phil's and wait, it would just be a matter of time before he/she showed up again. The BBQ sauce cures cancer (hey it's worth a try). If we sent one plate of food from Phil's BBQ to Afghanistan the terrorists would give up and the war would be over. I get the beef ribs and corn on the cob. That is what you should get too. After one bite you immediately regret ever having eaten at another BBQ place. The meat falls off the bone and has no fat at all. The corn is made with special magic and never gets stuck in between your teeth. "I go to Phil's BBQ all the time" is the best pick up line ever. Women love Phil's BBQ and would rather eat their then go shopping or hang out with their family. If you are having trouble with your wife just take her to Phil's and she will forgive you for what ever you want. If you want BBQ go to Phil's or just starve.

I was on vacation in San Diego last week with the family. We wanted to find a place for BBQ and I used the Yelp! for Android App to find this place. Holy Moses... the ribs are divine.

I am a semi-vegetarian and I don't eat meat (I eat seafood) but I really enjoyed my visit here. I had the caesar salad with the homemade dressing... very tasty. I also had the baked potato which was very well baked but it came with butter in a small container, I was expecting some whipped butter. The best part was the service, when I picked up my food a server offered to help me to my table, and the "bussing" waitress was very friendly. Finding a table is a tricky task, be prepared! Dear Phils, can you make a BBQ shrimp dish?

Pork Ribs are the BEST!! Boneless Chicken is pretty dry though. They have awesome fries!!!!!!!!! Definitely always need to wait in line.

I have no complaints really about this place. ÊI understand everyone LOVES this place, but really, I'm not too sure if you can take what everyone says at face value. ÊHave you tried Texas style bbq?? Ê There are literally NO other bbq places in San Diego to compete with and everyone goes here. ÊI've had better, BUT, like I said, there isn't anywhere else to go for bbq in this town. ÊSo, Phil's it is! Ê Phil's is good enough, but I will have to agree with others, the sauces are somewhat bland. ÊIf you are used to Texas style or Kansas bbq, this isn't exactly similar. ÊThe meat is sometimes overcooked and the coleslaw isn't very flavorful - maybe they need to add more vinegar. ÊSome pulled pork would be nice :-) or did I miss that on the menu? Ê Anywho, worth checking it out - but I think bbq is a "to each their own" kind of thing. ÊI'll go back until there is something better in town. In reference to that there are more BBQ joints in town: Êmost of them are mom and pop shops - it's like comparing a Walmart or Target to a small boutique.

All you people who put less than 5 stars suck. Yes, the line is long...that's not their fault; lots of people love their food=long line. If you are SO worried about the long line, just call ahead and take it home, the food is ready in like 15 minutes or less and you can just eat it in your car if you want. That said, I LOVE Phil's. And yes, I have eaten at GREAT bbq joints, like The Shed in Mississippi (AMAZING), but that doesn't mean that Phil's isn't simply awesome. I've tried almost everything on their menu, but their mac salad is TO DIE FOR. I always get the Ribless Dinner (I hate dealing with messy bones) and for my 2 sides I get ALL mac salad, and each and every time the meat is super soft and tasty and the bbq sauce is finger-lickin good. I also share a small order (not that small!) of onion rings with the people I come with because they are the best onion rings ever and their house ranch is just creamy goodness. I love Phil's BBQ so much I ordered it for my wedding rehearsal dinner and the price was super reasonable and they even helped us put the enormous amount of food in our car. It came with everything you need, too: napkins, forks, knives, hand-wipies, serving stuff, paper plates. A little more relaxed for a rehearsal dinner, but it was a good price; it saved money for the actual wedding itself... Great service, great prices, great food. Couldn't love Phil's more.

Phil's is definitely the best place I have had BBQ in my entire life. The meat on the ribs fall of the bone and the BBQ sauce is the best I've ever tasted (I usually don't like BBQ sauce at all). Phil's has a wonderful atmosphere and is usually filled with hungry people. Stop by, any day except Mondays, tie on a bib, and enjoy some grub. I'd recommend calling in your order and then going to try and find a seat. Don't forget a bib (located near the handwash station) because you'll definitely need one. Their fries, baked beans, and whoopie pies are great too. Next to the main dining area is a sports bar type of area if you want a beer or other drink. Whenever I hear that a friend is visiting San Diego, I direct them to Phil's. It's just that good.

ÊEven if they sat us outside on the patio, weve always had a worker come ask us if we needed anything, if everything was good, or if we needed extra bbq sauce or togo boxes. ÊI never felt like they forgot about us out there. I do get a bit frustrated when I walk up to the building and theres a hugeee line, but honestly, I cant complain.

ohhh my goodness i love me some baby back ribs and phil's offers only the best, and for very reasonable prices. of course, the biggest con is that there is alwaysssss a wait at this place. good luck coming here on friday nights or weekends. expect to wait at least an hour if you do. the way they operate is you order + pay first and then they give you a buzzer that goes off when your order is ready. you just go and find a table and get your drinks while your food is being prepared. the food comes quickly though so that sorta makes up for the original wait to get inside. i always get the half rib dinner (6-7 bones) with a large side of macaroni salad (or you can get 2 small sides) for $13 and i devour it. the meat is super tender and juicy and falls right off the bone. the amount of bbq sauce on it is just right. they're also generous with their sides. it's smart that they put a roll of paper towels on each table because it sure gets messy. i've tried a sample of their bbq chicken and beef ribs before too but it's just not as good as the pork ribs. the ticklers are a steal though - 3 bones w/ 2 HUGE onion rings, cole slaw, AND fries for only $6.50!!! it's a good option for those who claim they don't like ribs but want to try them. give the tickler a chance and you might just change your mind. :) i just wish they would open up a location in norcal!

I phoned in the order and was told that there would be a 15-20 minute wait once I actually arrived and paid (WTF?). I arrived about 7:30pm on a Saturday. There must have been two hundred people in line!! After navigating through the crowd, I made it to the "phone order" line. Unfortunately, this is the "order to go" line also. Luckily, they have a guy walking through the line with a hand held electronic gizmo asking who has phone orders. He alerts the kitchen that you are there. After paying, the food was ready in under 5 minutes. Pretty slick service given the enormous crowd. The food was good, but suffered from "take home syndrome", fries soggy, not any extra BBQ sauce. I look forward to eating in and seeing how good it really is. Maybe someday when I have half a day to burn!

What can I say?!!! Phil's has cornered the market!! I remember years ago about watching a news piece on the problems neighbors were having with the first Phil's location and the bbq smoke. Yeah, they were complaining on how good it was?!!! Good indeed!! Though I've never been to that location, the Point Loma one is my bbq choice! I've been to numerous bbq places and yes each are different with their own preparation styles and food, but there is just something about Phils that keeps me coming back? When I really, really, really figure it out, I'll let you know. Place is just great. Food is great and the staff must have been to customer service academy because someone is always striking a conversation and checking to see how everything is. Top notch!! Though the wait to be seated may seem like a lifetime, I guess all good things come to those who wait! I love the fact that you can now go their website and check the bbq cam! That camera is positioned right by the front door and you can usually see how long that line is and even if it's wrapped around the building.

You wait a minimum of Atleast 45minutes or more but its totally worth it. The sauce is so smoky and full of flavor. Everything I've had so far is DELISH!!! The beef ribs are huge juicy moist and full of meat that practically falls off the bone. The onion rings are homemade and awesome fries,baked beans,macaroni salad I love it macaroni doesn't taste like it has vinegar or preservatives has good homemade taste all the sides are good. Today we also ordered the pulled pork because of all the rave on yelp :( well despite what everyone says I expected the meat to have more flavor than it did the only flavor was the BBQ Sauce over it I thought it was going to be simmered in the sauce that's what I would've done different. I won't say I'll never order again cuss I will. ÊI'll just order a side of BBQ Sauce and top it off at my table :) But I would have to be craving it until then pass me the ribs... LOL P.S.

Wow. The ribs were tasty. Loved those beer battered onion rings! And the beers were flowing. Not too loud so I could talk to my friends. And what made it better was that I didn't need to wait in that line and instead snuck into the bar which let's you order everything anyway.

DISCLAIMER: ÊI love BBQ sauce, especially the good kind. I say this because I see a lot of criticism here for too much sauce, so you will not hear that from me. ÊI also am a fan of bold BBQ sauce (as opposed to sweet or overly spicy), and this is what you get here. ÊA good comparison would be Famous Dave's original. I've been meaning to check this out for a long time, and I was pleasantly surprised. ÊThe El Toro was a great value, overflowing with meat for only $6.95. ÊVery tasty. ÊI would also put the pork and beef ribs up with the best in Southern California (though the competition is admittedly not that stiff here). My only complaint was that the beef ribs were a bit pricey in relation to the pork ribs, especially when the beef ribs are typically much cheaper than pork ribs at the grocery store.

incredible! mmm. the line was wrapping around the building when we arrived, but it moved fairly quickly. i got the tickler... fries (extra, since i subbed the coleslaw for more fries), 2 onion rings, ribs... and it was just enough food for me!! i also ordered extra onion rings for my boyfriend and i like that they give you little pre-poured containers of ranch if you ask. i love onion rings and ranch. and fries and ranch!! MMMM. i can't remember what my bf got, but it had the boneless chicken, ribs, potato salad and macaroni salad. his food was good too. i love that the potato salad is made with big big chunks of potatoes. yum. and the sauce on the ribs is really good!!! what i really loved about this place is the workers. they are sooo friendly. the lady who spoke to us before we ordered explained what we do to find a seat and was constantly joking with us. she seemed like she was in such a good mood, and it was nice to see people working and actually happy. the lady who helped me at the register was named heidi i believe. she was SO KIND. my boyfriend happened to brush my arm to get my attention because i was ordering while he was finding a seat for our group, and she goes, "oh. he loves you. he really loves you". LOL wtf. i was like, "why do you say that?". and she said she could tell because he brushed my arm lightly, which is a huge sign of affection and care. i was like....you must be a communications major... and she said yes. HAHA. we had this long ass conversation before i even ordered. she was just super super easy to talk to and she was the one who suggested i sub the coleslaw for fries. i love when employees are helpful and give suggestions. it shows that they actually care and enjoy their job, and want to give the customer the best experience ever. more pros: -hand washing stations -clean bathroom -little hand wiping packet things to clean your hands with. i took some home hahah. they came in handy the next day when i ate mexican food seriously top notch restaurant. i'll be back for sure the next time i come down to sd!!

I've only been here once and I am definitely coming back. Go after lunch but before dinner if you don't want to wait in such a long line and forget about going on the weekends. The food we ordered was delicious and tasted like it was made with love. The lady greeting everyone was REALLY nice and asked if we had been there before, since we hadn't she gave us some instructions on how things worked. She asked how we heard about the place and where we were from. She was very attentive and came up to me after my meal to ask me how it was! Now thats some good customer service!

I love Phils! ÊThe baby back ribs are beyond amazing. ÊIm moving out of San Diego soon and my boyfriend and I are already planning to drive 2 hours just to get Phils. ÊIm also glad that they sell the Phils BBQ sauce so i can put it on everything. The trick to skipping the line is too call ahead, look up the menu online and place your order. The to-go line is pretty short and fast. The only downfall is you have to drool over the food all the way home... Did i mention the beer battered onion rings are some of the best ever?!

Bbq tri tip sandwich I think it was called the toro was delicious. Healthy stack of sliced tri tip on a bun drenched in their bbq sauce and a side of fries. This is one of very few real bbq joints around even though Lightning Jacks is closer to my house the drive here is well worth it. Only minus is its packed so suggest calling in to go.

Not only is Phil's BBQ the best place to eat ribs, they have excellent customer service. One night I did a phone order and after I received my pager, I waited for more then 30 min when I was told it should have only been 10-15 min. I went inside to see what was wrong and there was some sort of miscommunication and they did not have my pager number to notify me when my food was ready. I was given the food on the spot and the manager came out and refunded my money. These things do happen unfortunately, but they made it right. Despite what happened, I'm always going to come here.

I don't shell out 5-star reviews willy-nilly, but this place has absolutely the best BBQ I've ever had in my entire life. ÊI ordered the baby back rib dinner, the BBQ chicken dinner, and a spring mix salad, and everything (including each of the sides) was a taste of heaven.

I am not a huge fan of baby back ribs but when my boyfriend's best friend brought us here on our trip to San Diego, I can proudly say that I've converted. Permanently. The wait is usually ridiculous with the line wrapping around the restaurant. Fortunately for us, we came a bit earlier and was able to avoid the rush. My boyfriend and I split a full rack of baby back ribs, macaroni salad, beefy rib and the sweet bean thing. Our friend had the chicken which looked good but I didn't get to sample as I was so busy tearing the "fall off the bone" meaty goodness that was in front of me like a mad woman. IT WAS EFFING GOOD! I almost wanted seconds. In fact, I should have gotten seconds no matter how stuffed I was because Phil's BBQ DOES NOT DISAPPOINT! Service was friendly and very attentive. I think that was also why I enjoyed my meal so much. When you're dining in an area where the staff takes care of their customers, the meal just tastes better. Overall my first experience here was very pleasant. I will be sure to go back every time I'm in the area. You should go to!

The good: the ribs were amazing, bbq sauce was great, and service was fast and friendly. The bad: the fries were not good, oversalted, and the serving size was about three pounds. ÊThe chicken was inedible. Tasted microwaved like tv dinner. Do yourself a favor. Buy a whole slab of ribs and no sides and this will be a five star dining experience.

It doesn't need anymore reviews, but I'm going to give one anyways. Well, I went there around 8pm on a Saturday after my visit at Sea World. ÊI was honestly complaining about having to wait in a long line to get into the restaurant because I'm not the type of person who is willing to wait 2 hours for just food. ÊBut surprisingly, the wait wasn't that long; I guess because the line only went around the store, and other days it goes further than that. Ê I ordered a full rack of ribs with two small sides. ÊThe meat was tender, it was easy to eat. ÊThe coleslaw is not my favorite, and the BBQ sauce isn't all that unless you like the taste of tang. ÊBut still it's a place I would wait in line for. Just to let you know, it's not a place where someone is going to seat you, you order at the register and find a seat yourself unless you're a big party then the employees will find the seats for you. Ê To conclude, the price isn't all that bad either. ÊMy boyfriend and I ordered for each of us the Baby Back Ribs, full orders that are 10 to 12 bones, with two side orders. ÊIt cost us around $42.00. Ê It was enough for both of us to finish.

I know much has been written by many folks, most of it very positive.. and this review is no different. ÊI've been eating at Phil's since the hole-in-the-wall days, and even though they've grown and expanded, the line is STILL out the door and around the corner.

VERY crowded, but understandably so. ÊTheir ribs are delicious. ÊBut nothing about them stands out to me; ÊI lived in SLO for two years with Firestone's in downtown. Ê I'll admit, Phil's is comparable to Firestone's, but it's also pricier. ÊYou kinda have to fight to get your own table though, which may be difficult at times. ÊWe ended up having to sit outside. ÊThey did have heaters just in case we got cold though, so sitting outside isn't that big of a deal. ÊIt's just... I had to look inside through the window to watch TV, made me feel ostracized....

i been eating here since they opened wayyy back then. and its always been consistent every single time. i used to order the full rib dinner then over the years i slowly get smaller and smaller portions of food. i guess the older you get the less you eat. now a days all i do get is just the beefy ribs and some onion rings to share. the onion rings here are amazing. i always get a small order everytime i highly recommend getting it. the wait times do get crazy, i use to be able to say its worth the wait but if you are a local you can go during the off peak hours and there wont be much of a wait. but if you are here from out of town or something or taking friends or family here for the first time. its always worth the wait haha. service is amazing here cant say that enough. the staff here are the nicest people you will meet.

phills frikin bbq. o em gee. For a good 2 weeks, I craved this stuff. My friends usually get the baby back, but i'm a beef ribs type of girl. The "best of both" is my usually dish with my choice consisting of half chicken and 2 beef bones + large side of beans (I like to fill me belly up with bomski meat, not the filler). The teaser is usually too small for me (meat portion wise). It gives either 3 baby back or 1 beef ribs with sides of cole slaw, fries, and 2 onion rings. But, like i said, I go to phills for the BBQ, not the eh sides. But, if you're the type of person who doesn't care what your belly gets filled with just as long it's food, get 2 teasers instead of the dinner meal options. You'll have a MASSIVE PILE of fries, cole sale, and 4 onion rings which would fill you up plenty. Dinner time the line gets FRIKIN LONG. So, I always try to go at the awkward times like 3-4:30. I love my phills, but i over 45 minutes of waiting is gg in my book no matter how good it might be.

This place was definitely 5 stars before it moved to it's new location. The new location is just as crowded, and the food is definitely not as good. I have never been a huge fan of their BBQ sauce b/c of it's sweetness and I feel it has fallen off even more since the new location opened. I gave it 3 stars only for the nostalgia of Phil's being the original BBQ spot for me in San DIego. I still give it to Phil's for their awesome Onion Rings that continue to be amazing and are still the best Onion Rings in town. But nowadays when I want some good BBQ I head over a few miles east and go to Bull's BBQ, less crowded, better sauce, and still a great atmosphere.

This place is crazy! Be prepared to stand in line for 2 hours, because thats what I did today! The ribs are great and tender and they give you a good amount of food. There is staff that comes around and check if you need anything- all of them are really friendly. It is a very casual place but its a pretty exciting place to eat since everyone is so happy. On a side note, their bathrooms are pretty cool with those airport hand dryers and sanitary door handles (you kinda have to see it to understand). Loved eating there with my friends and had a fun time.

This place is so delicious I suggest you go with a group of friends and do family style! But otherwise, their combos are pretty satisfying, too. I love their sides: baked beans, coleslaw, and onion rings. Their chicken ticklers are alright .. I'd suggest you get the ribs or something else unless you've already tried everything else on the menu. The wait was ridiculous on a Saturday night (over an hour or two) ... but if there's that many people already waiting there, you know it's worth it. I'd probably be a regular if I lived in San Diego.

Hands down the best BBQ in San Diego. ÊI've been coming to Phil's back when they were on Goldfinch. ÊNow i think his bathroom is bigger than the old place. ÊMeat falls off the bones, the fries are to die for. ÊI usually go back and forth between the Rib-tickler, 3 bones with fries, onion rings and slaw,The Broham sandwich, pulled pork, on a bun served with slaw on top, also you have to get fries with this one.

Delicious and a great value. ÊDecided to stop by after seeing it on Man Vs Food, and ordered the Tickler and decided to split the Tri-Tip with the bf. ÊWe certainly didn't need it - the Tickler was more than enough food - 2 large onion rings (which the breading stayed on it perfectly), 3 ribs (but had 4 huge pieces of meat on them), delicious cole slaw that may have been the best I've ever had, and fries!

One of the best BBQ I ever had. I've came here several time, at first being introduced by my roommates and then later me introducing others to come. Its a little pricey, but boy is it worth it. However be warned, the line can get extremely long. I have seen it warp around the building and stretching all the way to the end of those other buildings on the same side of the sidewalk. There's a good selection of meals, ranging from burgers to plates of ribs. I would opt for the full dinner b/c I can sample everything. In my defense, I am a heavy meat eater so this place is like paradise. The atmosphere is very ambient. There's also a bar so its great to bring some friends to enjoy some games which would make a great outing. Despite how popular the place is, the waiters never try to rush you to finish eating and leave to make rooms for the customers who are waiting outside. Its just a matter of customer courtesy if you so choose to. I can't wait to go back with some friends if I'm down at SD again!

I finally ate at this place last Thursday. I have to admit it was pretty good. When you need to splurge on some bad for your heart yet tasty food. The kind of place you would want to go in and get some hardy good eating without the wait. The amazing thing about this place is it's quickness. The line was out the door when I arrived and I was like "Oh dear god no. Time for forever." Yet, they were super fast. They had 6 registers and people were in and out fast as can be. I had the 4 baby back ribs and 1/4 chicken. It wasn't an explosive taste. The sauce needs more work. Too basic. But above average when you just want meat with a little bit of love. The only thing that I would say is a negative about this place is the fast paced busboys. They kind of hound you a little, "You done?" or they just take your plate and your like whoa bro. Also the bar area is nice. They have stellar LCD screens there. And the bar is cozy and not too crowded. Other than that, you'll be full with BBQ taste. You'll surpass your percent daily value of calories. But leave satisfied.

I've eaten at Phil's numerous times but it was a first for me at the Sports Arena location. Drove up on a Sunday around 12:45 pm and the line was crazy long. None the less my friend and I knew the wait would be well worth it. Surprisingly, the line moved quickly and were at the register placing our order shortly after arriving. Until today I had always ordered dinner but it was lunch time and this was a good excuse to try something different. I went with the chik tickler which has chunks of white meat smothered in bbq sauce, a generous bed of french fries, scoop of coleslaw and 2 onion rings. This is more than enough food for lunch. Drinks are self serve with the usual soft drinks you'd see at other restaurants. However, they have a machine that serves sweet black or green tea. I went with the black tea which was a little sweet for my taste but once the ice melted a bit it tasted great. From ordering to finding a table the service was on point. We were seated by the time our drinks were filled. We sat in Kenny's section - Ê he asked us how our meal was, quickly cleared our table of used up plates, napkins and gave us a few toothpicks and wet-naps so we could clean up. Kenny added that extra touch that takes a restaurant from 4 to 5 stars even if the food is amazing. All in all the new location didn't disappoint but somehow I knew it wouldn't....

So much hype for this place, so I had to try it out for myself. Their baby back ribs were alright. ÊMy expectations might have been too high. However, their beef ribs were very good. ÊIt's a "fall right off the bone" kinda deal and the ribs were pretty large. Great atmosphere and good prices for delicious food. Can't say it lived up to the hype, but it was still worth it.

Don't know what the fuss is about! ÊThe food is good, but to have lnes out the door is not reaity! ÊI ordered the rib tickler, with 3 pork ribs , slaw, fries and 2 onion rings. ÊNone of the ribs were more than 3 inches long and barely had any meat on it. ÊI thik they just throw the ends for this item. ÊMy BF ordered the el toro, which had quite a bit of beef on it and had good taste. ÊWe also tried the beef rib sample and it was good in flavor, but quite tough. ÊBeef ribs should still fall off the bone and be cooked til tender. ÊWill probably try this place again and order something else. I now give Phil's 4 stars. ÊThe owner has emailed me back twice to ensure that my next visit will be more satisfactory. ÊThat is a rare occurrence nowadays as everyone is out to make a buck, so his gesture is greatly appreciated that he took the time to improve my experience. ÊI'm sure he doesn't need my business, but still wants to and takes the time to satisfy each and every customer! Ê Hats off to Fred the owner! ÊI now have a better idea of why this place is so popular and worth the wait!

I used to frequent Phil's B.B.Q when it was in Mission Hills. ÊWhen it moved to Point Loma and we decided to go, I was shocked at the line that wrapped around the building. ÊIt looked like a line for a ride at Disneyland. ÊI jumped out and asked people waiting in the line how long that had been waiting. ÊI was so surprised when they said only ten or fifteen minutes. ÊWe decided to wait. ÊSo glad that we did. The B.B.Q. ribs are so good!!! You wait in this long line to order at the front desk and then you pick up your food. ÊIt is not the type of place that they seat you and take your order. I have always loved B.B.Q. and this is one of my favorite places for ribs.

If I could go here every day, I would. It's that darn good, as evidenced by the line that goes around the building every day. The ribs are TO DIE FOR! They fall of the bone and the sauce is amazing. I just can't say enough good things about this place. I got all my friends addicted to it as well. You must go here and try the baby-back ribs. Ohhh and Man v. Food was just there a couple weeks ago so you KNOW it's good if it's going to be featured on tv. Go here. Do it. You won't regret it.

As a native Texan, I feel that my opinions on BBQ are rather picky. I gotta say though, Phil's is real good BBQ. My "baby-back" ribs were tender and delicious. I also ordered the Pulled Pork Shoulder sandwich, which was absolutely GIGANTIC (It should have been advertised as an open face sandwich) . It came with a side of Cole-Slaw that was a perfect combo of hot and moist / cold and crunchy. Service was great too! MY ONLY COMPLAINTS: 1. They put a TON of BBQ sauce on my ribs and sandwich. It is a solid BBq sauce but it was just tooooo much. 2. A bit pricey for BBQ I'll be back to Phil's 4sho.

One of the best BBQ places in SoCal. Been here many times and I have yet had a bad experience. I usually order the 1/2lb Cheeseburger, can never go wrong with a burger. It has cheese, an onion ring, and topped off with their special BBQ sauce. Now if you want to up it up, then try their baby back ribs. You can get it just ribs or if hungry, you can oder the dinner which comes with sides. I also would have to recommend their onion rings. Get a small if you're by yourself or just 2, because those rings are HUGE! Try not to get there at peak times, because like in the picture there will most likely be a line out the door and around the corner. If you get there and there is a line, don't let that line discourage you.... the line moves fast and the food is well worth the wait.

Food wise, I love this place, I've been a few times and the ribs are super amazing. I got the full rack, my boyfriend got the chicken, and his brother got the pulled beef sandwich. We got onion rings (which are also some of the best onion rings ever) and we split and it was a good amount, not like exploding or too much. But service wise- kinda creepy how the servers literally perch near you to ask you if you want water, napkins, ranch, etc etc. And when I went with my boyfriend, this girl HIT ON MY BOYFRIEND! Rude! If you can wait the 1hr+ wait, then do it! Good food, creepy service.

I have to say, this is probably one my most favorite restaurants in San Diego; definitely in my top 5! There are so many reviews for this place, and every opinion does matter. For me, I don't eat BBQ as often as other people, maybe once every couple months. When I do, I think of Phil's BBQ. This place is so popular and so SO good. Service: This place has some of the nicest workers ever. Everyone from the cashiers to the cooks to the waiters, all are so generous and considerate. When I was eating with my girlfriend, there was always a person there to see if we needed anything else, such as more choices of sauces or more utensils, etc. I'd figure the large number of people would tick off some workers, but not at all, I think it's the exact opposite; the more people there are, the happier the workers! When there is a line, and usually there is, it may seem like it'll take forever, especially if it's wrapped around the building. However, the line goes by so fast somehow, and even if you wait for a hour or so, it's worth it for this food, DEFINITELY worth it. Food: One word - WOW. The food is amazing as can be. I usually get the Beefy Ribs and Baked Beans. I am in LOVE with the beans, don't know why but they are so GOOD! I'm not a big fan of their chicken or chickless whatever because it's usually really dry and doesn't have too much taste. I don't really like the potatoes, cole slaw, or macaroni (all sides) too much, so I usually stick with the beans and fries. All their sauces are BOMB! Use them well! Everything is great here: the environment, food, people, TVs placed everywhere, everything! The price is great for BBQ like these. I recommend this place to EVERYONE I know, and I have not heard anything bad at all, ever. It took me 18 years of living in San Diego to hear about this place and finally eat here; I really wish I knew about it a long time ago! So what do you do after this read this review? Go to Phil's BBQ and start eating your hearts out!

The food here is just wonderful, my only complaint is that it can tend to get a lil pricey and the long lines, but other than that the service, and the ribs are out of this world. I always get the baby back rib full rack dinner with the cole slaw and fries. I just like to put the malt vinegar all over my food and dig in~

This place has THE BEST BBQ I have ever tasted. ÊHaving tried most of the fast casual BBQ joints around Orange County, Phil's definitely ranks #1 on my list. My wife, 17-month old and I arrived at Phil's around 5:30 and the place was already packed with a line out the door on a Thursday night. ÊAfter reading many of the reviews on Yelp, we were expecting a wait so it wasn't a big deal. Ê My wife ordered the 1/2 rack of baby back ribs and I had the small order of beef ribs. ÊWow, you get a heck of a lot of food for the money. ÊGreat value and amazing food for sure. Overall, we had a great experience at Phil's BBQ. ÊThe staff was friendly and organized. ÊA couple of the managers kept coming by our table to check in with us and talk to our daughter. ÊIt's a little loud on the inside, but that's to be expected with it being so crowded. ÊAlso, being in a wheelchair wasn't a problem with the crowd. ÊThe place is designed well and there was a table open right near the front that worked out perfectly for us. I feel like driving down to San Diego again, just to get some BBQ for dinner. Yummmmmmmmmm

DELICIOUS! they had some of the best ribs I've tasted so far. The servings are pretty huge and the bbq sauce is legendary.

I would recommend eating with a small group of friends so the line doesn't seem too long. YOU SHOULD GO!

I had the "best of both" item: beefy ribs and 1/4 chicken. It was delicious food, however if it's really packed then I wouldn't recommend getting the beefy ribs unless you want to wait a bit longer for your food. The food was definitely worth it and I was very satisfied with the portions. If you're looking for good ol' BBQ where you can just indulge then, this is the place for you. They even have bibs!

Overhyped. I've been here a handful of times, and I still don't understand why everyone thinks this place is amazing. Lucille's BBQ has better food and they're a chain restaurant. Prices were average. The kid's meals are a pretty good portion/price if you want to get that. It will fill you up. I wasn't really a fan of the sauce they use. It was a weird spicy & sweet combination that just threw me off.

ru kiddin me? People in San Diego are just as bandwagonish with food as they are with the Chargers and the Raiders. I guarantee most people writing these reviews have never had bbq OUTSIDE of the state before. The sweet rub is full of sugar because it chars easily. Ive never had charred bbq until Phil's. They should call it Phil's coleslaw because that was better than the actual bbq. The sauce was mediocre..the meat was just ok. The BBq Pit in National City taste better if u ask me. Also, what do people get out of trying to eat in a place with soo much activity?? Im there to eat, not listen to 1000 voices in my head. People saying the BBQ was super yummy really concerns me if they consider this real bbq. id hate to see their reaction if they visit CHicago, Kansas, texas, or Ga bbq places... San Deigo needs to stick to what their known for...a good burrito. lol..not funny

Just finished eating Phil's BBQ and honestly, it was just so-so. This is my 3rd or 4th Phil's meal and I always have the same impression when I finish.... ÊGood, not great. The ribs were flavorful and tender, but I had several bites of gristle among the meat. ÊThe pulled pork was very dry without sauce and I don't love their sauce. ÊPrefer a more Carolina vinegar based sauce. ÊCole Slaw has way too much mayo in it. ÊBeans were tasty but watery. ÊMaybe I am just spoiled from 4 years living in Kansas City and 4 months spent in Charlotte, NC, but this is just not great BBQ. ÊPersonally. I think Bubba's in La Jolla Cove is actually much better. ÊTheir meat is very tender and flavorful, especially their sliced brisket and BBQ chicken and they have a few different BBQ sauces, including one that is more vinegar based. To wait in line for an hour to eat at Phil's just isn't worth it.

The food is delicious. The ribs are tender and the chicken isn't dry. You can get a little bit of both plus some sides for only $12. Fries are seasoned just right and the other sides compliment your meal well. The only problem is that this place is always packed. One way to get around it even though I am sure they frown upon it is to just order through the phone. This way you can just walk in and pick up your food then go grab any empty table you find and hope the servers don't notice. Phils BBQ is one of the best BBQ places I have been to. I highly recommend it.

Everything here is good but one must try the colossal onion rings they are very good. May be different from KC and Memphis ribs but this place is really good. Sometimes the lines can be a little deceiving because if it seems long the most it can take you is an hour and your food is ready in no time. Also, if for whatever reason you cannot wait that long you can head to the bar and wait to see if a spot opens up and that sometimes is quicker than standing in line.

The best BBQ I've ever eaten!! There is a reason why this place is always super packed. I've been eating here ever since they had their small location in Hillcrest. I'm so glad they expanded to their new location. I usually order their baby back ribs. The meat is super tender and flavorful. Then you add some of their bbq sauce and you'll be in heaven. Their sides are also delish. I love their onion rings with buttermilk ranch, fries and mac salad. Other than their ribs, I have enjoyed their El Toro sandwich and grill chicken. It's very flavorful and juicy. I have also met Phil a long time ago. He is really friendly and seems like a great guy. I am very thankful to him for opening his restaurant and sharing his oh so yummy bbq goodness.

We came here for dinner after having visited SeaWorld. With 4.5 stars out of 2,400+ reviews, we figured hey why not. What can go wrong? Well, just a wait of about 1.5 to 2 hours long. I guess that's about normal for a 6:30 pm visit. Here's a good tip (which we learned -- after having to wait over an hour -- from a friend who lives around the SD area): if you have Êa small party (less than 6), just go to the Bar area and wait for seats to become available and grab the first one you can get your ASS on. It will save you time. You can order the same food in the bar as you would if you were seated elsewhere in the restaurant. The plus side is you're closer to the beer. ÊNow as for the food, the BBQ Pork Spareribs are, without a doubt, one of the best. They are tender, and indeed, more tangy than sweet. The Beefy Ribs aren't as impressive but they were good. As for the sides, the fries and onion rings are okay but the coleslaw was pretty good. Overall, worth to try but expect to wait in line. Update 3/28/2011, an hour after the original review: I accidentally gave this the 3 stars when it deserves more so I updated it to 4. I would also like to mention that the customer service is exceptional; especially at the bar, the tenders were very attentive and catered to our needs. Our food was ready after 15 minutes and that's for a party of 12. Thanks, Phil. ÊYou sure have earned my recommendation and a second visit.

I pondered writing a review since there was already almost 2000 but this review is for my friends to view on my profile and decide if they want to try it from there. And once again my "any restaurant featured on tv" theory is spot on. Of course they are going to give the host of the show the best representation of their food that they possibly can. In my case i got your standard every day Phil's bbq sandwiches. Tried both the pork and beef sandwiches, both were dry even though they were slathered in sauce. Looked nothing like the sandwich on Man Vs Food, not even close. The beans and coleslaw were good and the pork and beef ribs were also delicious and fall off the bone. That is the only thing I would recommend Êbesides the refreshing cola from the fountain. The staff was nice too so that was a plus and we fed 3 of us for under $40! Great deal for BBQ but i would not wait an hour to eat here again and I don't think I will be going back unless there is no line and it is the only place close by that is not fast food. Nothing will top Joey's BBQ, that is my conclusion and I should just stop looking and just go back to Joey's. Lucille's being a close second.

Portions are huge and the line is long but does that mean they serve good BBQ meat or just good BBQ sauce? This is the question I've pondered for awhile now. Don't get me wrong, I love their baby back ribs, and I have eaten here close to 30 times but I keep asking myself what brings me back? Is it the super cold beer or the tasty BBQ sauce? To me truly good BBQ needs no extra sauce added after the meat is done cooking, and sadly, Phil's fails this test. I find myself asking for extra sauce on the side to drown the meat in because frankly, without the sauce, their meat is tasteless. I love their sweet, tangy with a late kick of heat BBQ sauce. I know people will say that BBQ sauce makes the BBQ; that maybe true but good BBQ needs no extra sauce and should stand on its own. Call me saucy, but I could eat their sauce by itself. The fact that they are making it harder to get into the bar(bypassing the stupidly long line) to order is really starting to piss me off. If it wasn't for the extra cold beer I would just call my order in. ciao

Would you wait in a huge line just to eat BBQ? you would if you where going to be eating BBQ at Phil's. This is an order at the counter and wait for your number kind of place so i always think it's best to have someone order the food while another person finds a table. Now for the food the portions are generous here so my Man and I usually share. The Sweet Tea here goes perfectly with the BBQ and it's always a must when we come here.

I think Phil's BBQ is pretty good! It is not great but good! I don't think it is worth waiting in line for an hour for unless you are really craving BBQ. I have been there twice. They have really good customer service! I got the el toro last time I went. It was ok. There was way to much bbq sauce on it. I love there onion rings they are really good! they are beer battered and you can dip them in there buttermilk ranch. Really bad for you but tastes really good! But then again most things that are bad for you taste pretty good!! One thing I like about Phil's is they have a good drink selection! There prices are reasonable. I have just had better BBQ which is why I am not giving it a five star rating. If you are in San Diego I think this place is worth trying!! Just beware the line will be long. Try to get there before 5pm and the line will not be as long!

Last year during a trip in the south we tried some local BBQ joints. In Owensboro KY it was OLE SOUTH in Nashville it was Calhoun's and in Memphis it was The Interstate, Neely's and the Rendezvous. We had seen some of these on the food shows and were looking for the "REAL SOUTHERN EXPERIENCE Êwith BBQ and we were sorely disappointed,. Phil's beat them all in every way. We always TAKE OUT because of the crowds and when we announce an event with Phil's as the main course or guest limit is always filled. We love the ribs and chicken plates and even though I fancy myself a good cook I can not come close the meats and sauces. One time I came close but it took 14 hours. Rib meat falling off the bones and chicken moist and succulent. Beans, coleslaw and potato salad better then Moms and she grew up along the Ohio River near Kentucky. Will success spoil Phil's BBQ? I hope not

Phil's BBQ is where I go on my birthday. That's what Phil's is to me. The night I can go anywhere and do whatever I want; all I really want is to go to Phils and get a 1/2 rack of the Beefy Ribs. And if it's your birthday you can cut the line as long as you are on their email list. They don't even really email me anything else except on my birthday. And they have so much to be proud of. I wouldn't mind if they emailed me other times. Since there are 2000+ reviews about Phil's already, all I'll say is that this is where I go on my birthday. Think about that on your birthday.

Once again, following the Yelp reviews, came here prepared but again, didn't have the problems other Yelpers claimed. Sunday at 9pm there was a line around the corner but the line moves very quickly and we ordered within 30 min! Well worth the wait in my heels. For the 2 of us, ordered the full dinner baby back ribs with 10 ribs and for sides we got fries and Mac salad. Also ordered a small onion rings since those seemed to be popular. The ribs were freaking amazing, just for that, everyone needs to go hear. Theres lots of meat on the bone unlike Daves Famous BBQ which barely has any meat! Now I feel robbed at Daves! That one meal is more than enough for 2. We killed the ribs first. The fries were normal, peeetu good, like the Mac salad. But I don't get the deal with the onion rings. Yes they are huge but if I ear something and can literally taste how bad it is for me cause it's super oily, that is not what I want to feel when I'm eating something. Other than that, it's good but I'll never order the onion rings again. Ate 2 n threw out the rest. Phil's has lots of advertising signs up about yelp n twitter etc so it's cool they care about the customer service. I'd give it a 5 but knocked it down one cause all the hype over the onion rings n I was disappointed. The baby back ribs were a million percent what everyone said they were. Hope they open a shop in norcal in San Jose or San Francisco!

It's pretty good. Best bbq I've ever eaten but I don't really like bbq haha. The meat is so juicy it falls off the bones though. The sauce just isn't to my taste (ask for sauce on the side if you don't want the ribs to be molested). The food is a lil expensive too. My boyfriend gives it a 3.5 out of 5. He thinks it's ok, but we don't really crave it, thus the 3 stars. Better than average but not good enough to want it over and over again.

Great ribs. ÊThis is my second time eating at Phil's and the BBQ items have always been outstanding. ÊI wasn't such a big fan of the long lines, but if you go anytime other than lunch or dinner time, the wait isn't so bad. The fries and cole slaw are solid.

Beefy ribs are the best I've ever had! Before Phil's, I would always choose baby back ribs over beef ribs, but now that I've tasted what perfect beefy ribs are supposed to taste like, I don't think I can have ribs anywhere else! Here are the reasons I did not give Phil's 5 stars: Ribs without mac n cheese? Somehow I don't feel complete without my mac n cheese. Also, the torture of waiting for Phil's and watching people eat through the windows always makes me order more than I can eat. Leftover Phil's is never as good. I'm split on the service. While the servers going around the tables are great, the lady at the front telling people to go to a register is horrible. We were next in line, and a register was open. The lady, of course not doing her job, was chatting with someone, and the server behind the register was gesturing us to go to her register and order. After we finished ordering, the lady finally stopped chatting and yelled at us rudely to get back in line because we went to the register for Phone Orders. These were her exact words, "This is for Phone Orders. Did you phone order? No, you did not." After waiting for an hour just to be treated like this, my boyfriend and I were not happy and retorted a few remarks in which she just sat there and did not have the slightest idea on customer service. On the other hand, after eating, I needed boxes for my sides to take home. The server that was helping our table brought me two completely new sides already packed instead of empty boxes. I had well over half of my baked beans left over, but she kindly gave me a new batch for me to bring home. Hallelujah, there is a reason, besides the beefy ribs, to come back to this place. If it weren't for this last act of kindness and their amazingly cooked beefy ribs, I would never come back. All in all, order the beefy ribs and sign up for their newsletter online so you can cut the line on/around your birthday!!! Update! Within 10 hours of my review, the owner contacted me to apologize for any negative experience and offer to cut the line next visit. I'm not adding any stars because it still happened to me, but I do want to acknowledge the prompt and professional response in addressing the issue. I will, however, say that I'm going to utilize this offer very soon and update my review after the visit.

I am not a fanatic of American food, but this one is just irresistible to me. I have been there twice, and each time I spent about 45mins to 1hour in line. It seems like that many Mexican families like to held their family part tere; so, a group of people before you might up to 20 people. However, a group of two sometimes can get the seat faster at bar area. Well, about their food: My favorite is their tender and tasty beefy rib, others are just OK.

It is so good, I'm not a big fan of ribs or bbq , it's just ok,but Phils BBQ rocks! I visited this place and it's pretty crowded, the place is nice too. I got this for 'to go' and had to go back to LA and had to wait for 2-3 hours to eat the Phils, but yet it still tastes yummy! It is so cheap , I bought it like for 5 persons , it costs only 46 bucks. The parking space is free. In some specific days you might need to get in the line though.Keep that in mind.

This place gets 5 stars because they make it a point to do everything right. ÊIs is the BEST bbq? ÊI don't know, but it sure is damn tasty and a fun place to go. ÊI would come here again for sure. Ê Didn't see my bud Jaron's review beforehand, but ÊI just happened to have seen this on my SD yelp list and wanted to give it a try. Ê Lamely attempting Êto beat the dinner rush, DH, son and I got there at 5:30 pm thinking this was ample time. ÊHowever, there was already a line, but it moved quickly. ÊThis is a place to get your grub on and move on. ÊNo lingering. Ê Soon, looking behind me, I saw an even longer line snaking all the way around. Ê This restaurant is very yelp conscious with the yelp mention in the outdoor menu. ÊCameras (smile!) are on you while you're in line. ÊQuestion, who's watching us? There's a guy host who helps keep the line going by asking if anyone wants to be seated at the bar. Ê Hey, and there's a pleasant but don't put up with nonsense hostess who controls the line at the front. ÊSmart, cuz we know with that intoxicating smoky bbq aroma causing salivating patrons to be indecent enuff to cut in line. Ê I ordered the tickler menu for son, the pulled pork sandwich for myself and the full rack of baby back ribs for DH. ÊSides ordered: Êbbq baked beans and mac salad. We had it all covered except for the potato salad which I'll try next time. The cashiers were friendly. ÊThey were trained well in customer service. Ê I was given a pager the size of a candy bar cell phone from the 90s, much larger than the ones at the Cheesecake factory which threw me off. ÊI couldn't tell when the light went off since there was a intermittent flash. ÊDuh on me but I'll soon be a regular. Anyway, when I picked up our food, we definitely needed to don bibs for the ribs. ÊThe bbq sauce has a strong tangy flavor which is quickly addicting and can make a grown man almost cry, it's that good! ÊI crave it right now as I type this review. Ê The tickler plate did just that. ÊTickled me pink like the pigs that we consumed that day. Ê It was absolutely huge! ÊI thought what a great value and it's probably a kids' meal size. ÊBoy, was I wrong! Ê Other patrons positively gasped when I placed this plate in front of my 4 year old. Ê No worries though, i helped him polish this off. Another plus, the tickler plate also gives you a taste of the huge onion rings, 2 of them in fact. ÊThis is an awesome value! The mac salad and cole slaw are both delish, a nice milder complement to the bbq and not overloaded with mayo. Ê The mac salad also had a good amount of celery for flavor, the way I like it. The bbq baked beans were really tasty too. ÊI would definitely order that next time I'm here. Ê Fries were typical fare. Ê Next trip out to SD and we'll be back for sure!

Last year after my poor review the manager contacted me. I explained the situation to him and his replies showed that he earnestly wanted to fix things. He asked me to come back and I told him I would. Well, I finally came back and I am glad I did. I came in with the same circumstances as last time. By myself, at around 11:30am and sat at the bar area again. This time I was able to get an order in immediately. The guy who took my order was courteous and quick. I was in and out of the place in under an hour. Compared to the last time I was there that is a massive improvement. This time I had a BBQ Broham sandwich with colossal onion rings. The food came out very quickly. It was excellent and with the coleslaw the flavor was balanced. The onion rings are a definite must.

ok my review is going to be totally biased because i didnt eat the ribs. not a huge fan of them because its messy and dont care for bbq sauce. but my friends wanted to go, and id heard all the hype so went along. it was extremely packed, but the line moved at a good pace (to order). i ordered a cheeseburger (hold the bbq sauce) and a side of macaroni salad. was bummed they didnt have mac and cheese! i thought maybe there would be? the cheeseburger and macaroni salad were just decent. everyone's ribs looked really good and the portions were HUGE. everyone left extremely satisfied, so next time i will try the ribs, wear the bib, and use a fork and knife to see what all this madness is really about! will review again after i try the famous ribs or the ribless meat.

I am a long time fan of Phil's BBQ! ÊAn incredible business and incredible food. ÊPhil's is derserving of five stars with one exception. ÊMy office orders Phil's BBQ delivered through their catering office for company lunches at least once per month. The delivery is approximatly 9 miles and Mapquest indicates the commute as 12 minutes. The mimimum purchase order for delivery is $200. ÊEach time that we have Phil's deliverd there is a $35 delivery fee. ÊWith the minimum of a $200 order and the frequency of orders from my office, I feel the delivery fee is excessive.

Approximate Wait Time From This Point 21 Minutes 14 Seconds (Phil's really has a sign that says this) When I see a sign like this, with a line of about forty people in front of it, there better be one of two things waiting for me at the end of it. The first would be an awesome ride like Space Mountain or Big Thunder Mountain The second would be delicious food Well, at Phil's BBQ, I'm pleased to say that when we reached the front of the line, we found the latter. Phil's BBQ is a local legend in San Diego. I have wanted to try this place for many years but every time my girl and I drove by the line was wrapped around the building. This time around we decided to go in the early evening on a Thursday night to see if we could avoid a crowd. Well, our little scheme didn't work so well. Even though we got to Phil's at 5pm on a Thursday evening, we still had to wait in a line with about 40 other hungry carnivores. Phil's is a giant sports bar/restaurant. Their dining room is huge. It contains lots of booths and tables and the walls are covered with HD TVs. They also have a decent sized bar area and an outdoor patio. Once you've conquered the line you arrive at a counter where you place your order, get a buzzer that tells you when your food is ready and then you have to find an open table. That is one of the only things I did not like about Phil's. It took us almost 10 minutes to find an empty table. I could only imagine how hard it would be to find one on a weekend. We were only seated about 3 minutes before our food buzzer rang. This is what we ordered. Me- Baby back ribs and chicken dinner combo with a side of macaroni salad, corn on the cob and a small order of beer battered onion rings GF- Beef rib dinner with a baked potato My baby backs were pretty good but they were not the best I have ever had. They had a nice flavor but they were not the meatiest baby backs I have ever had. My BBQ chicken was great. The chicken was super juicy and really tender. The corn on the cob and the macaroni salad were both pretty good. Their beer battered onion rings were amazing. At first I thought the small order was not going to be enough but there were at least 8 or 9 rings in my basket. These O rings were huge and were super crispy. I could have eaten at least two orders of these. My girls beef ribs were phenomenal. These may have been the best beef ribs I have ever had. They were super meaty, had a nice Smokey flavor and the meat literally fell of the bone. Luckily for me she was not able to finish all of her ribs so I got to help her finish off her meal. Her baked potato was just OK. It was supposed to be packed full of cheese and sour cream but there was hardly any of either of them. I almost forgot to mention their BBQ Sauce, which has a Smokey and somewhat spicy flavor and is extremely yummy. For dessert we bought one of their homemade Whoppie pies to go. Their Whoppie pie was big super soft and super sweet. It tasted like a big, soft Oreo cookie (sadly, since we got it to go, I forgot to take a picture of it). The service and prices here were both pretty good. Even though the line to get in was long, it moved quickly. Since you pick up your own food and have to find your own table there are no waiters/waitresses but there are bus boys walking around that will bring you extra BBQ sauce, napkins, bibs, silverware or anything else you may need. The prices here are good too. All that food we got came to about $40 or so, which we thought was great. If you live in SD or are planning on visiting the area and feel like some great BBQ, then you have to check out Phil's. Two quick tips for you if you do go are 1. Be prepared to wait in line 2. Make sure you don't wear a light colored shirt because you may end up with a few BBQ stains at the end of the evening because their food is drenched with BBQ sauce. If you do wear light colors, make sure and wear a bib. I made the rookie mistake of not putting one on right away and I had to walk around the rest of the evening with a big, fat BBQ stain on the front of my light silver shirt.

I love BBQ so we decided to try Phil's BBQ since so many has proclaimed it to be the best BBQ place in town. We got there right when it opened and the line was nearly wrapped around the building. We were lucky to be ordering take out so it wasn't Êquite as long. We ordered the pork ribs and the ÊEl Toro. I was a bit disappointed that the sides for the family meal was a choice of one large side or two small, so I decided to get one large side. To my surprise the large side was the size of a small side elsewhere. The pork ribs were drenched in sauce which was too salty for me. Perhaps I should have ordered the beef ribs. The service was great and will probably come back again to try the beef ribs.

my bf's dad has him drive for an hour each way to deliver the ribs whenever he gets a craving...so i had to check it out if they really are that good. Ê we encountered a 15 min wait at 7pm on a humpday. Ê not too bad since you can drool over the choices on the menus posted outside. Êonce inside, you can view the dishes on the tv screen. i got the rib tickler with 2 onion rings, 3 small ribs, a load of fries, and a scoop of slaw. the rings were slick from being deep fried - i recommend eating this first while it's hot and you won't have time to regret it. as for the ribs: they were shorter than the ones in the regular order + 1 had barely any meat (end piece?), the other 2 were good and juicy. the fries were addictive and the slaw was tasty. i washed it down with some sangria - it was tasty but on the weak side so i'll ask for light on the ice next time. Ê you can also get unlimited refills on sodas or chug it down with some beer instead. my bf had the ribs with chicken and corn on the cob. Êi traded most of my fries for the corn and slathered it with butter. Ê yum! we were both pretty full by the end and packed the chicken in a box before hitting the theatres. and the verdict? Êyes, they really are that good! tip: *if you can't stand the lines, get it to go or head into the bar area and order the food from the bartender.

Always a long wait but well worth it! ÊWe tried the baby back rib and the large ribs and both were delicious. ÊThe meat just tears off the bone and the BBQ sauce is not too sweet. ÊThe portions are huge. ÊYou can probably eat the meat and take all the sides home for another meal. ÊService was friendly and they got plenty of seats. ÊIf you're ever near by San Diego, definitely stop by Phil's.

Dear Phil, You are a bastard. You know I have ZERO control when it comes to good food. Why, oh why, does the meat on your beef ribs just fall off the bone? I understand that some people, like The Woman That I'm Currently Married To, prefer the porn, I mean, pork ribs. As for me, it's your beef ribs that give me a serious boner. Your beef ribs are so tender that I'm salivating at the thought of them as I type this from my jail cell (man, dial-up sucks). Your fries are wonderful. Your chicken is a waste of time when there are ribs to be consumed. Your turkey burger should be renamed "Turd Burger" not because it tastes bad, but because it doesn't matter what you call it - THERE ARE RIBS TO EAT (http://www.yelp.com/biz_É). Your corn on the cob is the real deal - not some little rinky-dink thing that you would get at KFC (which sucks, by the way). Your onion rings are supposedly really good according to my so-called "friends." I don't have time for your onion rings because THERE ARE RIBS TO EAT. Your mac and cheese - pass. Baked beans - get 'em out of here. Ribs and fries (plus corn on the cob) - this is the combination that makes me fall in line. Just like the rest of the people in that line that stretches out your door and sometimes around the corner. Oh yeah, I'll see you soon and give you my money because I admit it: I'm an addict. In return, you'll give me something that will remind me exactly why I have no self control. Even when I'm done and stuffed, I'll still be reminded of those ribs because I won't be able to get the aroma of that sauce completely off my fingers. I'm sorry Phil, you're not a bastard. I just have a tendency of getting a little cranky when I'm hungry. No bad feelings? Psst..hey, uh, soooooo, can you hook me up with 3 bone beef dinner?

I don't think I have ever had better BBQ in my entire life! I had the pulled pork sandwich. There was so much meat that fell out of it I could have made a whole other sandwich! The onion rings were amazing...order the small...I promise that will be enough. My boyfriend and I both ordered baked beans. He loved them, but I wasn't a fan. Way too much pepper. I dislike pepper, but if you dig it then these beans are for you! The baby back ribs that he had were the best ribs we have ever tasted. I loved everything! The long line didn't seem so bad because the whole time I was trying to decide what to order. The guy towards the front on the line made it fun too. He said "I have a beer garden and you're standing in it!" Made me want to buy a Fat Tire not only because he said that but bc it was in a can. How cute! I wish I lived closer to SD to have this right now!

You know that scene in Soylent Green (http://en.wikipedia.org/É) where Charlton Heston follows Edward G. Robinson to the "Home"--the place where people go to die, and he sees a film of what the world used to look like with a deer leaping over a clean bubbling stream and beautiful unpolluted sunsets, fields of grain and unsmogged skies, and he gets tears in his eyes and says, "How could I know? Ê How could I...? Ê How could I ever imagine?" Well, that was kinda how I felt when I finally got to Phil's BBQ, being in the area Tuesday evening. ÊYeah, I know, I've been hearing about Phil's ever since I joined Yelp, but geez guys, all the ranting and raving really didn't prepare me for how good the whole experience was. ÊI thought it would be expensive for starters, maybe $12-20 a plate so I just figured, I'll stop in and just get and appetizer, maybe something barbequed if they have it, for about $8 and then I at least have tried it and been here. ÊInstead, I got a huge plate of food ("The Tickler")including three pork ribs, a pile of wonderful cole slaw, two Êhumongous onion Êrings that were among the best I've ever tasted, a gigantic pile of homemade French fries, and all for $6.50 before tax and tip?? ÊGood golly! ÊI ate a little over half and brought the rest home where it was all still good the next day as leftovers. ÊAnd the servers (though they don't really serve, but they do help out a lot) were all so friendly and helpful--I can't wait to go back!

phil's is good. probably really good for california BBQ, and maybe that's why there's always a line. it's nice to see restauranteurs making money doing what they like, so good for phil's. i don't consider myself a BBQ snob or aficionado, but i did live in kansas city for a while. and maybe for that reason i'm a bit biased. there are three aspects of BBQ, in my opinion. 1) the meat: i didn't find phil's meat all that flavorful. it didn't have the gamey, porky, smokey flavor that coop's has. in fact phil's meat didn't have much flavor at all. it mostly served as a phil's BBQ sauce and grease delivery system. sadly, phil's also doesn't have brisket or burnt ends. 2) the way the meat is cooked: i read somewhere that phil's doesn't use oak smokers or even wood, but humidified ovens with their own version of "the texas crutch". phil's meat was fall-off-the-bone tender, but it really lacked complexity. i've only ever had the ribs and pulled pork there, and when i had pulled pork it was, sadly, quite cold. not good. Ê 3) the sauce: Êmidwestern style BBQ sauce wins hands down over other styles in the states, in my opinion, with TX style a close second. in both regions, the sauce is never applied to the meat by the person serving the food. instead it's slathered on by the person eating it. Êi really dislike phil's sauce. it's too thick, too sweet, and they douse the ribs with WAY too much of it, even if you ask for less. this is disappointing. the meat is a bit bland. maybe they know this. but a lighter, punchier side of dipping sauce would make their ribs much better.

HOT DAMMMMMN!!! ÊTalk about drop dead, awesome, kick-ass, barbeque! ÊI would willingly gnaw on my arm if they would baste it with their secret bbq sauce :P ÊI know people argue about what makes good ribs. ÊIt's not just the sauce (I'm sure Phil perfected his because I've never tasted anything like it. ÊHis sauce is not so sweet and not so tangy. ÊIt's just PERFECT w/ the right amount of spices!). ÊI seriously think it's in the preparation of the meat as well. ÊI heard it thru the grapevine that they brine their meat, so that they become "fall off the bones" tender. ÊAnd don't get it twisted...THEY DO! ÊThe RIBS are tender and flavorful, they make you go "um...um...um!". ÊThis is not the only tongue-tickler on the menu. ÊThe PULLED PORK (BROUGHAM) SANDWICH is off the chain (tender shredded pork w/ Phil's barbecue potion, on an onion bun, topped with creamy coleslaw), as well as their BEEF RIBS, cripsy BEER BATTERED ONION RINGS, COLESLAW (I'm not usually big on slaw, but Phil's is fo'shnizzle good!), and of course their BAKED BEANS (rockin'!). Ê I'm not so near this joint, but I tend to make an excuse to visit my friend down S.D. so I can eat at Phil's! ÊHah! ÊBtw, order ahead before you get there 'cuz the line is OUT DA DOOR!

Wow, Phil's BBQ in Point Loma is off the hook. Now I'm not a huge BBQ saucy guy, I love a good BBQ chicken or meats, but haven't been a sauce kinda guy until I was introduced to this spot by friends who live in Spring Valley. When you think about going here I'd suggest viewing the website to see the on location cam to see how long the wait is, we showed up around 3pm on a Saturday and OMG I was like "No BBQ is worth this wait" , boy was I wrong . I have to give a huge shout out to the ace staff "Christine, Tammie , Louis , Brandon and the Manager George, from the gate we were welcomed and made sure our visit was tops, thank you all..Now on to the food, after ordering we got out piping hot food within 10 minutes, and the fun began, the flavored of the ribs were sweet and had a little kick , and if you blew on them the meat fell right off the bone, the chicken came chick-less (or you could do the bone) and two side choices (double upon on the macaroni salad) wow, my girlfriend got the BBQ cheesburger and these huge , crispy onion rings..yum yum, we both pick and ate from eachothers plates until both were cleaned, we even got two large macaroni sides togo, I am now a BBQ fan (Phil's or nothing for life), thank you all and counting down till the next trip , lunch tomorrow lol

it should be called PHIL'S GRILLING not BBQ. to me if its not slow smoked its not bbq. we've eaten a handful of times at phil's when they were located on goldfinch in mission hills and once and awhile co-workers will have phil's cater our lunch because they swear by it, to each his own i guess. the meats are good but its not "OMG the best ive had ever". if you've had southern bbq (s.c. tenn, k.c.) or even texas bbq then you know what real ba-bq taste like. also i'm not a fan of the black peppery sweet sauce, bbq can have a little kick but it shouldn't be a black pepper kick. its true if you go to tennesse or south carolina each bbq joint can differ on sauce but none of them taste like phils, and i guess its their way of making themselves different but i still can't stand the flavor. if you want a real bbq experience there's only one place to go and its not k.c. bbq in downtown or abbey's or baby back jacks, or the pit, or johhny rebs but Burrells: Êhttp://www.washington-sqÉ you want real pit slow smoked bbq there's only one place to go in all of socal. we were just there last week after missing them on new years day and the bbq and sides is still the same, absolute killer pics: http://www.yelp.com/biz_É

Well, I posted a review a little over a month ago, but after thinking it over, I realized it just wasn't fair; at least not fair to BBQ fanatics that eat BBQ from shacks behind houses, where the meat has substantial smoke flavor, and doesn't rely on any sauces. BBQ, like "best burgers" and "best pizza", is all about personal taste preferences. And your personal taste will always be the final judge for BBQ. And Phil's "ain't in no shack", and unlike a backyard operation, it really is easy-access, off of a major boulevard and behind the SD Sports Arena. And, there's ample parking. Don't get me wrong on this review, I still think Phil's is one of the best BBQ houses in San Diego, and quite possibly for you, your favorite. But it would be unfair to compare it, across the board, to say, Everett & Jones in Oakland, a Southern style BBQ icon in the Bay Area, or Burrell's BBQ in Santa Ana, which is a little house in a residential area that has quite a history. (my ex-biz partner swears by Burrell's.) Phil's is a well honed big operation, where you walk up to the long stainless steel counter, meet your BBQ order-taking specialist, make your decisions, pay, and take your vibrator/pager to where ever you decide you want to sit. And then you wait for the vibrating pager to signal when you can pick up your order and start pigging out. And to pay praise where it's certainly due, Phil's is a great example of a food business that understands how to marry great product, an efficient and comfortable facility, and high-level customer service. I found all three to be, remarkably, well integrated and at the top of the scale. If you enjoy substantial BBQ flavors and the availability of thick sweet and/or spicy sauces, then you should definitely try 'em out. I doubt anyone would say they absolutely didn't care for Phil's, because it is tastey. If you're like me, and travel around the country and try every nook and cranny BBQ place, then you may not be so hasty in doleing out the 5-star reviews, which actually makes my 3-star rating extremely solid. But if you do hand out 5's, you might want to indicate what you think makes great BBQ. I like American, sweet BBQ sauces, and meats that have a deep smoke flavor and clearly defined smoke rings. And if you try the TRI-TIP SANDWICH, you'll get alot of smoke flavor, and then you can hit it with as little or as much sauce as you care. For our lunch, we ordered the tri tip sandwich, short ribs and chicken, and also the chicken nuggets, in their own heavy sauce. (those are my San Diego client's favorite thing.) I loved the Tri-tip sandwich, and would recommend it. The nuggets may be off the charts for a traditionalist, but great if you think you'd enjoy fried chicken nuggets, generously covered in a sweet and tasty BBQ sauce. Again, this is all subjective. Their short ribs, for me, were drier than I prefer. But overall, I highly recommend Phil's if you're hankerin' for BBQ. You will not be disappointed. (Order a side of their onion rings with whatever you get!)

Ok, so I'm not a big carnivore, but my bf is and he wanted to take me to this fabulous place his roommates introduced him to when he first moved to PB. ÊNot feeling too excited about it, I obliged because I was starving and seeing he was so excited to take me to it. ÊWhen I walked into Phil's I realized it wasn't like your conventional restaurant where a host/hostess seats you and gives you menus and drinks and works it for a tip. ÊInstead I jumped into a line just in time before it began to filter out the door and found myself holding onto my bf's arm for dear life. ÊAll the meat seemed to make everyone go crazy =P Anyway we had originally intended on taking the food home with us, but we decided to just find a seat and eat there, which he recommended cuz he said it would get messy, to which I scoffed at because I'm not a messy eater. ÊWe found a nice 2-person table with a roll of paper-towel on the wall (that gave it quite the romantic feel) and the buzzer which would let us know when our food was ready. ÊOnce it went off my bf went and got our food. ÊIt definitely got messy once I saw how good the food looked, not to mention tasted it! ÊWe got the Ribs & Chickless, Beef Chickless, Onion Rings, and Baked Beans. YUM, YUM, YUM, and YUUUUUM!! ÊWhile we both agreed the Beef Chickless wasn't that great (because it was really fatty) the Ribs & Chickless was mouth-wateringly delicious!! The onion rings were to die for, and the baked beans were basically consumed by only me because I wouldn't share. ÊFor a girl who prefers her vegetables and sushi over meat, I was definitely a carnivore for the night (I like to think he found it incredibly sexy)! It was so good that I suggested he take me there before my plan flight back to Boston so I could fatten up on meat before my long ride back. Phil's BBQ is definitely somewhere I'm gonna want to eat at again when I get back to PB!!

Phil's is a vegetarian's worst nightmare and a carnivore's best friend! I don't know where to start but let me just say that you can't go wrong with any of the selections on the menu. Their baby backs are cooked to perfection as the meat slides off of the bone as you sink your teeth into one. All of their sides are yummy but my preference is the onion rings. Whether your dining in or taking out, be prepared for long lines that can sometimes stretch out the door. I wouldn't be disappointed though as it will all be worth it in the end.

My husband and I finally decided to try Phil's today, since it's a week day and the line wasn't wrapped around the building. I thought it was going to be a typical restaurant that seats you and gives you a menu....I didn't know you had to order at a counter "McDonald's style", then walk in circles trying to find a table....but finally we found a good one...the bar area had NO seats available :(. The food was very good and well worth the money, but when my husband brought our beers to the table I was not impressed with the temperature! I love an ice cold beer, and these Coronas weren't very cold! Also.....why in the world does this big - over hyped - constantly crowded restaurant only have a one-person restroom????

As far as BBQ goes this place is prime. Not a very large menu, but outstanding BBQ. I personally like the chicken and tri-tip, but they're big on ribs. If you eat lunch there get there before 11 pm or the line is out the door. They don't have a kids menu though.

I have to say I don't get it. Yes, the food is good but good enough to stand in line over an hour for? I think not. And then to discover that after all that waiting you are not even served but give your order to a cashier, get a pager, and then have to go get it yourself? At least it was done quickly after the order was placed, but I just found the whole experience disappointing. Maybe I just don't get the allure of BBQ enough to appreciate the long wait and lack of personal service.

So the 45 min wait in line on mother's day to get into this place to see what the hype was all about was definitely worth it. We shared a beefy rib & chicken dinner platter with a side of macaroni salad and onion rings was off the chain! It was also pretty cheap for the amount of food we got. we shared the entree, and couldn't even finish it (2 ribs, 1/4th chicken, with a large side of macaroni salad, and small onion rings). It was enough to feed 3 people all for $17. The meat was so tender and juicy, and definitely hit the spot. We LOVED the mac salad...not sure what seasoning they use to make is sooo flavorful, but a definite must try. service was actually pretty speedy...so don't feel intimidated by the long lines..they actually move pretty quick. if you happen to be in the SD area....definitely go check it out!

Phil's seems to be the Applebee's of the bbq world. ÊThe food seems pre cooked, Êand the waiters have way to much energy. ÊThe bbq sauce can easily be mistaken for sweet and sour sauce, Êfor christ sake it's red. ÊIf all these people think that this is real bbq, ÊI suggest you come up to northern california. ÊSouthern california bbq doesn't compare at all.

This place is over rated and I think you yelpers giving it 5 stars are just BBQ deprived in San Diego. ÊI think it is just passable at best. I was disappointed in this place. ÊKansas city BBQ in Encinitas was way better and you could have as much sauce as you could drink! ÊSadly lost their lease.

i've been to phil's a couple times and the last time i went we waited in line for over an hour!! over an hour!! now that's some dedication. Êphil's is probably one of the only restaurants that i would stand in line for an hour to eat at. the baby back ribs are so yummy and they just fall off the bone. Êsuper tender. Êi always order a whole rack and end up eating about half to 3/4 of it, but no worries because they still taste good the next day! Êthis last time we went we ordered a small onion rings for me and the boyfriend. Êooh boy those are NOT small! if you're impatient, order take out otherwise i would recommend eating in at least once to fully enjoy the atmosphere that is phil's. mmm... drooool.

Mmm. This place is pretty dang good. After living in San Diego for my entire life thus far, you'd think I'd have tried this place already! After buying about a million party snaps at the swap meet just down the block (and throwing them at unsuspecting folks), my brother, our friend, and I had worked up quite an appetite. We decided that meat, especially in large portions, would be the way to go. We waited in line for a good 20 minutes. What sucks about the entrance is that you have to wait to even get up to the counter, and there's no seating for people who are waiting. Other than that, it's not bad. There are televisions all around, and you can watch one of those while you wait. The counter is a lot like you'd find at Fuddruckers or any other place where you order and then pick up a pager. While waiting, I noticed that this place had the tone of a grouchy-ass aunt or something. A sign informed patrons that patience (and likely, they meant waiting) is a virtue, and that there was to be no pre-seating (grabbing a table before you placed an order). The guy at the door was asking if there was a party of 6 in line. A lady came up and said, "We have a party of 5...does that work?" His response: "No...that's why I said SIX." Granted, it annoys me when people try to bend the rules and do dumb crap while thinking they're being cute, but he could have been a little bit nicer. Later, I went to pick up some wet hand wipes from the condiment-and-cutlery station, and the packaging of the wet wipes said something to the effect of, "If you need more than one, go to our hand-washing station." Sheesh! I thought barbecue was about wild times and hicks, not being ordered about more than you would be in Communist China! Next, they'll be telling me that everything's better in Texas, and I'll be on a fast-moving death row for doing something wrong! The food was DELICIOUS, and the prices can't be beat. A "small" side of French fries would have been enough for 2 people to split, but we didn't know that, and everyone ordered their own. The small sides of beans are so damn good, but they're what you'd actually consider a small side. I ordered a cheeseburger, and they actually cooked it rare! I love when that happens; too many places will only go as far as medium before they start getting their communal panties in a bunch about food-borne illness, e-coli, the Black Plague, and who knows what else. My friend ordered the baby back ribs...oh, yes. Heaven. (I tried one.) The restrooms and the restaurant were clean. If you're a late bloomer by San Diego standards and haven't tried Phil's BBQ yet, definitely check it out!

I'm not usually a rib guy, but I was in town with a friend who insisted on going here. ÊHe drove, so basically I had no choice. ÊThe line was around the corner to get in but we went to sit at the bar and they let us go right in and order. ÊThe line was about 45 minutes long (there's a sign outside that said so like a ride at Disneyland). They have decent beers on tap, we got a pitcher of arrogant bastard. ÊI ordered Êa half-rack of short ribs with potato salad, fries and split a small order of onion rings between the 3 in our group. ÊThe half order of ribs was huge and delicious, probably the best I've ever had and I have been on a quest to find something just as good ever since. ÊThe potato salad was not costco style Reeser's like at other places, I could have eaten a big bucket of that by itself. ÊAnd the small order of onion rings were enough to make the 3 of us happy. I don't think I could ever go back to San Diego without stopping by this place. ÊBest bbq joint I've ever been in.

I didn't want to believe all the hype about how good this place actually was. I never really got into BBQ because it's more of a Southern/Texan thing. The closest thing to BBQ that I have enjoyed are those Costco BBQ ribs that are already cooked and only needs to be baked. So when I heard that this place was unbelievably good, I had high expectations. This place sure did live up to them. While the line was long and it took 20 minutes to get in to order, we were lucky to go on a Wednesday night rather than a weekend. The service is Fuddrucker's style where you order then they buzz you when your food is ready and you choose where to sit. I always want to try everything so I shared Baby Back Ribs and BBQ Chicken with Iris C. and she had some of my Beefy Ribs combo. That way, we both got to try all three BBQ meat items. The "Best of Both" combo costs $10.95 and comes with either 1 large side or 2 small sides. The best by far are the Baby Back Ribs. Nothing can compare to how tender and flavorful they are. The Beefy Ribs are also good, but the meat is tougher, but the rib itself is huge. You get two in the combo and when I saw them, they reminded me of the opening sequence to The Flinestones when Fred gets that giant rib on the side of his stone car and it's so heavy that it tips the car over. The boneless chicken was a little dry - maybe because it was from breast; I might want to try the bone-in chicken next time. The sauce was just ridiculously good. We also had a potato salad and corn-on-the-cob side. They were also good. The best part is that Phil's BBQ is relatively inexpensive and affordable. I am always looking for good value for the quality of food that I am getting. It doesn't necessarily have to be super cheap or expensive, but as long as I am getting what I am paying for. I will return for sure to try the rest of the items on the menu, including the sandwiches!

just some tips to add... 1) beef ribs better than baby back ones: meatier, bigger, fattier 2) get the potato salad. if you love potatoes and celery, you'll love this salad 3) good place if you want to watch a game: nice sony flat screen tv's everywhere 4) i don't appreciate the barbe-Queue cam : ( stop recording us please! 5) if you try to order over the phone to save time and then bring your to-go to sit down at the restaurant, you'll get yelled at, don't do it.

If you're used to midwestern/southern/awesome bbq, you'll be let down a little bit. ÊBut its the closest thing I have found to delicious bbq since i've been here. ÊTheir bbq sauce is more tangy than spicy and has a good warm taste to it. ÊThe broham sandwich as well as the beef sandwich whatever that one is called and the platters are great too. Êchickless are delicious. Êapparently thats just chicken that doesn't have bones and its little bits of them, but really they're big bits. Êand the ribs are bomb.

The food here is yummy, and the staff is super friendly. ÊFor the entrees, we ordered the baby back ribs, beef ribs, bbq chicken, and El Toro. ÊAll the meat items were smokey and delicious.

so i don't know if everyone on here that love's phil's has just never had good bbq or they love sweet sauce. if it's the latter, i understand, every palate is different. i do find it hard to believe this many people prefer a sweet sauce with no heat or smoke though. i moved out here three years ago and everyone was raving about phil's, so i bought into the hype and had to try it. very disappointing. i like a smoky bbq sauce that doesn't resemble ketchup, but that's exactly what phil's tastes like to me. i'd rather go to baby back jack's in hillcrest, honestly. my buddy agrees that phil's isn't all that, so i know i'm not crazy. I'm going to try the BBQ Pit and BBQ House next, hopefully they're better than Phil's... i find phil's way overrated. they may be one of the best bbq places in SD, but that's not saying much. my wife's friend used to own a place in temecula and all her workers were family from the south with home recipes. now that's real bbq! that place showed me what real bbq is and probably ruined most places for me. thing is, bbq ain't hard, i outcook phil's all summer on my bbq! i'd rather make my own bbq than eat this stuff. phil's is to bbq what L&L is to Hawaiian food, run of the mill.

My friends and I decided to come here for a birthday with good word from a friend's boss. This place has gotten rewards for their ribs, and this being said, definitely a place to try out. We went on a Thursday night around 8:00 p.m. and the line was already out the door, which is okay because it is said that the line wraps around the building's corner on a weekend. ÊWe waited about 30 minutes and the line moves pretty fast. Ê The ordering style is order from the cashiers and take a buzzer and find a table. ÊThe staff is extremely helpful and very enthusiastic about the food. ÊI shared the 5 beefy ribs combo with my boyfriend, and my friends got a BBQ burger, 2 baby ribs and chicken combos, and a side of onion rings. ÊThe portions are pretty big and freaking delicious. ÊMe and my boyfriend can usually eat a lot, but we could only manage to each eat 2 beefy bones. ÊTheir sauce is so delicious and tangy and the meat slides off the bones. ÊEven though I ate it with a fork and knife on account of my morning dentist appt, it was easy to eat and very, very good. ÊThe sides are pretty awesome: the onion rings are HUGE and the french fries are fresh cut. Ê They have a wash station by the to go counter and it comes in handy ;) Definitely go for a big dinner and share with friends. ÊThe prices are reasonable for the quality of food. They won awards for a reason! My boyfriend and I spent about $23 for a drink, and a 5 Beefy ribs plate. ÊTotally worth it, and I dare anyone to go there for a first date!

BBQ is usually not my #1 selection when it comes to picking a place to eat, but having a bf that loves BBQ, I've tried every local hole in the wall and family owned restaurant. I still do have a local favorite since I'm 8 hours away at Hi Life in Downtown, SJ - Phil's deserves a crown and the throne! Service was quick with 5 cashiers taking your order and food came out in a decent time. After a long day at Legoland - my stomach was deserving of a good meal.

4 1/2 STARS. things i will wait in line an hour or more for: 1. the midnight showing of Twilight 2. the space mountain ride at disneyland 3. justin bieber's autograph 4. a collector's limited edition bobblehead of the dalai lama 5. phil's BBQ dont forget to bring a book, a boardgame, or a 1000+ piece jigsaw puzzle when you dine here because you WILL wait in line AT LEAST 45 minutes. Êbut don't fret because while you're waiting, your appetite will slowly grow & your dining experience will mean so much more. you could probably close your eyes & point to any item on the menu & not be disappointed. Êwhether you choose to go with the ribs, chicken, or both, either way, your taste buds will build a shrine for you. Êeach piece of meat is slowly cooked which creates the most tender morsels you can get from a BBQ restaurant. Êthe meat literally falls off the bones even with a slight touch from your silverware. Êtheir super secret barbecue sauce's tangy, sweet & spicy mixture both confuses & commands your taste buds to have more. Êadd on a full order or two half orders of sides & i guarantee you think twice about getting in your car, driving home & risk getting into an accident because you fell asleep at the wheel from being so full. Êthe macaroni salad is a winner & you will be sick of fries after eating a bucket full of the half order! this restaurant is not only a local favorite, but mainly a tourist attraction, so the long line & wait will be a given. Êits a family friendly environment, you get a ton of food for the price you pay, parking is plentiful, &service is always good. i guess what im trying to say is, i kinda like this place.

(~$15) it is difficult to finish but you can always take it home. the leftovers are good too. :)) although.. it's really saucy. i am definitely a sauce person so i don't mind-- i actually LOVE it. but if you don't like sauce too much.. well i dunno. you should still try it. it is still worth it. HEHEHE. dude.. the meat just slides off the bone. very easily. i don't like eating with my fingers-- i use fork and knife for everything; pizzas, hamburgers, hot dogs, anything. but phil's is an exception. because the meat just slides off my hands don't even get that dirty. wheee. :)) TRY IT IF YOU ARE IN SAN DIEGO!

ok, i wont lie... ive been a fan since their other location in mission hills - when i would wait in the car (no parking) as my fiance ran inside and grabbed me a broham sammich to go. so i was very impressed when they went BIG - and opened up this joint in point loma. i am able to park all the time now, but be fore warned, as the wait is still there. i dont mind the wait as much, as now there is plenty of seating to go around - and the service is always awesome by the cashiers and the kids busting tables. the bbq is the best of san diego in my opinion - i LOVE the RIB-less Dinner and rib ticklers - but the traditional baby back rib slab is pretty damn good too. do yourself a favor and get the onion rings with em - and if you want a sandwich treat - do the BBQ Broham. yum. they still do take out, price is good, the new joint is very well designed and trendy, plenty of parking - an impressive UPGRADE from the last location. 5 star bbq in san diego.

it suuuuure is dee-rishus. (i ate all of my baby back and chicken combo, tender and scrumptious. i like that they have the option for a dual protein and steamed vegetables on the side too!) it suuuuuuure is satisfying. (it's a lot of food. i think i was full until 1pm the following day.) and it suuuuure made me thirsty the next day! (water - i need water! meats are so saucy and so salty.) but you know what? Êit just wasn't *WOW* for me. (my pinnacle standard is Rudy's BBQ in Texas) to supplement all of the other yelps, the wait at Phil's BBQ is super long, so don't go hungry! it's a wait to ORDER food, not a wait to get seated. it's kind of like a fancy mcdonald's, in that way. Êgo find your seat later. we did learn a neat trick from a local though - they serve the full menu at the bar! so if you can snag a seat or two at the bar, you can order drinks AND dinner from the bartender. we opted for the take-out counter, which clocked in our dinner wait at only 10 minutes! we scarfed down our appetizers by the door and then took dinner to-go. if you are craving some bbq and have a soft side for ribs (like me!), then you should definitely go!

This is as good as it's gonna get when it comes to ribs in San Diego as far as I know. This is the ONLY place where I'll eat ribs. I've always been turned off by how fatty ribs can be, or how much effort it takes to get the little meat off the bone, the mess... just give me a hot dog, please. But when it comes to Phil's... it's like they were made of the shimmeriness off of a unicorn's horn and cooked by elves. Yeah, something like that. But really, this is the only place where I actually like the ribs. The fries were good, the barbecue sauce was good... I don't know what's not to like. I had some chicken from here too (chickless I think) but I didn't like it nearly as much as the ribs. Chicken was too dry for my taste but still yummy. I'd go here again and I hope you guys give it a try. They do have a long line but hey, that's when you just call in your order. Woo hoo!

Having been to many BBQ restaurants is my life I've come to be a self proclaimed expert. Phils is definitely on the top of their game when serving up the baby back ribs. Just get in line with the rest of the herd and try not to piss off the teen taking your order by taking to long looking at the menu behind her. I don't eat here as often as I would like but if I did I wouldn't be able to hold my pants up on my big ***. Take a ride over to Phils and get you some ribs. Eat up.

Hands down my favorite bbq in Califonia. I used to eat their bbq up to 4 times a week when I was a student at UCSD. I frequently drive down from Los Angeles just for the food. It's that good. The pork ribs are simply amazing. The meat is always tender and delicious. The sauce is one of a kind. I always make sure to purchase a bottle. I usually get the sweet beans on the side. Also make sure to try the tri-tip sandwich. The price is great, $20 for a full rack dinner. Most bbq places will charge anywhere from $26-30. Some people may have a problem with the long line but it is definitely worth the wait. There is a long line for a reason. Parking is ample and the portions are huge. You will not be disappointed.

Had time to kill near the airport so I took two out-of-country folk here because I've been wanting to try it and they had mentioned it as a yelp finding earlier in the week. Came here on a Wednesday night last week and couldn't believe the line! I didn't understand at first how it worked - I presumed it was people waiting to get a table, not order....still though, pretty crazy for a freaking Wednesday. Luckily the end of the line was under the "21 minues 14 seconds" sign and although I forgot to actually time it my guess is that was pretty darn close to accurate. Two of us ordered the rib sampler and the third ordered a burger. We struggled for a few minutes to find a table but luckily a table of four got up to leave and I hovered over the table as it was being cleaned. Everyone who works there that we encountered were super friendly and helpful. I'm not sure it was as OMG as I'd hoped it would be from the reviews, but it was pretty darn good and definitely a wallet friendly deal. My only complaint - on a side note - is that the parking lot is very squishy and just...odd. Other than that it was a great experience!

First time didnt like it(cows they used probably were from mexico). Second time I understand why people like this place. I orderd the half rib plate with two sides $15-20, they dont serve mashed potato's(over healthy female cashier looked disgusted at me when I asked for some, like I was a piece of vegetable she didnt wanna eat). All you can drink fountain sodas. ÊStill dont know who Phil is? But they got this big blacc woman chillin near the door saying thank you for coming, one time she wasnt there, it was a skinny blacc lady(maybe she lost weight or that was her maid). Next time I gotta try the ribs with no sauce(looked like a plate from the flinstones).

I must pay my respect to my favorite BBQ place in town! Tried other spots which were good, but I have to say Phil's is head and shoulders above the rest of the competition. The only downside about this place is the line when there busy. But lines are a clear indicator that they must be doing something right and it moves pretty swiftly. I still gotta give them 5 stars for helping me on my quest to get as much meet stuck in my teeth as possible. Who got a toothpick?

Phil's BBQ is derrrrrrissshus. ÊThe lines get supppppppper long but they go by fairly quickly. ÊYou basically order your food as you would at a fast food place, find a seat and wait for your little buzzer thing to light up when your food is ready to be picked up. ÊTo avoid lines, go during happy hour and go directly to the bar or call in your order and take it to go. ÊYou can't order on the phone and eat it there, it's rude and well... not allowed. ÊIt's also in the same complex as Red Lobster and The Mens Wherehouse.... So if you're craving ribs and need a suit you're in luck

A second return and I'm still sticking to my vegetarian guns, my will power must be made of steel. Of course, got the Garden Veggie burger, but with a side of coleslaw this time. Man, this coleslaw was good too! The 'slaw was crispy and tossed with the right amount of 'slaw sauce. My friends fully enjoyed their turkey burger and I even got a free drink. I was told the sangria was satisfactory and the colossal onion rings were indeed colossal. The onion rings were good, a bit too much fried-ness for my liking, but then again, I'm not a huge onion ring person. But it still had a good flavor. Waited a tad longer than I did last time, but had good company in form of hot foreign guy, so the time went by fast. Hah. Will definitely come back despite self-inflicted vegetarianism.

Truly the go-to barbeque place for any meat lover in or visiting san diego. In particular, i order the beefy rib tickler: 1 big beef rib, coleslaw, fries, and two giant onion rings - for a price of 7 dollars, i consider it the best deal in town. The beefy rib ticklers are the best, in my opinion, with the chicken and pulled pork being somewhat average. I don't know how phils does it, but everyone who works there seems to be ecstatic, and in a genuine way, too. though its mostly self serve (order at counter, pick up food) someone always comes around to check on you. The lines are bad, like disney theme park bad. If you're not hungry when you get there, you will be when you order. expect ~40 minutes or even longer on a friday or saturday night. That said i can't let that detract from the overall rating- the place is operating at max capacity and the staff is working hard.

I have eaten BBQ all over the east coast, but this was my first exposure to west coast BBQ and I was pleasantly surprised how different but enjoyable it was. The portions are Flintstone-esq. My girlfriend and I ordered half servings of the pork ribs, and beef ribs and chicken and there was so much food it was borderline ridiculous. The mesquite wood smoke gave a tangy kind of sharp sweetness to the meat. This is completely different than the mostly hickory smoke BBQ back east but entirely delicious. The pork ribs were among the best I ever tasted but without a doubt, the meatiest I ever had. The meat was moist, thick and was just tender beyond all comprehension. The chicken was delicious. Take my same description of the pork rib and apply it to the chicken. This was the first time I had beef ribs. They just weren't for me. While i did enjoy eating them like a caveman, I felt there was too much fat, gristle and thin membrane along the bone. I didn't feel it was as tender as it could have been either. I scarfed down the meats so heartily, it looks as I had on clown make up made of BBQ sauce and I couldn't care less how I looked because I was happy! The sides were very good too. The mac salad had an interesting zip to it. No, not like Miracle Whip, but something very unique that I couldn't put my finger on. It was probably the best mac salad I have had. The beans tasted like BBQ smoke with a tasty meatiness to them. Just mouthwatering! The fries and potato salad were good but unfortunately, nothing to rave about. I would probably be a regular here if I didn't live in NY. LONG LIVE PHIL'S!

Well, I just had to come check out the new location near the Sport's Arena. ÊThis venue is definitely much more spacious and commercial than the original location that is closed now. ÊPersonally, I liked the small intimate feel of the original location. Ê You have GOT to be kidding me, this place had a line out the door at 4:30pm in the afternoon. ÊDespite the long line we were able to reach the front in about 10 minutes to order, so not too bad. ÊI ordered the best of both worlds with baby bbq ribs and 1/4 chicken. ÊRemembering the portions were huge at the old location I thought I would need to share this dish. ÊYeah, not so much. ÊI could have had two of those plates to myself, I must have ordered the wrong thing? ÊThere was no way I wanted to get back in the even longer line just to order more food. ÊThe 1/4 chicken was actually a small chicken thigh and we got 2 scoops of coleslaw and pasta salad for our sides(limited selection on sides). ÊThe ribs were somewhat disappointing compared to how I remembered them and the meat was not nearly as tender as I remembered. ÊThere was no falling off the bone action going on here.... ÊI was left bummed and hungry. ÊMaybe my BBQ standard has gone up after eating at other places? ÊHence, the minus 1 star.

This is my third time at Phil's and I was hoping for better. ÊI gave them three chances, but I was woefully disappointed. Here goes---Heresy, ÊI really loathe what Phil's calls BBQ. I've had the BBQ chicken- Êdry. Êbone dry. ÊIt tasted like chicken, but it was dry. ÊDry as the Sahara... please give me water dry. I've had the chicken breast BBQ sandwich-also dry..It was better than the dinner, at least it wasn't dry, but that could be because I put the slaw on the sandwich. Not to mention the exorbitant cost for a dollop of food. ÊThat being said, I can live with the cost, if I can get taste for my return. Now for the third data point, ÊI had the Turkey BBQ sandwich...drum roll please...my worst experience yet. Ê A table of 5 people. ÊEverybody else ordered the pork or beef rib dinner. ÊI ordered the turkey bbq sandwich. ÊI was third in line of our group. ÊNot only did I get served dead last, I got served when everybody else was about 75% done with their meal ( 5 more minutes and I was going to ask for a refund---that's how bad my wait was). ÊTalk about awkward. ÊAnd, the turkey tasted like cardboard, or for what passed as turkey anyway. Ê I told the guy who spearheaded the push for Phil's in our group, that I've not experienced a good dining experience there. ÊHe couldn't fathom why. ÊHe loves the joint. ÊAfter my wait and my making him taste my "sandwich", he now, begrudgingly, knows why. What sauce was on the meat was spotty at best. ÊI almost put my glasses on to find it. ÊThe cheese was a square of Vons caliber prefab, rip the cellophane off, cheese. ÊMy G-D, was that the turkey patty offensive. ÊYes, offensive. ÊI couldn't believe I actually paid for that sh_t. ÊI'm sure the inmates at Donovan, tasted better. ÊLike I state earlier, I made the "leader" of our group taste my meal, so he can realize why I no longer want to eat there. ÊTo his credit, he agreed with me and said he was sorry. ÊThe other fowl eater in our group, also had the same issues, but I won't write his review. If you are a Buddhist monk looking for a fun time out while fasting, please feel free to eat the turkey bbq sandwich, it does NOT resemble meat, nor anything that was living for that matter. Phil, ÊI will never eat there again (the leader of our group will eat there again, so don't feel pinched). I gave you three chances. ÊMaybe you are a two trick pony- Êbeef and pork, and fowl is not in your wheelhouse, because what you laughingly call fowl, I call foul. Ê I miss Fat Ivors. My wife and I literally plan trips around Smokin' Mo's BBQ in Chico and Pismo Beach. ÊThe cost of travel and the long wait between vacations is worth it to NOT EAT AT PHIL'S ever again. P.S. Êjust in case you think I'm BSing, Phil, my ticket was 345 around 1300 on 2010, Nov. 11. ÊGood riddance.

Mmm, Phil's sauce is the boss! ÊThere's not much to say - the BBQ is excellent. ÊOddly enough, the giant new location is harder to get into than the smaller old one - your best bet is to call ahead for takeout or go with a group so you can tag team the line for food and tables. ÊThe open seating arrangement is cool - you often have to share a table with strangers but I've always ended up meeting really nice people. ÊMinus one star for 3 reasons: Êfirst, they refuse to sell me a giant tray of pulled pork (seriously, I don't want to mess around with like 10 broham sandwiches just to have good BBQ while we're watching the Chargers game); second, their sides are kinda blah (especially compared to how phenomenal the ribs and pulled pork are); and third, some of their employees have major ATTITUDE. ÊSettle down, mister! ÊYou're selling BBQ, not haute couture.

It gets two because it's marginally better than the BBQ all over SD. ÊThis city doesn't know BBQ if the bland California-style BBQ is what has San Diegan's asking for more. Ê Head out to Texas or Oklahoma and there in little tin shacks off highways you'll find meats sold by the quarter lbs. ÊFlavorful meats. ÊWith hot sauces and Dr. Pepper and it'll run you less than $10 for a feast that's dripping with flavor. Phil's you'll drop $10 for a tiny hunk of meat that tastes like something endorsed by Martha Stewart - it'll look pretty but it'll be basic and low impact. ÊThere's nothing possibly aggressive about it.. ÊEverybody around you will giggle about how it's the best BBQ they've ever had as they tighten the Polo sweater around their necks or walk out to their Range Rovers. ÊApparently, Phil laces his BBQ sauce with Soma. Ê If you want real BBQ, leave California. ÊThis stuff isn't it. ÊIt's just a reminder that some foods really don't exist in SD at top levels (French, Cuban, etc).

If your craving for some serious BBQ then dont think twice before heading to Phils. The sides are delicious as well. We have tried the baked beans and macaroni salad.

This is one of those hard to write reviews. ÊUnfortunately, San Diegans know little to nothing about BBQ.

Love the food. I usually choose between a half rack of ribs, the chick tickler, or a broham depending on how I'm feeling.

Line moves fairly fast, and the food comes out pretty fast after you order. Baby Back Ribs, Marcaroni Salad, and French Fries yum... ÊThe meat just comes off the bone so easily! I usually add in half a chicken as a side if I split a full rack with a friend.

It's not like this place needs another review saying how amazing it is, but I'm going to continue typing anyways. I've heard a lot of people complaining about the ever constant line outside... People, there's a reason for it! This place is BEYOND yummy! The portions are huge and I have never been disappointed. If I wasn't worried about the size of my hips, I would eat here every single day.

Probably some of the best food I've ever eaten. The meat is so tender and juicy that every bite melts in your mouth full of flavor. Definitely a must go if you're in San Diego, although the wait time may be long.

We were in San Diego for my husband's business and really didn't know where to have dinner, so I googled "places to eat in SD." Yelp popped up with top ten places to eat in SD with Phil's being the 1st choice. After reading the reviews, and yes contemplating the expected long wait, we decided it was worth a try. Well worth the wait!! The onion ring samples in line were a nice touch, and the staff were helpful and friendly. I ordered the beef ribs with corn on the cob, and my husband ordered the baby back ribs with coleslaw and beans. Everything was good, but the beef ribs were AWESOME!! They had amazing flavor, even without the sauce, which was also great. The beans and slaw were good as was the corn, but I think next time we'll try the macaroni salad instead of the corn because it good but not great. I heard in line that people really like the red potato salad, which we might try next time too. I would highly recommend this restaurant if you have time to wait. It's worth it!!

When you see a restaurant with a line out the door at 3:30 pm on a Sunday, you know it's gotta be good. Next time we will call in our order and pickup. Fortunately, the line was less than 15 minutes until we were able to order. I got a half chicken (white meat) dinner w/ baked beans and fries and Mike got the BBQ burger. The self serve set up reminds me of Fuddruckers- they even have moist towelettes and disposable bibs-lol! Everything is huge here! Good thing I got my long run in this morning. It seemed like every seat was taken so we ate at the bar. Next time we'll try thje ribs and the pulled ppork sandwich.

The long line is worth the wait! I remember going here before they opened up at this new place. It was this small place that was converted into a restaurant before they moved Phil's to this location. Phil's is always packed and you'll understand why when you try their ribs. I also love the onion rings! A must try great for friends or family dinner.

There's a reason I come here at least once a month. There's a reason why my friends have to eat here whenever they visit from LA. There's a reason why people are willing to wait 30+ minutes in line in the cold and the rain. The creole seasoning they have is actually crack. Or whatever other addictive substance you could think of. And each bite into a baby back rib is a way of snorting it into your system. Well, maybe that was a little too crazy of an analogy. I finally decided to write a review of Phil's after visiting it so many times. Why so long you ask? Phil's has become such a common hangout place, that to review it would practically be reviewing my friend's house. The staff is unbelievably friendly - whether they are monitoring outside, hosting at the front of the line, taking your order, or cleaning up tables, service is done with a wide genuine smile. If their job were to simply make you feel at ease and have fun, then they certainly deserve promotions. Whether you get beefy of baby-back, full rack or half, you'll always be satisfied. The ribs here put all other places to shame. If I could truly have it my way, the only restaurant serving ribs WOULD be Phil's BBQ. Food comes out fairly quick, but the meat is always tender and succulent, and slides right off the bone. Plus the burst of flavor from the creole seasoning is mind-blowing. And I have to say that if you get fries, they load that shit up. So if you find yourself craving a bombass meal, and in need of a good time, head on over to Phil's. P.S. If you're celebrating a birthday, tell your friend to sign up online. When you get to Phil's, you get a "front-of-the-line" pass.

Went on a bad day or something? ÊThat will be the last time I show up there with 10 other Texans just to disappoint them. ÊNo one like it. ÊI mean, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't that good either. Êi ordered beef ribs along with 3 others. ÊMy ribs were really dry and tough. ÊThey really seemed to lack flavor without the sauce. Others had pork ribs, baby backs and other combos.

OMG, I find it REALLY hard to believe this place was voted best BBQ in San Diego Magazine as well as has as high of a rating as it does. ÊMy husband and I being new to the area went to Phil's it was near the hotel we were staying at. ÊThis BBQ is a Joke. ÊAnd has nothing on Southern BBQ real BBQ the meat was flavorless and the sauce bland. If you've had real southern bbq most likely this place will be a huge disappointment. Ê And the lines wow it's like when Oprah or some celebrity says a pair of the ugliest shoes are so cute and thousands of Êpeople go out to buy them , just the day before they would have passed right by. ÊPeople see a big line at Phil's and say it must be good ...umm no, that's part of the strategy. Long lines mean good food??? not necessarily. Very disappointed in Phil's. BTW My husband and I have had BBQ in San Diego twice (different places) and have been disappointed both times.

I really like Phils. I have been going for a few years now even before the sports arena location. Although the line has a tendency to be long if you dont mind taking it to go, call ahead. Don't try to cheat and order when standing in line, to go orders are to go only. The macaroni and potato salad arent the best but the BBQ makes up for it. I have to admit they serve the only coleslaw that I eat in a restaurant. The portions are good sized and they have soda on tap never seen in other places.

This is basically a San Diego monument. This should be part of your San Diego routine. Go to the beach, cliffs, and end it all with PHILS! Phils BBQ has the best ribs I have ever eaten in my life. This place got a spotlight from the hit tv show on the travel channel "Man vs. Food." If it is on Man vs. Food you KNOW this place is LEGIT. Lets start off with the place. The restaurant is pretty spacious and cozy. But the fact that there are A LOT of people there makes the place kind of hectic but not too hectic to ruin your meal or interfere your conversation with your group. The staff is extremely friendly and animated. There is this certain busser he is super friendly and chill. He is this tall skinny man that you cannot miss. Make sure to strike a conversation with him because he has made me crack a laugh a couple of times. And also the service is pretty good. Once I got my order literally 2 seconds after ordering from the cashier. The food is nothing less than spectacular. I have tried the full baby back rib dinner and the beefy rib dinner. Nothing against the beefy ribs, but my personal preference is the baby rack dinner with fries and macaroni salad. Other notable sides that you should definitely try are the beans, the onion rings (I think the onion rings you have to order separately), and the corn on the cob. This is an actually legit corn on the cob not the ones where they rip you off and give you half of a cob. Overall this place is great. I have been to this place roughly 10 times and I cannot wait to go back again! Hooray for RIBS!

ÊWhat I would do is call 30 minutes ahead and order the food you want. ÊOnce you get to the restaurant, you can bypass the long line and pick up the food and sit yourself anywhere. ÊThe best thing about this place is seeing all the hungry eyes looking at you in envy as you are walking out of the place stuffed with delicious BBQ!

Someone slap me along side of my head. . .I've lived in San Diego county for 12 years and this was my first time going to lunch at Phil's. I am a bit jaded as I have been to Southern barbeques where Bubba has been outback slathering sauce on various meat items for at least six hours. Yes, the meat does fall off while you suck on ungodly sized animal bones. Also, the butcher paper on the picnic tables and loaves of white fluffy bread in the middle create a sorta communal Texas feeding frenzy that is hard to beat. Phil's does a good job at smoking the meat and not having the sauce too sickening sweet. I ordered the pulled pork sammich which had ample meat. . .minus one star for some of the pork strands being a bit dried out. Maybe this meat was on the outside when being prepared? I want all the meat soft and tender, lordy help us if I actually have to chew! For a little tasting test, my dining partner and I ordered the cole slaw, macaroni salad, and potato salad. My favorite I guess would be the slaw. The potato salad is of the red potato variety, the potatoes were cooked just right. The macaroni salad has a bit of a garlic taste which was interesting. The cole slaw had bigger than average pieces of cabbage that was yummy with my pulled pork sandwich (the sandwich is called "The Broham" and was $6.45). I can't be too objective about our side salad tasting as after awhile we got tired of the mayonnaise taste. The corn on the cob looked interesting as the husk is left on. I'll probably get the corn yet time. Yes, I'm already plotting a return trip; Baby back ribs, cole slaw, corn. . .and I'll call it in beforehand so that I can go to the left hand side line! Kudos to; Friendly gal at the front station directing people to order-taking cashiers Sign-up for their email club, while standing in line there's a clip board on the wall. . .maybe I'll get something free from Phil's. Friendly atmosphere, the booths are especially soft and cushy For how long the line was to order, it moves along pretty good and once you order your food comes fast. The big sink behind the beverage bar provides you with a good place to wash your hands as you will slop sauce all over yourself. Cheap pricing; Phil's Ticklers with 2 onion rings (tempura breaded rings that are on the greasy side), a Baby Back Rib Tickler (3 bones) OR a Beef Rib Tickler (1 bone) OR a Chick Tickler (chucks of white meat that has Cajun seasoning) are $6.45 each. Cheap! Phil's does have the best BBQ in San Diego county - Jes go and be the carnivore!

I'm gonna preface this by saying that I am assuming that you like BBQ. So for all the haters out there that don't like BBQ and then do nothing but complain about Phil's, keep it to yourself. If on the other hand, you appreciate the work that goes into the ambrosia known as BBQ, you'll understand where I'm coming from. I shouldn't have to say anything since the line around the building almost every business day silences most critics. Once you round the corner and get inside, you'll see why this place might as well have its own mint. To your left is a bar with about 20 flat screens playing all the days games, ahead of you is a line to your left for phone ahead carry out orders and to the right the rest of the line for dine-in, and to your right is a sea of more flat screens over tables with families and friends gorging themselves. Covering all the classic park/backyard BBQ food, Phil's BBQ is the best home style ribs and food that I have come across in SD. Possibly ever. I can't explain properly how tender the Baby Back Ribs are and how additively sweet and spicy the BBQ sauce is. With the perfect amount of char on the ribs and a generous dosing of the sauce on every plate, you end up gorging yourself rather than taking anything home. If you laugh at the idea of having paper towels at your table, you'll quickly change your mind when you are covered head to toe in sauce. I love the trough sink by the exit you can use to shower off when your done. The Baked Beans and French Fries sides are a perfect match for the ribs. The beans are the sweet and savory and are great for dipping the fries in. You won't go wrong with the Onion Rings or the Corn on the Cob either. They have the only rings I've ever had that don't pull out of the ring when you take the first bite. The Potato Salad has large chunks of potato if you like that kind and the Macaroni Salad is some of the better that I've had. The Chicken is largely very good and juicy, but occasionally comes out dry. Bonus points for having a order out line that you can call ahead for. On the bad side are problems which are largely out of their control and problems which most businesses would kill for. Even in a recessionary economy the place manages to have a line around the building and no tables available for sitting every time I show up with a pretty pricey luxury product. I'm sure that once this economy picks up they will open up another location and it will be the same way. You are also going to put back enough food for about 2 days in one meal and you might fall asleep at the wheel on the way home when that itis hits ya. Bottom line, Phil's BBQ wins. Period.

Best BBQ in San Diego. Phil's is great. I used to go to the location in Mission Hills, I'm glad they moved to the new location. So much more room, not as long of a wait. I really like that they have a separate bar area, the draft beer is really good and cold. The food is excellent, I always get the Broham sandwich, pulled pork and coleslaw, I didn't think I would like the combination, but it is so good. All the sides and ribs are great too. The baked beans and potato salad go great with your sandwich. One thing I would say to avoid is the Chick-less, I was very disappointed in this item, I think it was chicken strips, but I remember them being bad, I ordered them years ago on my first visit and haven't since, so I don't remember exactly what it was. Another thing is that the food is grilled, not smoked, I don't care, the food is great, but a BBQ aficionado will say it's not the real deal. I wish I lived closer, I would be a regular.

okay, Phil's bbq was GOOOOD....it was our first time eating here and so we didnt know what to get. Êmy bf and i decided to get both the bbq baby back pork ribs and 3 beef ribs... (3 beef ribs sounds like just a tastebud teaser, but let me tell you...they were large ribs..thats a decent meal on its own...) Êanyways... so my bf passes me a beef rib, but we had to basically catch the meat bc it was falling off the bone...yes...we had to literally catch it from falling on the table... i like the very casualness of the place where you go up order, and go back and pick up your order..it really saves you $$ on tips.... Êi only gave it 4 stars bc i tend to like my bbq sauce spicy.. im Êa bit particular...but other than that..it was GREAT....they have other things on the menu like pulled bbq sandwiches...those look good too for people who dont want to get down and dirty (dont worry they have bibs)...but i like my meat off the bone...i did see that they do have a veggie burger to appeal to those vegetarians out there...but....yea...i dont know who would go there..and smell all the other great food and see everyone chowing down and then ask for a veggie burger. ÊMy bf wants to move to SD for Phils... to people who think you shouldnt eat bbq ribs on the first date...pish posh...just get it over with....this place is great for large groups, or just a pair...i definately recommend... **EDIT 4/22/2009** soo...i came back and the ribs had a bit more kick... maybe i got a good side with ample dry rub spices massaged into the meat.... my meat was peppery, tangy, sweet, oh so tender and smokey.... We went for my birthday and they were able to get seated and get our food rather quickly even tho we were a party of 9. ÊDespite the massive line, they are quite efficient in getting you seated..... even tho it was MY birthday...i picked this place for the BF....but i still loved it anyways... YUMMMMssss

I went on a Monday afternoon at 2:20pm and the place was packed. I'm guessing the only reason was because of the most delicious barbeque sandwich ever created...... The El Toro, best barbeque sandwich I've had in life! The sauce and Êthe tri tip..... a match made in heaven. Best thing I've had in San Diego by far. However, the sauce Êdoesn't really taste so great on the chicken and Êribs but the tri tip is crazy. Put in your mouth, enjoy and repeat!

This place gets HELLA FREAKING BUSY! Come here early or you will have to wait a long time. I really enjoyed the ribs here, I got the ribs with no sauce to taste the true flavors of the ribs and they were delicious! I would definitely recommend this place to others if they like ribs.

When you go to a place where the line sticks out from the front door, that's a very good sign. The line moves pretty fast. The order and receival time was about 10 minutes tops. They have a selection of soft drinks, coffee, sugarless and sweetened iced tea and juice. We ordered their ribs, two order of 1/2 chicken, coleslaw and onion rings for four. Yum! Hey it may not be the best bbq but it's good!

After my more-than-forgettable experience at Beachwood BBQ in Seal Beach, I was in dire need of some good (or at least decent) barbecue. ÊAnd since Phil's had been on my list for years, I decided to take a day off work (don't rat me out now!) and headed over. Ê The wait wasn't as long as it could have been since it was a Thursday night. ÊUpon entering, you are directed to the counter to place your order. ÊThen you take your pager contraption and find yourself a table. ÊIn my case, the pager buzzed the second I placed it on the table. ÊImpressive. Onto the food... First, the baby back ribs. ÊAs overused as this term is, there's nothing else I can say to describe it: the meat just falls off the bone. ÊThe sauce is sweet and it surprisingly had a little kick to it. ÊUnfortunately, I didn't enjoy the second half of the rack as much as the first because I started finding the sauce to be too sweet. ÊActually, I thought there was just too much sauce on the ribs to begin with; it took too much away from the flavor of the meat. ÊThey don't make this mistake in Texas. ÊI even switched my drink from the orange soda to lemonade just to minimize the sweet flavors in my mouth. Ê The beef rib tasted like the baby backs initially because of the sauce, but once I got past the sauce, I realized the beef doesn't taste as good as the pork. ÊIt just wasn't fun to eat. The cole slaw was probably one of the better slaws I've had but I was a bit disappointed with the macaroni salad. ÊIt was pretty bland. Last but not least, the onion rings were quite the hit. ÊI had eyed someone's order of rings while waiting in line and I knew right off the bat that they would be good (which was why I ordered it). ÊI can tell by looking at onion rings whether I'll like it by the way it's battered. ÊIt had the perfect amount of crispiness to it and it was the perfect side for the ribs. In most BBQ restaurants, a full rack of ribs will cost $24-26. ÊAt Phil's, it's $18 (or was it $19). ÊReally not a bad deal. Ê I have no issues w/ having to walk back up to the counter to pick up my order. ÊIn fact, it's probably in my health's best interest to get that extra bit of exercise (if you call walking 10 feet "exercise") to make up for the massive amounts of food I'm about to eat. Speaking of which, Phil's was the 5th restaurant I ate at in the 7 hours I was down in SD. ÊAnd it was still good. ÊThat ought to say something.

It's good, but I don't understand the hype.. and I certainly would not wait over an hour in line for this. ÊDoesn't taste magnificently better than any other BBQ ribs I've had. ÊDon't get me wrong, the meat slides off the bone and has just the right smokiness, portions are good, and both times I've been here I had a satisfying BBQ meal. ÊPrices are reasonable and there is a good selection of everything on the menu. ÊBut for the wait and the reviews on here, I expected almost orgasmic. ÊMaybe that's my problem: I had high expectations. ÊMy advice? ÊDon't expect anything spectacular. ÊYou can expect a long-ass line though.

My visit to San Diego included dinner at Phil's BBQ. This is a small place with a line out the door. I'm not a big BBQ fan, but the pork ribs were finger-licking good, along with the coleslaw. Nothing fancy here, just straight up, good BBQ. I'd definitely recommend Phil's.

So im not exactly what it is about this place but it never disappoints. Well maybe it does on one point and that's why its missing the 5th star. The dine in line is always NUTS! It never fails, always out the door with a approx. wait time of 30 min. That's not including the wait time for the food. I always order takeout. The have my food in no BS like 5 minutes. While I wait I am always greeted by someone and offered some water while I wait. The staff has always bee en courteous. If you order one of the Sandwiches beware there is tons of meat in there.

Phil's is good BBQ. I miss the Goldfinch location. For some reason, I thought the food tasted better there. The new location on Sports Arena feels a little like a cafeteria. If there is a really long wait, the hubby and I will usually go somewhere else. Bonus tip: If you eat there later (after 9:30), there is not as long as a wait, and if you sit on the patio in the summer, you can catch the Seaworld fireworks at 9:50.

The service is fast and friendly!! I don' t even know how many times my boyfriend and I were greeted. Even the customers standing in line with us were really friendly and happy to be there. Everyone had a huge smile on their face. Got to our table and in less than 5 minutes our little buzzer went off to get our food. Ordered the Baby Back Ribs and Chickless with a side of baked beans and cole slaw. The cole slaw was a little toooo peppery for my liking. I really wanted to like it because some people in line were raving about it. The baked beans were good. But my favorite on my plate was Baby Back Ribs!! The meat just fell off the bone! sooo good! The chicken/less was ok but i think i wasn't into it because I was infatuated with the ribs hahaha I guess everytime I visit San Diego, I have to visit Phil's .. I have no problem with that. I knew we made a good decision on dinner because people were talking about it at Seaworld the next day.

Phil's is the best bbq in San Diego, but that is not saying much. Come on guys grilled bbq? Where is the slow roasting "bbq pit"? To be able to cook "good" ribs it takes time and patience, not a 20 minute sear on the grill. If you have never had "pit" bbq then you probably do not know the difference, so keep giving the 4 & 5 stars. I want to "keep it real" and this is not "real" bbq. Just my 4 cents...........

this is by far the best bbq in san diego. i grew up in north carolina, and i thought i would never find southern style bbq till i found out about this place. there is ALWAYS a wait, rain or shine. 20 mins at the least, its that great.... i once asked this hostess "what is the great here?" and she responded " Everything, everytime you come here, order something else...it is all equally tasteful" and it really is , ive had most of the items on the menu. my top 3 choices are the: beefy rib dinner with Large frie and (creole seasoning salt) baby back rib dinner with potato salad and small frie(with creole seasoning salt) and of course the BBQ chicken is always flavorful. the onion rings are fabulous. i have converted people who HATE and will not eat onions, to love these onion rings. they have a great selection of coke products and liquor. its a first come first serve seating unless you have a large party(6+) then they will try to save you some seats. other then that, i have went there 3 times this week and a total of 7 times in a months time. thats GREAT. i highly recommend it. nothing but the greatest bbq in san diego. oh ps...dont listen to the sign by the entrance . Wait from here is 21 mins and 14 secs. because it really isnt .haha

Wow, 1900 reviews, how could you go wrong?? Let me just preface this review by saying that hubby and I are by NO means granola eating folks. After 32 minute wait, we ordered the baby back and beef combos. Yummy! ÊHowever, Êwe were chugging gallons of water afterward. Which means they use msg or an INORDINATE amount of salt (no wonder it tastes so good!) Ê I would've given less stars, but staff was wonderful, environment enjoyable & prices reasonable (18 bucks for bb meal) I guess if you're in the area & can spare some time, it's worth a visit. But I would much rather go to Tulsa Rib Co in Orange. Delectable and not as much salt. Oh, and tulsa potatoes-yum. ps. If you don't want to wait the queue, you can go to the bar and see if they have enough stools for your party. Ê:) Enjoy!

This is by far, the best BBQ I've had, so far. Given, I've only been to 6 or 7 BBQ joints. But, once you've had Phil's, you won't want to have anything else. I've tried almost everything on the menu and all of it's good. If you go there, go for the Ribs and Chicken dinner. Go with a few people and add a large order of Onion Rings to share! Wow, my mouth is salivating already! =) The only downsides are that it can be hard to find parking and also that the line is usually pretty long (which is a sign of some good food!). Do yourself a favor and call in your food before you go. It's "a little" faster and you can get a general idea of how busy it is at that time.

Hands down, best bbq I've ever had. The bf and I came here with some San Diego friends for a last lunch before Sea World and then back home to LA. Needless to say, I have yet to find a great bbq place in LA... First off, be prepared to wait. We came at around noon which is prime lunch hour. We made sure to drop someone off to wait in line so we could park. During that 5 to 10 minutes, the line had grown to 8 parties deep behind us. Given the amount of people ahead of us, I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly the line moved. After ordering, I was again pleasantly surprised by how quickly the food came out (given the line.) My friends and I had the Barham and the bf had the 7 rib dinner with beans, slaw, and an order of onion rings. Can I just say, the slaw is AMAZING. The Barham is big enough to share the meat with someone else as long as you order another set of buns. Delicious, fall off the bone, pulled pork. The ribs were mouthwatering and perfectly seasoned, sauced, and VERY meaty. Also, the service is excellent. Could be because they were trying to get us in, get us out, and keep the line movin'. I didn't mind though, I wasn't there to chill, I was there to EAT.

im not a big BBQ person, but if i was, i would definitely love this place. it's really affordable and even though there can be long lines, its a big restaurant with a lot of seating. the beef ribs and bbq chicken are super tender and slathered with tons of tangy bbq sauce. i really like the potato salad and macaroni salad sides. its very refreshing to eat after all that meat! i also had the pulled pork shoulder sandwich that came with a tonnnn of meat. i thought i had read that it came with coleslaw in it, but when i was asked if i wanted any sides i said no, so my sandwich was just bun and meat. unless you like a ton of meat and sauce, i recommend you make sure you get coleslaw with it. i really liked the onion rings as well. they are HUGE! and crunchy and when you bite into it, you dont end up dragging the whole onion ring out, leaving you with just a hollow fried shell. if you love BBQ, this is the place to go!

HOLY MACARONI (yes! they do have macaroni salad too!) I just did a double-take on number of reviews this place got. Ê Before I get into the REAL review... There's no waiter service. You go in, order your food, and perch on the sidelines being vultures awaiting tables to open up. ÊThe lines are long but it goes by pretty fast. If you're coming with a party, come during a time when its NOT busy, which is like... never. jk. Call ahead or something.This place is totally worth it. I promise you the moon that it is. Okay, to the more substantial review: Hands down the best BBQ spot my mouth has experienced in San Deezy. ÊI ALWAYS split the "Best of Both- Beefy Ribs and Chicken" with my mate; it's about $12 and the portions are quite big. ÊI don't get the "chick-less" (chicken minus the bone) anymore because I find that it just doesn't taste the same as the most awesomely awesome chicken with the bone. Onion rings are awesome. They're ceasar salad is awesome (i'm just saying that because all ceasar salads are awesome to me). Their bar is awesome. The line wrapping around the building is not too awesome. However, the "Official Twitter Area" outside is too awesome. The creole spice on the table is awesome (Sorry Phils, everytime I leave, you guys are one seasoning container short). The beefy rib the size of my head is awesome. ÊThe bibs are awesome (although, BBQ somehow happens to find its way towards some part of my clothing). ÊMy sticky BBQ-ey hands are ESPECIALLY awesome. Had enough of "awesome"? Nope. You haven't until you've eaten here!!

I've been craving some BBQ, so I headed over to Phil's for lunch today. ÊI had been to the Hillcrest location a few years ago, and that visit left me disappointed, especially after all the hype. Ê I feel the same way after today's lunch - somewhat disappointed. ÊGood food, but nothing special and I don't understand the crazy hype this place gets. I work off Miramar Rd., and as many of you know there is another BBQ joint nearby. ÊThis place tends to be hit-or-miss, but I ate there yesterday (beef sandwich) and it was pretty damn delicious. ÊI think they're a little overpriced and the quality is inconsistent, but I still think their BBQ is better than Phil's, even on an off day. Ê At Phil's, I ordered a plate of onions rings (thick and delicious), a pork rib plate (with fries and mac salad), and the El Toro (beef sandwich). ÊMy wife was there to help me finish everything. Ê Ê The fries and rings were excellent. ÊBut you don't go to a BBQ joint for fries and rings, dammit. ÊThe ribs were good, but not great. ÊMy wife and I agreed that my own home-grilled pork ribs (purchased from Costco) are better than Phil's. ÊThat's not a testament to my own cooking - it's more a slight on Phil's. ÊThe tri-tip sandwich, which is what I was really craving, was below average, in my opinion. ÊThe meat reminded me of some generic "beef in bbq sauce" that you might buy in a tub at the supermarket. ÊTo be fair, I'm not a huge fan of Phil's sauce, and since everything was slathered in it (which would normally be a good thing), I think it turned me off. ÊSauce aside, the beef itself wasn't anything special. ÊI think I prefer a thicker cut of meat, instead of the "deli-sliced" that they use in the sandwich. ÊI definitely prefer a spicier or smokier sauce, with less sweet tanginess. ÊThe color and glaze of the sauce reminded me of some terrible Chinese sweet and sour. Ê The service was EXCELLENT. ÊWe were greeted at the door, the girl taking my order was real nice (and asked if I'd like my sauce on the side), and a dude stopped by our table a couple of times to ask how we were doing. ÊThe facilities are pretty cool, it sort of had an amusement park feel to it (like an old school Knott's Berry Farm) and the trough sinks are a nice touch. Ê I'm sure I'll go back at some point, but I won't be jumping on the Phil's bandwagon like the rest of these reviews you'll read. ÊWhen I get that urge for a tri-tip sandwich, I'll be sticking to Miramar.

So, having just written my review for (UGH! YUK!) Abbey's Real Texas BBQ, it made me remember to add my humble review to the thousands of raving fans for Phil's. Everything here is DELISH. The ribs are tender, the side dishes are awesome...all of them! Good chicken, good everything. If you dine in, it's hard to get anyone's attention if you need something that's not on your table. Also, the wait is usually atrocious. I know they can't help it, it's just because they're popular...but I just don't like to wait! But still, there aren't too many good bbq places in SD, Phil's is definitely one of them, and I'll keep going back. I just try to get there as early as possible! Also: Both me and a friend have at different times ordered Phil's for parties through their catering service, and WOW, do they ever take care of you. We both learned that you can pretty much order about 3/4 of what you think you need, because we had BOATLOADS of leftovers (Yum!). They packaged up the food very nicely, provided plates, plasticware, wetnaps, a TON of extra sauce. Perfect!!!

Ask almost anyone you know where to get good BBQ and they will no doubt point you to Phil's BBQ. I've eaten here numerous times and it's average compared to other BBQ I've had across the country. The wait isn't worth it, nor is the price. There is better BBQ to be had in San Diego but it does make a decent lunch if you're in the area. I find the onion rings to be over-cooked and they charge you extra for ranch to dip them in. Your typical wait from getting in line to eating your food runs about 30-45 minutes. Lunch for two will cost no less than $20 so be prepared - it isn't cheap by any stretch of the imagination but then again, BBQ isn't cheap in San Diego.

The place was clean, the customer service is fast and polite, and the food is fucking great. I tasted the ribs, the chicken, the coleslaw, the onion rings, the fries, and the baked beans--and they were all fucking delicious. I want to add that, while this may not be "real" barbecue (who fucking cares?) it's still scrumptious. The haters need to go find something to do. This will be a mandatory stop from now on in my future travels to San Diego.

The food is great, the service is great. The hostess is such a sweetheart. I love the pulled pork sammich. Plus they have crystal light. F yeah, that stuff is too expensive to buy for home, so when I go there I indulge. Their onion rings are to die for. You have to try those if you go. They're huge so a small order of them is enough for 2 people. Great prices too. Very affordable. If you love your woman and she's not afraid to eat real food, bring her here. Men, this place is for you. It has man food. None of that sissy stuff like salads. Oh!!! And there are always Kenny Rodgers look a likes, its sweet &gt;_&lt;

I found out about this place from the Man vs Food website and I understand why this is one of the restaurants they chose out of all the good restaurants in San Diego. ÊI had the pork rib dinner and I have to say it's one of the best BBQ meals I've ever tasted. ÊThe sauce has just the right amount of spice and tanginess. ÊThe two sides I chose were the beans and potato salad, both very good as well. ÊThe last BBQ place that ÊI felt left the same impression was at Gates in KC. ÊLastly, you can't beat the price! ÊFor the amount of food you get, you can't beat it. ÊI highly recommend that if you find yourself in San Diego, that you try and find a way to make it here. ÊEven if you see a line, it'll be worth the wait.

Came here with friends that are visiting. They don't have a Phil's BBQ in their small town in Colorado so they wanted to go. I had never been here before. I shared the half BBQ chicken dinner and it was plenty. We had cole slaw and sweet baked beans for sides. I was surprised by the sauce because it was really sweet and tasty! Wines and beers are reasonably priced. They have pitchers of beer for $13 -$15. I'm not a meaty BBQ person at all so this was a nice treat. Will be back for ribs OR BBQ pork sandwich and will be sure to share again next time!!

Worth the wait and lives up to the hype! Be prepared to wait at least a good half hour to get into the restaurant as the line usually wraps around the building. But once you get in the front doors that BBQ smell greets you and everything is right in the world. All I can say is ribs, ribs, and ribs. Their ribs are delicious and moist with just the right amount of flavorful sauce. I'm a big guy and a half rack with the sides are the perfect portion for me. An order of the full rack will guarantee a goody bag to take home. For the sides, the onion rings are delicious and their baked beans are good. The staff at Phil's are extremely pleasant and make you feel right at home. I've spent four years in the Deep South and I've had some great BBQ out there, so my standards are high. The good news is that Phil's meets them.

I've actually never been to this specific Phil's BBQ, I always went to the one in Mission Hills area. I love the babyback ribs here. It's very informal, self serve type place. And I like that about this place...roll of paper towels on the table and your good to go. The only downside is that it looked like the prices were increasing...which sort of got pricey...but still decent for BBQ.

I never enjoyed bbq because the ribs would hit my chubby cheeks and get my face all greasy, but recently discovered shorter, more flavorful pork baby back ribs and the myriad and challenging tricks to make them tasty (boil with garlic). ÊSo I don't have many places to which to compare Phil's, but as a meal goes, it was outstanding... First off, we stumbled upon it while we were waiting for alterations on suits from Men's Fashion Depot (an actual word-of-mouth recommendation), and I were delighted that we would get to try this "famous" bbq instead of going to Burger King (Hostage Gastronome's fall-back eating establishment). ÊThe line was out the door, but the ordering set up and seating was the most effiecient I've ever seen - the hostesses were right on top of the vacating tables, but didn't pressure anyone out. ÊThere were heaters outside, but we chose to sit inside and soak up the minimal ambiance. ÊI really wanted to see some fatties pigging out on slabs of ribs, but it was a family crowd (Sat. lunch), and no one seemed over-eager (like me on the inside at a good looking buffet). ÊThe memory of the pungent vinegar bbq sauce smell is making my mouth water right now, but the sauce was a little on the too sweet side. ÊI tried the pork sandwich, ribs, chickless chicken chunks, and the breast - all great. ÊThe breast wasn't dry, but the boneless chunks are the way to go. ÊI was expecting the sides to be mayo-laden 5 gallon drum type slop, but the cole slaw was perfect....wish I had ordered some potato salad too. ÊThe beans were good and fries fine, but the most "5-ish" thing about Phil's is the onion rings. ÊThe crunchy batter adhered to the huge ring, and the taste was sweet and savory. This beats Sonny Bryan's in Dallas, and was probably cheaper. ÊDefinitely a bbq stand-out; I'm just not giving it a 5 star rating because it didn't have me plotting to somehow get back there for more.

hot damn. i had no idea what this place was all about til i got here. i pull up in the parking lot and its a huge line (it was a sunday, no wonder) the wait was about 30-40 minutes, which wasnt too bad since it wasn't cold that night. the way they do it is almost like a fast food resturant where you park, wait in line, order, and your order is up, then you sit and eat. except, they're more organized here about where you sit, especially if you're a large group of 8+ i believe. the service here is really good. the servers and cashiers are really nice. if you want a suggestion on what to get or you cant decide, they give your their honest opinions. RIBS - DELICIOUS. whether its the baby back ribs or the beefy, damn its good. i've never had ribs THAT good before, no joke. the sides, they're not bad, i'd comment more if i could but i was busy eating my ribs. CHICKEN - ehh. it was decent. if you eat this last, it'll be dry cuz the breast soaks up all the juices. i can't wait to come here again next time i'm down in San Diego. the perfect day would be going to P.Beach and then straight here!

Review is on food only. Baby back ribs only. Hubby brought home a few ribs from his full rack. I devoured them. Scrumptious. Lip smacking. Liked the peppery kick. He enjoyed the sweet beans and coleslaw too. So much that he didn't bring home any for me!

you want good BBQ, than Phil's is the place to be! My god, some of the best BBQ I have ever tasted and i know my way around a grill to say so. before i get into the greatness that is Phil's, let me say the negatives first (tho there are not many to be seen). the first thing that sticks out is the wait. more often than not, you will be waiting in line just to make your order. the line is always out the door and will round one of the corners. they do have signs saying how long you will need to wait at the point in the line you are at but that just makes me feel let down when it takes longer then posted. Êby the time i order, i am so hungry; the waiting is excruciating. also, on really busy days, it can be hard to find seating; so there could be even more waiting. maybe this just really sticks out to me because i am a pretty impatient person. but there are so many saving graces to Phil's that make me give it 5 stars! now the good stuff. first and is merely a fun novelty but their is a webcam out of the front door that faces the line so a friend can log onto Phil's website and laugh at your ass waiting in line. fun for the person watching i guess. now onto the food and drinks. i usually have a pulled pork sandwich slathered with BBQ with a side of potato salad and french fries and this is the feast of champions. the BBQ sauce is truly the highest of high for phil's. i could drink this stuff, its so good! the pork is cooked just right, so its nice and sweet and tender. they grill the bun a bit to give it that crispy touch. the fries are cooked where they are crispy on the outside but warm and tender in the inside; with a little ketchup and i am set. the potato salad has big pieces of potato and the perfect amount of mayo to give it a rich taste. I always have a cup of sweetened raspberry tea and a large stack of napkins by my side, so by this point i am set for life! i could truly go on for days about the excellence that is phil's, but you really need to check this place out to believe. you should just stop reading this review now and get into your car and drive there. bring a book tho or a friend, because you will be waiting, but good things happen to those who wait!

I always have a delicious meal here, and I think it's because of their baby back ribs. Its so soft and tender it just melts in your mouth. Not a big fan of their beefy ribs though. I had it once and the meat is all dry and ehh. Normally I'll get the half pork ribs and half chicken meal, so I get a little more variety. My usual sides are fries and mac salad because I feel as though it complements the meal perfectly. If only their corn on a cob didnt count for 2 sides. Lines are pretty much always freakin longgg as ef. More often than not, you'll be waiting around the corner, especially on weekends. But I did notice they set up a mini bar outside so you can have a drink while you wait. What a good way to keep hungry customers happy. But if you're with a small party, try catching an open table at the bar to avoid the wait. The bar is the perfect place to sit during basketball and football season because they have the games playing on multiple TV's. Keep in mind they are closed on Mondays!

i first had phil's before the point loma location opened. it was amazing. but the line was ridiculous and the wait was long. BUT!!!!!! NOW....... this location has triple the seating capacity of the hillcrest location and 10x the efficiency. there is usually a line stretching out the door, but it moves quickly and you receive your meal within 10 minutes Êor so of putting in your order. you seat yourself. the ribs..... OH... the ribs. i have dreams and day time fantasies about these ribs. unlike chili's or other casual dining sit downs, these ribs are VERY meaty, and VERY tender. they fall off the bone and melt on your tongue. the sauce is tangy and sweet but not overwhelming. if ripping meat carcass off a bone doesn't sound appetizing to you....the boneless chicken is also smothered in this sauce and just as delicious. they also have a few sandwiches to choose from, one of which has pulled bbq pork with coleslaw (IN THE SANDWICH) on a delicious soft bun.... for only $7? the fries are to die for, especially if you sprinkle some of the cajun seasoning (available on the table) and dip it in your left over bbq sauce from your entree. have i gushed enough?? are you convinced? stop reading and go eat phil's.

This place doesn't need another 5-star review, but I'm going to give it one anyways. I was just down in San Diego for the weekend and hit this place up on the drive back to OC. ÊSince it's only about 10 minutes from Gaslamp, it was definitely worth the detour! ÊReading other reviews, we tried to get there early. ÊWe got there at 11:15am on a Sunday, about 15 minutes after it opens. ÊThere was already a line of about a dozen people out the door. ÊThe staff keeps it moving pretty fast, and we got through in about 20 minutes. ÊThey are also really helpful with seating, so don't be worried if you don't see a table open. I ordered the baby back ribs. ÊThey were fork tender and the sauce was sweet and tangy all at the same time. ÊI'm surprised not much has been written about the baked beans. ÊThey were the best beans I've ever had in my life! ÊThey had a great smokey taste, so you definitely knew they did NOT come from a can. ÊThey added a dash of cajun seasoning to the potato salad that gave it a nice kick too. ÊThe onion rings were also delicious, but they were served with ranch dressing. ÊNext time, and there will definitely be a next time, I will ask for an extra side of bbq sauce for dipping.

i'll give it 5 stars just cause my bf who's a total rib monster loved it, otherwise it would have received four cause it's not as good as the original location (which is currently closed). Êanyway i brought the boy here for the first time a couple of nights ago and we ordered a full rack with fries and mac salad and a pulled pork sandwich. Êi ate about half the sandwich and half of the fries and was disgustingly full. Êmy bf cleared his entire plate of ribs plus the remaining fries and mac salad, and then proceeded to finish my plate. Êhe wanted more claiming he wasn't full yet but i thought i should stop him. they have tv's here so we watched some basketball to digest before heading off to ice cream afterwards :D a couple of quotes from the bf on the way to ice cream: "do i really want ice cream? Êi don't want to get rid of this rib taste in my mouth" and "i wish i could burp right now so i can smell the ribs again" fries here arent that great but the mac salad is an excellent complement to the bbq sauce. Êtheir coleslaw is pretty damn good too. Êi hate vegetables and i'd eat the coleslaw. like i said, this place isnt as good as the other location. Êmaybe cause theyre making more ribs at a time or something, i dont know, but i do know that when i ate the ribs at the other location the meat just slid off the freaking bone when i touched it with my fingers, and that did not happen here. Êalso, maybe im just a sauce fiend, but i think they totally could've given me more sauce on my pulled pork sandwich. how did this get so long? ÊIN SHORT...really good ribs but if you can, head to mission hills. Êstick with the baby back ribs and mac salad.

Didn't want to give another 4-star review, but the fact that my classmates went to Phil's after many (many) pitchers of beer, on a whim, during high traffic time, AND we found seating fast, AND our food was ready just as fast... ÊWell, that's deserving of 4 stars. ÊI felt sorry for all the people who were waiting in line to place orders and find seats, because (I could see from my patio seat) that line was wrapping around the corner. ÊThe last time I went to Phil's was over a year ago, when it was still at the old location. ÊI don't know why I hadn't been back since. ÊShared a half rack of ribs, fries and onion rings (with ranch), and still had leftovers. ÊThe BBQ sauce is so yummy and sticky, even with the napkins and wet-naps, you come away feeling like your mouth and fingers are coated with residual sauce.

900+ reviews. This place doesn't need another review, but what the heck, I'll write one anyway. My friend was dying to take me here for the longest time. It is indeed good. I got the 1/2 rib dinner, which comes with half slab of baby back ribs and two sides, which I got potato salad and coleslaw. The meat falls off the bone and the sauce is just perfect. The side dishes are very fresh as well, especially the coleslaw. Coleslaw, if not fresh, can taste very soggy. As for the wait, it was not too bad. About 15 minutes wait, but it can be longer depending on the time and day. However, nothing can beat the atrocious wait time of the Boiling Crab in garden grove.

There aren't very many well known bbq joints in southern California, but when I am craving some good bbq I think of Phil's! The line may look long and will even go around the corner, but it actually goes by pretty fast. Huge portions that I usually take home for another meal or two. The baby back ribs here are awesome, and the beef ribs are HUGE! In my opinion, the beef ribs had too much fat on them so I prefer the baby backs. You have to get a side of onion rings--AMAZING! Especially when they're still piping hot and makes that "Crunch!" sound when you bite into it. I have yet to try the tri-tip that was featured on the Food Network but I will get that next time!

Oh Phil's BBQ...I ate so much here I had food coma on the way home. ÊHad their tri tip sandwich, the best of both worlds baby back ribs and chickless chicken with the mac salad, french fries, and onion rings. ÊEVERYTHING was good..the onion rings and mac salad were probably the best I've ever had. ÊThe chicken was so tender and the meat on the baby back ribs easily came off the bone. ÊIt was so good I even had some to go..and it survived the two hour drive home pretty well too. ÊDefinitely going to be going here whenever i'm in SD.

Overrated. Based on food alone (we waited for an hour in the rain to get in the place)-- tri-tip was dry and rubbery. Beef ribs were fatty and barely had anything edible on them. They look like huge Fred Flintstone ribs, but there wasn't any meat on them. The best thing we had were the onion rings. We were disappointed with the place. Service was fine, no complaints there. Update: The owner did email me and try to make it right. I'm pleased with the customer service :) I hope the meal we had was just an anomaly.

He's a Keeper! There's a guy your parents would approve of. Anyone that can open up a BBQ joint, name it after themselves and have 4.5 stars rating on yelp has got to have some big huveos. Seriously, I would have never in a million years eating a BBQ joint called "Phil's BBQ" if it wasn't for my trusted food junkie Adam Richman from Man vs. Food. My fianc and I have passed this place a couple times but the long lines always turned me away to other local eateries. But 2 weeks ago, I was the early bird. I got to the restaurant at about 11:20 AM to get my eat on. Less than 10 minute wait, which was tolerable for my fat face. I stocked up on food as if the Armageddon was coming tomorrow. The Beef Rib dinner + the El Toro sandwich. Yes, it was a big man's order, but it wasn't all for me. I ate half of the sandwich... a piece of the beef rib... some fries... all of the mac salad... and I was stuffed. I wrapped the remaining, with love, for my fianc to try. Come to think of it, I spent 20 bucks on this meal... but I managed to squeeze 5 meals out of it. Not bad. I'm giving this place 4 stars, instead of 5, because of the ridiculous lines. A little about my credentials: I first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky, engineering image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian ÊRestaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of pastas and dishes. I never became a professional chef, but I continue to enjoy & love food. 8 years later and 55 lbs heavier, I am now an engineer that travels all over the world trying new foods and learning about different cultures.

Always a great place for BBQ. I am personally a fan of the Beef Ribs. The baked beans are great but the meat is why you come here. The meat is BBQed and slathered in Phils special BBQ sauce. The sauce is what carries this BBQ and there is no doubt about it. If you come here earlier in the day then you can beat the crowds. It's a shame that they are closed on Mondays though :(

OK look, this place is so worth it. ÊYou get so much good food for your money. ÊWe went for San Diego's restaurant week. ÊThey had a set menu, that covered a big selection of their food. ÊI ordered the salad and baked potato for the first course. ÊThen for the second course, I had Wow, a big beef rib, 1/4 BBQ chicken and some baby back ribs. ÊWhile I was devouring my food I felt like I was eating like a caveman. ÊIt's not pretty with all the BBQ sauce splashing all over the place. ÊIf anyone came close to my food I probably would have growled and shown my teeth. Ê That's how good this place is, you will protect your food from other people. ÊIt is like instinct! ÊThen to finish with some mint girl scout cookies. Ê ÊWe got to Phil's aroung 8:30pm on a Tues, there was no line. ÊI hear the line could wrap around the building sometimes. ÊI also hear that the line moves quick. ÊWhile I was there you could see they run a tight ship. Ê ÊI really enjoyed this place, the staff was helpful and on it.

I loooove this place. Everytime my best friend comes out to visit me, we have to come here. We've never had anything but the ribs. We've had the pork and the beef. Both are so tender, always fall off the bone. The sauce is delicious. Phenomenal. We skip the line and order take out, it's just easier. We've never had so much as a hint of a problem with the food or service. Until this time..we ordered to full BEEF dinners to-go. The woman that took our order repeated to us 3 times, which I thought was odd..but no big deal right? We got our food, that girl said "two full racks?", "yes" we said. So we got on the road to head home. And almost got there. The aroma from the food was mouthwatering, as usual, so I opened the bag to eat some fries. And saw our PORK ribs. Now, don't get me wrong..the baby back are insanely good..just not what we ordered. So, we turned around. We went to the counter and talked to the woman who had taken our order. She didn't offer lame excuses, just got straight to getting us our correct food. Awesome..cuz I hate it when people try to argue that I'd said something else, or whatever. Then, like 30 seconds into our return, the Asst. G.M., Ray La Placa, sidles up to us like a ninja. I didn't see anyone notify him of a problem, he must have radar or something. He introduced himself, asked the problem, and sincerely apologized for it. Sometimes, managers (at other places, not here) seem like they are bothered to have to deal with this type of thing. Not Ray. He was genuine and clearly loves his job. He compensated us for the mistake and sent us happily on our way. So, we get home with our BEEF ribs. And no fries. Ah man.....My buddy calls the restaurant fromt he number on the card Ray gave us, and asks for Ray. He comes to the phone in like a milisecond. (a ninja, I'm telling you). Hears the problem, invites us and our kids to eat for free. Really? He'd already taken great care of us at the restaurant. I was so suprised. We decided after that phone call not to take the free meal, cuz we felt like that would be almost taking advantage. But, I've NEVER had such a perfect experience with a problem resolution in my life. And we eat out a ton. Lots of problems, never such a professional;, sincere, and helpful manager EVER. Love Phil's. Love Ray. Wish I could give more than 5 stars. Can't wait to go back.

This place is delicious! Although, I don't know if you want to trust my judgement because I don't eat red meat, therefore I've only had their chicken dishes. However, hearing my friends' opinions and seeing the other reviews on here prove that their pork/beef rib and chicken dishes are all amazing! I've been to Phil's twice. The first time, my friends and I went in the middle of the afternoon on a weekday, so we were seated almost immediately since there wasn't much of a line. However, our food took a bit of a wait. Here is the way they serve their food: you wait in line to order, once you order they give you one of those buzzy things that go off when your order is ready for you to pick up at the counter, then you take a seat and wait for your order to be completed and you pick it up once it is ready and take it back to your seat. I ordered the BBQ Chicken Sandwich, along with the macaroni salad side. I have to say, I was definitely impressed. I wasn't even that hungry when I went, but I ended up finishing my plate! I'd have to warn you, the meals get pretty messy. They do provide a roll of paper towels on the table and they have moist towelettes for you as well. The second time I went, we went at night during the week day. There was a bit of a line, but it didn't take too long until we were at the front. We ordered and, although the place was quite busy, we didn't have much trouble finding a table. The employees were super friendly, but they didn't act fake either. There was a birthday celebration at the table next to us... It was actually fun singing along with them. It wasn't too corny, yet they managed to get us to participate. We had multiple employees come by and ask us if we needed anything, and when our buzzer things went off, they offered to get our plates for us (which is service we didn't get the first time I went there)! I can't say anything negative about the staff at all. One of them even offered us free dessert if we found him after our meal and told him how it was (we ended up being way too full after to pursue him though), As for what I ordered, I had the Chick-less Dinner (white meat boneless chicken) with baked beans and fries for my sides. The fries were really good with the creole seasoning they provide. What I loved about my meal was that since it was boneless, I could eat the whole thing with my fork and knife... mess free! I'm typically picky with my meat, yet I was very satisfied. The sauce is really good as well. It has this spicy kick to it that I really like. Although Phil's is so awesome (food, service, atmosphere, everything), I'd have to say that it's really something that I wouldn't indulge in, but to enjoy every once in a while instead.

Went to Phil's yesterday for lunch, I usually get Th Broham (pulled pork sando with coleslaw) but I decided to get something else and chose the El Toro (tri tip sando) ÊThe beef was smothered in BBQ sauce which had a little kick. ÊFor 6.95 it was a HUGE sandwich and I was thoroughly impressed. ÊIf you want faster service and skip the huge line, call in an order to pick up or eat in the bar.

What's wrong with Phil's? It's too small, and there isn't enough parking. The food is why. I got take out because it would be quicker and ordered the "Half rib only, 6-7 bones" for $10.95. I got about 9 and they were great. ÊI think the ribs are grilled vs smoked but still killer. The ribs are tender, moist with a little char on the outside. The sauce is different from other BBQ sauces. It looks almost like Chinese sweet and sour sauce because it is clear and kind of reddish. It tastes sour, sweet, with a little delayed heat. I will definitely try this again, at maybe a little bit of an off hour instead of 12:30PM.

This is my favorite place to get ribs in SD, but I liked it better when it was at the hillcrest location. People complaining about getting seats at the Point Loma location have no idea how bad it was at the hillcrest location. When I used to go to the hillcrest Phil's there was always a lady who you talked to for a seat and I always contemplated bribing her. The point loma location is nice since there is a lot more seating and its near my work, but I hate sitting next to the window where the line forms because then people just stare at you with evil eyes as you eat your food. Ribs - The ribs here are great. The meat falls off the bone and the ribs are usually cooked well. I like my ribs well seared, but sometimes they overdo it and burn it. The sauce is good, but I find it a little bit too sweet. French Fries - The fries are better than the standard fare, but nothing really special imo; though they do give you a bit. I like to make a sauce for the fries with ketchup, franks, and some of the ribs bbq sauce. Onion Rings - These are so good, but you can feel your arties getting clogged as you eat them. The onions are nice, big, and meaty. The rings are greasy and crunchy as they should be. Corn on the cob - I like the corn here because they do it right. The corn is nice and hot, plus its great spraying corn juice all over the people you are eating with. Other - I have had the other sides like slaw, potato salad, and macaroni salad, and I am not a fan of any of these. I don't think they are bad just not my cup of tea.

I haven't had BBQ in a while but let me state that I was super excited to hit up this BBQ place. ÊI've heard nothing but a lot of good things about this place so I'm already coming into this place with really high expectations. ÊFirst thing that I noticed about this place was that their lines were out the door and around the first corner of the restaurant. ÊI was already ready to turn around but, let me tell you, don't let that line fool you. ÊThere's a sign that says that at the corner outside of the restaurant it's only a 20 minute wait from there. ÊThat's not bad if you ask me since most of the time I'm already waiting for 25 minutes or so for Chili's (and Chili's isn't even all that!). ÊI noticed that the service there, except for the person that was on my register, were really friendly. ÊThere's a guy Louis there, gotta let him know that dude was real cool. ÊAnyway, I got a half order of Baby Back Ribs (which I heard were THE thing to get when it's your first time there), a side of potato salad and fresh cole slaw. ÊThe misses got the same except a quarter order of baby back ribs, macaroni salad, corn and fries. ÊI got a side order of BBQ sauce cause' I love my sauces!! Ê The ribs were daaaaamn good. ÊThey were mesquite cooked and you can really taste it. ÊIt's not a hint of it, you can TASTE it. ÊI really liked that cause' I think it really made it that much better. ÊThe meat just fell off the bone. Êasldkjas83l ÊExcuse me, I had to wipe the saliva off of the keyboard real quick. ÊThe BBQ sauce was thinner than I would've liked because I'm really into the thicker BBQ sauces. ÊHowever, it was tangy, a little sweet, and didn't overtake the mesquite flavor of the meat. ÊThe potato salad was just alright, I wasn't a huge fan of it. ÊThe cole slaw tasted fine so no complaints there. ÊThe fries were okay just like any other fries that you'd have. ÊThe sides didn't really stick out to me with the exception of the potato salad where it was below average. ÊThe portions are pretty good. ÊI think on a hungry day I would only be able to handle the half baby back ribs anyway. If I could take some home after my trip, I would love to do that. ÊI wouldn't want to put them in my bags for under the plane and I doubt that they'd let those saucy things on the plane so I just might have to grub on some ribs as they x-ray my whole body. ÊNom nom nom!

So I was working and overheard some of my coworkers talking about Phils BBQ in San Diego. "it is a MUST try if you ever go into the area" The service is amazing! very nice people and a really good environment! We witness the long line at phils and the workers are kindly enough to go around the line with a tray of fresh french fries and their own bbq sauce! that was a awesome teaser treat! ÊAs we got in the door, we were help by David who was a awesome cashier, we told him it was our first time and what was the best and favorite item they had. He told us about the baby back ribs, so we got that BEST ribs falls off the bone . ÊThe bbq chicken(WHITE MEAT), that was juicy! BBQ broham which is a classic pulled pork with coleslaw on the side(veryyyy filling) and the amazing el toro!(these are tri-tip and they dont know when to stop with the meat! which is amaing! its enough to make 2 sandwiches!VERY SMOKEY flavor yumm Êoverall, it was a good experience, VERY good food, great service and the place is clean!

Best ribs ever! For roughly 10 bucks you can get the most amazing, mouth watering, meat-falling-off-the-bone, basket of goodness. Sure the lines can get up to a mile long (not really), but if you're in line with some friends, it can go by fairly quick. Phils needs to expand to a larger location with the amount of business they get. They have an extended menu consisting of other sandwiches and things, but i never think to get anything else but their baby back ribs. Yum!

Phil's BBQ is a favored spot in San Diego for many San Diegans and for good reason. The food is tasty and you get a lot of it. Now I'm no BBQ expert and I've come across many a BBQ snob (when I mention Phil's), but those people should realize that the definition of what makes good BBQ is different for each person. All I know is that Phil's BBQ is tasty and I enjoy it so much it's in my regular rotation. I like the variety of plates they offer ÊCan't make up your mind between chicken or ribs? No problem, they got the "Best of Both" plates that include a quarter chicken, beef or pork ribs and two sides (I always opt for the bake beans and mac salad). The onion rings are very good too. If you're in the mood for a burger the BBQ Cheese Burger is yummy as well as their sandwiches. I'll usually get the BBQ Broham which is pulled pork shoulder meat topped with cole slaw. Once you get through the long line, service is quick and prompt. Sometimes though, when the lines are especially long, they have a poorly implemented system where once you get to the head of the line they shuffle you off back outside to wait for your name to be called. Also keep in mind that they are closed on Mondays. All in all, good BBQ for a reasonable price. Recommended.

Best BBQ in the world? Hmmm I dont know...but it sure is the best BBQ Ive ever had. Me and my S.O. and our 3 month old son were out in SD over Labor Day weekend and couldnt figure out what to have for dinner. He immediately suggested that we go on the Travel Channel website to see if there were any places around that we MUST try out. Soon enough we bumped into a recent tv segment of 'Must Eats: San Diego' and we were directed this way. Of course, being the loyal Yelper that i am i went on http://yelp.com and typed in the place, just to discover that it had tons of 5 star reviews...quickly we jumped in our car with baby and all and drove a few minutes (thank god our hotel was super close Ê**look for a homewood suites by Hilton review from me after this he he) Anyway, so here we are driving super amped to check out/find out what all the fuzz is about...we pull up and OH EM GEE! All of San Diego must have been there that night....it was ridiculously packed...the line must have gone around the restaurant like twice...they have these signs like at Disneyland that tells you what your expected wait time in line is. Anyway...super bummed we drive away from the place thinkin oh hell no, we cant wait to eat till midnight, we are starving, and just headed towards Red Lobster (ugh right?). As we were convincing ourselves to just eat at Red Lobster and make the best outta of it...i thought to myself 'hmm i wonder if they do carry out' BAM! i call and yup, they do carry out and its only a 15min wait!!!...God is great! i placed my order hung out in the parking lot for a few and then walked in to pick up what is now the best BBQ we have ever had. Tender, fall of the bone meat. Best Onion rings ever...the fried batter literally melts in your mouth. its a MUST TRY!

Considering I am the 314th reviewer I doubt I will be saying anything new here but this place is awesome! We went here last Friday night at 7:30pm thinking we would just wait out the long line. Boy were we in for a pleasant surprise. The line appeared long but by the time we figured out what we wanted to order...we were at the front of the line. We liked: Chickless Tickler combo plate, baby back ribs, and the Sangria. The people are all really friendly too!! Big plus. We are adding Phil's to the rotation!

Let's face it, Southern California isn't exactly known for it's bbq, but while staying in San Diego recently the concierge recommended Phil's so we decided to give it a try. Ê Yum! ÊIt reminded us of the type of bbq we would get when we lived in Austin, TX but with better sauce. ÊThe girls split a rack of pork ribs with the sweet baked beans and cole slaw, hubby had the pulled pork sandwich and I had the corn on the cob. ÊWe all split a small order of onion rings. ÊTop it off with a few drinks (soda fountain, self-serve, free refills) and our bill came up to just under $40. There was so much food that we struggled to get through it and still weren't able to finish. ÊI am usually skeptical of corn on the cob from restaurants but this was fresh and sweet. ÊThe ribs could have used a little more flavor, but the pulled pork was nice and smoky. ÊI missed the pineapple bits in the cole slaw, but it was still tasty, and the beans were a perfect balance of sweet and zesty. Ê It is similar to places in the south where you walk up and place your order and pick up the food once your buzzer goes off - an upgrade from straining to hear your order number being called. ÊWe had several people come by during our meal to make sure the food was good and to see if we needed anything or to clear plates. Ê We went around 4:30 pm on a Thursday and had no wait, but were warned that evenings and weekends were crazy busy.

I'm torn in writing this review. I LOOOOOVE Phil's as a restaurant, but I was super bummed about the prospect of having them as a wedding caterer! When my husband and I got engaged last year, one of the first details we thought we would be able to nail down would be the catering since we both loved Phil's and wanted the yummy and casual feel of bbq for our big day. I had also used their catering service when I was graduating from UCSD for a simple large pick-up order and they had been great to my mom. WRONG! I was very disappointed with their catering manager. Granted, it was at the start of my first ever wedding planning journey, so I had several questions, but we set up a phone appointment and she did not call me. Then we set up a second appointment a week or two later, and she flaked on that one again. Finally I had a day off from work and called to set up an in-person appointment. Her office was super messy, though it was in the middle of their holiday season and it seemed like she was the only person working in the catering department. During the 45 minutes I was there, she probably got about 10 phone calls and she answered 2 of them while I was there. By that point, I had already began researching costs for party rentals and had developed a pretty firm idea about our overall wedding budget. I explained that we wanted a simple, casual summer garden wedding. She was pretty pushy in trying to convince me to have them take care of the rentals "for a small extra fee" as well as trying to convince me that we needed to upgrade many of the rentals. She tried to convince me to add 3 layers of tablecloths, fancy chairs, real silverware and added that I should really rent some crazy port-a-potty trailer with lights and sinks that would "only be an extra $1,500". She said that she would put together a quote for me with all the possible bells and whistles and that we could take things off the quote from there. She promised to send it the next day, and actually sent it the next week. It was not itemized and was more than $2,500 more than I had already been quoted from the site's preferred vendor. Yikes! She also told me that because I was coming to meet with her 9 months before our wedding, that she really didn't want to deal with me until 2 months before our wedding! I really don't think I was a bridezilla, but I left feeling like someone was trying to boss me around and take advantage of me as a novice party planner. Their prices were decent compared to some of the other caterers out there and their food is super yummy, so I might use them if I had a company party or something, but they get a thumbs down for me for wedding planning. This was also back in the winter of 2008, not sure if they still have the same catering manager.

Getting good bbq is hit or miss these days. ÊI usually get pretty bad bbq at the chain restaurants. ÊHowever, at a little spot in SD near the Sports Arena you can get a super mouth orgasm. ÊThe best ribs I ever had! ÊI've been goin to this place for years back when it was a dark hole in a wall place with the ghetto benches. ÊNice apple smoked flavor to their bbq. ÊOnion rings are really good too. ÊIt hits the gspot. ÊSeriously.

This restaurant is a must-go-to place. Every time someone visits me from another city, I always take them to Phil's. It's just.. the best! I hate finger foods and getting my hands dirty, but this place is worth it, I promise. The meat from the baby back ribs just slides off the bones and the sauce makes it oh-my-freaking-goodness good. I get a baby back tickler (3-4 ribs, fries, cole slaw, and 2 onion rings) and it's only $7.01. What a freaking deal! And oh yes, the fries. UGH. I want some right now. You dip that in the Phil's sauce and then some ranch and you get a taste of heaven. Freak, I'm getting hungry. Oh yeah, and I met Phil, too. He's this huge bald guy with a mustache, a low voice, and very little words. But he was nice enough to take a picture with me. :) Oh yeah (again), I catered from Phil's for my college graduation and they were so nice, congratulating me and conversing with me as I waited for the food. They're so patient and friendly. I seriously wonder how they are like that with all those customers in there.

If you're into BBQ with a kick like me, this place is great. The yelpers who said that the sauce has too much vinegar might be right but I like it that way. I get the half rack rib dinner with corn on the cob and extra BBQ sauce. It's just enough to put me in a coma.

We loved Phil's so much we had them cater our wedding! I know what you're thinking: BBQ for a wedding? It was the best decision we ever made! The staff was amazing and I probably made 345346 calls to the department confirming things or changing orders, etc. and their patience never grew thin! We had a tight budget on our wedding, but the one place my husband knew we'd spend money on was going to be good. Worth every penny. Even with our budget, we still were able to afford a full dinner menu for 50 people in an affordable range! They came and grilled right at our wedding location and during the ceremony, our wedding party was salivating in excitement for dinner as they could smell that sweet meat grilling away! I think I'll go ahead and add a picture of the meal at our wedding! Phil's is what it advertises itself to be: A great business that serves great food!

I had my first taste of Phil's when someone at work took orders and brought in take out for all of us. ÊI've been hooked ever since! ÊPhil's BBQ is rightly deserving of the "Best BBQ in San Diego" claims. ÊTheir BBQ sauce is honestly the best I've ever tasted. ÊWhatever you normally like at a BBQ, order that at Phil's and you will be able to die happy. ÊI usually get the El Toro beef sandwich which is packed so full you can barely pick it up with two hands. ÊEven when you succeed, about half of it falls all over your plate/table/lap anyway! ÊBut don't worry, they have a much needed hand-wash station in the back!

I am usually not a big fan of bbq but man this place rocks! The wait was long on a Saturday night, about 45 minutes, but a game of categories can make that wait seem much shorter. The whole system of getting your own table does make it a little chaotic but this place is a cozy, elbows on the table type of place. The sides are good most of which contain mayo, but the one that stood out the most were the baked beans, so delish! The pulled bbq sandwich was amazing, so tender and just the right amount of bbq sauce (I recommend getting the cole slaw on the side). The baby back ribs were amazing, yes they were finger lickin good. We got amazing customer service and everyone just seemed friendly all around. Now I don't claim to be an expert on bbq, but it was good FOOD and I don't even like bbq all that much.

I didn't really read the reviews in depth before I came, so I was expecting full service sit-down place. Once I ascertained what kind of place I was, and got my chicken and beef-rib combo I was impressed by the portions for the price. I didn't expect the ribs to be falling-off-the-bone, but they were reasonably close and the best I've had for that price. The sauce was really tangy and not overly sweet. I personally love vinegary stuff and the sauce sold me on this place. I should really go again sometime, or get something to go...

Went to San Diego to go to Comic-Con and was told this was the place to eat in all of San Diego. ÊWent Sunday afternoon at around 15:30. ÊLine was crazy long. ÊThere's a sign outside that states the wait is about 21 mins from that point. ÊThere were about 20-something more people after this point. ÊWow, I was amazed. ÊGot in line with my friend and the woman in front of me (a native of San Diego) told me this was normal. ÊOK, so we waited a bit when a leaving customer told us the secret was to go through the side and sit at the bar. ÊWell, she's right. ÊWe found two available seats right away and sat down. ÊMy friend ordered the BBQ Broham-the pulled pork sandwich with the cole saw and I ordered the Baby Back Rib & Chicken Dinner. ÊWe also got fries, potato salad and an order of onion rings to compliment all this. ÊDriving back to LA, we opted for the endless soda. ÊI did notice they had Arrogant Bastard beer on tap-a rarity. Ê Food came quick, we waited maybe 10m. ÊPortions weren't bad. ÊFor lunch, filling. ÊFor dinner, I would have ordered a little more. ÊMy friend's Broham was excellent. ÊSome of the best pulled pork I've ever had. ÊAnd I recommend you eat it with the coleslaw. ÊReally adds a lot of dimensions of flavor to the pork. ÊMy baby ribs were also excellent. ÊThey're served wet. ÊReally soft and flavorful. ÊNot the best I've ever had, the meat still had to be chewed off the bone but it was good. ÊMy chicken wasn't so much-very average. ÊSo were the fries, also very average. ÊThe potato salad was below average. ÊThe cuts of potato were big so that there wasn't a good balance between the potato and the salad part. ÊYou tasted more potatoes than anything else. ÊAnd the onion rings are quite possibly the biggest onion rings I've ever had. ÊRidiculously huge. ÊBut they also were just average. ÊSo while we found the sides pretty average, the ribs and the pulled pork were excellent. ÊI'd come back here next Comic-Con. ÊAnd upon leaving, the woman that was in front of us in the line? ÊShe was still standing there waiting for a table. ÊSo maybe a 3 1/2 star?

Negatives: 1. HUGE LINE = LONG LONG LONG WAIT. They have signs like at disneyland to tell you how long the wait is from that position. Sorry, no fastpasses. Positives: 1. Best BBQ I've ever tasted. This is some smoky, tangy, fall off the bone, finger licking goodness. I only tried the pork ribs, but they were AMAZING. 2. They give you a TON of food. You will leave with a bulging stomach and a doggie bag. 3. Huge amount of seating! If you got a big party, they let one person reserve one of the bigger tables until you reach the front of the line. 4. Hospitality is fabulous! Everyone is very friendly, they ask you if you need anything and start up conversations. These guys deserve a big tip. 5. Food comes out fast! Once you've stood in that 45+ min line, youre hungry! But about 10-15mins after you order, you're set to dig in! 6. There's a handwashing station and bibs. Good ribs = BIG MESS. You're bound to get all sticky and messy, but don't worry; they provide everything you need to leave clean and satisfied. 7. Cheap for the quantity and quality. When I go to somewhere like Lucille's I get less ribs for a much higher price. I was surprised it was so cheap at Phil's and tasted better too!

As popular as Phil's BBQ is it is still considered a San Diego hidden gem. The ones who haven't been to Phil's have at least heard how amazing the food is. It's to die for!!! I started going to Phil's BBQ when it was in Mission Hills which was very close to where I lived so I use to make a weekly appearence at least. Don't be intimated by the long line you'll see out the door because they have it down to a science to make things flow. My mouth just watered thinking about my usual order of Ribless dinner, Fries, & Mac Salad. AWESOME!!!

phil's...you did NOT disappoint. i have several friends that talk about this place nonstop. i was spending the day in san diego and told my bff that we needed to go to this bbq place...because apparently its the best. i'm not quite sure if its "the best" since i really don't eat bbq too often, but it definitely lived up to all the great reviews! we got there around 730 on a saturday... and to my surprise there was a line outside the door that was wrapped around the restaurant. it was kind of a bummer to have to wait in that line but i had a feeling it was probably going to be worth the wait because there were so many people. its a casual restaurant, they take your order at the front and buzz you when your food is ready. so the line went by pretty fast. we probably waited for around 25 minutes...not bad at all. i had a hard time deciding what to get because everything sounded SO good...but i finally settled with the quarter rib dinner w/ cole slaw and macaroni salad. Ê YUM!!!!!!! ribs were delicious. the sauce was a winner. i can't really describe it but its tangy, sweet and a bit spicy... it was delicious. sides were great as well. and we also shared an order of fries... reminded me of the fries they serve at islands. having kenny as our waiter was an added bonus! he was hilarious. made our experience at phil's really enjoyable! come here if you're ever in the area....this is definitely the bbq place to try!

The best BBQ place ever! everything on the menu is good from the ribs to the sandwiches and even the sides. One good tip before you go is to get a copy of the menu and order over the phone even if your eating there this can save you sometimes even up to an hour. The line to order is super busy all the time not to mention trying to find a table to sit and eat once you get your food. I suggest ordering a good 15 minutes before you arrive and just bypass the entire line of people still waiting to order!

My experience at Phil's: - Show up right at 11am when they open, and the line will already be around the corner, but will move fast. ÊShow up 15 minutes prior and you'll be in the front of that line. - The only other way to avoid the lines is to sit at the bar or call ahead and get your order to go. - Their bulk-order catering is awesome, a good choice if you're throwing a party. ÊIf you order their pulled pork and/or tri-tip sandwiches, everything comes separated and the meat and sauce come in styrofoam containers to keep the heat in (the containers are recyclable; just bring them back into the store when you're done). ÊThey'll even give you plates, napkins, utensils, and wet-naps if you want them. - Lines are long, parking sucks - Barbecue is really good and arguably the best in San Diego (although that's not saying much). ÊPulled pork (broham) sandwiches are the bomb, tri-tip (el toro) sandwiches are good but doesn't live up to the Man vs. Food hype. ÊThey serve their barbecue with more sauce than most barbecue purists would deem as acceptable. ÊIt's a good thing that I LOVE their delicious, tangy sauce.

Visiting San Diego with my family and decided we wanted some BBQ, after a search of Yelp came to Phil's. ÊWe arrived around 5 on a Thursday and the line was out the door, I would imagine there is going to be a line most of the time. We tried the pork ribs, beef ribs, tri-tip sandwich, chicken, onion rings and probably something else I can't remember. ÊThe meat was flavorful however they used too much BBQ sauce which over powered the meat flavor in our opinion. ÊOur favorite was probably the beef ribs, a lot of meat on them bones. ÊWhen you order they give you the choice of putting the sauce on the side so if you don't like it drenched may want to leave it off

No need to rave about the back ribs, beef ribs, mac/beans mixed together, onion rings, fries, etc. as everyone knows how exceptional the food is. But I do want to highlight how awesome it is that almost every time I've been here the last several years (both the new and old location), Phil himself is right in the mix making sure everyone and everything behind the counter is like clockwork (which it is) and everyone who's in BBQ heaven is indeed blissful. Which is just awesome and really sets the stage for an overall 5-star experience in taste and service. I love Phil's.

Come a couple of times and been disappointed both. ÊIt's pretty standard southern CA BBQ in my opinion. ÊI've had the Broham pulled pork sandwich and the beef ribs. ÊThe pulled pork was mediocre, not very flavorful and the texture was just okay (perfect in some areas, mealy in others) and thus the sandwich was forgettable. ÊThe beef ribs were disappointing as well, as the flavor wasn't that good and they weren't very tender. ÊThe first time I came I sluffed it off as being an aberration based on all the awesome review, but twice in a row and I'm pretty sure this really just isn't that great. ÊYou can drive around a couple of places in San Diego, let alone Southern CA (Smokin' Mos in Huntington Beach comes to mind) and get better BBQ.

Finally came back to Phil's for some BBQ. We had tried a couple of weeks ago but the line was just too long and we were starving so we left! We came here again on a Friday night around 9:30, and it was still about a 35-40 minute wait. The hostess asked us for our party number and when she heard it was 6, she helped us find a table right away! What great customer service -- I thought we had to find our own table which could have been a few more minutes of waiting. Anyway, I ordered the Baby Back Ribs Tickler for 7 bucks and this definitely was not a tickler, it was a full meal! It came with a few pieces of ribs, two onions rings, cole slaw and fries. There was so much fries that I barely finished half of it and I was full already. The BBQ sauce was just as good as I remembered it -- juicy and flavorful. The cole slaw was a little on the dry side but it was good nonetheless. The two onion rings that came with my meal were okay, I thought they were a little burnt but the BF seemed to enjoy it. He ordered a BBQ sandwich; he said his meat tasted bland but it was nothing their table seasonings couldn't fix. Our bill came out to be 20 dollars, including tip. There are a lot of waiters/waitresses walking around which I thought was convenient since there was just so many customers. P.S. I overheard a customer and hostess talking and she mentioned that Phil is at the restaurant every day. That shows a lot of heart and dedication!

Line was long for our Saturday visit. Despite the fact we were there at 10:45 am. The food and service were average at best. 5 in our group had Beef ribs, baby back ribs, burger, tri tip sandwich and pulled pork sandwich. We also had fries, onion rings, potato salad and BBQ beans. The best item were the onion rings but they were way to greasy to finish. The beef ribs were boiled in water without a doubt. Tender but the only flavor was the charred BBQ sauce. $85 is a fair price for a family of five. We will not return for another visit.

I love going through reviews on Yelp and I've been a member for.. not so long but I'm not sure why I never felt the urge to write reviews for other restaurants or places I've been to. ÊAfter Phil's BBQ and seeing the Yelp sticker on their window, I knew I had to write my first review on them! ÊPhil's was quite simply, very delicious and worth the wait! ÊI took my friend who was visiting SD for the day to Phil's on Saturday night. ÊIf you're super hungry or looking for a quick bite to eat, DON'T GO ON A SATURDAY NIGHT! ÊThe line was wrapped around the restaurant! ÊBut like I said, it was worth the wait. Ê The environment is nice with bright lights, clean, and spacious. ÊThe staff was extremely courteous, funny, and helpful. ÊWe ordered a quarter rack of baby back ribs (comes with one large side or two small sides), the pulled pork sandwich, and a small order of the onion rings. ÊThey have the biggest, greasiest, yummiest onion rings I've ever had in my life! ÊThe pulled pork sandwich was tender and drenched in bbq sauce. ÊThe baby back ribs... mmm... my favorite item of the night! ÊI will definitely come back again! ÊOh yeah, my bill was the grand total of $21 and something cents! ÊMy friend and I both got to bring home doggie bags that night. ÊHappy campers =)

i lived in kansas city for 4 years. Êkansas city knows bbq and it's nothing like the typical trash you find on the west coast. Êphil's does an admirable job of emulating the feel of a real midwest bbq place. Êthe atmosphere feels right. Êthe menu looks right. as to the food, it's pretty good. Êif all i'd ever eaten is garbage coastal bbq, it'd probably find it orgasmic. Êbut having eaten midwest bbq, i find it decent. Êit gets bonus points since it's the best you can get around here. be prepared to wait a long time if you plan on eating at the restaurant on a weekend for dinner. Êif you want to carry out, call it in.

The wait is totally not worth it. I was not willing to wait 2 hours and a half just for some bbq. Me and my friends decided to order it to go which breaks the time to a 10 min wait and eat it back home. But yo, the ribs are super super delicious. I ordered half a rack and i wished I ordered a full rack. One of my friends told me that eating at Phils BBQ, you have to experience the whole thing and the wait is part of the whole experience so maybe I should have waited, but regardless, the baby back ribs was awesome! next time ill bring my ipod or some cards to pass the time in line. =)

Accidentally got here 30 minutes before the place opened on a Sunday morning and I was sure glad we did. ÊBy 11am when they opened, the line went out back into the parking lot. ÊEven though we were like the 5th group in line and didn't even wait all that much, the long line raised my expectations for this place. ÊI must say that although the baby back ribs were pretty good, I've had much better elsewhere. ÊHeck, I know some people that can Q up their own ribs better than Phil's. ÊMaybe it's just that I like eating ribs standing in someone's backyard with a cold beer in the other hand, but Phil's was just okay for me. ÊThere's nothing unique about the food or worth spending more than 30 minutes to be seated.

I feel like I should write just a brief review, because if you don't know that Phil's is the best BBQ in San Diego, you haven't been listening. ÊNor have you even driven through Phil's neighborhood and smelled that heavenly sweet scent. Ê Not only is Phil's dine-in and take-out fabulous, their catering is equally wonderful. ÊI have had them cater several business lunches for my firm, and more times than not, Phil himself delivered the food. ÊThey are generous with their portions, prompt, and professional. Ê My only complaint about Phil's is that they are not going to reopen the original Mission Hills location. ÊI live in MH, and this was a huge disappointment.

this is my first time visiting the place i heard from many of my friends that this place was THE place to go for some realll good bbq, ,definitely had to check it out the place outside looks like some chilis or something, didn't expect too much at first, but then i noticed the long line theres going to be a long line, but don't fear.. its kind of like a food court set up where you're in line to buy the food, and then you sit anywhere pretty much the prices are pretty reasonable, line seemed long but waited about 15-20 mins - food was very tasty, i recommend the baby back ribs, meat was very good but they don't give enough bbq sauce - the sweet baked beans its alright, i got the large size but they didn't really give me that much, its nothing too amazing just pretty ok - the fries are pretty good, you can cover them in tabasco, malt vinegar, and ketchup overall the place is good, great atmosphere, and prepare to get a little messy, they give you bibs to help you keep clean :) o yeah since its not a restaurant you dont have to tip~

The best place for BBQ in San Diego! so far, I've only had the Beefy Rib Dinner & the Baby Back Ribs with Macaroni Salad. It is good. Only downfall is that this is the only location they got here, they should have at least 2-3 locations because the line outside goes around the entire restaurant about 1 mile long, I would recommend coming in early, right when they open to avoid the crowd. On our way out from dinner, I've seen people standing in line outside in the cold & the rain eating a bar of Kit Kat to hold them up until they get to the front of the line. Usually a 45 min-1 hour wait.

HOLY SMOKES! ÊThis place really cranks it out! ÊI kind of like the operation. ÊYou wait in a long line (good sign, but it moves pretty good) and order at the counter then Êreceive a pager. ÊOne of you goes and scouts out a table while the other(s) fill the drinks. ÊBy the time everyone is seated, the pager goes off and you go up to fetch your meat. ÊThe beef bones are HUGE and BEEFY (even though personally, I'm a baby back fan). ÊThe q really is pretty tasty and my only complaint is that the meat is drenched in the sauce. ÊThe sauce is decent with a sweet peppery vinegary kick, but seems a little on the commercial side. ÊIf I were to go back, I would order my meat dry so I could sauce it myself. ÊAll in all, pretty decent place with energetic positive vibe.

I had to write about a favorite restaurant as a writing exercise to jumpstart my brain for my graduate program, so instead of writing out a new review, I'm just going to copy it here... Anybody who lives in San Diego knows that the best place to get delicious barbeque is at Phil's BBQ in Point Loma. This restaurant is the perfect place to get some lip-smacking, finger-licking grilled foods at inexpensive prices. For less than twenty dollars, you can order a full rack of succulent pork or beef ribs, with a choice two side dishes such as corn on the cob, cole slaw, and fresh cut French fries. But the crowds of people do not come to Phil's just for a deal on their meal; they also come here for the famous sauce. Phil's sauce comes from a secret recipe which blends the best qualities of sweet, spicy, and tangy into a symphony of flavor, which combined with the natural flavors of the grilled meat make for a very memorable dining experience. The sauce has even won awards at prestigious barbeque competitions around the United States. So the next time you have a major craving for some serious barbeque, you cannot find a better place to go to satisfy your appetite than Phil's BBQ. Just in case you can't tell...I love this place!

I love the baby back ribs. Tender and juicy with the spectacular sauce. Fries are crispy and tasteful. Overall food taste was pleasant in my experience. The people there were very friendly with me, and even took the time to make small talk with me. Overall set up is a tad bit interesting. Bar separated from the actual dinning area. You have to find your own seat. The line wraps around the corner, with about a 20 minute wait on a Friday night. However, right before I left, the line died down and was barely out the door.

It is so very hard to find good BBQ, and I've looked. I've lived all around California and the only two places that I would classify as having "great" BBQ (well, technically grilled, but don't split hairs here) are Firestone's in SLO and Phil's. I seriously look forward to trips to Phil's like little kids look forward to trips to Disneyland. My friends and I plan them out and mark them on our calendar and count down the days. Nothing beats an extra big order of beef ribs, fries/onion rings/corn-on-the-cob, and a nice pitcher of Fat Tire or Red Trolley. It's the kind of meal you wake up in the middle of the night craving. When I'm out of town for any extended amount of time, it's the thing that brings me home, like some kind of meaty, grilled lighthouse. I don't know what kind of facts I can add that others haven't already mentioned. The line looks long but moves fast, but the bar is a good way to shortcut it -- you can grab any open seat without waiting in line, and order from the full menu. The line attendant is always great, though, and has the kind of personality that makes her seem like an old friend, even if it's the first time you've ever met her. The bussers are all friendly and attentive. Really, the worst part about going to Phil's is trying to decide what to order. Every time I tell myself I'm going to try something new, but inevitably I'm drawn back to those ribs because, really, how can anything possibly surpass them? Why mess with that?

Phil's has been my favorite BBQ joint since years ago when it was in Hillcrest....Best ribs in San diego, Onion Rings oh yeah baby!!! But has anyone tried his Sangria? ÊIt is the best I have ever tasted in a restaurant, I make my own at home and it is better, but Phil's is close. ÊLove ya Phil, baby, thanks for buying me and my friend a drink last time I was there.

We arrived at 5 pm thinking we would beat the dinner crowd. Almost. The sign outside that reads something to the effect "20 minutes and 49 seconds wait from this point" is about as true as it gets. Always crowded. I'm no BBQ aficionado, but I know what I like and I like Phil's chickless dinner, the ribs, and pulled pork sandwich, in addition to the sides and most importantly the bar. Yup, the watering hole has a killer selection of craft brews. The meat isn't as tender as places back in Birmingham or Atlanta, but it shines here on the left coast.

Get ready for a long line and longer wait. But if you want BBQ, this is the place. I usually call ahead and order p/u. The staff is so nice and friendly and helpful that it throws one off. You feel as if you're in another state... like Texas -friendly. All food is great and the service makes it better because it gets hetic and busy in there.

Every time we take a trip to San Diego we always stop by here. The lines get really long but the line moves pretty fast. I am a beef rib type of girl so that's always a part of my order. Since we don't live around the area every time I order I tend to order the whole menu. Everything is pretty good. I was surprise that there burger was sooo yummy also. The only thing I was not fond of was the El Toro sandwich.The BBQ sauce on there tasted different from what they put on the ribs so if you get the El Toro ask for the BBQ sauce on the side so you can try it before putting it on your sandwich. Other than that this place is a winner!

Okay....so usually Phil's BBQ is on my wish list of places to eat but everytime me and my boyfriend pass by this place, the line is around the building. ÊToday, though, being a weekday, we made the trip from Mission Valley and walked right into the place and up to counter and ordered. ÊWe both ordered the Beefy Rib dinners (3 Ribs - Two sides) and sat down and eagerly awaited the ribs we have had in the past - tender, moist meat that falls off the bone. ÊToday, however, that wasn't the case - even though it wasn't busy, our food took longer to get to us than on the busiest night we've been there. ÊAnd when it did finally get there, we were shocked to take our first bites into ribs that mostly were fat and gristle. ÊAlthough their delicious sauce disguised the meat for what it was, it was almost inedible for all the fat, gristle and tendons. Ê I can see getting a bad batch of ribs once in awhile but this was ridiculous. ÊIt shouldnt have been served. ÊHad we not been starving, we may have gotten up and left our side dishes too. Ê For $15, we expected more. Ê ÊFor $40 bucks, we could have went and had a good sushi lunch. Ê Well, I think Phil's is off my wish-list. Ê Maybe Phil's success will be it's demise - losing sight of what made it a good place to begin with. ÊIf you want good BBQ, without the hype and the line, pass on this place. UPDATE: My boyfriend's "ribs" went right through him - not-so-easy in, but very easy out.

My wife and I have been eating at Phil's BBQ since they first opened in Mission Hills and were still going to the new location. In fact we were there twice over the Fourth of July weekend. Their food is jammin the meat on the ribs pretty much fall off the bones. The sauce Phil's use is the best I have had in Sand Diego as a matter of fact the best BBQ in San Diego of all the places I have tried. There service is great even though their is waiting lines going out the door if you want to sit and eat there, but it can be worth it as many people will tell you. We like to call in for a take out so we don't have to wait. Enjoy

There may be better BBQ on the planet, but I don't know where it is. A few important things to know about Phil's 1) They are closed on Mondays, period. 2) They are closed in January so their employees can take a nice vacation (how cool is that for the employees?) 3) Weekends and evenings and any time there is some major event happening in San Diego like baseball or football games, and the place is packed. For that reason I recommend getting there early on a week night. Or, do what I do which is I phone in my order, pick it up and enjoy my Phil's in the comfort of my home. Note, if you phone the order in, you MUST take it out. They do not let phone orders eat in any longer. But eating in is worth it too. It is a great place to get together with a few friends and enjoy some good food. They have a bar too if you like alcohol with your BBQ. My personal favorite order is the full rack of baby-back pork ribs, fries and beans. Mmmmmmm-mmmmmm. Give it a try, you can't go wrong.

I went here on Memorial Day and the wait wasn't too long. I think we waited about 10-15 minutes to order. It was my first time going here so I was a bit surprised because it wasn't like the normal restaurant where you get seated and then order. Here you wait in line to order and then find your own seats. I love ribs so I got a whole stack and a "large" side dish. My "large" side dish was corn on the cob because they did not have mash potatoes. I took off a star because of the lack of mash potatoes. The corn was a little under-cooked too. The ribs here are delicious. They take reservations only if there's a lot of people. I heard the line is pretty long on the weekends.

OMG I can't wait to come back here for more! I'm not a big fan of ribs because most places don't know how to make it right. But Phil's know how to do it right. The baby back ribs are so tender and juicy just like how it should be! Plus their fantastic BBQ sauce is just off the hook. I tried some beefy ribs off my bf but I still like the pork one better. Their onion rings are such great compliments. They are homemade and oh-so good!! I love Phil's BBQ!!!

love the food here :) their potato salad is definitely my favorite side order! It goes well with their bbq, because it mellows out the tangy bbq flavor in your mouth with the creamy flavor. I just wish their bbq sauce was a bit more on the sweet side, instead of the VERY tangy bbq sauce, but i guess thats a preference issue. I always bring some leftovers home and sprinkle on some brown sugar on top...mmm then its absolute perfection. if you're planning to go on a weekend be willing to wait!! there will probably be a looong line wrapped around 3/4 of their building, but don't worry too much, even a line that long goes down in less than an hour. although it's mostly self serve here, the staff is very attentive and helpful.

The time: Sunday Night The location: Phils BBQ in San Diego! The line: only about 30 minutes! It was Sunday night, after spending the previous days at Comic-Con, I was exhausted. My friends wanted to get Phils BBQ, I was in San Diego hanging out with my cousin, but i was tired.....sooooo tired. But he said it's probably the best place in San Diego, and after a quick glance a yelp, I decided to try it out bracing myself for the 45 minute wait time that would undoubtedly be waiting for me. So I wash my face, and head out. When we were there, the line was wrapped around the restaurant a little past the "from this point, the wait time is only 21 minutes and 14second" and i laughed Êand breathed, "yeah right" to my cousin. But after meeting up with my two friends who were waiting in line already (score! but i think they just got there too, since we were nearly at the end of the line) and filling them in on what happened at the Con, it seemed like time was flying. [A side note: good friends, good conversations make time go by that much quicker] As we got in, I was surprised. It was a Carl's Jr-esque ordering system where you order, get a little beeper thing, have a seat, and wait for them to beep you to get your food. I don't know if this is a good thing or bad thing, I was just surprised. I was expecting to be waited on and such, ask what they recommended, etc etc. ÊHowever, the Carl's Jr ordering system worked to my favor. I was starving and tired - being waited on would have been much, much more time consuming. We ordered, sat down, and after a quick stop for some sweet tea at the soda machine, we were ready to go.. My cousin got the 3 bone beef rib meal, and I got the 7-8 bone baby back rib so we can share. As for sides, we got the french fries [GOOD], Sweet baked beans [I didn't enjoy this as much], and Corn on the Cob. I was disappointed with the corn, I was expecting a smoked/grilled corn, as It was a BBQ. It seemed like it was boiled, and quite mundane. But onto the meat - They used the same BBQ sauce for pork and beef, and I'm used to BBQ sauces that have some major HEAT to them, but it was mild, sweet, and tangy. They had a variety of hot sauces on the side at the table, but i generally don't like the flavor. I prefer it to be embedded in the BBQ sauce, either with crushed red pepper, chopped up habanero chili's, or something to spice it up - anything but hot sauce! For both pork and beef, the meat was tender and it was the "fall off the bone" you look for when you're doing ribs. As far as that goes, I have no complaints. It was delicious - 4 stars only because of the sides. I loveeee corn, and was looking forward to it and was sorely disappointed. Disappointment sucks. But my friend, Vicki V., said that the slaw side was AMAZING. I should have tried some, damn it. I don't eat ÊBBQ at a restaurant Êthat often, most of my BBQ excursions are through family BBQ's and vicariously through various food network shows. But I enjoyed the meats

When I moved here from the East Coast, I thought I would never again find decent BBQ. ÊI've had the best redneck BBQ in Florida. ÊI've had North Carolina-style, Texas-style, and Kansas City-style BBQ. ÊHeck, I even mail order Corky's ribs from Memphis via QVC. Then one magical day last year, I smelled BBQ while in the Target parking lot. Ê"Where's that coming from?" ÊI wonder. ÊThen, in December, I went with some co-workers there for lunch and at last, I discovered very good BBQ on the Left Coast. ÊThe rib tickler is a great deal and the meat is excellent. ÊI like the fries, the onion rings, and cole slaw but I'm not a picky person when it comes to sides. ÊThe meat is always the star anyway. The lines range from crazy to insane, so it's to your advantage to either eat at off-times or call in with your order and pick it up.

Decided to try the baby back ribs here. First couple of bites it was pretty good then it became way too sweet. Ribs were covered with so much sauce that I couldn't even taste the meat itself. Next time if I ever come back, I'd have the sauce on the side. Lines are long too..wait was about an hour.

I guess every city has one of these: a curiously mega-popular, stand-in-line-no-matter-how-long-it-is joint to which everybody in town flocks. ÊIn my experience, they invariably turn out to be over-hyped, over-exposed mediocrities that seem to be popular merely for being popular, and Phil's is no exception. I found myself in the area yesterday, and I just had to try the place that has four-and-a-half stars and 2,285 reviews (not even New York has any place with that many reviews). ÊI figured 4:00 in the afternoon was a good time to go to avoid the crowds. ÊSo I was surprised to find this barn-sized place nearly full even at that early hour, although luckily there wasn't much of a line (the line ended up outside the door by the time I sat down, so I guess I did come at a good time). I got the rib-less dinner, mostly so I wouldn't have to get my hands messy. ÊIt came with two sides (or one big side), so I got the "sweet baked beans" and the potato salad, two musts for me at any BBQ place. ÊI like that they tell you (both verbally and on the receipt) how long your food will take to come out, even though they were wrong (they said 15-20 minutes, but it was only about 5 minutes). When it arrived, the pork didn't look very appetizing. ÊAnd it wasn't. ÊIt was absolutely smothered in BBQ sauce. ÊIf you need to drench your meat in sauce, something is wrong. ÊAnd the sauce wasn't even very good. ÊIt was sweet and tangy, but far too rich and overpowering. Of course, the meat itself was a bit dry and tough, so there wasn't much to overpower. The sides weren't any better. ÊThe "sweet" baked beans had, yes, an underlying sweetness, but they also had a bitter flavor that wasn't pleasant at all. ÊAnd the potato salad didn't have much taste at all. I don't get the popularity. ÊI really don't.

Good food at good prices... the only drawback its the 1+ hr wait! The babyback ribs were very good but the sauce was too strong, which takes away from the flavor of the meat.

Phil's BBQ is by far one of the best! I give it 5-stars meaning, "Woohoo! As good as it gets!" This place is outstanding! They offer a ton of food, good beer selection, and amazing ribs! I always get a full rack with fries, and tend to order another half rack! It is definitely a place to eat when you feel like gorging! Be sure to wear stretchy waist pants here! Last time I was in, I spoke with Phil himself, and they are slowly looking at expanding. They had another restaurant, but decided to close it down for a possible remodel, when they opened this one up! They need to open one up in south OC! Great Ribs!!!!

What was I thinking ordering the chicken tickler my first time here? I should have ordered their ribs, but I wasn't that hungry and wanted something small and easy/quick to eat. The BBQ sauce that smothers the chicken is the perfect combo of sweet and tangy. I love how the french fries are both fat AND crispy! Usually, you'll get one or the other (fat and soggy or thin and crispy), but Phil's BBQ fries are the best of both worlds. Next time I'll try the ribs and be able to give a more comprehensive review!

I love, love, love Phil's BBQ! I am so glad they have opened the San Marcos location. I started going to Phil's back when they were in a tiny little place on Goldfinch. It was so hard to get a place to sit and enjoy my meal, but those days are long gone and thank goodness. I have recommended Phil's to many friends and family members and none of them have ever been disappointed. At work, we often make a "road trip" to the Sports Arena location for a special lunch. The service is outstanding and so quick. Keep up the good work!

I really don't know what the big deal is about this place. The ribs are good, but not great. I shared half a rack for 10 bucks and it was disappointingly small. 5 really small pieces for 10 bucks... and really weak sides. Got the potato salad and something else I forgot, but they were both bland and unappealing. The ribs are good, they fall off well, but I felt they should be a lot more tender for 20 bucks a rack. It I wasn't already stuffed from a tractor room lunch I would have left hungry, and I probably would have left hungry still with a full rack. The sides are just not worth getting, unless you get fries cuz they load that on like a mofo. Good bbq at steep prices to get yourself full.

yummy ribs. tender, slide right off that bone, moist. unfortunately they DROWN it in bbq sauce so maybe u should as for it on the side. ok so heres why it doesn't get the coveted 5 star.. so when u order a meal, u can get two small sides or one large side. i decided to get steam veggies, which only come as a large side. when i got it... dood there were so little!!! my friends all got coleslaw or fries or macaroni salad, and their plate was all full!! my veggies only accounted for the size of a small!!! i wasn't that happy, but i guess its ok cuz i wasn't that hungry. but i ended up eating all of it anyway. the prices are reasonable for the taste and portion. nice!

ÊDont go here is you are on a diet or going to be counting calories and looking for healthy. this is some good old fashion bbq! Try to know what you want before getting up to the register too.

This place is probably one of the yummiest bbq i've ever eaten, but I minus one start because their bbq sauce was really salty.

I've come here several times. ÊThe wait is always very long. ÊI prefer the baby back ribs to the beefy ribs, as in my opinion, they have more flavor, but you get more meat with the beefy ribs.

Always on the search to satisfy my insatiable appetite for roadkill... this place simply kicks ass! ÊWaited about 15 min to get in and get seated. ÊThe interior kinda reminded me of some places I've been to in New Orleans but anyways. ÊI've been to plenty of bbq joints in and out of Cali and I'm always plagued with this lingering feeling of "what if the bbq sucks?". ÊI admit I had the same feeling walking in and ordering. ÊBut once the food came out and I sank my canines into the meat, I knew that my mouth had won the lotto. ÊThe meat was very tender and the caramelized sauce looked perfect. ÊNot like some Texas joints where the meat looks as if it's been napalmed. ÊThis place definitely lives up to the hype. ÊI wish I could review the sides but I was too fixated on the ribs to notice. ÊI will definitely be going back sometime in the near future with some eager out of towners...

Driving from LA to San Diego, I kept thinking what would be a great BBQ place to eat at, to mark the end of summer? Luckily, I don't have to look further: across the street from our hotel was the famous (and packed) Phil's BBQ. How lucky we came right before dinner rush, and even then the line was long and getting ready to wrap around the corner. We ordered the Full Ribs (10-12 bones) and I thought they were too pricey at $18.99 (dinner price with 2 sides), but I have no regrets, it was so good! The ribs were so tender, once you sink your teeth on it everything just melts... The sauce is sweet and tangy with a little kick of heat, just perfect. ÊToo bad they have no brisket, but they have a full menu of sandwiches, chicken, and other extras. I have lived in Oklahoma and Texas, and let me tell you this place is it for BBQ. Can't wait to visit SD again soon!

An order here of ribs and sides is about $12-13 dollars, and their portions are HUGE. I actually finished all of my food, but would have been full with just eating about half of it. This place is crowded, the line almost wraps around one side of the restaurant, but it goes relatively quickly for how many people there are. You order and pay, and seat yourself (the staff seated us though). I would definitely come by again for my bbq fix or to show my friends from out of town around :)

It is a great place to go for watching sports with the guys, or to have a nice family dinner. But honestly, dont get me wrong i love all sorts of meat dishes, the wait here is a big turn off for this joint, and the ribs are sometimes overly burnt to mask the flavor of the meat. the food is good but not to the point of waiting 45 min to order, and then fighting to find a spot.

For CHRISTMAS my parents asked me to get them PHIL'S BBQ- and they live in ARIZONA! They wanted me to PICK IT UP and FREEZE IT and DRIVE IT 6 hours to them in Tucson! They even called up Phil's to get their holiday schedule. NO JOKE! The ribs are THAT GOOD!! The sides are delicious too- I recommend the macaroni salad and the onion donuts, I mean onion rings. I text my parents every time I go there- to make them jealous, maybe.. Or maybe just to let them know I'm getting some delicious BBQ! FYI- They are closed on Mondays and be ready to wait in a line... but besides that get your stretchy pants on and get ready to EAT!

This place got so may raves wit their whole web cam to check out the line and such that had to make it a stop on my list.The meat was tender and tasty. The service (i sat at the car) was good. For west coast, it was pretty decent bbq. The sauce could be sweeter and thicker. The beans more homemade. The macaroni salad was nice. Overall a good experience but i've had better.

Ok, we love us some Phil's. My last experience kind of put a damper on my opinion of the place, but here's why. For some reason, business has really been BOOMING for them--which is great. But I'm not really all up for standing in line for bbq for 45 minutes. My husband and I usually sit in the bar..the bar area has a big bar, and lots of seating around it. Now, when we went about a year ago, we found out via the bartender that if you sit AT the bar, you have to order your food from the bartender. Back in the day (like..2 years ago) you could only get drinks from the bartender, and still had to stand in the regular line for your food--the buzzer would go off, and you could bring your food back to the bar. So, we followed old procedure just to be scolded by the bartender. He said if you're sitting anywhere in the BAR AREA, you must now order your food from them. This was OK by us because this meant we by-passed the huge line, and got some tasty beer. Woohoo! Well, we chose Phil's (based on this new bar policy) to take our parents to for my "last meal" before having our baby boy (and I mean literally right BEFORE--the night before!). So, we secure a table in the bar area, get our order together and go to the bartender to place our order..only for him to tell us that we can't place our order with him unless we're sitting AT THE BAR. Really? Phil, make a rule and stick to it. So, my almost-10-month-pregnant self secured a seat at the bar. After I waited 10 minutes for the bartender to come over (another pity taking patron hollered at him for me) I placed an order for 5 people. The bartender actually had the nerve to ask me if I thought I was "above the rules" since I should be "standing in line" (this was after we'd been sitting at the table for 15 minutes.) I was INFURIATED. I just placed an order for $75 worth in food plus 4 beers..and he was asking me if I was above the rules? You know what, in this situation ÊYES because a) the "rules" of ordering in the bar are constantly changing (which I explained to him) and b) bartender, why the hell are you complaining? would you rather make a tip off of 4 beers, or 4 beers plus 5 meals? We haven't been back since, but since we're moving out of the area I assume the hubby will want to pay a visit. Also--the sauce they sell at costco--don't waste your money. Not as good as the sauce they put on their meals in the restaurant.

My favorite bbq place in all of san diego!I've tried everything they have to offer and it's all great. My usual order is a ribless(chunks of boneless pork smoked and sauced to perfection) fries and beans. But sometimes I like to mix it upand get an El Toro sandwich(tri tip smoked and sliced with sauce) with potatoe salad(sour cream based) and onion rings. I love this place so much I had my hometown reception here at their event center. Their staff was excellent. The venue was great and the food was just as amazing as it is in the restuarant.

I would give 3 and a half stars if I could because this place isn't just A-OK place. It is better than that. BUT, I must say it isn't THAT good either. I tried this place with a friend of mine a couple of days ago just to see if all these ridiculously good reviews were right. The verdict is...........my friend and I both said.......... "it's good, but it's not THAT good". But this place definitely deserves more than 3 star so I give 3 and a half. Like mane reviewers say, "GET THERE EARLY" because you will end up waiting on line for sure. Oh, I almost forgot to add: their coleslaw is TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YUCK.

Phil's BBQ is probably as good as it gets in San Diego. As everyone has already indicated, the wait time can extend to an hour and a half depending on the crowd. Their markers (e.g. "45 minutes from this sign") are fairly accurate and probably have something to do with their live cam feed online. It's no doubt that Phil's has done their homework. Onto the food! Phil's BBQ focuses more on the sauce-based BBQ marination process than the dry-rub. Their baby back ribs are quite tasty and their beef ribs are definitely worth the four bucks a rib price. I ended up grabbing the Baby Back Ribs & Chicken combination (4 bones and 1/4 chicken BBQ'd) since I couldn't decide which BBQ item to try out and ordered several beef ribs on the side. In my opinion, both the baby back and the beef ribs had a good amount of flavor and both were tender (meat falling of the bone effect). Beef ribs, for obvious thickness and size reasons, provide more filling than the baby back ribs. The carby sides are normal. The corn is rather tasty and the fried delights (fresh cut fries) are always pleasing. The sweet baked beans provide extra filling and the macaroni salad is on par. Service and Ordering. After ordering and paying for your food at the register, a waiter/waitress will direct you to an open table. There's no need to share tables at this location. There are actually two sections of the restaurant; one of which is the bar and the other being the restaurant. The bar side still has a couple booths for seating, so it's not a pure "bar" on the bar side. Service is pretty on par and exudes a bit of Southern hospitality, which probably depends on your service person. Brilliant Ideas. The one that stuck out was the placement of large sinks in the back area of the of the main restaurant commons. Plenty of soap, water, and paper towels to wipe off the BBQ goodness off of your hands and face. This allows the restaurant restroom doors and utilities to be a lot cleaner than say... Boiling Crab. Things I wish they had... Macaroni and Cheese, sweet potato fries, sweet tea, dry rub BBQ beef ribs. I've had my share Texas and Southern BBQ and have lived out there for years, so the taste buds have been exposed to too much BBQ goodness. Would I go back to Phil's? Of course I would. I would even go with a random group of strangers just to get my BBQ fix.

ÊThe city's not known for its BBQ, and I've never been to a place like Kansas City where it might indeed surpass Phil's; but so far it's the best I've ever had. Getting there is like getting into a Disneyland ride. ÊAs you walk in, you look up and there's a sign saying "21 minutes from this point on." ÊThe sign is unchangeable, and there was no line, so big breath of relief. Inside, a lady sits in front of two lines (one a pick-up to go and the other eat-in), asks you how many, and points you to a register. Ê"Did I SAY you could cross the line?" she asks, pointing to the line in the cement floor. Ê"No. ÊNow go." I was grateful to her, as otherwise people would have been stuck in one spot, drooling, unaware of the open registers. I got the pulled pork with coleslaw and hubby got basically roast beef, forgot the name. ÊWe each ordered a small fry, which is HUGE and filled up two plates. Ê At the next table, a man with his buddy got his ribs and they gleefully shouted, "Holy S&^!" like two teenagers, confronted with the mounds of meat. ÊJoy prevailed all over the restaurant as everyone stuffed their gullets. I loved my generous pulled pork slathered in tangy BBQ sauce with the crunch and cream of the coleslaw underneath; hubby loved his beef; we didn't even think to share or sample the others'. The buns were perfect. ÊNot greasy, not too filling (it would distract from the meat!) ÊI also got beans, which were piping hot and had a hint of smoke.Service was quick (we went at 1; there's a huge line earlier). ÊPaper towel rolls are at each table; wet naps provided. ÊAwesome.

This place is great. ÊI would murder someone for a 3 Rib dinner. ÊOnce inside Phil's, I eat like a prisoner huddled over my food. ÊI don't want anyone taking my food. ÊI stabbed my brother with a fork for trying to "share" with me. Minus one star for no smoke.

Lawdy lawd! ÊSorry, Everett and Jones and Lucille's, but you guys have been dethroned. ÊThe beef ribs here are big and flavorful. ÊThe meat just falls off the bone. ÊThe bbq sauce has that homemade tang unlike a lot of other bbq joints that tweak a bottled sauce to make it their own. ÊThe baked beans are pretty decent, too. ÊA must when you're in SD.

The BBQ was freakin' awesome! ÊI ordered the baby back ribs and they were fall-off-the-bone saucy goodness on a plate! ÊNot only was the BBQ some of the best I have had, but the sides were equally savory. ÊThe cole slaw was awesome, the onion rings were awesome, and the macaroni salad was awesome. ÊThe entire meal was awesome. ÊThe only reason I am not giving Phil's 5-stars is because of how long I had to wait. ÊI hate waiting, but for Phil's, it might just be worth it!

AMAZING! I got here to meet up with family and the line was already out the door at 4:30. So you get in line with your party and order once you get to the front. See the thing about this place is you are bound to have a great time and want to come back for more within the next two weeks. We did not have to wait for a long time at all. It took about 10-15 minutes, if that. Everyone working there had such great attitudes. You can call in and get your order to be picked up so you don't have to wait in the long time since around 6-6:30 it's wrapped around the building and would take about 40+ minutes or something...never happened to me but I'm thinking it would take about that long. ( don't quote me on that) I'd suggest going here if you want to experience great BBQ and a lot of it. The prices are not bad, it shows in the amount of food you get, trust me on that. Go here and have a great time, just get there around 4 so there won't be a long line. Enjoy :)

A great place for BBQ ! The portions are rather large and I usually split a sandwich with my boyfriend. If it is your first time going you should be smart in choosing the time you decide to go because the line can wrap around the building. Lunch is usually when I go, mostly because who wants to wait in line for 30- 40 mins to order then another 10 to get your food. But all in all the menu is very tasty and I haven't been disappointed by the food, just the line.

Definitely a place to visit if you live in San Diego and have craving for ribs. Very modest pricing for ribs. Ribs are nicely cooked. Baby ribs for softer meat, however, I prefer regular beef ribs for the earthy beef taste. Plenty of food on the plate, several sides to choose from. Very American place. It could be a good idea to give them a call and ask for food to go, cause they ALWAYS have a line outside.

Very good BBQ. ÊI had the chicken/pork rib combo and the ribs are definitely better than chicken. ÊTheir pork rib is very tender and flavourful. ÊThe chicken, on the other hand, is a bit dry. Êso if I go back I will probably go with just the pork rib dinner. ÊPortion is very good for the price also, especially the french fries side.

i think that it's genius to have a little spot just to wash your hands without having to step inside a restroom. as a germaphobe, i found it wonderfully terrific to see an automatic faucet and an automatic paper towel dispenser waiting for me to abuse it right before i attacked phil's ribs. i went here in august '05 and i've been craving for ribs ever since. i thought sizzler could help me satisfy my needs...what in the hell was i thinking to even consider sizzler? anyway, i wish that i never washed my hands after my meal so i could keep the smell of phil's ribs with me where ever i go.

this place is HELLA good. now that i'm back in the bay... i miss phil's. yes, it's worth the wait. even better... call in and wait the time at your place, then go in. i love their bbq chicken and pork riblet thingies. i think i would die of a heart attack if i ate this over and over... but it'd be worth it. Êtheir sauce is sweet and spicy. mmmm. i'm drooling thinking about it. let's put it this way. my boyfriend had the worst day of his life at work. so i surprised him with phil's take out... and i am now (and will always be) the best girlfriend ever... and he forgot about all of his problems. phil's just does that. it's like a drug. another time i went i played dominoes with my friends. best thing about that? we had at least four double 6's in our set. the dominoes didn't match up and it made the game that much more fun. and messy. nothing like bbq sauce all over your pieces. sooo good. phil's is hella good. ps. i like my vegetables steamed well... so that they aren't super cruncy. their vegetables are crunchy. just a little disclaimer for people as picky as i am.

Phil's BBQ has delicious ribs. I usually just order the 3 Rib Tickler (Comes with 3 pork ribs, coleslaw, French fries, and two onion rings) and I can barely finish that. The Beef ribs are gigantic - usually my friend can eat one of them and then she gets full, but I know plenty of people who can usually down 5-6. The wait is usually pretty long and the line extends around the actual building, but sometimes waiters come out with free samples to keep the customer's from grumbling. Plus, the anticipation makes the food taste even better :) It's a very relaxed environment...+ delicious food + nice servers. I would definitely recommend going here if you're ever in San Diego!

It's been said that you shouldn't take a date to eat barbeque ribs. For Phil's, I think I'd make an exception. A date is just another excuse to eat at Phil's and any reason to eat there is a good one. The ribs, both pork and beef, are better than any I've had. They're tender, juicy, savory, and just a bit spicy. The food is messy, for sure, so I can't help but feel just a bit barbaric tearing into them with my hands and teeth. Adding to the feeling is the fact that the full rack of beef ribs looks like it might have come straight from the opening of The Flintstones. As the wait can be upwards of an hour from the time you order on a busy night, my advice is to call in the order before you arrive.

Phil's menu is full of good choices. For your first time try one of the ticklers: Ribs, coleslaw, onion rings and fries. Other good choices are El Toro (sliced tri-tip sandwich) or BBQ Broham (pulled pork sandwich). If you phone the order to go you can eat in the comfort of your home/hotel and avoid the line.

I looooooooove the smell of bbq as you park your car and walk towards phil's. ÊI would have to say it's one of my favorite smells. ÊDefinitely get the rib tickler....ribs, slaw (which I never ate until I tried it here), fries and onion rings. ÊI prefer the ribs because the chicken is a bit dry. ÊI love the way the meat just falls off the bone and I can't get enough of the sauce! ÊI've also tried the potato salad (red potatoes & dill) and the macaroni salad- both are pretty good, but I rarely get them. ÊI keep going back to the heart attack and a half tickler. ÊGo when it first opens or around 4pm and you won't get any crowd!

When you see a line that wraps around the building, then it's a good f'ing place. I love bbq...period. I search for the best in CA, though I haven't been fortunate enough to visit Texas or St. Louis yet. Memphis nearly made me nut in my pants because it was sooo good. Anyway back to Phil's, we ordered the baby backs, beef ribs, onion rings, 1/2 chicken, fries and the bbq broham - pulled pork on a bed of coleslaw topped with bbq sauce. Tender and smokey, they definitely pay homage to bbq. The sauce is sweet and tangy and you can order it on the side. The onions rings are beer battered and along with the fries, I suspect they're fried in peanut oil. What impressed me the most was the beef ribs. I usually order baby backs, but I got to say, it's gonna be hard to find a better beef rib. Meaty, tender, not overly smoked or sauced, it's one of the best I've had.

I'm not mad at Phil's. ÊI have to admit a fondness for the meat-sicles aka ribs that just fall off the bone. ÊSauce is a lovely combination of sweet and tangy with a bit of a kick. ÊChicken is good - my dad even preferred it over the ribs (go figure - he's a chicken guy). ÊBoth Toro and Broham sandys are delish (I get the slaw on the side, but that's just me). ÊLove the onion rings, beans, even the corn on the cob is cooked so that it doesn't get stuck in your teeth. ÊIf you can avoid the peak bone-suckin' hours, you'll find your wait not as long it has been made out to be.

This is what I propose...in 10 years we all file a class action law-suit against Phil's BBQ kind of like those fat kids sued McDonald's for making them fat and they lives shorter.

Who ever said that this place sprinkles its food with crack is probably right. Just kidding. This place is freaking great.

when there's a line... i must try. the baby back ribs here are fantastic and i'm not that big on bbq! the meat just falls off the bone and it's nice and tender... not dry. i was warned that the sauce might be too much... like after awhile the sweetness of the sauce would get to me. however they put the right amount on my rack so didn't phase me... i ate the whole thing with no complaints. i was craving good mac n' cheese but they only had mac salad. so instead i got the baked potato and corn. i didn't like the baked potato that much. the cheese was a slice of american and i like shredded cheddar on it. the corn was good... i mean... how can you mess up on corn? my cousin ordered onion rings for the table (thanks buddy)... which are a must have. service was great... food came out quick... they had fanta orange... good stuff.

having recently been to my baby brother's graduation ceremonies from UCSD, i have to say that the hardest part of the whole ordeal is the logistics. there is mom, dad, me (the sister), auntie, and grandma. Êwhere do we sleep? where do we park? where do we sit? where do we find james (the brother and the grad)? and most importantly, WHERE DO WE EAT? phil's has got this logistics thing DOWN. step 1: you wait in line (could be a long time, prepare yourself) step 2: you order your foodz (baby back rib dinner please. with corn and fries. THANKS!) step 3: you find yourself a table (which is almost never a problem) step 3a: if there is a problem, there are wonder people who work at phil's that will help you look for a table! step 3b: if you know you have a large party (10+), you can send a representative up to the front of the line to tell the host/hostess because they will hook you up with a prepared table! step 4: put on a bib, roll up your sleeves, and get ready for some finger-lickin' good! they certainly know how to cook bbq and how to get this bbq to you in a timely and orderly manner. if you don't find this bbq delicious then YOU SHUT YOUR MOUTH WHEN YOU'RE TALKIN' TO ME.

The staff at Phils looks like they want to die. They lack communication between one another and have no idea what is going on. They tell you "Sit anywhere you can find a seat". We went to a table then another girl said "Oh! This table is for a larger group!, you can go sit inside or somewhere else". Seriously after an hour of waiting!!! They should retrain their staff on customer service skills. Not one person seemed happy to be working here. I would recommend McDonalds before this place!

My friend and her boyfriend came down from the Bay Area and I have heard so many good things about this place that I decided that we should try Phil's together. My boyfriend and I have been wanting to try this place for awhile but have always been discouraged due to the length of the line. Anyway, we arrived to Phil's around 7:30PM on a Friday night, the line was fairly long, it took us about an hour till we finally were able to order our food. It's a seat-yourself-after-you-order type of place. Good thing there were plenty of places to sit so it wasn't too bad. The wait for the food wasn't too long so that was good. I ended up ordering the El Toro which is a tri-tip sandwich and a small side of onion rings. My boyfriend got half Beefy Ribs and half chicken, while my friend and her boyfriend got the baby back rib dinner. The El Toro, it was good, but it wasn't what I expected. I was hoping for something sweeter, but it was more tangy and had a kick. I'm not a huge fan of spicy food D: Good portion though. Anyway, the onion rings were really good, and HUGE! I loved the batter! I tried a piece of my boyfriend's chicken and rib. LOVED LOVED LOVED the chicken! It was so tender and bursting with flavor! The rib was pretty good too, but definitely didn't leave me with the same reaction as the chicken. For the half beefy rib and half chicken, it's like $12.45 which is an amazing deal! My boyfriend was full off of one beefy rib (they're huge) and the chicken. My friends enjoyed their meal as well. The workers are super nice too! I would definitely come back, my boyfriend and I made it a point to come around 9:30PM on Fridays (when they close at 11PM) since the line isn't long, there is a lot of parking, and plenty of places to sit [: I also forgot to mention that they were giving out free samples of their fries while standing in line.

Okay ! This is the most famous place in San Diego for sure ! There is always line everyday on weekdays and weekends. But the line move fast so the line is actually not that bad. The ribs here is good, no doubt about it! But it was not that special either. I think as this place is so famous and many people raving about it, everyone think that it is verrryy good. But, !! I think the ribs here is not that extraordinary. Don't get me wrong, it is good but it is not the best ribs I would say. I have been visiting here everytime I have friends coming to town and they all say it is good, but it was not that worthy of praise. I kinda agree that the food here is good but what makes it very good is because its popularity. But as for the taste of the food itself, it was not that extraodinary. But definitely try it as it still offers good ribs, the baby back though, the beef ribs is not that good. Tony Romas has better beef ribs! and the onion ringss ! It wassss goodd,,, :D

If you haven't been to Phils - you should probably go. Its the best. The chickless chicken is my favorite - white meat of chicken cut up with BBQ sauce. The service is great - even when the line is LONG. Suggest going on a week day in the afternoon if you can. Otherwise - man up and wait in line, its worth it!

Went here the other day. The wait is always long and while waiting in line, we learned that phils serves something ridiculous like 2500 people on weekdays and like 5000 people on weekend up to like 5600 on sunday (these numbers are approximates from the ridiculousness that i vaguely remember hearing) BUT THAT'S INCREDIBLE. The reason they serve so many hungry san diegans is that their ribs are really the best. They're meaty and juicy and tender! Their macaroni salad is the best side dish and their pulled pork sandwich is good too! To bypass the line, call in and take your yummy ribs home! They have large tables for groups but you might have to wait for them.

I come here every single time that I have visited San Diego. Great barbecue food...ribs with juicy meat that literally slides off the bone...loaded with sauce and you can always ask for more! All the meat sits on top of some yummy fries which are just as good as the meat! You have to try the colossal onion rings...crunchy with a different type of batter. Finger licking good...don't bother grabbing forks and knives. Lots of options on the menu plus sides. Service has been great...someone always greets you at the beginning of the line and directs you to order so it's not hectic even when it gets busy. (There can be a long line! So decide to go early or call in your order to go...) might be hard to find a table if you are going during busy hours...especially with s big group, but so far no trouble for me!! YUM!

5 stars for the staff! Ê bf and i drove down to sd from long beach one friday night just to have an adventure and get some (what we heard is) great bbq. Êside note: our friend was absolutely correct. Ê anywho...bf called the place to see what time they closed..let em know we were coming from lb. Êwhen we arrived, my bf mentioned we'd traveled a while just for this bbq and the guy taking care of us at the counter asked if we were the couple from lb. Êwe're famous. Êwe got drinks and a few extra rings on the house. ÊTHANK YOU! now...we ordered a literal metric ton of food for the two of us cuz we were like "how often do we make it out to sd, and anyway we drove an hour and a half, let's make this worth it." Êboy WAS IT!!!! Êthis place is amazing. Ê phil's is clean, tastey and the staff is outstanding. Êwe shall return again and again...even if it's just for a saturday afternoon adventure cuz we've got a rumbly in our tumblys.

One word: YUM!!! This is my favorite BBQ restaurant, hands down. I lived in San Diego for a year, and always tried to hit up Phil's whenever I saw the line wasn't wrapped around the back of the restaurant. Not only is every single item on this menu delicious, the service is amazing. The staff are super friendly and all seem very proud to work for this company. I only wish they had a location in Orange County, where I currently live.

Oh those ribs! ÊFantastic rub followed by the almost perfect sauce. ÊNice balance of sweet and vinegar. ÊFall off the bone but not mushy or too loose. ÊThe only short fall is the lack of smoke. ÊRe heated on a grill adds nice grilled flavor but dried out some parts. ÊPass on the beans, just wrong texture and lacking in taste. ÊNot worth the 2hr plus wait that seems to be a daily occurrence.

As you can tell, everybody says this place is great. So I'm not going to waste your time and I'm cutting to the chase: We had baby back ribs, onion rings (large size), macaroni salad, and el toro sandwich. There's nothing more you need. Though, I heard that some people really enjoy full beef ribs or something like that. I will try next time and report back. But you must get ONION RINGS and the EL TORO SANDWICH. They're good, and relatively inexpensive. It's like.. $7 for each, but the portions are quite large and always super tasty. Bon Appetit! ps, expect long lines. it's always busy. however, it's part of the experience as you talk with friends, family, or make new friends! no wait for bar though!

I don't know what the craze is, its pretty good but ppl make it out to be the best ribs out there. ÊI have to take off a star b/c the line is usually crazy lines.

When the line is all the way around the building, that's a sign the food is great. ÊFor those who love BBQ like myself, I can't stop raving about this place. ÊThe portions are great for big eaters. ÊThe food quality is very tasty. ÊThe beef BBQ ribs are my fave--the meat just comes right off the bone and not full of fat like some rib places. Ê ÊFood has always been consistently fresh and hot.

My best friend drove from the bay to visit me and one of the things he wanted to do was eat at Phil's. Keep in mind that I live about a hour from LA, where we could have easily picked a spot there. Better yet, we could have ventured a little further to Orange County but none of those places could replace his dying wish to go to Phil's. So off we went, which was a 2+ hour drive. When we got there, the line wrapped around the building so I had an general idea about this place, meaning it must be pretty damn good. My best friend told me Phil's had the best ribs and onion ring he has ever had in his life. What did I think? It was great. The meat had a nice smokey flavor to it. Omg the meat was so good, it literally fell off the bone. The dinners come with two small sides or one large size so I picked the fries and macaroni salad. My best friend had the ribs, potato salad, and baked beans with a side order of onion rings. We both thought we could finish our meals in one sitting but we were sorely defeated by the meal. The portion was big, the staff was wonderfully nice and funny, and the meal was great! Great choice, bff.

This review isn't necessary, but I will write a short one anyways. Phil's is probably the best BBQ place I've had. I LOVE the beef ribs as well as the macaroni salad. The sauce is like an addictive drug. I've had Phil's at the location as well as delivered from my friend and eaten a couple hours later. Both times were amazingly delicious. This place deserves all the hype.

My low star rating is based solely on my experience as a vegetarian. ÊWhy would a vegetarian go to a BBQ place? ÊBecause, sometimes we are dragged there with meat-eating friends. ÊVegetarian choices are limited to a salad or the BBQ veggie burger. ÊFrom the two, go with the veggie burger - but they will charge you extra if you want lettuce & tomato! ÊAnd it is way over-priced for a bun with a veggie patty and bbq sauce (seriously, that is all you get). ÊI'll admit, the bbq sauce is good, and the onion rings were awesome too. ÊBut, for a vegetarian, the long lines are not at all worth it - I suggest you eat before you go!

3.5 stars I'm being generous today. Really, I think Khann and I freaked out about the line for nothing. I don't know what time I got in line but I know it was around noon and I was sitting down with my order within 15 minutes. Granted, going to a barbeque joint on a Sunday afternoon isn't gonna bring out much of a crowd, but I expected the worst. I was surprised. The line moved fast. I got a chance to check out some of the NFL scores on the various televisions throughout the restaurant. It was 38-0 New England over Arizona in what looked like a white field in Foxborough. As I moved further into the line, I saw that the Chargers were playing Tampa Bay. Weird, given the fact that I remembered the DirecTV menu listed the game as the Sunday night game. Must have been flexed, I thought. So I placed my order and tried to find a place to sit down and watch the game on the televisions around the eating area. I gotta say this: I don't like the cafeteria-style seating arrangement, where you have to look for seating. For a guy like me who's going into the place alone, I wouldn't be able to find a place to sit down. It was crowded. I guess the caveat I'd tell people about this place is to bring a minimum of two people. When I came in, the Buccaneers had just scored on a big pass play to Antonio Bryant to make it 24-20 in the third quarter. The defense made big play after big play after that deflating play. Allowed the offense to get the team back into the game on the road. Philip Rivers threw a touchdown to Antonio Gates and the place exploded. 27-24. At least the place is in tune with the game. After the TD, a PA announcement of "Touchdown" came out over the loudspeakers. I found a table in the back of the restaurant that was empty. I would find out later that it was part of two tables that the employees use during their lunch break. Now, here's my question: No sign anywhere said that the tables were off-limits. If those were employee tables, why not completely seal that area off and make another exit to the tables outside the restaurant (which I never considered because I wanted to watch the game)? It's friggin' stupid. I ordered a Chick-less dinner, fries, and potato salad. Small stuff. To be truthful, the place doesn't have much in terms of variety in their menu. It's not a place to drag a vegan to either. Fries weren't oversalted, which is good. Potato salad is tasty, but nothing too spectacular. The chick-less dinner was bathed in the sauce, which I didn't like. Good portions given the price. So then they drive down for another big touchdown off a screen pass to Darren Sproles after yet another outstanding defensive stand. They sealed it with a pickoff of Jeff Garcia, tipping a pass to Antoine Cason for a sealing TD. So I finish my meal and go to toss the plate when an employee tells me that the area I sat in was for employees. Well. Thanks for telling me! Honestly, that soured a pretty good experience with the crowd (and some of the employees) being really into the Chargers game. And to top things off, I went on the day before they close for the holidays and don't re-open until January. Safe to say I won't go there for a while, at least making sure that I have another person coming with me to eat there.

There must be something about a place when there is a line wrapped around the building just to get in. ÊThe wait actually wasn't bad and we were in good company. ÊThis is not a sit down restaurant, you go up and order and the staff will help you to find a table. ÊMost tables sit only 4 people. ÊThe beef ribs were huge and I loved the taste of the bbq on it with the smokiness. ÊThe best part was the clossal onion rings. ÊHonestly the best onion rings I ever had. ÊThe onion was sweet and the batter was amazing. ÊA little greasy but it's a small price to pay. ÊTheir coleslaw was good as well.

Recommended by a friend from San Diego to try this place out. On its website, it says it's closed at 10pm, but I placed an order for to-go around 9:30. The pickup time was minutes before the restaurant closed, so I expected that there would be less people. Instead, the restaurant was full of people. Picked up the to-go order and it was still hot and fresh when I drove back to the hotel which was about 5-10 minutes away. The ribs were flavorful, comparing to other ribs that I have tried before where it's dry. My brother loves it so much he had ribs from Phil's BBQ twice in a row and he wanted more the following day.

SO GOOD. There was a lot of hype prior to my visit, but I can gladly report that it met my expectations. Prices weren't bad either. I enjoyed the baby back rib tickler that came with 3 bones, 2 HUGE onion rings, a mountain of fries and slaw for $6.45. The meat melted off the bones and the sauce was delicious. I wish I was more hungry so I could have ordered a half rack instead. Came on a Saturday night, and the line is deceivingly intimidating, but they have a helpful sign that tells you how long the wait is from where you are standing. I would make sure to prepare for a good 20-30 minute wait. I also like the order at the counter system. Makes it easier for huge groups so you don't have to haggle with splitting the bill. I will definitely come back!

This place is insane - insanely busy. We came in the early evening on a weekend and the line went around the corner that has that made up (?) sign that says from this point it's 21 min and 42 sec till you get to order. Anyways I think the line almost made it to the other corner. Anyways we decided to just call in our order and wait 15 minutes instead of in that long line. 15 minutes later, we still had to wait in a little bit of a line to pay and then it took like 10 minutes to bag the order. They say they don't place and pack your food till after you pay so that it's more "fresh." They even gave us one of those pagers to let you know after you've paid that you can pick up your food at the counter. And there's a sign that you can't eat take-out at the restaurant but I'm sure tons of people still do it. If you do eat there, the deal is you order and I think they give number so that you food can be delivered. Then you go find a table. There's a no saving tables policy so I really hope they enforce that. But from the reviews, I don't think people have too much trouble finding seats after they order. Before we left, we picked up plastic bibs, utensils, napkins, and condiments. It's a nice spread. So we got the chicken and ribs combo. It came with your choice of beef or baby back ribs, a quarter of a chicken or chickless, which are like grilled chicken nuggets, and 2 small sides or a large side. Since there were 2 of us, we got try one of everything. For the sides we opted for french fries, macaroni salad, and potato salad. I think I liked the baby back ribs over the beef. You get a larger portion of beef ribs but the baby backs absorb the sauce better and is more tender and smokier in flavor. Either way, it still works out to a quarter of a slab. The chicken is chicken. The nuggets are a little dry. But in terms of quantity, it's about the same. Both the macaroni and potato salads were a bit plain. And when they say small sides, it's like a shallow plate the size of your palm. The french fries were gross. A word of advice, don't get them to go because they will become soggy and inedible by the time you get home. I was disappointed because my friend had said they were fantastic when she had them at the restaurant before. Each combo set us back like 12 bucks but that's a good deal for all that food. Not the best BBQ restaurant ever but still pretty decent. Now if only they could get rid of the ridiculous line, I would be more of a regular customer.

You know whats one of the things that suck when you make ribs yourself or order it at a sit down restaurant: the wait. Well at Phil's, all you have to do is wait in line, order, and the food comes out in about 5 minutes. The baby back ribs are juicy, fall of the bone tender, and covered in BBQ sauce and have a great pork flavor throughout, but it's not charred, which I like my bbq to be like. The prices are average. I think the sides are great also. You get fresh corn if your order corn. Other sides, I've had are the onion rings, potato salad, and baked potato. I heard the line can wrap around the building, but I've never had to wait that long. No alcohol in the general restaurant, just in the small bar area.

3.5 stars Not a hater of Phil's.. I know it's like, one of those places you HAVE to bring your visiting friends or any other tourists, but I think it's only aiiitee. Prices are pretty reasonable for what you get, considering it is all meat. The thing is that the prices have dropped within the past year or so since they've changed the quality of the meat (it's no longer as slide-off-the-bone as before). I love that they slather sauce all over it... as some people may not be fans of that, but I am. But one thing I think they do amazingly well is the smokiness of the beefy ribs and pulled pork sandwich. My complaints about the place are the insane lines on weekends, but they recently put a webcam on their website so you can check how long the line is before you leave... or you also have the option of placing a phone order before you get there so you don't have to wait in line. Also, last time we came in a group of 15 for the boy's going away party. They were pretty good at accommodating such a large party, but the thing that sucked is that the food trickled out. The pagers for two of us never went off, even while everyone else got their food. We probably waited about 15 min (assuming that they were busy and were just working on cranking it out), but then when we finally went to ask about it, my friend's had been ready for nearly 20 min, but the pager was broken. As for mine, my order wasn't even showing up in the computer, and they asked to see my receipt. After all that trouble and long wait for us, the only thing that they said was "Sorry, here you go". I was a little disappointed, as it would've been nice if they'd even thrown in a side as a sorry, but I guess they don't roll that way here, which is fine too. Their good food makes up for it. Other than that, if you're into consistently good barbeque, this is the place to go. Just make sure you're ready to wait!

I like how Phil's has its menu posted several places outside the building, like it's expected that you'll be waiting in line for their food. But I have to admit, them baby back ribs were tender, flavorful, falling off the bone and barbequed perfectly. It was worth the wait.

Went here for the first time yesterday as my visit was much overdue. The line wasn't too bad. Didn't realize you have to order at a counter, find your own seating and then pick up your food. The whole place feels very authentic and fun inside. I ordered the "Chick-less Chicken" which is just pieces of white meat chicken off of the bone, covered in BBQ sauce. So good! It comes with either 2 small sides, or 1 large side. I got the steamed vegetables, in attempt to be somewhat healthy, and an extra side of the potato salad. The veggies needed more flavor (or any at all - they're literally just plain steamed veggies!) but their potato salad was really good. The chicken was moist and covered in their delicious sweet, tangy sauce. Their onion rings are so killer. Definitely order those. And definitely wear a Bib if you're eating ribs so your company can laugh at you and take pictures of you devouring meat with BBQ sauce all over your face and a Bib around your neck. It's awesome. Everything is pretty affordable, too. Dinner portions are huge and enough to fill you up. My chicken dinner, extra side and drink came to $15 and change, which you can't really beat at all, and I couldn't even finish!

Some friends took me to this place and i have to say it's very different from what i'm used to. It's like a Mcdonalds, but at the same time a restaurant such as chili's. The food was great, i ordered some baby back ribs with fries and coleslaw. The place was quite active with a lot of people. The workers/busboys were polite they would ask if everything was alright. I would definitely come back to this place when i get the chance to. Check it out if your ever in SD.

While i don't agree with Troy M. about food being better than sex TWICE, Phil's is Banana's GOOD when it comes to BBQ. One draw back are the lines, but the food is well worth the wait. Lots of seating is always nice. They have a takeout line that moves pretty quick but dine-in is always best. You know a place is good when you can smell from about 3 blocks away on a good day.

i went here again and i liked it even more the 2nd time around!! the wait was about an hour on a sunday (3-4pm). i had previously wanted to come here but the line traveling back 3 hours made me leave the parking lot in 2 seconds. i got the rib and chick-less combo. ribs were equally as yummy as the first time. the chicken was boneless and mesquite grilled. delish. the thing i liked the most was the ONION RINGS! last time i went it was SOGGY :( so i was so happy when i bit into these babies and it was crisp and delish!! LOVED it! i had leftovers for THREE days. equally as tasty each day i ate it. word of advice, if you don't like a lot of sauce (and you like to taste your meat), ask for the sauce on the side!

ok i dont know much about BBQ. Êi just know what my taste buds like and what it doesnt. some BBQ sauce are too tangy and some are too sweet... some ribs fall off the bone too easily so it taste more like mush and the worst kind is when there's hardly any meat on the bones!!!! Êphil's, i must say... got all the proportions right. when we pulled up there was an insane line out the door. the wait time was for sure over an hour. luckily we learned from our past mistake at splash cafe and immediately parked the car and phoned in an order. Êwait time... 20 minutes. now was it good enough for me to want to wait in that hour long line.... truthfully no, but if it was only a 20 minute wait.. most DEFINITELY.

Still good, but the beef ribs are not great. I ordered a tickler for beef ribs and was disappointed. BABY BACK RIBS FOR THE WIN WIN WIN. Oh, for the beef rib tickler, they give you a lot of fries and a couple of onion rings oh and one beef rib. Pretty good deal, fries would get you full. But those beef ribs are not my thang. Next time I will try the chocolate moon cake...I will remember not to fill my tummy to the top of my esophagus.

I went to college in SD and discovered Phils many years ago. I've tried their chick tickler but what I really love is the ribs! ÊThey are so flavorful, juicy and tender that it literally falls off the bone. The sauce is awesome and the choice of sides are to die for. I have since moved away from SD and whenever I visit, it is a must go to stop for me!

Not a fan. Waited 1 hour and 50 minutes for a table. The ribs, while tender seem to be sloppily dressed with sauce. Seemed like sauce is what makes the meal. Onions rings were good though. The dining experience itself was only 20 minutes. but had a good service from Kenny in terms of getting extra dipping sauce and clean up...however not worth it overall for such an absurd wait. It would've been best to get my stuff to go and eat it in the comfort of my own home. Should've made the establishment more a "fast food" place. Would've spared me from the leg aches and pains.

We stayed across the street at wyndham garden and saw a ling line out the door. ÊAsked our front desk about the place and she recommended us trying, but told us to just call it in and pick it up. When we got there, the line was out the door and almost around the restaurant. No line for phone orders, so we skipped the long lines and went to pick up order. Apparently they will do your order when you there so there so everything was piping hot. We ordered rib and chicken dinner with 2 small sides $12.95, 1 large spring mix salad $4.95, large onion rings $5.95. We hurried to walk back to our digs and we smelled the good food the whole time in our hands and couldn't wait to get our hands on them. Onion rings were the bomb!!! The batter was very good and the onion ring was Huge! Ribs and their sauce was oh so yummy. Ê My husband says this is one place has of his favorite BBQ place! We will Definitely come here when we r in SD.

Fast and friendly service. The ribs were really good, the cole slaw okay and the fries were horrible. They were not hot, sloppy and chewy.

Great food and Service always. Ê (Would have given 5 stars, except for a nonsense policy) ÊOn Friday, after some debate of where to take Mom and kids to dinner for Mom' s Bday, I picked Phils because I knew they had TVs and I wasn't worried about missing Game 7 of the World Series. ÊWhen we sat down to eat, I didn't see the game on the tvs, they were playing some college football game. ÊI asked the server if they could put the game on and she straight out told me no! They NEVER play Big games in the dining area, only in the bar. ÊShe said thy don't want to have a 3 hour line out the door because people will eat and watch the game for too long... I was shocked! After expressing my opinion and disappointment, (why even have TVs if you won't play big games? Duh!) the manager came over to talk to me. ÊI have to give Kudos to John the manager who made an exception about playing Big Games in the dining area and put the game on immediately! He apologized and made it right without question. That's customer service!

there's a reason you'll be told there is "a two hour wait for any food coming off the grill" on a sunday night. Êphil's does it right. Êin addition to running a very efficient and streamlined operation(take-out) the food is worth the wait. i've never dined in, mostly because i have a weird fetish that prevents me from watching other people eat with their hands. Êhowever, don't let that stop you. Êeat-in, take-out, whatever floats your boat. Êknow that you pretty much cannot go wrong with this BBQ. Ê they work wonders with the ribs, slow roasting for tenderness and then they throw them on the grill to finish out the dance. Êthis provides a gastronomical harmony wherein the ribs are tender and succulent but have a crispy outer coating. Êtrs bien. all the standard stuff is aces too - side of beans, potato salad, etc.

Oh man the best bbq i have ever had in my life. The pulled pork sandwich was good but i got tired of it pretty fast. On the other hand the baby back ribs were really good. I kept stuffing myself even if i was full i didn't want to stop the delicious flavors that were going through my mouth. Really and just the first bite of the ribs you get this nice garlic flavor to it and the sweet sauce on the ribs follows it. They really give you a lot of food as well. The fries and onion rings man BOMB! The onion rings were so good . Really every time I'm in San Diego this has to definitely be one of my favorite places to eat.

I really love Phil's BBQ- the one on Goldfinch but this one on Sports Arena is much bigger. We showed up and the line was already out the door and around the corner of the building and the parking lot was packed! We waited for 23-25 minutes in the line before being seated and we were a HUGE party- a dirty dozen - twelve to be exact. We got seated outside on the porch/patio area which was nice because it meant less noise than inside but the place was just super loud. The lady who took out order must have been new because she didn't understand we were ordering racks to share instead of just individual dinners... although we ordered those as well. It was nice because my cousins didn't have to behave like at a super nice place - you know the ones with pristine white table clothes and a waiter with a crumb brush who comes and "sweeps" your table clean of crumbs. The food was quickly served they have that handy dandy "buzzer" thing so you know to make your way up to get your grub and don't end up hungry even if you are having a great conversation. I got the beef rib dinner and it was AWESOME.. Juicy, tender and a bit spicy- California BBQ is sweeter than MidWest or Carolina BBQ which tends to be a bit more sour.. but I am an equal oppurtunity BBQ eater. Hand me a rib and I will clean it! The only reason Phils didn't earn 5 stars was the noise level and the fact they have no benchs except inside for the elderly - like my Grandfather- the pregnant, differently abled or just plain lazy like me!

Never had better ribs than I have here. I used to come here all the time and my pudgy little teenager body showed it! Never get the boneless, it's convenient, but you sacrifice the taste.

Alright, I've got to up my rating, i visited Phil's again on Friday for lunch (no i did not go to the elite event the night before) Êand enjoyed my ribs thoroughly.

would you drive from la to san diego to eat phils? and do nothing else? i would.. and i have.. and that's probably why this place gets 5 stars from me.. it's so good.. that i don't even mind the mind boggling line they have constantly out the door.. baby back ribs is the name of the game.. throw down 2 sides with that.. and i'm in heaven.. Ê its not often that really really popular places can crank out consistenly good food.. but this place does it.. and does it good.. i like the fact that you just order at the counter and go find a seat.. there's no servers around but there are always really helpful dining room staff that can get you whatever you need.. but who need anything besides ribs and a roll of paper towels which is already on the table. i don't know how they do it, but the ribs just have this additional depth of flavor and smokeyness that you cant find anywhere else.. and its not even about the bbq sauce at all here.. most places slather it on.. this place uses it as an accompaniment to their delicous bbq'ed meat..

Phil's BBQ is definitely one of the most talked about place in SD that my friends have been telling me and I finally get to try this place. the followings are the food I've personally tried and these are my personal opinion. Beef Ribs - Juciy and tender. Perfectly cooked, perfectly executed. I'm actually surprised by this because alot of BBQ places failed at cooking beef Ribs and Phil's Definitely Aced it. A MUST ORDER! Baby Back BBQ Ribs - It's definitely a good pick. One of the better baby back ribs place in southern California. BBQ Chicken - simply plain because the chicken wasn't marinated. Yet, the bbq sauce compensated for the lack of seasoning. Onion Rings - freshly battered definitely and huge compared to others. Fries - They use freshly cut fries so they are definitely fresh fries and they resemble more to In & Out fries Overall, definitely a good experience. It meet and exceed some of my expectation. I'll go back there again for the beef ribs.

YUM! There's not too much I can say that other people haven't said already, but this place is awesome! Prices are not dirt cheap but suitable for a casual lunch or dinner--I paid 13.95 for half a rack of baby back ribs and one large side. The ribs are some of the best I've ever had; the sauce is so flavorful and the meat practically falls right off the bone. If you got dragged here by some friends but don't like meat, the salads look pretty good too. The only downside is that the line is tremendously long; I went here on a Tuesday night and had to wait about 20 minutes to order. The food takes about 10 minutes to prepare, and you pick it up at the counter when your buzzer alerts you. Even though it's basically a self-serve place, the servers still check up on you once in a while. Also, there's a handwash station near the back. Pretty convenient.

I dunnoe... Maybe I have high standards because I was born and raised in Texas where BBQ and steak is a part of everyone's meal 3 times a day... but this place just didn't do it for me. I got the ribs and it wasn't very juicy and tender and it was completely flooded with sauce so that all I tasted was sauce and not the meat.

Would have given five stars except for the genius that walked us in the dining area and then ditched us. ÊThe lovely warm taller and very funny black woman made it all right. ÊOur busser was also an incredible service oriented and very engaging individual. ÊIt was a fun atmosphere and we were still eating left overs days later. ÊThe food is incredible.

Try Phil's tickler- its about $7 comes with 4 bones of baby back ribs, 2 large onion rings, coleslaw AND fries. ÊYum, hits the spot when you are craving some good ol' BBQ Ê;-) ÊIf you want to avoid a HUGE headache, make sure that you phone in your order, otherwise, you may be in for a hefty wait. ÊTastes just as good at home.

came here on saturday night with my bf, cousin, and her husband. The wait was about 20-25 mins on a rainy day. we were tired and wet from sea world so we just wanted to sit down and get our grub on. Most of the employees are pretty nice but there was this one server who told us to move from our original table because there were customers who had food with them already. That kind of ticked us off because we were getting our food. We moved about 3 more times until we actually got to sit down. I ordered the beef ribs and chickless with fries n beans n the ribs were HUGE with lots of meat! the chicken was a bit dry. fries were yummy and the beans were whatever since im not really a fan. I packed a lot of leftovers to go. Overall I would have gave this place a 4.5 if it wasnt for that rude server but oh wells it was good to see my cousin again~

totally worth it. all of the food was sooooooo goood - my friend and i shared a rib platter when we were visiting my friend in SD, and we were pretty full afterward. if you've seen us eat, you'd say that's pretty impressive the ribs we got were covered in their delicious sauce, and we're the biggest I'd seen at any restaurant (that's what she said...). The onion rings were awesome too. i'd plan on making a stop here if you're in the area. the line was long, but it moved quickly. plus, you get to awkwardly stare at the people inside the restaurant who are making a mess of themselves.

This is the best BBQ in california! Trust me, I've been looking for 4 years ever since I moved to the west coast from NYC. The baby back ribs are to die for and the onion rings are crazy good. I'm not a huge beef ribs fan except for Phil's beef ribs. They are tender and delicious. I even like their set up. Wait in line (it's always long but moves pretty fast), place your order with the cashier, find a table, grab your food when it's ready, enjoy. Eat at Phil's!

Had to try Phil's after reading all the good reviews on Yelp. ÊI'm from Atlanta and found myself in San Diego craving barbecue, so off to Phil's we went. ÊWe stood in line for awhile, and all got really hyped because it was so popular. ÊI really don't want to sound snobby, but sorry, we have better barbecue back home. ÊNow, it is not a bad choice if you are in the area. ÊIt wasn't terrible, I just found myself yearning for my at home staples. ÊThe onion rings were pretty good. ÊAnd service was friendly. ÊHowever, both my husband and I got sick following our meal here - like violently sick. ÊRuined the following day of our trip. ÊOh well.

Phil's BBQ is alright. Honestly, I just think this place is way too hyped up. The lines are ridiculously long and the food is just OK to me. I don't think it's really worth the time to wait out in line and get mediocre food. If you're craving some bomb BBQ, try Joey's Smokin' BBQ in Carmel Mtn. Never a long wait and the food is better and cheaper!!

i LOVE this place! This is the place I take my friends who visit and the place my friends want to go when they come back! There is not much that I can say that is bad about this place: the food is DELICIOUS (I recommend a "tickler" or a "best of both world's" platter for any first- timers), the location is not hard to find, and the staff is amazingly nice. The only negative I can think of is the long wait, but it is so worth it! I actually went last night with a couple of girlfriends and had a very nice customer service experience. So, I went with four of my girlfriends and four of us had ordered the meat platters while one had ordered a sandwhich which took a little longer to make I guess. We all had our food expcept my friend with the sandwich. I guess the Assistant Manager saw that one of us did not have food and offered my friend a plate of anything she wanted while she waits and "all your friends eat without you" HAHA. He was very nice and even hand- delivered the sandwich when it was done! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED as a place to eat with a group of friends or any night that you just feel like STUFFING YOUR FACE!

One of the better BBQ joints I've been too, located in Point Loma near the Sports Arena. First thing I noticed was the long line out the door (so it must be good right?). You order up front like @ fast food places. So grab a menu while you are in line so you know what to order once you get up there. Baby back ribs, Tri-tip sandwich, chicken, fresh cut fries, sweet backed beans, and onion rings... great. Everything was simply amazing. And if you make a mess, there is a huge sink near to the exit to get cleaned up.

I came here yesterday w/my bf & some friends & we were all completely underwhelmed after all the hype. ÊThe line wrapped around the building & despite the wait time sign that read about 21 minutes, our wait was significantly longer than that from that point. ÊYou order & pay first & then go find a place to sit. ÊWe split up our group so that 2 of us went to order & the other two looked for seating but seating was that difficult to find. ÊThe real hold up is ordering. Ê As for the food, my bf & I shared a full rack of baby back ribs, a large side of steamed veggies, large potato salad, & onion rings for the table. ÊThe portions were just enough to fill me up & was around $35 w/tax&tip for the 2 of us. ÊSurprisingly, the veggies were probably one of the better selections. ÊCame with broccoli, zucchini, yellow squash, cauliflower & carrots. ÊThe onion rings were a little over-battered for me but that's just preference. ÊI know plenty of ppl who like their batter heavy. ÊThe ribs were definitely not what I expected. ÊFell off the bone, yes, but not juicy! We noticed that they were actually pretty dry. ÊThe sauce was alright, tasted like apple cider vinegar & they did a good job of putting just the right amount on. ÊIt's also just the right amount of spiciness. ÊAll in all, dinner was good but I'm not sure I would ever go back if there's a wait especially since I feel like i could get a similar if not better dinner elsewhere. ÊThere was even a wait for the pick-up to-go orders!

After eating at Phil's BBQ, no other BBQ place will taste the same. If you are looking for the flavorful BBQ that will have your mouth watering for more, then you will have to try Phil's BBQ!.

Dunno what the hype is about. Had the baby back ribs and BBQ chicken with fries and corn. Chicken was good. Moist. Ribs were also good but kinda burned. I had to pick off the charred parts or else there would be flaky bitter pieces. BBQ sauce kinda too sweet. In my opinion, BBQ should be more savory. Meat was tender but not very meaty at all. Too mushy. The worst thing is that the food is not hot!! How ya gonna eat BBQ that's not hot? Not worth the hour wait.

Well i have to say I really wanted to LOVE this place. My whole family loves it, but it just didn't do it for me. I was hoping for sparks to fly when i tried the food, but I really didn't like it. Ya, the BBQ wasn't bad, but nothing special. Too bad the BBQ sauce was terrible, would've made the BBQ fantastic if it was good. Baked bean's were not good. I was able to eat the mac salad. I don't think I've"ve ever gone out to eat at a place and liked the mac salad. in the end, I would have to say I would never go back there to eat again, unless my family was going there to get together and celebrate something.

After hearing the hype about Phil's for so many years, we finally got in there to give it a try. Well, it wasn't worth the hype. I got the baby back ribs, my other half got the pork sandwich. The dry rub on the ribs was good and the meat was tender enough, but the sauce is nasty. It's that vinegar-based Southern Style sauce. YUCK. My other half found the sandwich to be okay as well but also thought the meat was a bit dry/stringy. So now we've tried Phil's and know that when we want BBQ the only place to go is BBQ House in Ocean Beach. Now THAT'S some fantastic BBQ!

My best friend is going to kill me, but I have to give 3 stars (she has a love affair with Phil's BBQ). First off, I hate lines. Second, I don't like food that makes me smelly! Third, I don't like the idea of fighting for tables. I admit that their ribs are especially delicious when I'm famished, but standing in line usually sucks the life out of me. Strangely, my favorite part of my meal are the french fries because they remind me of In N Out's fries. Other than that, I prefer having a BBQ in my backyard with my dad as the chef.

This place is really good (the meat falls off the bone (however, I still like Tony Romas sauce better)...BUT and that is why I am minusing 2 stars...toooooooooo CROWDED.......looooooooooooong lines (to place an order!)...then you find a seat after you order...but you can not get a seat until you have ordered!!! (That means a friend can not reserve a table while you order your food). ÊWhen we finally got a table for 8, we barefly had enough elbow room.

I've written reviews of Phils before. ÊAlways a good review. ÊDon't think I wrote about the last 2 times we went, both not so good. ÊMost recent was this past weekend. ÊMy cousin, her bf and son were visting from LA. ÊHer bf chose to eat at Phils. ÊWe had taken them here about 4 months ago and wanted again. ÊMy husband and I hadn't eaten here in a few months so treated them to dinner. Ê OMG. ÊI know we've waited in a line there several times before. ÊMaybe 30 minutes was the longest, but this past visit we waited 1 hour 20 minutes! ÊWe had driven from CV and didn't want to waste gas for nothing and when you crave BBQ, thats what you want. ÊI was about to tell them to lets just to to Red Lobster or something! ÊIt was ridiculous. ÊOnce inside, we realized, it was because of the Laker game. ÊDang! ÊWhen people are done eating they need to leave and watch the game at home. ÊLol. ÊThere was a ton of people just waiting for a table. ÊA ton of people who were just standing to watch the game. ÊSo finally got inside and ordered. ÊSpent $68 for 4 adults, 1 child and 1 baby. ÊSeems pricey, but the portions are big...well they usually are. ÊI always order the same thing...half rib baby back dinner with macaroni salad and french fries and I almost never finish it. ÊBut this time...I had tiny ribs, 2 of them were burnt. ÊAnd hardly any macaroni salad and fries. ÊMy daughter and I ate the whole thing. ÊIf you order the same meal anywhere else, it would be twice as much though. ÊWe had to wait for the game to end to get our table too. Ê Staff is super friendly. ÊBig black lady always at front seating us...super, duper nice. ÊMy male cashier taking my order was super nice and funny and cute. ÊHa. Ê What I dont understand is why Phil doesn't open up a larger restaurant. ÊOr maybe even another location...like say in the Southbay area? ÊHa. ÊSeriously though. ÊA ton of people in SD love it and people drive miles to come here. ÊSo why not?

I love Phil's! The sometimes 1-hour line is definitely worth it when you are in the mood for smoky meat with gobs of barbecue sauce. Here are some must-haves: - Onion rings: Beautifully fried sweet onions. Delicious with the ranch sauce. - Beef ribs: Fall off the bone tender and not fatty. - Baby back ribs: My personal favorite ... delicious! - Grilled corn: Never overcooked, always sweet. Especially good with butter, then sprinkled with the cajun seasoning provided at the table. All the other sides are pretty regular ... fries, potato salad, macaroni salad, etc. I'm also not too impressed with the chicken ... seems like regular chicken with BBQ sauce dumped on it. Here's a heads up. If you are planning to head over to Phil's, go online to their website to take a look at the length of the line so you can prepare yourself for the wait.

This place has a some delicious BBQ. ÊWe went on a Sunday afternoon, despite the tips from other yelpers. ÊSurprisingly the wait was not bad a all. ÊWe got in line and were ordering within 15 minutes. ÊWe ordered a bunch of food since there was 7 in our party. ÊWe got two orders of beefy, two orders of baby back, an order of chickless chicken and a side of fries, a side of onion rings, a side of mac salad, a side of potato salad and a corn on the cob. ÊIt was a lot of food. ÊThe food came out, or should I say out to the counter fairly quickly. ÊDespite the large order, I don't think we waited more than 15 minutes for our food. ÊOther BBQ places take upwards of 30 minutes for your food to be ready. ÊFour of us had to go to the counter to pick up all of our food. ÊUpon returning to our table in the patio the grubbing commenced. ÊThe beefy rib was very moist and flavorful. ÊThere where nice bits of chard meat mixed in with the moist and juicy beef. ÊThey were not fall of the bone tender, but the beefy ribs were good. ÊThe baby back rib was very tender but the flavor of the meat was a little more subtle. ÊIt was also moist, but not as moist at the beefy. ÊBut its not really fair to compare beef ribs and baby back pork ribs. ÊAll I can say is, you should try both and pick your favorite. ÊI am partial to the beefy. ÊThe sides were good. ÊI was very fond of the onion rings and the fries. ÊThe onion rings were like home made, you know there is an onion in there and the batter was simple in a good way. ÊThe best way to describe the fries is, there were like in-n-out fries but thicker. ÊThey had that distinct fresh potato taste which is rare in many french fries nowadays. ÊThe mac salad and the potato salad were ok, in my opinion. ÊBut other in my party were very fond of the potato salad. ÊThe service was good. ÊThey don't really do much for you though. ÊBut they are friendly and very attentive. ÊThey brought us ranch and extra BBQ sauce and offered to help us carry some of they platters to the table, but we came prepared. ÊBut why would I only give them four stars? ÊWell, I'm definitely a fan of this place. ÊSome of the best BBQ I've had in a while. ÊProbably on par with Famous Dave's and definitely leagues ahead of Lucille's. ÊNow only if they served rice, I'd give them an extra star. ÊBecause as you know, Filipinos like rice with everything especially meat. Would I go back? I'd like to, but the 70 miles trek will most likely not be made often. ÊOnly if they would branch out to OC.

It's the best baby back ribs I've had in San Diego. ÊThe bbq sauce was a little too overwhelming -- maybe they slopped on too much, which is my only complaint.

Pork Heaven! I LOVE Phil's. In fact, one of the few things that is memorable about the three years I lived in San Diego was Phil's. The pork ribs are show stoppers, and I would recommend just diving in and splurging on a full order of the ribs. The mouth watering meat is tender and falls right off the bone. It is slathered in spicy and sweet BBQ, and there is even some honey in there. I couldn't imagine a better set of ribs. They would convert even the most stubborn of vegans into a meat eater and become a true believer! Equally delicious are the yummy fresh cut fries. I usually get a double order of that, since you get two side options with the full order. I don't particularly care for the other side accouterments, but some friends of mine like the beans. I, personally, do not care for them. I would, however, recommend steering clear of the beef ribs. Honestly, there is nothing to write home about them. Too much bone, not enough meat, and fatty without all the delightful flavor the pork brings! Also, the line can be long, if ordering take away, make sure to call in advance.

My favorite seat is the one right in the front against the window. That way I can bite into my ribs and onion ring while the people still in line(looonnnnn ass line) watch as I lick my fingers and make a big mess! I give them dinner and a show. The food is good too!

So I was attracted to this place due to the large number of high ratings on Yelp. ÊI went there around six and was expecting a lonnnng line but was pleasantly surprised. ÊWhen waiting outside the aroma of the bbq was great. ÊI was greeted by an affable staff and the menu was nice and simple. ÊI decided to order the baby back rib chickless dinner, which I recommend to anyone for their first order. ÊNeedless to say the food was delicious. Ê If you haven't made it to Phils bbq then you are definitely missing out.

Tasty BBQ. ÊGreat sides. ÊLike everybody else says: the onion rings were exceptional. ÊA little too much sauce for me on the beef ribs. ÊNext time I would get the sauce on the side (and probably not even use it). ÊGet there early or you WILL be waiting in line.

i like quite far from SD (about a 2 hr drive) and well everytime i go to SD i make sure i come here! i always get the baby back ribs because they are super tender (definitely beats lucille's bbq) and it's super meaty - a half rack will help me hit a food coma for sure. i've tried the chicken (im not a huge bbq chicken fan but its really good - but baby back ribs ftw! (; ) and if you like hot sauce - they have REALLLY freaking good hot sauce that goes with the bbq - its like its made for it or something. i would recommend the macaroni salad over the potato salad. i am usually a fan of both. the french fries are quite good also: sprinkle your fries with the cajun seasoning (loves it). the baked potato with the cheese is delicious! but i think you're better off getting the 2 sides over the one large side (if you get the baked potato that is) i also sprinkled the cajun seasoning over my baked potato hehehe :D more flavorr! i love the staff they are super friendly and very outgoing. if you have any questions about the menu, they will give you recommendations. :D the only con is the line: the line usually goes around the building but even so - its like a 30 minute wait and trust me its worth it. Plus, by the time you get there you're SUPER hungry and then your food wont go to waste for sure :D (that's how it goes for meee) AND its too delicious to go to waste!

I literally came from San Francisco for this! Well... not really. Anyway, my friend took us here after we arrived. I ordered the half rack pork ribs dinner with the baked potato. The ribs were mind boggling! The meat came right off the bone as my teeth got a grip of it. It was amazing! Oh yeah, the BBQ sauce on the ribs were GOOD! It was sweet with a bit of spiciness to it. As for the baked potato, it could have been a lot better, but it was just dry. I tried my girlfriends fries which were pretty good. Overall Phil's BBQ must be one of the best baby back rib restaurant I've been to! I like the whole concept of the restaurant: wait in line, order, find an open table, wait for your pager to call your order. Oh yeah, they clean up the tables pretty quick!

TIP: ÊOne meal is good for two people, share the ribs and get some extra sides. ÊPork and beef ribs are amazing and the price is right. ÊSince you order at the counter, you save in tip money as well. ÊBest macaroni salad I have ever had, and don't get me started on those onion rings. ÊOhhhh yeah! ÊGreat spot worth waiting in line for. ÊOnly bummer is you have to get your beer in a different section (bar) so if using a credit card, you use it twice.

ÊThe two times that I came here there was a line so I did the next smartest thing...call in your order. ÊThe wait 20 minutes...what you should get the fall-off the bone ribs and chicken...so delicious. ÊOver the weekend we also ordered a tri-tip sandwich to try...would love to tell you how it tastes but a doggie ate it during our photo shoot before we got to try it.

So I came back again, of course and everything was better than the first, if that could happen :) The line was very fast and as soon as I got up there I ordered my favorite meal, the chickless dinner w/ two sides. onion rings and macaroni salad. Soooo good and of course the boyfriend got the big meaty ribs. I am actually salivating!! Once we sat a very nice gentlemen named Andy helped us out. He was part of our great experience, seriously..this guy is awesome :)) He said he just started but he seemed to know what he was doing w/ an amazing attitude.

Look at the constant line wrapped around the restaurant and believe the hype. This place is delicious. ÊI can't claim to be a bbq expert and doesn't a bbq restaurant in San Diego just sound weird.

GET THE RIBS. NOT THE CHICKEN However, the wait is very long on weekend dinners (well all the time usually wait is 10+ minutes from my experience). The sides are ridiculously filling. I have yet to see a single human being who can finish a full plate by oneself (9-12? ribs and 2 sides). I can BARELY finish a half although I eat a lot. Onion rings here are ridiculous as well. They are gigantic and tasty as well. All the sides are very delicious in my opinion and when you are in San Diego area, Phil's BBQ is a place to visit at least just for the experience. Food can be a bit pricey but is very good and I highly recommend this place.

we have our ritual Phil`s dinner every time we head down to SD, without fail. there is always a huge line, but i assure you it is always worth the wait. as a small person i`ve only ever ordered the Tickler, which is plenty of food for me. most ppl fill up on the half rack, and if (and only if) you`re feeling particularly carnivorous, go for the full rack (i have yet to see someone finish one solo). baby back ribs are delish, with the tender meat falling cleanly from the bone. the sauce is probably what Phil`s is best known for- goes wonderfully with the onion rings and fries. yes, the fried goodness is a heart attack waiting to happen, but it is all simply too good to resist. don`t miss out on Phil`s! it will become a ritual of yours too.

If you're ever visiting San Diego, or live in the San Diego area, this is the BEST BBQ place ever!!! Pre-warning: this place tends to get packed very fast, & luckily when I arrived I had a reservation party to attend to, so I easily ditched the line. The size of the food is massive... yes I said massive. It's not expensive & definitely worth every dime, nickel & penny! It's a place cool enough for kids but chill for college students to go to.

This is a must visit place in San Diego. It's near the sports arena so you can't miss it. Hell, you can probably smell the place from the airport or even Los Angeles...just follow your nose from there. I've eaten at this place several times and it never gets old. The baby back ribs are the bomb. The bbq sauce is that perfect kind of hot tasting sauce that you can't quit eating...sooo sooo soo good... I recommend this place to everyone I've ever talked to that is headed to San Diego for whatever reason. I always insist they make time to go to this place. I've even told friends I will personally refund their money if they have a complaint about the food. Highest recommendation for this place if you love your bbq. Couple of side notes, parking may be tight as this is a popular joint. Along with a full parking lot, you're going to have a long line that may take some time to get through but it's well worth it...additionally, it may be a rat race to get a table. All this drama and it's still totally worth it...this overcrowded headache is a small price to pay for this grub. One final tip, they do what's called "freeze blasts" if you want to take some home with you. I've taken this on plane rides home several times. If you do that, the bbq sauce has to get checked in with your luggage but the frozen ribs can make it through TSA with no problems. Wear a bib and don't be too shy to lick your fingers!!!!!

I always have to come here when I'm in the area. I love their beef ribs! They're so tender, flavorful, and the meat practically comes off the bone with very little effort. The staff is extremely friendly. The baby back ribs and chicken are also pretty good but my favorite would have to be the beef ribs. The fries, onion rings, and corn on the cob are average, nothing special, but definitely goes well with the ribs. This place is ALWAYS packed so expect a long wait. Well worth it though!

Phil's! Phil's! Phil's! LOVE this place! Well, since only 1500 other people have written a review, I figured I'd throw mine in as well, just to help people make their decision. If you haven't eaten at Phil's- GO THERE NOW. If you have eaten at Phil's- go tonight for dinner! Phil's has the best BBQ I've ever had. And I live in the south. The sauce is so sweet and so spicy, a perfect complement to the tender, delicious meat it covers. Excellent sides, cool atmosphere, big-ass drinks with free refills, you can't go wrong. Every time I go in, I get the platter with 1/2 ribs and 1/2 chicken with baked beans and an order of onion rings. The onion rings are beer battered, crispy and crunchy, HUGE, and you get a massive pile for a small price. Also thoroughly enjoy the baked beans and coleslaw, but the real star of this place is the BBQ. You can get the chicken cooked many different ways, I usually go with the chunk-less, which is just chopped up pieces of chicken, although the chicken breast is also very, very good. If you're going to eat at Phil's, though, you HAVE to eat the ribs. Fall off the bone, so tender and juicy, and the sauce... Oh, the sauce! This place is THE BEST! Of course, you have to time your meal here just right, as it will get PACKED. They shuffle people in to take orders, but they do not seat you, so you have to find your own table, and people really take their time to eat here, so you may get your food and not have a place to sit, so be prepared. Huge place, lots of seating (indoor and out), and seats in Phil's Beer-B-Q, but still, this place gets full. But it's oh so worth it... go in hungry, try to stay positive, and once you get your food, sit and enjoy. And get ready to come back many, MANY times.

It was our first visit to Phil's BBQ, and I was really looking forward to some great food. ÊI had the baby back ribs/chicken combo with baked beans and coleslaw. ÊI LOVED the ribs as they were flavorful and fell off the bone. ÊUnfortunately, the bone-in chicken breast was somewhat dry.Both meats were dripping in their spicy BBQ sauce; almost too spicy for me, but definitely way too spicy for my husband (he had the tri-tip sandwich). ÊHe said the meat was very good, but way too much spice in the sauce. ÊI would return, but would use their suggestion of having the BBQ sauce on the side. ÊGlad we came before 5:30 PM, as the place filled-up fast by 6PM. ÊVery friendly staff, too

Ok, ok, so I'm not from the South or the Midwest. That being said, this is the best BBQ you will find anywhere within driving distance in San Diego. There are long lines if you walk up to order.

By far the best ribs place I have ever been to, and arguably the best in Southern California! It can get a bit hectic and the wait may be long to get in, but man is it worth it. Their Baby Back ribs are drenched in BBQ sauce, and their Beef Ribs are amazingly good with a lot of meat. The sides are delicious as well, especially their macaroni salad and onion rings! Their bar has a decent selection of beers, but definitely come here for the ribs. YUM YUM YUM. Most of the time I make a trip to SD, I want to give a quick visit to Phils, because I know it will satisfy my cravings for ribs :)

The sides are great, the portions of BBQ are huge, and the prices are very reasonable, but it's just not worth the line you have to stand in. I've had the same BBQ at many other places, but maybe it's because San Diego is lacking in decent restaurants, but the line is not worth standing in. Get there around 5 Tues-Thursday or get takeout.

The simple fact that there are 1195 reviews should tell you something. If your ever in SD, this is the place to be. Well maybe not the place to be but its a must stop place, if you like bbq, that is. Their ribs are finger-licking good, their cole slaw, hands down! ÊPrices are reasonable. A well portioned half rack of ribs and two sides plate will cost you about $14. The full rack is about $20. There is also chicken and other stuff to choose from but the ribs are the must-haves! The only downer is the LOOOONG line to get in but totally worth it!

I'm not a fan of BBQ but this place is my boyfriend's favorite BBQ joint so I gave it a shot, I am glad to say it's awesome! The chicken is tender and BBQ sauce is delicious. Onion rings and fries are amazing. The people and staff are very friendly and welcoming. Overall a great place for BBQ.

ÊThe sauce is spectacular making every bite incredible. ÊDon't miss out on the onion rings! ÊLet me say that I don't eat onions, the only place I will eat onion rings is at Phils!

The bbq sauce on my ribs was a bit too tangy for my taste buds. Minus one star. The service was not of my expectation. I guess its because I got stuck with a bad waiter. Minus another star. All the other waiters looked like they were having a good time with their customers. The onion rings didn't have any taste and the fries were too salty. The wait was about 20-30 minutes. My boyfriend recommended this place because he said its the best BBQ in SD. I can't say they're the best because my ribs were a bit burnt, but they did taste better as leftovers the next day.

finger-licking good! but if you're like me (eye too big for mouth!) you'll probably be so stuffed you won't even bother licking your fingers. i got the full baby back ribs with 2 small sides. BARELY touched the sides of fries and cole slaw. i have this determination problem where if i'm determined then i'll do it no matter what...kinda wish i didnt now...somehow i finished all the ribs and i swear to you i couldnt move after. the ribs were damn good especially if you love bbq, and that's coming from me...im not even a big of a fan on ribs. however i am a fan of stuffing myself with as much food as possible. guranteed you'll leave here stuff but it's not cheap... we came around 1pm on a sunday and waited in line for a good 30mins atleast. drink+baby rib+sides came out to be 23 dollars. to quote a friend "i feel like i got a baby cow in me"

After a long day at the beach, I was really excited to come here...it did not let me down. 5 stars all the way! I shared with a friend and we got the full baby back ribs with some fries.

This place was poppin!!! The line was absolutely insaneee. It wrapped around the building and more. Thank goodness I didn't have to stand in it. I ordered to-go so I can't speak on behalf of the restaurant's service but man is that food bomb or what! We ordered: 1 Full Rib Dinner (10-12 bones) Side of fresh cut fries Side of macaroni salad Side of Baked Potato That sauce was sooooooooooo good. My friend and I were wondering how we might ever replicate it for our own ribs. Really good melt in your mouth meat too. My friend wasn't too fond of how they didn't separate our fries from the meat and decided to just throw them all together, getting the sauce on the fries (some people just like 'em plain) but I didn't mind. The macaroni salad was pretty good. The baked potato was your normal baked potato, cooked thoroughly. Love that they leave the individually wrapped wet naps for you to take home.... or to store in your car... Story: Later that night, after a good night at the club and bars, the friend is unfortunately yackin up dinner and for some reason... "All I taste is butter.... Why does it taste like butter........" Perhaps butter is their secret ingredient?!

With a sign that says, "Approximate Wait time for this point: 21 minutes 14 seconds," at the end of--what it seems like--a never ending line, who would not see Phil's BBQ as a favorable place. It is tough to say that good BBQ can be found in California, especially if it is in the coastal area of San Diego. Everything about Phil's exceeds all expectations. A good BBQ joint should guarantee a welcoming environment along with delicious food. The atmosphere and food is what keeps the long lines continuous and mouths watering for more. Phil's BBQ accommodates their customers through the whole process from waiting in line until you walk out on a full, satisfied stomach. There is a bar and free ice cold water for those that need some refreshments while in line. Hostesses are walking around helping anyone that has questions and recommending what they prefer. Along the line, there are also menus on display. The menus help the lines move faster, and everyone is able to get their chance at some finger licking good BBQ. ÊAlthough people mainly come for their food, Phil's does not forget to maintain a feel-good ambiance for all of their guest. The dcor has a cabin meets homey feel. The tables and chairs are wood, which remind customers of family dinners. ÊThere is a fireplace near the entrance that makes a person feel welcomed when entering the restaurant. Plasma screen televisions surround the whole place to accommodate the sports fans while eating. ÊThe surrounding decorations are western antiques that represent tradition at Phil's. Despite the fact that BBQ has a Southern background, Phil's has achieved in bringing out the Western history of California into their BBQ. The atmosphere is friendly and there are fulfilled customers with gratified smiles that surround the restaurant. Through the dcor and environment, customers easily forget that the restaurant is still a self-service place because of the at-home feel. After the line, guests are directed to the cashiers to order and find their own tables while waiting for their beepers to buzz for the food. Phil's does an exceptional job in maintaining the needs of their customers. They provide extra to-go boxes for the huge portions, bibs for the messy BBQ sauce stains, plates for sharing, and utensils for the side orders. There are also extra wet-naps and condiments available at the table. Although customers are able to do everything themselves, the waiters and waitresses are more than helpful. They come by and check up on their guests repeatedly and make sure that everyone is pleased. The workers make conversation with their customers and there are many interesting characters that make Phil's worth the try. It is easy to like a restaurant because of their food, but it is a bonus when their service is just as great. When the buzzer vibrates, come forth with empty hands and expect to come back, to the table, with muscles. The food is served on big trays that seem to weight a ton. It is amazing to see how generous Phil's is with their hefty portions. The delicious food will leave anyone satisfied and guaranteed extra for the day after, which is always a plus. The grand finale of Phil's is their food. The food is filling and inexpensive, which guarantees a satisfied stomach. The best order would be the baby back ribs and chicken dinner for $12.25. The chicken is mesquite grilled to perfection and very moist and the ribs are fall off the bone tender with a delicious tangy BBQ sauce. With the dinner, there is a choice of two sides that range from cold salads to french fries. The sides are a good accompaniment for the hearty BBQ because they are lighter in flavor, but just as good. There are also options of pulled pork, tri tip BBQ sandwiches or even burgers. ÊPhil's is also famous for their Colossal Onion Rings that are decadent. The onion rings are as huge as their name labels it. They hold a perfect amount of batter and are extremely flavorful along with their house ranch dressing. Phil's succeeds in establishing a memorable BBQ experience because of their delicious food. Ê Phil's BBQ does not disappoint any aspect: the dcor, the atmosphere and most importantly, the food. It is evident that Phil's is a popular place because of their pleased customers that keep coming back and new customers that keep the lines long. If long lines are worth the wait, then this place must be self-explanatory. In any circumstance, Phil's is worth the distance, the calories, and the BBQ stains.

I went to Phil's on the recommendation of friends. First thing to know, order by phone ahead of time. We went on a Saturday night and the line to get in was around the building and getting longer as we watched. Since we had called ahead, we walked past that entire line, got our food, and were gone within 15 minutes. Even better, we had seven people order food and they didn't mind us all paying separately. Kudos to them for having a really friendly staff, but not friendly in the creepy way that some stores go for. I had the beef ribs meal, can't say the fries were any good but I ate five beef ribs and had a foodgasm. Excellent.

To each his own. I find the bbq sauce to be cloying and overpowering of the bbq flavor of the meat. My advice, ask for the sauce on the side and add your own to taste. San Diego is not known as a mecca for BBQ, so it not difficult to see why this place get the raves that it does.Life is too short to wait in a line for Phils bbq. Sometimes less is more.

This place is worth the buck. However there will be a line...A lonnng line. But the wait is worth it. Ordering shouldnt be so hard because while you are waiting there will be a menu for you to look at. this place is almost like a Pat and Oscars restaurant where you order your food and then find a table to sit at. forget about the way how things work there, lets just get to the food. there's only one word i can use to explain there food here "delicious" and the portions are HUGE. i only spent about 12-13 dollars for my entree and i could not even finish it. I got a half rack of ribs with cole slaw,fries, two giant onion rings, and when i say its giant i mean its as big as your hand. And Last, I got a beefy rib as big as my arm..(literally). I gotta say phils bbq do not cut you short. they wanna make sure your money is worth spent. its lively, friendly, and satisfying. i recommend this place to everyone who enjoy great bbq.

Best in the Country! I have lived in the South, had Kansas City authentic BBQ, and traveled across the country several times and I have to say this is my favorite place of all time! I think their BBQ sauce is the best anywhere. A bit spicy, a bit sweet, and a bit tangy. Its perfection! Best Menu Items: Baby Back Ribs- Pure perfection! Brohman (Pulled Pork Sandwich) - Best I have had in my life! El Toro (BBQ Beef Sandwich)- If you like sliced beef than this is for you. Onion Rings- Handmade and some of the best ever. Get BBQ Sauce and buttermilk to dip them in. The wait sucks though. Either go towards closing on a weeknight, or do take-out. I don't even bother waiting in line anymore. Glad to see it doing so well these days. The owner Phil is a great guy!

I was first aware of Phil's BBQ when I moved to Point Loma and saw a huge line outside of the restaurant. ÊI said to my husband, "wow that place must be awesome!" ÊA couple days later we were on Yelp looking for a new place to try when it came up with a high rating. ÊThat sealed the deal and we were not disappointed in the least!

We just came from here on a Sunday. The line was not bad shortly before noon, but when we left it wrapped around the building. Had been here once before, a few years back and it was mid-week. I simply can not see how a BBQ place can cater to this large volume of customers, and maintain a decent quality standard. As you can see from the number of stars I posted - this restaurant cannot do it all. The Beef Ribs were very fatty, under-cooked, and tough - yet burnt to a crisp and charred on the outside. This combination of poor cooking rendered the beef ribs as inedible. The white chicken meat BBQ was quite similar to chicken nuggets from a fast food restaurant, which is not bad, if you like fast food - or call it fast food made at Phil's. My wife had pork, which was not as bad as my two meat items. The beans were OK, not horrible, but not good. The coleslaw looked and tasted like the paper it was served on. San Diego does offer a few BBQ options, and all will be considered in my future BBQ meal choices. Phil's BBQ has decent atmosphere, but anybody who knows BBQ should know it is not the atmosphere these BBQ Yelp posers are overrating this place for. We are not planning to return.

Southern expert here.....it ain't nothing like the taste of the South. If you're looking for a southern bbq experience you won't find it here. They do try to go out of their way to be nice to you, though....but, even that failed to impress as we were repeatedly interrupted during our meal with them trying to take our plates away!! They were in such a hurry to get us out so they could get more in. & No, we weren't taking a long time - they started this Shortly after we got our food! No, we didn't go close to closing time - they had a few hours before that. I got my extra bbq sauce that I paid for almost taken away, my spoon did get taken away so I had to get up and go get one before my food got cold, then they took my baked beans away! Get your hands off my food!! The baby back ribs had so much fat on them I barely got any meat between the fat and the black crust everywhere. I was given a chicken without any skin! (Yes, I ordered it with the bone-in) I had to plead my case for another one. You have to order your food at a counter and are told to come back to get it when the buzzer they give you goes off. However, when we went to get it we were told we weren't 'Allowed' to carry more than two plates! We tried and they wouldn't have it. They INSISTED they would carry them to the table regardless that we said we'll be fine taking them ourselves ----why tell us to come get em' in the first place, just wasting more of our dinner tallk time??? Both the pork and the chicken doesn't taste like high-quality meat, just bbq'd black crust with sauce to kill the taste. This place is definitely overrated...it boils down to it being a fan favorite in SD because it is virtually the only place to get BBQ. Cost is too much for what you get ($17.50 for a meal)....or should I say, get taken away. 1 star for trying, another because it's edible.

So you know that whole thing about America and obesity? Well, if obesity defined America, this place is like the holy bible of America. It's the thesaurus word under America. Hell, go to Wikipedia to search Phil's BBQ and you'll get the message "redirected to AMERICA". In either case, DAMN THIS PLACE IS CROWDED. Do you guys reaaaallly have to all come to the same damn place where I eat??? At the same damn time???? I DON'T EVEN COME HERE OFTEN. But yea, despite the crowd the food is pretty mediocre. Meat is often overcooked, and slathered with ridiculous amounts of mediocre BBQ sauce. As a grilling man... seriously, I can make something better (and my friends agree). The portions are HUGE but the price is high. Seriously, go to Costco and bake one of their frozen pork ribs. It's much better bang for the buck. The staff are very friendly though. That's a plus :) Oh, and if you are on the skinny/not-too-fat side of picture, go here. You'll feel even better after seeing the people around you.

It gets four stars because number one: I'm a southerner and feel (while there are many greats) the south just does it the best - AND - the place is so crowded (and with good reason)! I'm not used to the order in line style as that's not how people back home do it, but it works for the volume. In all of SD, I haven't experienced better bbq that reminds me of hom. The ribs are great and so are the sides. I do wish, however, there were more options like fried okra, corn nuggets, and Texas style bread. I wouldn't take friends that I haven't seen in a long time to catch up, because I can't hear myself think there, but the call-in/carry out is genius! It's delicious. People seem happy to be there. The employees are real nice and I hear from friends Phil's a real delight.

Phils doesn't need my review. But I love you Phils. I lived in Georgia for 18 years. BBQ to Atlanta is mexican food to San Diego. So i was eating BBQ about once per week when I lived in ATL...OK...so now that you have my credentials...Phils is about as good as it gets. We could very easily have a average BBQ joint in SD because let's face it...it's not SD fare...but we are super lucky to have this gem...If Phils were in the south...they would still pack em in...

Best BBQ joint in San Diego IMO. ÊThe baby back ribs are awesome along with their beef ribs. ÊPortions are huge and the meat isn't dry to the bone like a lot of other BBQ places I've been to. ÊIf I had to rank my favorite BBQ places, I'd rank this up there with Lucille's and Memphis BBQ. ÊMy only complaint, during busy nights it might be hard to find seating, but hey, it's busy and packed for a reason right? ;)

best bbq in SD. I'm from texas, so I know my bbq. and although this place isn't as good as the bbq from back home, it is pretty tasty and always hits the spot. lines always get long and wrap around the building during dinner time so we always go after 8 after the crowd dies down.

One of the Best BBQ in San Diego. Their BBQ sauce has won adwards, just wish they would come up with a Honey BBQ sauce. Always a place to take the out of towners. Make sure to get there early because there is almost always a line to get in.

Decent for California "BBQ". ÊHowever, if you've ever had authentic BBQ from anywhere in the South beware of the following: 1. ÊBBQ is not smoked!! Ê 2. ÊBaby-back ribs was slightly more tender than what you can find at Chilli's.. 3. ÊChicken was bland and rubbery. ÊDrizzling a crapload of sauce does not compensate. Ê With that said, the onion rings are awesome!

The rib-less dinner has got to be the most slutty/delicious meal on the market in San Diego today. Just a pile of sweet meat and a huge side of fries. Now that the new phil's has a beer bar it's very tempting to top it all of with a pitcher of brew but if you do you may want to call a taxi ahead of time. Not because you'll be too drunk to drive but more so because of the intense food coma that will follow. Delirious with satisfaction.

I've eaten at nearly every BBQ restaurant in Memphis, Tennessee, from Interstate BBQ of the world renowned Jim Neely to Corky's, and Phil's blows all of them out of the water. ÊRelaying to the reader simply how good Phil's ribs are is impossible. ÊThe tender meat falls right off the bone like no other. ÊHowever, the word is out about how good Phil's ribs are, so be prepared to wait in a line. ÊBe that as it may, Phil's BBQ is one of a kind and well worth your time, money, and appetite.

WOW!!! BBQ doesn't get any better than this. For me, BBQ was always sweet and that was, in my opinion, the reason why people liked it. Nope, not here. This place blew me away with how tender their ribs were. It was sweet without any sauce but the sauce blew it out of this world! I like the amount of side dishes they served. A LOT of fries and cole slaw for me! This place is jammed pack so don't expect to just go in. You'll be waiting 30 mins like we did but it was worth it. Abolutely loved it! Best of all, my friends all said it's a little pricy but around $14 for the half ribbed filled me up. They come with Ê2 huge sides!

Phil's 1000th Review! This place is simply amazing: best bbq in San Diego and some of the most desirable comfort food in the county. I have had exceptional bbq in Texas, and this joint is right up there with the greatest of them. The bbq sauce has a wonderful vinegar-based composition with just the right amount of sweetness. I recommend the El Toro sandwich (tri tip steak smothered in sauce inside a perfectly textured bun) and onion rings. I have been to Phil's a half-dozen times and never have been disappointed. With first-class, friendly service and outstanding food, you will have a memorable meal Phil's.

Crazy wait, great food. ÊPork ribs were a bit burnt on the outside but that may be the style Phil is going for. ÊImportantly, the ribs were juicy and not overcooked. ÊTo-go order sides seemed a bit small, and the beans left a bit to be desired. ÊNothing that would keep me from coming back.

The best BBQ I've had! The ribs were tender and the sauce was perfect (just the right amount of sweetness, spicyness, and tang). I ordered the 'tickler' thinking it was going to be small, but the portions are very large. Their sides selection isn't very big, and they don't even have mashed potatoes or mac and cheese, but trust me, you won't miss it because the ribs are so good and it goes perfectly with the fries and coleslaw. Service is excellent. Don't be intimidated by the huge line....it goes surprisingly fast. Highly recommended. Great for groups/casual dining.

Two word: Beef Ribs. Get them! Juicy, flavor filled, tender yet cooked well. The line (about 30 minutes on a weeknight) was well worth it. Bring a couple of friends and hang out in line. The price was pretty decent too for what you get. We also had pork ribs and they were excellent as well. The rest of the reviews speak truth about this place.

I am so picky with meat! But this place was so good, their meat wasn't over or under cooked it was just right. Though its out of what I would pay for ribs it was good. The cole slaw was the best I ever had. The wait for me was about 45mins and even the ones we took home were still good. Since I live far I bought the sauce and seasoning to make me own and its awesome. The take home food was good and that's very surprising! Five stars for me is even more rare I'm horribly picky.

Everybody loves a good bbq, as do I. ÊAs with most discussions around the topic of BBQ, preference always comes into play. ÊLocation and options (alternatives) are also a realistic consideration. ÊPhils has always been one of the local favorites in the SD area. ÊBut, is it really worth the notoriously long wait and lines out the door. On the whole my experiences at Phils have been very good. ÊFor us, its almost unimaginable to not get beef ribs as well as babybacks whenever BBQ is on the menu. ÊI occasionally like to add bbq chicken as well, but, most places don't do the poor bird justice. ÊOh, and the sides ... the sides ... mac'n'cheese, corn, french fries ... what more is there to say. To be honest, the BBQ sauce Phil's puts on its babybacks tend to be a bit more tangy (more vinegar) than I personally like. ÊSome people love the acidity, while I'm only ok with it. ÊBut, in good conscience, I have to acknowledge that the bbq is consistently good, has a good balance between tenderness and "bite". ÊIts almost always well-prepared. Ê For me, complaints about the wait are always secondary, as good places will almost always have loyal patrons. ÊThe question is whether it is worthwhile. ÊBBQ is at the end of the day, comfort food, and walking away feeling "comforted" and "satisfied" are as important as any other consideration. ÊIn that department, I think Phils consistently delivers. Ê But is it mind shattering as far as BBQ goes? ÊNot by a long shot. ÊAnd it may simply be a function of proximity and location options. ÊUnfortunately, living in California, as great as our food options may be in most areas, I openly acknowledge that this is one area where we may fall a little short. At the end of the day, I will continue to go to Phil's should the opportunity arise when I'm in SD. ÊBut, I will also not miss it when I'm not there.

If you plan on checking this place out make sure you have plenty of time because you are going to be in line for a while...the lines are long. Well at least when I went, but I here during the week its not that bad. The good news about waiting in line is that the food is worth the wait and once you place you order you receive your food fairly quickly. I had the baby back ribs and they were awesome...I think there sides need improvement... for the sides I had potato salad and macaroni salad. I also tried the baked beans from my boyfriend's plate and I have to say they were good. Better than the salad choices.

When in San Diego.. do as the Diegans do and get yoself some Phils BBQ! The food here is definitely worth coming for and waiting in line is the least you can do to experience the best BBQ of your life. It's like waiting in line at Disneyland for the Indiana Jones ride.. you wait and wait but once you ride it.. you wanna go back in line and go at it again! Phils definitely does BBQ right..without all the hootin and hollarin of "we got the best this" or " we sell of the most that".. when they have a sign that estimates your wait time in line, you know you're at the right place for some good eatin'. I suggest studying their menu either before arrival or picking up a menu to look at while you wait in line cuz it's like an oral exam when you come up to the bank teller style ordering stations cuz I felt a little pressured to already have made my choice. Rehearse what you're going to be ordering to yourself a few times before you reach the front and you'll do just fine. Cool facts- *Cafeteria style dining.. (that means no creepy old ladies taking your order with a fake southern twang) Simply.. 1) wait in line 2) order food 3) find a table 4) pick up your order when ready 5) dig in *you can purchase jars of their BBQ sauce or dry rub *call in your order if you don't wanna wait in line.. but if it's your first time.. pay your dues and get in that line! *sign up for their email club and you get a front of the line pass for your birfday (sorry no cheesy birthday song for ya) *open late night

I can't say enough good things about Phil's BBQ. The ribs are mouth watering and the prices are perfect. I tell everyone I know that hasn't tried Phil's to give it a try and they will be hooked just like I was after the first visit there.

We decided to go here with my daughters God Parents while visiting them in San Diego for Jacqueline's birthday. ÊThey warned us in advance that the line was going to be long but the line would go fast. ÊIt wasn't lighting fast but it went at a pretty decent pace. ÊFrom the moment we stepped inside and was directed to the counter to order, this place had their stuff squared away. ÊThey take a member of your party to get a seat ahead of time so you are not stuck fighting for a seat. ÊThe menu has enough things on it to choose from, but not so much so you are confused. ÊAdditionally, while you are waiting in line, they have the menu plastered in various parts so you know what you want before they take your order. ÊThey give you a pager for when your order is ready. ÊOur order was ready in about 5-8 minutes. ÊYou pick your order up at the window, but if you have a bunch of items in the order like ours, they are very kind to help you take it to your seat. ÊThere is plenty of condiments, paper towels, etc to help you devour your feast. ÊEveryone in our group with the exception of my son had the Broham, pulled pork sandwich. ÊJonathan had the Beef rib tickler. ÊAll I have to say is wow, I've never had BBQ like that before. ÊAttention all restaurants who are looking for an example of how your staff are supposed to treat the customers, Phil's BBQ is the place. ÊThey checked back with us often but not often enough to be annoying. ÊI wish we could rate their customer service, because I would have given them six stars. ÊNow a lot of my friends know me not to give out 5 stars because I feel that there is something that could always be improved upon, but with my 5 plus years working in the food/IT industry, I could not find anything that needed improvement. ÊKeep up the good work and we will definitely come back to Phil's BBQ on our next visit to SD.

I had lived in San Diego for three years before I first went to Phil's on September 16, 2010. ÊI don't know what kept me away, but I'm glad I had the chance to go. ÊI knew the wait would be long, so I was prepared for that. ÊThe staff who helped me and my friend while we were in line, when we were at the front of the line, and when we ordered were all great. Ê However, that's where my great experience ended. ÊOnce we got our food, I proceeded to get a drink. ÊI wanted a Diet Coke with caffeine in the worst way, so I went to the drink station and filled my cup with what was supposed to be Diet Coke. ÊUnfortunately, all of the Diet Coke dispensers were filled with regular Coke. ÊI then told a staff member, and she did a taste test and agreed with me. ÊShe told me that she would fix the problem, but she never did, and I spent the better part of the next hour trying to get someone to make this switch. Ê Don't get me wrong -- the food was great and I definitely see why people wait and hour plus to eat at Phil's. ÊI'm sure I will even return at some point in the future. ÊBut at this point, I am left with a bad taste in my mouth from this experience. ÊPhil's can get something right that is so hard to do -- good BBQ -- but it can't correct a simple soda mix-up.

Absolutely the best BBQ! Ever! Let me make it short...stop reading my review and get over there!!! If it's your birthday then you better go NOW!!! No waiting in line for birthday celebrants! It was my wife's birthday and we decided to have lunch at this place. To share to everyone, my wife doesn't like BBQ at all. It took a lot of convincing to get her interested. Plus reading the reviews here at yelp helped. Again, it's her birthday and I was worried that she'll be disappointed. So when we're about to order, I decided to order almost the whole main course. Full rack of baby back ribs, 2 beef ribs, tri-tip sandwich (El Toro), pulled pork sandwich and 3 small side dishes. The baby back and beef ribs falls of the bone and it's cooked perfectly. The pulled pork and tri-tip sandwich were so tender and juicy. Their BBQ sauce was tantalizing and full of balance of saltiness, sweetness, sourness and spiciness. Anyhow, here we go...I was patiently waiting for my wife's reaction and it only took one bite of the beef ribs then she's IN!!! It's like Pacman and Pacwoman doing there thing. After an hour, the only thing was left was the tri-tip sandwich, which we took for to go. We also bought a whoopie pie for dessert, Phil's dry rub and BBQ sauce. I beg you!!! Please go to Phil's BBQ asap!!! You won't regret it!

Okay so I've been coming here for years now, my parents took me to the old location in Mission Hills when I was a little girl and I've been going back for more ever sense. I must say since they have moved the line is a bit of a joke. I normally call when I am leaving my house and then by the time I get there my food is ready to take home and enjoy. Yesterday I decided to a meet a girlfriend for lunch and wait in line (ugg) The line actually only took about 15 minutes and I must say the ladies who were working were extremely friendly. I learned a great tip, the bar is first come first serve. So now for the food. I usually get the broham with coleslaw on top which is impossible to eat but I do it anyways. I also love the onion rings with ranch, amazing. I love Phil's every once in a while. YUMMMY and messy BBQ, what more could a girl want.

Dangg, I have to say Phil's is probably one of THE best places to eat in San Diego PERIOD. I discovered with when a friend told me about it a couple years ago and I havent stopped going ever since. The food is amazing for the cost ($12-20) and the portions are huge! What I love most about Phil's though are the fries that are covered in BBQ sauce. You don't find that anywhere and its actually a great idea. I highly recommend this place to ANYONE! unless ur a vegetarian. =)

By far one of the best BBQ ribs i have had, the sauce is sweet and delicious and the brisket falls off the bone. All of the sides are great and the onion rings are must have.

The only reason phils didnt get five stars out of the thousands of reviews is probably everyone knocked it down a star for the long wait. But that just means that the fooood is reallyy that good! I come here all the time and just recently went with a party of 30 for my friends birthday. The servers accommodated us quickly and efficiently. They were all on top of their game and I was very impressed. I always come here for the EL TORRRROOOO which id the best ever and THE WHOOPIEE PIES. You have to get the Whoopie pies seriously! This is the second thing I love about coming to Phil's. First being EL TORROOOO of course. I do wish they had better sides like mac n cheese or mashed potatoes...o well still delicious.

This is the most over-rated, over-hyped restaurant in San Diego. ÊThe quality of the food is actually good, I hasten to add. ÊBut if you are going expecting proper bbq, this isn't it. ÊThere's really no smokey flavor to speak of, and the sauce is this bizarre concoction that's more like chinese sweet and sour sauce than bbq sauce. As I said, the food is not bad, but given the price and the crowds and the general hype about this place I prefer to steer clear.

Phil's BBQ is one of my very favourite restuarants. Although, I liked the Mission Hills location better, the Mid-Way one is pretty neat too. When you are there you can splurge and get a huge, delicious full dinner of beef or pork ribs (both are equally sumptuous), or you could choose a lighter, cheaper, but nonetheless tasty, sandwich (the broham is my favourite, but the chicken is good too). My entire family and most of my friends crave Phil's BBQ on a daily basis and we usually go at least once a month.

I have had better BBQ in my life but I haven't had better in San Diego. The Best BBQ in San Diego by far! ÊNow without the hour and a half wait for your food from the old Mission Hills location, Phil's seems unstoppable. ÊStill a slight wait and a struggle to find a table during lunch and busy nights but it is so worth it. ÊRibs are great - dry rub style though so get the pulled meat if that is not your style. ÊI think I just drooled on myself just writing about Phil's.

Went here on Saturday night. ÊThere was a line but it moved fast, and soon we placed our order at the counter, seated ourselves and shortly they buzzed a little pager for us to come pick up our dinners. ÊWe got the rib and chicklets combo for $11, which included four or five pork ribs and some nice barbecued chicken, as well as barbecue beans and fries (or other sides, if you like). ÊI was verrrrrry happy with my meal. ÊMy brother had said Phil's was the best in San Diego, and he wasn't kidding. ÊI'll be back.

Phil's is amazing. I am blown away every time I go. My wife gets the Broham and I usually get the rib tickler or ribless dinner. The customer service is always on hit. My only complaint is that they close down for about a month over the christmas season. What are the Phil junkies supposed to do. I see myself rocking in the fetal position until they re-open. When I die I want to be laid to rest in a vat of their bbq sauce seriously. I have watched plenty of these travel shows on the food network and they have been to some good spots in San Diego but they haven't been to Phil's Êthey are definitely missing out on the Best BBQ in California and I have eaten BBQ all over the state.

Not the best ever, but definitely the best you're going to find in San Diego. ÊThe owner of Geno's needs to go here and take some notes. ÊThis place is a business marvel and I admire it greatly. ÊI've tried just about everything on the menu and you can't go wrong. ÊOne bit of advice though, if you go at lunch you should call ahead and get it to go because the line can get a bit long. ÊIf you do call ahead don't plan on eating it there because there is a Rib Nazi who will kick you out.

What a happy surprise Phils BBQ turned out to be. We went to San Diego on our honeymoon and while staying in Mission Beach happened upon this place on a Sunday night, only a 20 minute wait, which by the locals is unheard of. ÊThe food is really great for the price, and a good value since you don't have to tip, you order the food and pick-up yourself. Its a fun, casual atmosphere. If you like a bit more quiet sit outside. No lovely view, but the yummy tasting ribs make up for it. A must try while you are in San Diego. Way exceeds any Rachel Ray recommendations hands down.

went to phils the other day with some friends. dont be alarmed if you see a line outside because theres always a line! we got there around 5pm on a saturday and waited about 20 minutes in line. it seems they got a good technique down: they ask how many in your party, bring you up to the register to order, then by that time they've got a table ready for you, a very short while later they call you up and your food is ready at the counter. it sure beats the really long wait times at the old location on goldfinch. on to the food. pulled pork is good, but the sauce is a little on the the sweet side for my liking. onion rings are on point. the small order is plenty for two people to split. pork ribs were a tad on the dry side (maybe its the batch that i had). but again, the sauce a little overwhelming on it. if there was six stars, i'd rate it at a three. neither hate it nor like it.

I willingly make the trip from LA to SD just for phils. ÊYup, it's that good. Amazingly, every time I go, there's always long line of people that goes around the building. If you want to avoid the long line, you can go straight to the bar and order your food there but you have to eat there. Since it's a self sit in restaurant, they hand out pagers. You can ask the staff to help you get a table as you wait in line. After getting my food, I forgot to order a drink. ÊWhen I offered to buy a drink, they gave me a free drink. ÊI've done this twice. Ê I usually order the half rack of baby back ribs with sweet baked beans and fries. Ê/drool They have creole salt and this hot sauce which I both use to put on everything. ÊMmmmm. They have lots of TV's. They have cleaning stations which consists of automated faucets, foamed soap, and automated paper dispenser. I bought a shirt from phils and random people from LA recognized it.

Super delicious ribs doused in tangy sauce - loved it! And this coming from a 13 year vegetarian says a lot. I went to Phil's BBQ for the first time last night with my boyfriend + family and while the atmosphere is a little chaotic (line around the building, paper towel rolls needed everywhere) the restaurant help was super friendly and constantly asking if we needed anything and the food was delish. Steamed veggies were fresh and crispy (like steamed should be) and the onion rings were some of the best I've ever had. I had the beef ribs instead of the baby back and I'm proud to say the beef are better. yum.

By far the most overrated restaurant in SD. I love BBQ but this is not BBQ sauce it is sugar that is why so many people like it.. just the sweet tooth. I like real pit BBQ that tastes like a rib ate a tree and they both caught on fire. Not like... that cow musta been a diabetic. I know there is a shortage of good BBQ in California in general but just because it might not be as bad as most of them does not make them good.

Good BBQ for a place not in the South. I've spent most of my life down South so finding great BBQ in other regions is usually a tough task. But Phil's was pretty good. I had baby back ribs with onion rings and fries. The onion rings were especially good. The ribs were sweet and fell right off the bone perfectly. Phil's also has the coldest beer taps I've ever seen and the Stone IPA I had here was the perfect compliment to my meal. Service was great, the bartender was very friendly and even took the time to learn our names which added a nice personal feel. My friend who took me here is a local and says that the best way to beat the usual lines is to head straight to the bar and order there, then you can also sit and have beers while you wait on your food.

Phil's BBQ was great! I got the Best of Both Meal which had the ribs and chicken. It came with two sides. The ribs were very good. The BBQ sauce was lathered on just right and had this tangy kick to it. ÊThe chicken was moist and not dry at all. Very good experience eating there. They also provide you with a bib for when your grill gets all dirty with BBQ sauce. There's no need to be shy when eating here. Pretend like you are a baby and dig in.

OK we've been back since the last visit and this place came back with flying colors!. Man were we treated like some sort of VIP (and were def not) I joked to my husband "hey maybe they know it was me who gave the bad review the last time" We stood in the long-ish line because we had kids otherwise we woulda hit the other side. Maybe a 20 min wait. no big deal. While we were in line we were greeted by a very friendly staff member in line. She treated us like we were long lost family, talked to my girls and really was very nice. Everyone from that point on was so helpful and courteous. Right to the time we sat down to eat they brought us plates an extra paper towels asked if we need refills. I tell you they really are on the ball when it comes to customer service. The food was very good. We were very happy and we'll be back.

Ever since they moved from their previous location, the quality is lacking a bit. Don't get me wrong, the food is great but not what it use to be. In San Diego, this might be the best place to get some BBQ at a fair price. When I go here, I tend to order the baby-back pork ribs or "The Tickler". Honestly, when I host guest from out of town; I tend to bring them here. But be careful, if you get someone from Texas or somewhere in the Midwest.. They'll say this place taste "OK". Born and raised San Diego, this BBQ is pretty good. They give you a healthy servicing size so there's no way you can't be full. WARNING! You may experience some food coma after eating here! Tip: If you see an extremely long line out the door, phone it in real quick and go straight into the left line (much faster). Pros: Price, location and great takeout ordering system Cons: Too much sauce on everything (but you can request for it on the side).

Maybe I am a contrarian. Perhaps I was told too many good things about it. There is even the slight possibility that I am just crazy and don't know a good thing when I taste one...but, well, I just don't care about Phil's bbq. A long line usually signals good things to come. But there is something odd about this one. What I am looking for in a long line at a bbq place is a group of large, older men, who talk loud and knowingly about the bbq they had one time in the good ol' days. Not a single one there. This alone makes me afraid, not afraid enough to abort this outing however, especially since I am with a friend and leaving for such a simple reason would seem silly. Standing in the line, I feel a great disturbance; the air...the air is so relatively clear. What I do smell is not the aromatic face punch that accompanies barbecued meat. I smell cars and the sweat of people who are standing in the sun. "Hey boys! Ever been here before?!" Oh good lord, what was that? My confusion due to the non-barbecued air allowed a greeter to sneak up on me and my compatriot gave me no warning. There is fear in the air and I think she senses my weakness; her smile grows as I answer in the negative. "Well welcome!" My god, so many exclamation points. "You boys like to dance?!" Please, please, please...if I survive, I will go to church, I will be a good boy, I'll call my parents more often and help the elderly. By a miracle, the person next to me thinks she is talking to him and she parades off. Only a few more minutes to order. To the menu. Ribs, chicken, burgers...no brisket? Excuse me? How do you have a bbq shop without brisket? And by "how do you," I mean "how dare you." Alright, alright, everything is going fine. Ribs. There are ribs here. Order that. So to the order. Best of both, which is pork ribs and chicken. A beef rib. Sides of french fries and cole slaw. It comes quickly. Okay, everything looks good. But I make a mistake, my hand reaches first for a french fry. I chew. Chew again. Oh...oh come on. This is pitiful. The fry is almost cold and only has a little hint of crispiness at the ends. My comrade notices and asks what is wrong, perhaps slightly worried since it was his idea to come here. A smile reassures that all is well. I was just thinking of something else, which is technically correct; I am thinking of the last time I had good fries. Fine, Phil's bbq is not known because of the sides, time to turn towards that queue of meat. Pork ribs are the first sacrifice. After two or three ribs, my mind is a blank. Sure the ribs were basically floating in a decent sauce that was probably applied after the meat was cooked, but what about the meat itself? Is it dry or tender? Cooked well or burnt? Again, my mind is blank. The nuclear blast of sauce has destroyed any ability to discern whether the meat is good or not. Try the chicken instead, that isn't smothered in sauce. Well, it did have a smokey undertone and the meat had to do more work than the pork; it did that work adequately, like a temp. There was nothing to hate about it...there was nothing to feel about it. No, it just was. All the while, workers are hovering "Can I help you?" "Hi, my name is X and if you need anything just ask." Round and round he goes. I would love to ignore his presence, but that means I would have to focus on the food. My friend, being the perceptive sort, notices the displeasure. "What do you like the most?" A question with a lot of room for an answer. "The beef rib was by far the best. A good amount of meat with not so much bbq sauce," is the honest answer. We let it rest there. And so will I.

The wait wasn't nearly as bad as I expected, considering the line was around the side of the building and behind the 21-minute mark. ÊThe baby back ribs were excellent - very tender, but the sauce was much sweeter and less smoky than I would have liked. ÊThe sides we got with our ribs were fries, potato salad, baked potato, steamed veggies - everything was very good. ÊService was also quick and friendly. ÊReally where I didn't find it mind-blowing was the sauce - I like to have a mix of sweet and savory and theirs was almost like eating dessert. 4/5 for you.

i went to phil's in the past week with the gf and one of her friends, i heard the food is soo good sooo i had to try it. we were running late and the kitchen closed at 10pm sharp on thursday. so we rushed over there and had 10 minutes to order, we ordered, the full rack of ribs meal with a corn on the cob side, a 1/2 chicken meal with macaroni salad, a side of onion rings and 2 cokes, total about $33.. i know.. soo we found a table, and took a seat, i think we probably waited about 15 minutes, at this point we were starved.. then it happened... Ê our number was called *choir music*.. after bringing the 3 hot trays back to the table the food smelled delicious, and the fact that i can see the ribs and bbq chicken just covered in bbq sauce just made my mouth water. at first i was a little hesitant to use my hands, but after seeing that i could not fully enjoy the experience i dug right in. the meat was moist and tender, it was great, unfortunately the sides were ok, as far as the corn, after seeing the pictures of how much fries you could get the fact we got 1 corn on the cob as our large side seemed a little sad. haha and the macaroni salad needed some more mayo in it, i know its isnt good to eat mayo, but comon this place doesnt even serve salad, why not seal the deal and put more mayo! lolz.. after we were done eating, you could see we were all stuffed and very happy. the busser was really quick to clear off our table which was great! basically, loved phils, and if i didnt have to drive 2 hours to get there i'd go tonight..

Definitely a hot spot for San Diego. I been told by numerous friends that I should check this place out if I ever make it out to SD. I did for the first time yesterday and it was great. I had a half rack of baby back ribs, and half rack of beefy ribs and sides of bake potato, french fries, mac salad, and onion rings. The meat was very tender indeed. The sides were ok and was not anything to brag about. The line is long to get in but the food comes up rather fast so it would be about the same as any other restaurant. I wouldnt say its my favorite bbq place but its definitely a San Diego gold mine.

my favorite is the baby back rib. very well marinated and the meat literally falls off the bone. the BBQ chicken is decent. beefy rib is also good. it has a stronger taste but the meat is noticeably tougher. the side dishes are mediocre. you can't really go wrong with fresh cut fries, corn, Êcole slaw, and potato salad. customer service was great. although it's more of a self service dining. they still have people going around to offer services. sort of like pat and oscars. try to beat the lunch/dinner rush though. the line gets super long!

This was a real experience! Ê We tried to visit Phil's the night before but the line was so long and the place was packed out. ÊWe went back at lunch time and although it was really full the line was short and we stopped. ÊWow! ÊI'm glad we did. ÊI am not a BBQ fan, but I loved the chicken breast burger. It was so fresh, hot and spicy/sweet- mmmm. The three ribs, fries and cole slaw was not cheap but it was really tasty and good. ÊWe sat out on the porch and although the tables and chairs are not particularly charming it was ok for our quick visit. ÊThe waiter out there was really helpful and attentive. ÊGreat lunch!

Really good BBQ - This place deserves 5-starts but the line, my gosh the line is a story in itself. It is worth the wait, or if you are smart come early in the afternoon or sit at the bar. Definitely the best BBQ in San Diego, maybe in all of So cal, I still have a few favorite spots but this place satisfies.

The food is perfect and big. ÊI split a full rack of ribs with my wife and we had left overs. ÊThe sides are big. ÊMaxine was amazing, helpful, kind, and when I asked what her favorites were she said the baby back ribs, and the Broham. ÊThe Broham ( pulled pork) Êis huge for $6.45. ÊShe didn't just say everything is good like you hear when you ask this at some restaurants. She even advised to get the coleslaw on the side to put on ourselves. ÊI am sure everything is good here. Ê Cory was our server and couldn't have been more helpful. ÊWhen I asked Cory to get us crackers, or bread as our two kids were restless and hungry, he said how about a couple of french fries. ÊWhen he came back to the table he said the kitchen gave him more than a few fries it was a small basket. ÊIf Phil reads this I want him to know that Cory didn't give us a full order, but it was more than a few fries. ÊNo charge at all. ÊHow nice of them. ÊWho does that in the restaurant business. ÊEven if he had to charge us for the fries it was ok, and we expected to be charged, but it was quick and took care of our kids. Smart business. We went this year to Dallas for the best rated barbecue by Dallas magazine in 2010. ÊIt was great as stated, but ÊPhil's is better, and you get more food for the money here. Ê I do not say this lightly. ÊWhen you go out to eat you want better food than you can cook at home, and you want food that you don't have the equipment to make it properly. ÊThat is why you have to eat at this is the place. The to go process is so well organized, and the eating there is also well organized. Ê I will say if you are very hungry you might Êwant to eat something small before as the wait can be over an hour easily to get in. ÊI would go when you aren't so hungry, or call it in to go. Ê I would get it to go with small kids. ÊThe kids won't wait that long patiently. Ê If a restaurant has over an hour wait most of the days it is open, they must be doing something right. Ê I have also never seen a restaurant with almost 2000 reviews on yelp as they have. If you haven't had a meal here. ÊYou have to go now. ÊThere is another location opening in San Marcos, CA in a few weeks. ÊEveryone is already talking about this as I live in San Marcos. I heard about the new San Marcos location at the park with the kids. Ê If you don't like Phil's you either don't like barbecue, or you don't like to eat food. Seriously I would give them 6 stars if it was an option. ÊAfter typing this now, I am going to Phil's today for lunch, and it is a 40 minute drive each way for us, but worth it.

I wouldn't say this is the best BBQ place ever, but it's pretty damn good. The line is sometimes insane, but sometimes there are no lines. I love the beefy ribs because they are drenched with the BBQ sauce. The french fries are good too because it's fresh cut. Phil's is definitely a great place to bring friends and family who aren't native to SD. Also the price isn't too bad for the food.

I am not a BBQ fan, but the sauce blew me away! Sweet and tangy but not overwhelming. Rarely do I eat Chicken when I order out, but the chunks of chicken breast were tender and juicy with just the right amount of sauce. It was so good that when my conscious started questioning if the chicken was hormone and gmo free, pastured and cruelty free, my taste buds promptly dismissed my snobby organic standards. I would not have cared if the chicken was crated all its life, lived in its own feces and had breast bigger than mine, I would have still gobbled Phil's BBQ up! Even the french fries, onion rings, and macaroni salad were delicious. And I dislike onion rings and macaroni salad. ÊMy boyfriend has even associated being new our new home when he smells Phil's as we near our place.

Yay! I am so glad that I get a second chance to come here again. I brought two other friends to try out Phil's. Crazy long lines outside the door. It's wrapped around all over the parking lot. Geez guys.. what a great way to scare my friends. They thought we were nuts, but I swear to you Phil's is that good! We went to the bar area, and we were so lucky to find seats. We didn't want to stand in the crazy line. Brad was the one that was taking care of us that night. GREAT customer service. He needs to be recognize for his service. He was more than nice, he provided us with a comfort that not many people possess now and days. So we were already full, and we wanted to share, so we ordered the half ribs to share with fries, and corn. Good golly the ribs were just as great if not better from the first time we had it. The meat were succulent and tender. Now this is how you should make ribs! The BBQ was not too strong, it was just right. I could not stop eating the it. Man! Looks like I might have to come down to SD more often just for some Phil's ribs!! This is a GREAT ESTABLISHMENT and I can only see growth in this business. Great service, fast,large amount, and delicious! There is nothing more that you can ask for. I would come here everyday if given the gas and the money. We had a pitcher of Stella to wash down our food. YUM! We also tried their Whoopee pie... I love the cream in the middle. This was a great experience. (=

i would NEVER wait in the long ass line that is constantly wrapped around the building, but i did order take out. and it was like a dream. the best ribs i have ever had, and i'm originally from iowa where if anything is perfect, it should be the meat since it was slaughtered around the corner. Êso, call ahead and order takeout, and eat at home.

i love barbecues and who doesn't during the summer? i went to visit San Diego over 4th of July weekend and decided to hit up this highly reviewed place for an American independence Êday feast. my boyfriend suggested the place based on all of the positive yelp reviews and I was so glad he did. It was delicious, so delicious! I can't rave enough about the meat quality and the sauce. When we arrived, the line was snaking around the restaurant. We knew the wait could be as long as 2 hrs so decided to do take out instead. The line for that was manageable but still a bit long because they pack your order right when you get there to maintain freshness. We probably waited for 20 minutes before we got to the front of the line. When we got up to the counter to pay, the cashier had the food packed up and ready and was super friendly. They run the place like a well oiled machine managing the lines pretty well and getting things done efficiently. We took the food back to our hotel and chowed down and I gotta say the first bit was like ecstasy. If you love meat, you'll love how well cooked it is. It falls off the bone easily, there is no chewing involved almost, it's that soft! The sauce they use is not overpowering and compliments the meat well. I got the Best of both Worlds, half baby back ribs and half chicken and my boyfriend got the full rack of ribs. If I had to choose, the baby back ribs were a bit more savory then the chicken but that didn't mean I didn't enjoy my humongous chicken drumstick either! My boyfriend eats a lot and still couldn't finish 3 of the ribs so the portions are large. But it's so delicious you don't care until you've realized you're completely stuffed. We also ordered the onion rings and while I don't like them in general, the ones here are not bad. They're crispy and understated, complementing the rich BBQ aroma of the meat. I also got the mac and cheese as a side dish and loved their twist on the classic. I can't really describe what they put in there but it's pretty good. All in all, I will definitely revisit this BBQ establishment again when I head down to San Diego again. It's popular for a reason and I'm glad I got to enjoy this little piece of BBQ heaven.

I would give one star, but I think that then nobody would take it seriously. ÊPlus the actual Pork rib meat had good smoky flavor and they alone without sauce deserve a 4 plus star rating. Ê I grew up in Oklahoma and spent a lot of time in texas. ÊBBQ is big where I come from. ÊI have had Lots of Good BBQ and plenty of bad BBQ. ÊThis is the 3rd time I've had Phil's. ÊWe were going to try Abbey's tonight (Saturday) but they were closed. I gave it 3 chances. ÊThe Corn on the cob was pretty good. ÊThe kids "Tickler" plate of Chicken Brest was pretty Good. ÊI have a big problem with the sauce though. ÊBoth my wife and I find it WAY too sweet. ÊIf they offered some other Sauces, I might go for the ribs. ÊNow for the Bad. I ordered the Toro Sandwich. ÊIt was inedible. ÊSmelled like B.O. ÊSeriously. ÊI threw it in the trash and ate most of my wife's pulled pork sandwich which was merely Bad. ÊBut at least it was edible. Incidentally I ate at Kaminski's BBQ in Poway for Lunch. ÊI had the Carolina Pulled Pork Sandwich. ÊIt was Excellent. ÊTheir Brisket is good too. ÊNext time, My 25 minutes will be spent driving to poway instead of waiting in line at Phil's. FYI. ÊThis review comes from a person who loves food. ÊI will eat just about anything and I will always try something a second time if I didn't like it the first time. ÊI plan to write some positive reviews for some joints I do like. ÊIt's just that I am blown away that Phil's is considered the Best BBQ in town. ÊI will try some other BBQ joints that are rated well. ÊBut maybe if Phil's is the best San Diego can do, This means there may be room in the market for some Restauranteur with a good BBQ Recipe. ÊSorry For Hatin' Phil.

Note: Jim gives it a 3.75, while Lane gives it a full 4. we ordered: a half-rib dinner with potato salad and french fries and a half-chicken dinner with beans and macaroni salad. Lane: i was expecting a lot before i came and I was pleasantly surprised about the quality of the meat. i liked the sauce but its on the sweet side and the french fries were really good. the potato salad was kind of plain but tasted fine with a little bit of salt. Jim: the sauce was really good and flavorful with a little bit of smoky spiciness in it. the meat of the chicken wasn't as great as everyone made it sound, but it was still pretty solid. i wish it was juicier. the beans were very hearty (and sweet in a good way according to Lane) and the macaroni salad was pretty plain.

LOVVEEE this place. Large portions, cheap, good, what more can you ask for? A large fry is a whole plate so just split it with someone. The broham is the best. About $10 a person and dont need to leave too big of a tip since your not really waited on. Bomb, go there.

Best BBQ (maybe ever). Every person I have brought here thinks it is amazing. My fave is the ribs and chick-less with Cole slaw and baked beans, get it EVERY time. Only bummer is the place just gets so busy sometimes that the wait can be painful, especially if you are starving and have to be tortured by the delicious BBQ scents filling the air. I thinks it's a good idea to call it in if it's a really busy time. Or a little trick I just learned- you can order at the bar. Go in and grab a beer while you wait for the delicious food.

But once we got to the register, got out buzzer, after getting our drinks and sitting down at a table...literally 3 mins later...our buzzer went off and the food was ready! WOW! not only that, but one of employees circling around offered to get our food...how awesome is that! this place is great. we arrived bout 645pm or so and the line was hella long. when we left bout 830pm the line was still just as long. people are down to eat here no matter how long the line is!

the first time i went to phils my boss dragged me to the location on goldfinch at lunchtime, where we waited for an hour. I was pissed, i turned to him and said "these better be the best ribs ive ever tasted". since we were so late we took it to go, and once i sat down and started to eat i turned to him and said " these are the best ribs ive ever tasted"!

Went there on a Tuesday night. Luckily, we got there before the line extended and wrapped around the building. Probably waited around 20 minutes before we ordered. I had the beef ribs and friend had the baby back ribs. Just like the reviews say, the meat is fall of the bone goodness. The sauce was a little strong on the vinegar, but it was good overall. Biting into the meat left hints of smoke flavor and bbq sauce. This place is definitely not overhyped. Lived in Orlando for 2 years and this place is pretty damn good!

Just do it. Won't regret it. Tip: If possible, go on an odd hour during a weekday cuz weekends, it wraps around the restaurant. p.s. Pork is better. Don't get beef.

SWEET HOLY JESUS, as my son would say. ÊThis is the SHIZNIT. ÊPork ribs are THE BOMB, the chickless is heaven, NO BONES about it. ÊLOL ÊI didn't like the potato salad, I like my own better with mustard - too much FREAKN mayo, PHIL and add some damn salt. ÊThis was the first time I got the onion rings because my friend wanted them and they were delicious, eat them while they are HOT because I found them a little soggy when they cooled. ÊI also got the baked beans and they were wonderful. ÊI always get the same thing, but next time no potato salad, probably corn on the cob or the mac salad that someone suggested. ÊWhat's missing is cornbread or a biscuit, although this aint KFC folks! This past weekend we went and of course, we got there kinda late and the line was out the door. ÊI was up for the wait, even though I was starving, because I love this place, but my friend and the kids didn't want to wait, so we called it in from the parking lot (got a menu from outside - sent the kids for that errand) and in 20 mintues, we were at Crown Point beach mackn on some RIBS! ÊNext time, I will order the pulled pork, though because I heard it's awesome. ÊI want to go there again today I love it so much, but I guess it's closed Monday and I still have left overs from Saturday! ÊThe portions are awesome and the only other suggestion I would have is the wax paper under the food rips and is a soggy damn mess when you get through, but love the paper towels on the table and the wet naps.

The line was insane! When I first got there I was like no way I'm going to wait in this line. But the line was well worth the wait. It was about 35 minutes when I went on a Saturday night which wasn't too bad I guess. Anybody who would rate this anything less than 5 stars is crazy! This place is amazing and has the best ribs I've ever eaten. I had the full rack of ribs with some corn on the cob. The ribs were very moist and fell right off the bone and the corn was delicious as well.

I would give it 5 stars however there are 2 things happening since they moved to Point Loma. 1.- The lines are just to long, you should consider dinner reservations. 2.- The quality of the food is deteriorating since they are handling higher volume of orders. In several instances, the food is cold or slightly warm.

The Best Ribs I have eaten so far. ÊI have had ribs in Memphis and Chicago and PHil's is hands down the best. ÊI also gave this place five stars because now they are located in a bigger establishment on Sports Arena Blvd. and they have put in a beer and wine bar. ÊI am contemplating flying out to San DIego just to have them. Phil when are you going to open up more of these across the country. ÊSeriously lets talk.

If you like BBQ and don't mind waiting in line...(WORTH THE WAIT), then this is for you. This is the absolute best BBQ I have ever had, and I love BBQ. The tickler is the best if your not too hungry. They have the best BBQ sauce and they also cater. If your ever by the Sports Arena and are hungry, you shouldn't pass this place up!

YUM! ÊAfter watching the food network for an hour about BBQ, we had a craving. So we headed down to Phil's, after a 30-45 wait we had both beef and pork ribs and loved them both, though preferred the beef. ÊA great place for large parties and messy tasty bbq! ÊIf you don't want to dine-in and wait in their ever present line, order the take-out and enjoy at home.

I think this place is sort of overrated. My friends hyped it up a lot. I thought it was decent but nothing to go crazy over. This is a seat yourself place. The line can get super long, so try to avoid dinner/lunch rushes. It's good to go if you have a friend to share it with so you can split the price. Full racks are about $20, you can also get half rack or go with cheaper chicken option, or do samplers. The ribs are nice and meaty, but the sauce isn't outstanding- it's very tangy. It could use more flavor. Comes with 2 small sides or 1 large side. I tried macaroni salad, potato salad, fries, and baked beans. The salads are not that great. Fries are ok. Baked beans are good (very sweet), but it's too heavy to eat with all that meat and bbq sauce. If you want green salad you have to buy it seperately. Drinks- they have a bar but they only serve beer or wine or sangria. What I like about this place is they have beef ribs. It's bigger and more meaty than baby back ribs. You should definitely give it a try, since it's not something you can easily find at other restaurants.

I went in on a Friday evening. The line to get in wrapped around the building; I ended up waiting for around 80 minutes. If you're one of those who are okay with waiting in line for roller coaster rides like Goliath, then you can wait for Phil's BBQ. It was well worth the wait when I actually got to sit down and take a bite out of that melt-off-the-bone baby back rib. GOTS DAYUM that was bomb. I shared a half rack with a girl friend of mine and shared a thing of onion rings, which was also fantastic. Half a baby back rib dinner will get ANY person who eats a normal portion full. For what you get, the price is very reasonable. The atmosphere is very fun. They've got the season's sports playing and some music to play along with the Texan theme they've got going. Four stars all around baby. Just didn't like the wait.

My brother suggested this place. He told me the BBQ was amazing experience and I needed to go, so my mom took his advice and planned my Dad's 50th bday here. I arrived early so I could reserve a table ahead of time for about 15 guests. And when I got there there was a HUGE line. (like all the way around the corner of the restaurant.

Great pungent and delicious bbq. My entire family loved this, I had the ribs, wifey and kids had chicken and sandwiches. You usually have to wait outside but the line moves and its worth an hour wait. Kind of like a cafeteria where you order at the counter, pickup you grub and find a seat. Lots of room, but this is a destination restaurant. You won't be dissappointed. If you like people watching this place piles em in.

Waited an hour and half in line which was not bad at all cause we met some pretty cool people in line. Ê The food came out fast! ÊWhich was really nice the line starved me. ÊNot only that, but the food was really affordable The bibs that they have, have a little trough at the bottom that really do catch pieces of food as they drop down while you're devouring your food. ÊAnd hey, after you're all done, you can finish up those last bits if you're still looking for more food. The food was great with really tender meat just falling off the bone. ÊThe beef bone was GREAT (I'd recommend it over the baby back ribs to be honest). ÊThe onion rings were just warm but were still delicious when dipped into the ranch sauce. ÊThe fries were decent, but I wouldn't recommend them if you can avoid them (I'd rather put that money into some more beef bones if you ask me). The only thing that irked me a little was the very loud environment. ÊI felt that I had to talk very loud to be heard by the people I was with, but it wasn't a big deal because it's not supposed to be a quiet restaurant in the first place. Verdict: The food is amazing for the price. ÊGreat place for college students.

Definitely 5 stars for the food (delicious), but 3 for the LONG lines and atmosphere (i.e. not a place you'd want to chill in for too long), so I give it an average of 4 stars.

Found about this place online and had to give it a try. Called in to get directions and was told there was an hour and a half wait.

We still had to wait about fifteen minutes for our pickup order but Êthe food was worth it and more. We got the full slab of baby backs and chicken BBQ and beans. The meat practically fell off the bone cause it was so tender. Mmmmmm good food!!! Now I know why the lines are so long there.

What can I say that the 1500 other reviews already haven't. This place is the shit tho! Worth driving 2 hours just to get some. (Just realized I sound like some Horny-ass dude) Babybacks & Chicken- Yum Mac Salad - Delish Potato Salad- decent, not a red potato gal O-rings- I LOVE their onion rings.... seriously I come down here just for those suckers. BBQ Buckham- My friend ordered this (We call him the 'Hoover' u can figure it out) this mess filled him up to the brim. Wish there was one in LA. We love it! Our wasitbands definitely do not. Oh we've been lucky... I think our longest wait in line was 20 mins. *knock on wood* Shareing is Caring. You may be greedy and think "NO! I will not share this deliciousness with them."

As a lover and huge connoisseur of baby back ribs, I had heard great things about Phil's BBQ. ÊHowever, I'd have to say I was pretty disappointed. ÊThe service and atmosphere was great, but the ribs just didn't deliver. ÊThe ribs had way too much BBQ sauce on them and the sauce was very spicy and tangy, definitely not one of the better BBQ sauces I've had for baby back ribs. ÊIf it's not broke don't fix it, traditional BBQ sauce has been used to make delicious baby back ribs for centuries and messing with it can really ruin ribs as is the case at Phil's. ÊThe ribs are very tender and cooked well, sadly though, a bad sauce can really ruin good ribs. ÊMy advice to them would be to get a new BBQ sauce because unfortunately it ruins an otherwise good restaurant.

Not only is the food the best ever - the service is beyond amazing! We went to Phil's last night for my son's 12th birthday because it is his favorite place to eat. It didn't matter that it is 2 hours from our house!! It's that good!! Anyone can tell you how amazing the food is and how the onion rings are addictive!! But I want to talk about the service! We had 7 people in our party and three of the staff went beyond the call of normal service to ensure that we were seated and happy and they even sang to my son which I didn't know they did there!!

Mmmmm, how could anyone not like Phil's? I've lived in the area for several years, but surprisingly I had never been inside this San Diego institution until just recently. It was one of those places I had always heard about and had been meaning to try, but just never got around to. Finally, a couple of my friends decided that it was time to pop my Phil's cherry. At first, I was put off by the line to get in that wrapped around the back of the building. I'm not a very patient person to begin with, and when I'm hungry I'm even worse. But once I caught a glimpse of the expressions on the happy, finger-licking patrons inside, the wait really didn't seem all that bad anymore. I ordered the Broman (pulled pork sandwich) and macaroni salad, and my friend and I split an order of onion rings, which all together came to about $10 for each of us. Portions were big - there was so much meat piled on my sandwich that I couldn't see the bottom half of my bun for most of my meal. I'm pretty sure they lace the macaroni salad with crack. I seriously couldn't stop eating that stuff. The only downsides to this place are the small and ever-crowded parking lot; the long line at the front door; and that overly-full, heavy feeling you experience when you leave. Oh, and they charge extra for a side of ranch dressing, which seemed odd for a sit-down establishment.

I'll qualify this review by stating that a) I'm a fan of North Carolina BBQ, which is a whole different animal (chopped, slow cooked meat with a vinegary and not sweet sauce) b) that aside, I don't eat beef or pork. ÊYeah, I know, what was I doing at a BBQ place? ÊI was taking my boyfriend out to be nice. ÊHe ordered ribs, which I thought were a little pricey, and I ordered the BBQ chicken sandwich. ÊBoth portions were generous, his ribs were slathered in sauce, and my chicken was also drowning in sauce. ÊYuck. ÊIf you are a fan of the red/sweet/spicy sauce, you'll be fine. ÊI am not, and I found it too sweet and way too overpowering for the chicken (not that the chicken really made an attempt to have its own flavor). ÊThe meat was dry, and after a couple of bites I gave up trying to pretend I liked it. ÊI got my sandwich to go and my boyfriend had it for lunch the next day. ÊHe did love his ribs, but he's never had NC BBQ so what does he know. Ê On the overall experience - we were there early (before 6 pm) on a Wednesday night and were lucky to snag a seat at the bar with no wait. ÊPlace was hopping. ÊThe bartender was nice, and chatted with us. ÊWhen he noticed I didn't like my food he asked me if anything was wrong and recommended getting the sauce on the side next time (if there is a next time). Ê We had a nice chat about regional BBQ variations. ÊNo complaints on service. Ê Overall, I wouldn't go back, but it is mostly because I am not a BBQ fan in general. ÊTwo stars because chicken was overcooked, prices were high, sides had to be ordered separately, and they didn't have hush puppies on the menu. ÊIf you don't like BBQ, don't go here expecting to find non-BBQ items on the menu. ÊIt is BBQ centric. ÊAnd vegetarians beware - they don't cater to you. ÊSo expect to make a meal of the sides.

Well you already know how good the food is, so let me expound on their EXCELLENT SERVICE as well. ÊWent with 9 peeps for the king's birthday celebration...as per usual, the line was long but that's never been a deal breaker, they had the hot heaters suntanning our heads so we were good. As soon as we were within eyeshot of the host, he came right over and asked how many were in our party, and IMMEDIATELY whisked us away to the magic land...to make it even easier for us, he took our order at the table, AND delivered our food!!! His fellow co-worker made sure to load us up on extra sauces, wet naps, silverware, etc, and came back often to make sure we were all fat happy campers! ÊI hooked them up with a ginormous tip and the left over birthday cake (take note people, the servers like cake too) and all was good in the hood...Thank you to Phil and his crew for yet another awesome dining experience.

I think this is one of those places that is constantly packed because of the buzz. I've been here several times and had both their pork and beef ribs, and am usually underwhelmed. Today was typical of my Phil's experiences. The beef ribs were tough and I had to work to rip the meat off. The pork ribs were far from falling off the bone, and the meat was dry(not from a lack of sauce) and chewy. There was also too much char. Good bbq can have some char, but there was so much that a lot of my bites tasted like the black bits that you get after you scrape the grill. As other level-headed reviewers have mentioned, it's overcooked. The sauce also ranges from being too tangy to too sweet. What Phils gets right is the rockin rib joint atmosphere. The place is loud, fun, and perennially packed (the lines are legendary), with lots of wood and flat screens. The employees are friendly and the onion rings are huge, delicious, and dipped in a traditional wet batter, not that modern cornmeal or panko crap. I'm not saying you can't have a good time at Phil's, or that their food is always inedible. But it definitely doesn't live up to the ridiculous wait times or its "best bbq" reputation.

This was my first time here tonight. I waited in line for 35 minutes. Which sucked, but chatting with my friend actually made the time fly by. ÊWhen I got close to the entrance one of the female workers approached us and asked, "How many?" We answered two. The worker then stared at me and softly said, " So two, me and you." ÊI kind of blushed. ÊMy crazy friend said, "Be gay so she'll hook us up." ÊThe worker then told us there were seats over at the bar and told me to come over to her. My friend went to her and came right back. My friend said the worker probably wanted to hit on me some more. Talk about assertiveness. ÊSo we finally approach a cashier and he was full of jokes. ÊWe order the half-slab baby back ribs, bbq beans and cole slaw. ÊI get the buzzer. ÊWe get our drinks and sit down at a booth. 5 minutes later the buzzer vibrates and we get our food. ÊThe ribs were very tender and the meat just fell off the bone. The sauce was very vinegary and tangy. I like my bbq sauce a bit sweeter. ÊThe coleslaw was yummy and creamy. ÊThe baked beans were interesting. It tasted like bacon or something, I usually like it sweeter. All in all, I thought it was alright and I'd go again minus having to wait in line ;)

Don't be afraid of the long line!! It actuall goes pretty quickly, even when it's on the side of the building(30 min). It's the best bbq around. It's no Rudy's, but it's defanately worth the trip. Customer service is excellent, the people are really nice and make the wait tollerable. It's missing sliced brisket, sausage, chopped beef, po' boys, rolls, and green beans, but hey... what they have is D-LISH.

For my birthday, my daughter wanted to take me out to dinner at Phil's BBQ. ÊBy the time we left the house, it was after 8 p.m. ÊBy the time we arrive at Phil's BBQ, customers were backed up in line almost around the building. ÊI said, "I'm not waiting in that line? ÊI think I can put on a great BBQ so the next day around 4 p.m. we tried it again and I decided to see if the long line was worth the wait. ÊAfter almost a hour in line, I placed my order. ÊI ordered the "Pork Baby Back Dinner" with potato salad, cole slaw and onion rings. ÊThe wife ordered the Pulled Pork Sandwich. ÊThe Baby Backs were slightly charred but tender and very good. ÊThe cole slaw was not as good as mine, but good. ÊThe potato salad wasn't that great. ÊThe potatoes were under cooked and lacking taste. ÊThe onion rings I had were "over-cooked". ÊAs far as the wife's pulled pork sandwich, she said the meat was dry? ÊI know why the meat was "dry" Phil? ÊOn the other hand, Phil's BBQ Sauce matched my favorite, Tony Roma. ÊI even purchased two bottles because it's very good. ÊTrust me! The atmosphere was great, hanging out with the family, but if I had to do it all over again, call ahead and do the take out.

Phil's is good, but it's not good enough to line up for an hour like everyone does. ÊThe babyback ribs are tender and the sauce is ok, not the best I've tried, but it is good.

It's sad that it's taken this long for me to review Phil's but I just ate there two days ago so I figured I mind as well do it while it's still fresh in my mind. Don't get me wrong Phil's is great, best BBQ in San Diego hands down. It only gets three stars though because I've had better BBQ, and to be honest a few days ago the stuff I had, which is usually amazing, just wasn't giving me that satisfaction I so greatly anticipated. I had the BBQ Cheese Burger which before had been one of my favorite burgers ever, but this time they forgot the onion ring on it, and I didn't realize till halfway in. I also ordered the El Toro solely because it was featured on Man V. Food. I was pleasantly surprised with the amount of trip tip that accompanied the sandwich, but it just didn't taste as amazing as it should have. The sandwich itself was almost too simple to be delicious, just meat, bread, and bbq sauce; which I've seen done way better at way less known joints. The onion rings are the best part in my opinion, but some of them have to much extra fried batter stuck to them, and it demoralizes me whilst eating them. The BBQ sauce that everyone raves about is not the best, trust me people I have had much better (Lucilles/Famous Daves). I love Phil's though, and it's always a great place to eat if you don't mind lines.

Finally had Phils BBQ after hearing the hype. ÊThe line is usually pretty long, we waited about 45min. ÊThere is free lemon/cucumber infused water while you are waiting in line which is pretty cool. ÊWhen your up, you go and order your food, and find a table to sit. ÊThen they will buzz you up to grab your food, which takes only about 5 minutes. ÊEverything is basically self serve, and you would think you wouldn't get much service but the service is great and friendly. ÊThe lady who took our order wasn't knowledgeable about her BBQ. We asked her if they had trip tip and she looked at us like we were aliens. ÊThe menu is very basic. ÊThe BBQ is good, but doesn't live up to its hype. The sides are good, prices are good. ÊIts not a place I would go out of my way to get BBQ. ÊLucilles is very much comparable. Lucilles beef ribs beats this place. ÊBut i think the pork ribs here are better and fall off the bone tender.

We went for lunch last Thursday--the day the tall ships sailed into the Big Bay. ÊWe were afraid the place would be busy, as usual, but there were only about five ahead of us in line. ÊWe had tried to have lunch there on the Fourth of July--I never said we were smart--and the line that time was around the cornerl; after we finally waited for a parking space and saw how long the wait would be, we gave up and went to Pizza Nova. ÊWe used to walk to Phil's when they were in Mission Hills, and this was our first time as the Midway location. I had the Chicken Tickler, and my wife had the Baby Back Ribs Tickler. ÊEach is a "complete meal" (meat with BBQ sauce, cole slaw, french fries, and onion rings). ÊThe meat, coleslaw, and fries were very fine, but the onion rings were nothing to cherish. ÊAt $6.45 each the combos were priced well for what you get. ÊWe were able to sit outside on the patio and did not have to wait the suggested 15 minutes to get our food. ÊWe are not BBQ fans, nor are we experts, so authenticity doesn't enter in to our judgment--the food was plentiful and good.

it's ... AMAZING. The waiting is almost unbearably wrong but it's definitely worth it. I mean, there's gotta be a reason why there's 5 gazillion people waiting for it right? Go with a group of friends, the waits pretty fun then :). orderings simple, just order ribs. duh. hahha.

I remember hearing about this place years ago when they were still in Hillcrest, tried them, waited a loooooooong time and wasn't too impressed, I mean it was good, but it wasn't like, slap yo mama good... ÊI'll take Famous Dave's over this place any day of the week, just for the consistency in flavor, better prices and not having to wait forever... To me this is a slightly over-rated eatery, and now they are down by Sports arena, the lines are ALWAYS out the door and you have to wait even looooooooooonnnnnnnnnger... you won't find me waiting in one,in fact, for the prices and the wait, I'll pick up some tri-tips, BBQ em' myself and make some tri-tip sammy's so good that when my mother-in-law ate one she slapped ME and took the one I was going to eat right out of my hands... (Note: one of the owners contacted me and told me he was going to have me killed if I didn't edit this a little... JUST KIDDING, but one of the owners did contact me and made me an offer I couldn't refuse... Next time I go, I get to cut in line. So I gave one more star for customer service. And I plan on sampling a Tri-Tip sangwich this Summer, which is, ironically the only thing on the menu I haven't tried...

I ordered the baby back ribs half rib plate with fries and a macaroni salad. My friends ordered the same ribs but with different sides. All of their ribs were the same size and several inches long. Three of my ribs however were less than an inch long and were pathetic in comparison. They barely had any meat on them. To add insult to injury, the chef must've known that I was getting short changed on the ribs, and dumped a *huge* amount of fries on my plate. For $14 I think I got ripped off. Won't be coming back.

Went here last month during my vacation down there by the recommendation of my step-dad's cousin. I'm in love. This is the best barbecue I had ever had. Everything was great besides that I had braces so I couldn't fully enjoy it with a full bite here and a full bite there but man, if I enjoy it this much, I don't wanna imagine how it will be with my braces off.

This is the best BBQ I've had in SD, though I don't really think that means much if you come from the mid-west or south. But still, if you like BBQ, you will enjoy Phil's, even though it may not measure up to back home. Its pretty crowded usually, and I've found that calling ahead to order take out is a good way to avoid waiting in line...I've also had good luck a few times eating in the bar area, where you can order directly from the bartenders. Get the pork baby back ribs with baked beans and corn on the cob as your sides. ÊIts the best item on the menu. ÊThe other items are also very good, but I'm partial to ribs in general at a BBQ spot.

I saw great reviews on here and took my family out to give this place a try. We have two toddlers and an infant and the staff was great with them. The ribs (pork AND beef) were amazing and the onion rings were the best part!!!! My kids even scarfed down the coleslaw, and the baby was sneaking it off of her brothers plates. If you get the bigger meals, obviously it gets a little more pricey. However, I got the Ticklers meal and it was only $6.95, and way more than I could eat. I didn't even touch my fries after the ribs, slaw and onions rings that all came on my plate. We are a very satisfied family and will definately be going back soon!!!

Best ribs I've had so far! They have great sides too! The only problem would probably getting a table since it's first come first serve and seat yourself type of restaurant, plus the place is usually packed! On weekends we usually just phone in our orders, pick them up and enjoy them at home. :) They do have outdoor seating that our family usually takes and we get a long table. It come with heaters so it's still good during winter.

Oh my god this place has the best ribs in the world! I ordered to go so I wouldn't have to wait in the long line. When I was waiting for my order to finish up I saw them making the meat and it looked amazing. The ribs were so good and it fell of the bone! The sauce was really good as well. I could eat this everyday if I could afford it. the fries were normal and the onion rings were really good but super oily. My second trip I got the beefy ribs and they were as good as the pork ribs. It was so soft and tender. The bone was so freaking huge, it was literally foot long! The wait in line was about an hour but it was so worth it. It is hard to choose from the pork or beef ribs because they are both so good.

Fri. 3/5/10 - Arrived with a group of 10 diners just a few minutes after they opened. ÊThe line was short and the wait gave us time to plan our lunch strategy. ÊBTW...I dare you to stand in line at Phil's without getting hungry. The smell of BBQ sauce is everywhere! We were prepped in line by (Rhonda) so that we knew when a register was available to take our orders. They let us know that our food would be ready when our "call" device rang and helped us to the drink machines to "fill em' up" while we waited for our meals. (Louis), our table attendant, was very helpful and told us that if we needed anything he would be happy to help. ÊAs our orders were ready, he told each person to stay seated and that he'd be right back with the food. ÊHe was fast, efficient and made us feel welcome and comfortable. Dishes in this meal included: BBQ Broham Sandwich (Pulled Pork Shoulder) with fries El Toro Sandwich (Deli Sliced Tri Tip) with large side of O-Rings Half Rib Dinner with side of Cole Slaw and fries Let me tell you...there was enough food to feed an army. ÊWith the number of fries and onion rings that were ordered, we were able to make them a community plate. The El Toro Sandwich (Deli Cut Tri Tip) I ordered, was tender, tangy and smoked to perfection. ÊPut a couple of the onion rings on the sandwich and you've definitely got a meal to remember. ÊThe BBQ Broham Sandwich (Pulled Pork) was just another stack of BBQ'd goodness Êbetween two buns and the cole slaw that was included with the sandwich complimented it very well. ÊAt one point there was total silence at the table ++good sign++ while everyone enjoyed their food. ÊThe ribs looked and smelled wonderful and had I not been full, I would have sampled some of it, but I'll just have to do that on a return visit. ÊOh yes...there will be a return visit! ÊAs I looked around the table I saw nothing but smiles (and an occasional "belly rub"). As we prepared to leave, (Rhonda) came by with a smile and a hug to thank us for stopping in for lunch and invited us to come back soon. ÊShe was warm and sincere. ÊThanks to Rhonda, Louis and the rest of the staff at Phil's for the great food and superb customer service.

Phil's BBQ is way overhyped. ÊThe San Marcos location definitely doesn't measure up to the previous Phil's stores. ÊThe meat is drenched in BBQ sauce so you can't taste the meat, which is probably a good thing since the meat is overprocessed and tastes like freezer meat. ÊSeems like the quality went wayyyyy down.

Okay honestly, had I been writing this review three days ago, I would've given this place a solid five stars because their grubs are amazing and finger-licking good. So why four? Because I raved about this place to an out-of-town friend, so when he finally made a visit, of course I took him to Phils to show him what's up! The times before, I waited an hour or so and it was well worth the wait, but this time we went on a Saturday and waited in line for two and a half hours for some baby back ribs. TWO and a half hours! By the time we sat down, we were so over it that a bag of chips would've made us happy. I highly recommend coming here at five or eight to avoid super long lines.

I loved the beef ribs and the chicken. it was super good. husband got the beef tri-tip and was pleasantly surprised about how good it was. he liked that as you continued to eat your bbq there was a slight kick. he's not into sweet bbq. this was not too sweet and perfect for him. I loved the potatoe salad, the onion rings are meh, and i enjoyed the baked beans (they had a bite too).

I don't know if people in San Diego have never eaten decent BBQ or if they're just under the impression that drenching food in BBQ sauce makes it BBQ. Needless to say I was left unimpressed by Phil's and their "tri-tip" which arrived dripping with mediocre barbecue sauce The fries were decent, but definitely not worth the hour plus wait. I fail to understand why someone would come to a restaurant to eat alleged BBQ and be looked down on for not knowing how to order off of the menu. I ate Phil's with some friends before leaving for northern CA for a bit and on the way back I had to stop in Bakersfield at a real BBQ place to demonstrate to my boyfriend what real BBQ should be. Barbecue is an art, not a gloppy mess drenched in some sickeningly sweet sauce.

This is probably the best bbq in San Diego, hands-down. ÊThe place is always packed and the food is always good.

After hearing all about Phil's and how it's so good, I decided to give it a shot. I must say this has got to be the most overrated food in San Diego. It was average. Nothing out of the ordinary.

For the price, nothing beats phils. Their portions are gimongous and food comes out pretty quickly. The line tends to get very long but you get to the front in no time. ÊTheir staff is also very very friendly. Eg. My gf and I placed our order and after waiting for, seriously only 5 minutes, an awesome waiter by the name of Darrell came by and asked us if we've been waiting long. I told him no it's only been 5 minutes and he tells me to hold on to go check up on our order. He then goes to the front counter and WAITS there and then personally delivers it to us. How awesome is that?? I love this place and though i live all the way up in northridge, I'll be making frequent trips to phil's.

Should be 2.5 stars but since most San Diegans get butt hurt when I talk down on their beloved bbq joint, I'll round up. ÊThis place is definitely hyped and NOT worth any wait over 30 minutes on a weekend and any wait on a weekday. ÊI had the tri-tip sandwich since it was recommended by some frequent customers waiting in line with me and the girl taking my order. ÊI also assumed since tri-tip gained its popularity first in California, it would be a good choice. ÊI was so wrong. ÊDry and drenched in sauce. ÊIt kind of tasted like they carved the tri-tip and to heat it up, threw it under a broiler. ÊThen, to make up for the dryness, they just threw a load of sauce on top. ÊIf I am ever forced to go back, I will probably give the ribs a try. ÊSomeone else at our table ordered those and they did look very moist and tender. ÊSo the 3 stars is a bit generous in my book, but since the others at the table seemed happy with their selection (most got the ribs), I will postpone a bad rating until I've given some other items a try.

The ribs were delicious!!! I shared a full rack with my girlfriend but they were so good I could have eaten the full on my own! My two sides were fries and macaroni salad. The fries were soggy when I got them hence the 4 stars as opposed to 5 stars. The macaroni salad was very good highly recommend getting those. When we got there the line was RIDICULOUSLY long. We got there a bit after 8 but I have a feeling the line is like that most of the day and everyday. I'm not sure if others have figured this out but the best way to beat the line is to ORDER OVER THE PHONE!!!!!!! We literally parked in the lot, went in and grabbed a menu, called them up from our cars after deciding what we wanted then walked in 10 minutes later and walked out with our food almost right away. You could probably look for a table after grabbing the food but its soo busy it was hard so we grabbed the food and sat at a bench in the same plaza and chowed down. Overall great ribs and reasonable price for bbq. Remember to order over the phone to beat the crowd!!!!

They say the BBQ is the best thing about this place. I can honestly say the food is bomb-diddly-icious, but the service was even better. Phills BBQ was on Man Vs Food which is one of the reasons this place is just so bangin'. The other is the quality of the food and the dedication of the staff who works there. I have driven past Phil's twice and on both instances, there was a line that stretched around the entire building and into the adjacent parking lot. The wait to get in is usually around 1.5 to 2 hours, but trust me, it is well worth the wait, and besides... patience is a virtue (they even have a sign in the restaurant that states it). Once you get inside, their wonderful greeter acknowledges you and your party in such a wonderful manner that it almost seems as if you two are bff's. You order your meal at a counter and an electronic buzzer is given to you to let you know when your food is ready (the kind other restaurants give you when you are on the waiting list). The food comes out fast and hot. Every now and then, the greeter and other staff members come around to your table to check on things. They want to make sure you are taken care of just like a VIP. If you need anything they will literally bend over backwards to make sure you get what you want. I understand that no one wants to wait 2 hours to get a meal, but when the food is as good as they show on tv, and the service is even better, who can complain? 5 stars, 0 problems, 1 happy customer =)

if there was ever a restaurant that fit the description of "ayite," it's Phil's. Êthe ribs are good, but i don't think 900 5-stars good. Êbbq sauce is on the sweeter side (rather than spicy). Êfor toursists, like myself, it's a tough call on whether to use one of your few meals on this place while in SD because the wait is long and you only have the choice of ribs or chicken - no brisket and no links. Êthis place is a one shot deal for out-of-towners, go here just to say you've tried it. Êdefinately not a repeater like Versaille in LA or even Roscoe's.

Was looking forward to coming here for ages after hearing so many good things about this place. The famous sauce is very processed tasting and the ribs were DRENCHED in it. Nothing like the ol' BBQ house experience I was hoping for. The place is very fast foodish too - lineup, get your ticket, muscle in for seating. Then again... how can those long lines of people all be wrong?

A few years ago, my friend and I asked a locate where we could find a great BBQ place and he immediately mentioned Phil's BBQ. ÊThis place was such a great find. ÊEver since, every time I am down in San Diego, I stopped by Phil's BBQ for lunch or dinner. ÊThe service is great and the foods are even better. ÊLove the baby-back ribs.

Went there over the summer and mind you I came to San Diego from St. Louis which is second to Kansas City for BBQ. ÊPhil's is very good-almost as good as St. Louis. ÊI would have given them a 5 stars but the place was so darn crowded and I hate to wait in line for food of any kind. ÊOur waitress was excellent. ÊWe had a large crowd and usually you have to stand in line, place your order, pay for it then if you're lucky you can find a seat. ÊShe allowed us to do it backward. ÊWe found a table for the group and laid claim to it. ÊThe she let one of us go up to the corner of the counter and give our order. ÊIf they are doing so good, maybe they ought to open up two or three more stores in town to decompress the one they have now. ÊI'll probably go back sometime but it'll have to be without kids. ÊThere is no way they would be able to stand in line and wait for as long as it can take on a busy night.

Phils does a great job, the food is good, the atmosphere is casual like a BBQ joint should be. There is usually a line but the wait is not bad and the food is well worth it. ÊThe prices are great for the meal you get. I would defiantly put this on the list of places to eat. My friends and I try to make it a regular stop, we call it Phil's Friday.

Great BBQ! The tri tip sandwhich & the pulled pork sandwhich were the best. We also got the baby back ribs & chicken also good. The onion rings were good beer batter but needed seasoning. The beans & coleslaw needed some seasoning too. The lines are crazy long but you can call ahead for takeout. You have to order, seat yourself, & pick up your own food keeps costs down but inconveinent to say the least. The paper liners on the trays shred up when cutting your sandwhich & they don't have sharp knives so ask for plates. The food was worth the trouble & affordable. Next time we'll do takeout!!

It was my first time here, and OMG, it is seriously worth the one hour wait. My boyfriend and I got the 1. Best of Both: Êbaby back rib ( 4bones) and the chickless (6 pieces) dinner along with 2 sides: macaroni salad and potato salad for $11.95. - Baby back ribs are DEFINITELY THE best, hands down. don't even get anything else. JUST the baby back ribs is all you need. - We had trouble deciding between the chicken with the bones, or the chicken without it. but our friendly order taker recommended the chick-less. So that's what we ended up with. Personally, i didn't like it at all because it was seriously dry. They were like gigantic bbq chicken nuggets, but dry on the inside. so eh. i wouldnt get this again. - macaroni salad: probably one of the best macaroni salads I've ever had. the flavor is not TOO strong, and not drowned in sauce, and it came in cute looking pasta, not the regular macaroni. -potato salad, there's nothing much special about the potato salad except the fact that it came in largely diced red potatoes. 2.We thought it was not enough, so we also got the tickler for $6.45. It included 3 sides ( 2 onion rings, cole slaw and french fries) along with a beefy rib ( 1 bones) - beefy rib: it was a GIANT bone, don't think its a little small slab of beef folks. It's one big beef with the bone attached to it. Although this was good, it is in no comparison to the baby back ribs ( which is the best!) in my opinion. -onion rings: They were okay, maybe because they weren't as fresh, so the crunch wasnt really there anymore. - cole slaw: I'm not a fan of cole slaw AT ALL. but boy, phil's cole slaw changed my mind. The lettuce was so crunchy and light, so I really liked it. 3. The worker in our area was EXCEPTIONALLY hard working. Like you'd see him constantly cleaning the tables, and running around to get things for the guests. He was so friendly ! Usually at busy places like these, you would expect unfriendliness because they're so tired of serving people. but BOY! he was so energetic, so i helped him wipe the table a bit so it wasnt so messy, he was too nice! And when we were waiting in line, the lady who tells us when to go up to the cashier, was SUPER nice and funny too. She was really talkative, but in a friendly and fun way. Overall, I had a pretty good experience at phil's and is DEFINITELY looking forward to coming back here again(: highly recommended !

I don't understand all the rave reviews! The food was a bit below average, the pork ribs dry, the beef ribs charred beyond recognition and so extremely fatty that we didn't even finish them. The potato salad was pretty good and the corn on the cob was nicely cooked. The sauces were average. The prices were outrageous.

Phil's BBQ = California's Mecca of BBQ. All outdoor grills should be facing in the direction of Phil's BBQ. I used to work as a chef at a BBQ joint (Bruno's BBQ - don't go there, the new owners totally ruined the place) in Santa Cruz while I was going to school so I consider myself sort of an expert on the subject. Anything you order here will clog your arteries but consider the sacrifice worthwhile. All of their meats are cooked to perfection with the brown sugar expertly caramelized. The baby back ribs and the beef ribs aren't too fatty and melt off the bone. Their signature BBQ sauce is the perfect combination of tanginess and sweetness. The only suggestion I would make would be to add a little bit of black or cayenne pepper spice to add another layer of depth to the sauce. One order of onion rings is enough to cause deep vein thrombosis. Every bite is a delicious step toward cardiac arrest. The people who work here are fun and seem genuinely interested in you having a good time and enjoying the food. Don't be intimidated by the line that consistently stretches around the block, it moves fast. I'd happily wait 30+ minutes again just to have another opportunity to consume this soulful ambrosia.

Phil's has great BBQ worth the calories. ÊIf you don't mind standing in a line outside the door for 45 minutes and then having to find your own seat after ordering and paying - then Phil's is a 5. ÊI've eaten here three times and will only do take out now because I'm just not a stand in line heard mentality kind of gal. ÊThat being said, the food does make the wait worthwhile and people wait for a reason. ÊThe prices are reasonable for a rib house and the atmosphere is friendly. ÊFor me it is take out only!!!

After having heard about Phil's for what seemed like years, my friends and I trekked down to San Diego one fine sunny day during finals week for this deliciousness, because we're down like that. Instead of waiting in the hour long line, we decided to wait in the separate to-go line and take out the food and planned to eat inside the car, true college style. But it was late and it was dark. So all four of us just plopped down on the sidewalk in front of our car and feasted away. We all ordered the baby back rib half dinner with two sides. The first rib was heavenly, the meat, the sauce, the sides, and all. But while gnawing on my second or third to last rib, I realized: baby back ribs are just baby back ribs, nothing more and nothing less. I'm sure there'll be times in the future when I'll be craving the sweet meaty tangy-ness of Phil's like none other but for now, let's just say that I'm glad I waited only ten minutes for the food.

Wow what can I say, its good to be suprised sometimes. When we headed out to this establishment, i didnt know what to expect (actually i was picturing a small run down hole in the wall type place). When we arrived, i saw it - "Phils BBQ" in big ass bright red letters. Instead of a small hole in the wall we stumbled across a bbq haven. Very big and modern. When you enter you place your order in the cafeteria style counter and sit yourself down somewhere (who needs waiter and hostesses anyway). After a good 10 to 15 min u get paged (the pager speaks to you too! sorry easily amused) and grab your food from the counter. I ordered the pork ribs and chicken with a side of onion rings and ranch. Took my first bite and wow Êwas in for a pleasant surpise. The ribs were bomb, the chicken was good although i couldn't finish it all and the onion rings were awsome. All i can say is i was very satisfied and way too full when i left. Prices were right and the food was plentiful and delicious- 4 stars

For the ribs they are the best I have had at a restaurant. My favorite are the ones I buy from Costco and BBQ myself but when you do it yourself you can fine tune the flavors and save some dough if you have the time. ÊI appreciate that the potato salad and macaroni salad are not heavy on onion. I would say there isn't onion but just this weekend I swear I could taste something. My wife loves the heavy use of dill in the potato salad. ÊThe onion rings are generous in portion. I usually get take out here because the patience to wait in that long line which is generally 100+ deep on weekends. I remember going to the Hillcrest location and not seeing lines this big and it was a smaller place. Popularity must be WAY up since those days. ÊFor takeout the sides could be larger (with exception to the rings). The whoopie pies for dessert are guilty delicious. The staff seems to enjoy working here which adds to the experience. This is my go to BBQ joint, it's a shame I can only enjoy it for takeout. If you are feeding a family with ribs in mind bring $$$. I'm not a fan of pulled pork or the sandwiches of most places. My review is a reflection of the ribs and sides.

boyfriend has died and gone to meat heaven. we decided to take our cousins here based on our fellow yelpers enthusiasm. cousin is a total meat lover as well so despite the long ass line out the door, they agreed to wait with us. and boy was it worth it! i'm not even a huge fan of bbq and i totally grubbed out. first, the pork ribs were tender and the sauce was lip-smackingly good. the beef ribs were huge and the meat totally fell of the bone. i really liked their onion rings as well. we got a ridiculously huge basket of beer-battered rings that were a perfect heart-attack causing compliment to our meat orgy.

Let me start by saying I did not want to like this place. ÊI come from Texas barbeque, and we can be quite snobbish when it comes to barbeque outside the realm of the great state. ÊI was hesitant to believe all these Californians who said that this was the best BBQ on the planet. ÊSo, when my friend suggested we go for lunch, I kinda shrugged. ÊWell, I will be the first to admit that was wrong, very very wrong. ÊI thought that the place was sit-down with a waiter, which is so un-BBQ to me, but nope, it is a line out the door, as it should be. ÊI got the quarter order baby backs, with a side of corn on the cob, and my friend and I split the onion rings. ÊFor the price, I was pretty impressed. ÊI was totally full, to the brim, when I left. ÊI loved that the corn on the cob was a whole ear, not the half ears that most places give you. ÊThe ribs were falling off the bone kinda good. ÊThe onion rings were by far the best I've ever had. ÊHuge and crisp and dipped in nice and cool ranch. ÊI could have totally just eaten those for lunch and been satisfied. ÊWe were outside the door in the line, and within about 15-20 minutes we were sitting at a table with our food. ÊFor my personal taste, the sauce is a little thick and sweet, I prefer a more vinegar based sauce myself, but theirs is still pretty solid. ÊI will be back, again, and again, and again.

One of the best tasting ribs i have ever had. and i know my ribs. these pork ribs at Phils are to die for. the meat falls right off the bone and are dripping with bbq sauce.thats how ribs are supposed to be. i normally get a full rib dinner with fries and beans. i know what a fat ass. but if you can throw down then why not. it is pretty pricey and the place can get really crowded with the line going out the door around the corner. but i wont complain. all of that is worth it. and guys don't worry about missing a game. they have flat screen TVs throughout the restaurant that always have some sort of sport playing on them so you can catch up on anything you are missing. If i could i would come here all the time. but if i did then i wouldn't have any money left and i would probably weigh 300 pounds. so i'm gonna stick to the half rib dinner and hit the gym shortly after. thats if the food coma doesn't kick in.

If your looking for good ribs, this is the place for you. ÊI ordered their half rack of baby back ribs and they were served exactly as described... "slide off the bone." ÊI almost ordered a full rack thinking half wouldn't cut it. ÊI'm glad I didn't go for the full rack. ÊI was beyond full finishing a half rack. ÊThe side orders are just as big. ÊYou may want to stay away from the BBQ chicken. ÊIt didn't taste marinated at all. ÊIt's as if they grilled it and slabbed some BBQ sauce on it. ÊThe restaurant is self seated. ÊYou order and pay for your meal, then seat yourself. ÊOn a Thursday night, finding a table to seat seven was pretty difficult, but the waiters were helpful in securing a spot for our party. ÊWhat was eye catching about this place was the open wash area they have for rinsing down your BBQ coated lips and fingers after you are done eating. ÊI just thought it was a bit funny.

Well, I was surprisingly dissapointed...the restaurant is large, great atmosphere, I got food to go. I had heard so much about Phil's, and never heard anything bad. So decided to head there after leaving Sea World...anyways, I am a HUGE barbeque fan, so I got the ribs, and the El Toro sandwich. The sauce is okay, not fantastic...the coleslaw was very dry, beans were pretty good. (fries at this restaurant are very soggy). Anyways, sandwiches were huge, but just not my taste. My husband loved them, though..so it depends on the person, I guess. I recommend Barbecue Pit in Fletcher Hills. My all time favorite barbecue in San Diego....maybe I was expecting Phil's to be similar..anyways, Phil's is also very expensive!!lunch was almost $30!!!Yikes.

For San Diego, im sure this is 5 star quality barbecue. But where i come from (mid-west) it's decent. Was craving some ribs one night when i got off work, about 10 o'clock at night on a thursday. Surprisingly no wait! Baby back ribs, side of beans and the onion rings i hear people rave so much about. The hubby got the beef ribs and fries. So, why 3 stars and not 4 or 5? The sauce on these ribs was good, don't get me wrong, but i believe in a thicker, richer, sweeter sauce. Oh, and they were fall off the bone, but a true barbecued rib should have a Êlittle bite, or chew to it. The onion rings were ok. Very greasy and i didn't like the beer batter. really not much flavor to me. The beans were...well beans. Nothing special about those. Hubby's fries were addictive, but his beef ribs were more fat than meat. All in all i would give Phil's another shot, but i'm still on the search for a good barbecue joint.

I haven't had a chance to dine here in years. Just a weekend ago, we were all out in SD. I thought, what better opportunity than then to hit up Phil's. We didn't think that the lines would STILL be as redic as when I first went there a number of years ago. Anyways, the line wrapped around 3/4 of the building. While I was glad to see that they were doing so well, I wished that there weren't such a huge wait. Starving, we went elsewhere to get a tiny bite. ÊWe called in our order and 5 minutes later, arrived at the restaruant. And guess what, I didn't wait longer than 2 or 3 minutes. When I got there the line had disappeared. Amazing!! The food is so tasty, even when it's food you take out. ÊThe ribs were the precious fall off the bone type. There are no smoke rings or anything but you can't expect that from ribs, FYI. I ordered a full rack of baby back's to share with Walter and Kaelani. They loved 'em. ÊThe sauce had just enough of a kick and there was just enough sauce. Prices there are still just as reasonable as I remember. ÊThe cashiers are friendly and deliver service with a smile. ÊIf there is any place that you should drive out to for the day and really hang with friends, Phil's is the place! ÊIf you're able to, have someone stand in line for you while the rest of the group swarms the bar area. They do a good job there. Some groups who were waiting in that huge line, I asked them how long the wait time had been estimated at. ÊThe girl I talked to said about 45 minutes. ÊTHat's not TOO bad considering a number of people were waiting around the other side of the building. ÊAnyways, I picked up my phoned-in order and we headed back home to LA. ÊI swear to you, we made it home in just under 2 hours. The ribs were still warm. And of course, we had a nice steaming hot pot of jasmine rice waiting for us when we got home. *Thanks Mom* We had said that we were all going to go to sleep because of the long day that we'd had and that we'd eat the ribs the next day for lunch or something. SCRATCH THAT!! We all sat around the table and started nibbling. ÊEventually, we were all smothered and covered, like Denny's potatoes, in Phil's BBQ. Why not, right? ÊThe meat was still warm. The rice was hot. It was the perfect scenario. ÊToo awesome!! Thank goodness I thought of this place when I did. This really hit the spot!!

Phil's doesn't really need another review because there by far the best BBQ place in San Diego. No one else compares. There chickless chicken is my favorite and the sauce is very unique. The lines are always long but if you love it and want it you will wait. First thing I wanted after Lent was Phil's! Fast, Great Service, and outstanding food!

Awesome BBQ. I have a favorite place in NorCal and had been searching for a great place in San Diego. San Diegans already know about this place though - no need to let people know since the word is out. The Sports Arena location packs 'em in - what lines! The bar on the side doesn't serve food Êthough but provides a nice place to wait for a table if you can't find one (tables are first come first serve). The BBQ chicken is extremely tasty and an all-around favorite. For some reason their macaroni salad is better than any I've had elsewhere - not sure what it is, but it had that special something. Onion rings are HUGE and enough to share amongst a large group. Love how they offer fresh veggies as another side. Easy to be healthy here. They also have tons of drink options - iced tea, Crystal Light, Fresca, along with the normal Coke, Sprite, etc. Love this place. Love, love, love. Ahhh BBQ.

Dear San Diego: Do you know what real BBQ tastes like? ÊApparently not. ÊI'm baffled that 1000+ Yelpers give this place 4+ stars. ÊThe beef ribs and chicken were too tough, a sign that it was cooked too quickly. ÊOnly thing decent was the baby-back ribs, but even then there was no hint of smoke in the meat or the sauce. ÊI rate this place just a notch above Tony Roma's, Êbut given the usual long waits, it's not worth the visit.

A lot of times the second location of a local icon is one disasterous idea. ÊHow can it compare to the original??? ÊPhil's at Sports Arena is not a bad replica...at least in quality of the bbq. ÊIt's much larger than the previous location, with enough parking, and lots of roll paper towels for all those times you're tempted to lick or wipe off that sauce. ÊHowever, it's better to lick off that sauce because it's a waste of good food.

Friends of mine that used to live in San Diego swore by this place, but I never had a chance to try it out until last night. ÊMy parents were in town for my birthday weekend and my boyfriend and I were debating whether to go the Kansas City BBQ route, whose reviews on the food aren't fantastic, but are high on all the Top Gun memorabilia vs. the Phil's BBQ route where the reviews on the food are absolutely stellar. ÊUltimately we decided on Phil's and were delighted with our decision even despite the 28-30 minute wait to order food (don't trust the 21 minute and 14 second sign! :)) and the fact that we had to roll ourselves out of the restaurant post Beefy Ribs & Chickless dinners with way too many sides (our fault for ordering so much--not theirs!) ÊIt was incredible to say the least and hands down one of the best BBQ restaurants we've been to. ÊMake sure to bring an appetite (and a jacket and comfy shoes...if you go after 5:30pm, you're in for a wait on Sundays!)

This was a do over from a previous bad experience,and make no mistake about it there would be no bad experience tonight. The Manager, Fred, saw to it that my family and I circumvented a very long line,and we were whisked right in and next thing I knew they were taking our order. We were seated immediately,and received first class service from the Manager,as he personally checked on us and made sure everyone was satisfied. When we left we all agreed that the quality of the food was only exceeded by the service Fred provided to all of us. No doubt this was a five star experience,and we would like to extend a BIG Thank You to Fred. We will be back,and my family is still buzzing about the great food and service last night.

Since this place has 2000+ reviews so I won't be very elaborate with this review. The hype for this place was off the charts: 4.5 stars with more than 2000 reviews, a line wrapped around the building, and a business very adept at using social networking. I have lived in North Carolina for most of my life where discussions about the quality of BBQ can invoke firearms and hand to hand combat. My family has made BBQ for years too. I ordered the BBQ sandwich which was just about as average as you can get for BBQ. Subtle flavors and a bit too dry. The bun was a bit too hard for my liking also. I wish I could be more descriptive about the taste of the BBQ but again there was nothing memorable. The sides from this place up the rating. The BBQ baked beans were very tasty and the potato salad was also pretty good. Tasted the sig-o's fries which were tasty but the onion rings were a tad too greasy. Seems everyone in this joint was enjoying themselves and service was very good. Decent food but we have hundreds of little mom and pop places back in the South that would destroy this place. Nice try Phil...

came back here over the weekend, and it was awesome. i tired the chicken on the bone this time, and it's definitely better and not dried out, like the chickless. the lady i ordered from was really nice, complemented my tan, and we had a little convo going about hawaii and family, etc. very nice, especially when unexpected. anyways, back to the food. it was ready in no time! and one of the best things i love about this place is that the food is still good the next day. i usually order something big on purpose, so that i have lunch to bring to work the next day. after a meal like this, i'm too damn lazy to cook myself something to eat for lunch the next day.

Best baby back ribs I have ever had. The meat was very tender and fell right off the bone. The sauce was excellent and they heap plenty of it on top. Might be too sweet for some but not for me. The sides were decent but not amazing. I am a cole slaw lover, and I felt the slaw did not have enough sauce. The fries were very similar to In'n'out fries except larger, but I don't care much for in'n'out fries. The onion rings and potato salad were fairly typical. Overall, I have other restaurants I want to visit in San Diego, but I'd definitely be back next time I visit as long as the wait isn't too bad.

definitely the BEST place in SD for ribs. grab a brew and witness PERFECTION right before your eyes ! go with the (already highly recommended by fellow yelpers) BEEF ribs if you want a GARGANTUAN SLAB of carnivorous goodness or go with the pork if thats what you prefer--either way you WON'T be dissatisfied ! the line moves fast, and the serving style is kind of like fuddruckers i got the half chicken/half ribs plate and it was LIGHT on my pocket but HEAVY on the stomach--what more could you ask for? the chicken was--surprise!--TENDER in texture and NOT dry as i was sort of expecting. i recommend this combo plate for new-comers. the sides were also GREAT: i got the beans and potato salad, both recommended by the attendant. now, admittedly, i dont even LIKE beans and i have to say .. these beans were BOMB !!! NEGATIVES: the only thing i dont really like about this place is the seating style. at nights when its PACKED you have to "reserve" a table by practically hovering over a party who's occupying one, which feels kind of intrusive but eh, its not THAT big a deal.

I have finally had Phils! Why I have waited two years to experience it's deliciousness, I do not know. We walked in literally right before the rush thankfully. Got a full order or ribs, with beans, coleslaw and fries and proceeded to pig out. I'm not a big rib eater so my expertise is limited. The meat was tender and fell off the bone, they were graciously smothered in sauce and...great now my mouth is watering. The beans were good, honey tasting but not anything too exciting. I do not really care for coleslaw so I'm not going to comment on that. I loved the fries, nice and crispy in the golden delicious way, not the over cooked way. The staff was helpful and nice and there is lots of seating-when it isn't completely packed, which I have heard it is anytime after 5 and at lunch. I went with a veteran Phil's patron so he straight up ordered without letting me so much as look at the menu-but I will most assuredly be back to try more.

Phil's is by far one of my favorite restaurants in San Diego! It is our number one place to take guests when they come into town. I am not usually a huge barbeque beef person and I love their ribs! The best I have every had. And yes the line is incredibly long if you do not get there before six but it is well worth it. I promise you will not be disappointed. It has a very fun atmosphere as well which makes it that much better. We seriously crave it at least once a week.

If this place were in the South, it would be just another bbq place, nothing special. The sides are not like true southern bbq. The beans are all wrong and the bbq sauce isn't perfect. However, since its not in the South it is Êdecent place to satisfy a craving for ribs. The ribs are usually very good quality which makes it worth the long lines and expensive prices. I usually order only the ribs since I think thats the only thing they do well (don't order the chicken unless you don't mind it to be a little dry, the pulled pork is pretty good though). Overall, don't expect much if you come from the south like me, but if you haven't experienced true southern bbq this place comes close.

I went here on a Saturday night, and yep, there was the Disneyland line and parking was a nightmare. ÊThe awful thing about the line- every person in line seemed to be holding a spot for about 10 other people- literally- it was like they called all their friends and said hey, I'm already in line at Phil's, come on up. ÊDefinitely questionable behavior in my mind, very unfair to all of us waiting. ÊAfter waiting for about 30 mins and moving about 4 feet (still nowhere near the wooden "20 min from here" sign- and probably not moving b/c people arriving were going to join friends in line in front of us), we copied the idea of the people in front of us- pick up a menu, call in, and 10-15 mins later, you pick up Êyour food (no line for that!) and you're out of there, with a few last looks at the poor suckers still standing in that never-moving line. ÊI don't understand WHY the line didn't move- when we went in to pick up the food, there was plenty of seating.... maybe b/c they have about 3 cash registers for dine-in orders, and 2 for phone-in, and tons more people are dining in than phoning in? ÊDon't know, all I can say is, definitely phone in and carry out!!! ÊUnless you care to spend an hour and a half waiting in line to eat, getting angrier and angrier about all the line cutting. Ê So, as to the food. ÊI got the baby-back ribs and chickless, with sides of baked beans and potato salad. ÊThe baby-back ribs were awesome, definitely the best part of the meal! ÊTheir BBQ sauce is yummy. ÊThe chickless, was ok- hard to live up to those ribs. ÊThe potato salad was awesome. ÊThe baked beans- ew- they looked like soup in the container, mushy and didn't taste good at all- just not something I even cared to eat. ÊNot like any baked beans I'd ever had, and I usually love them. The baby-back ribs were worth going to this place for. ÊI'm glad, however, that I skipped the line- the yucky beans and so-so chickless were definitely not worth it. One more note- prices are very reasonable- I think it was something like $11 for my ribs, chicken and 2 sides. ÊDefinitely a great place for barbeque, hopefully the beans were just a bad batch.

First discovered it in '97 and the wait was around 30 min when they were in their old space, disappointed to learn that they now have a much, much larger place and the wait is just as long if not longer. ÊJust recently tried the food and the bbq here is fantastic, can go pound for pound and probably beat the nyc bbq renaissance that is happening. ÊNot only are the ribs good, the side dishes are so addictive.

so everyone one around me was always RAVING about phil's bbq and how amazing it was. i went with high expectations and unfortunately had to wait 2 hours until we got seated. it was the first weekend that it was open after being closed for three weeks, so im sure that contributed to it. this place brought back old memories of growing up in tx and eating ribs, so i was pretty excited. i ordered the half slab of baby back ribs with cole slaw and beans. the baby back ribs just slid off the bone and were very soft, which i liked. what i didnt like too much was the sauce. it was good with a sweet taste offset with a tangy-ness, but it was just TOO much sauce for me. as for the beans, i liked. they were sweet but not too sweet, and the coleslaw was good too but lacked a little flavor for me. im thinking of getting the macaroni pasta next time. that looks really good. the service was really good. the waiters were really friendly and were there to refill your drinks and get whatever else that was needed, so i liked that. another one little downer was the sodas! i dont know if all the sodas were like this but my diet coke was flat! :( maybe next time i'll have a 5 star experience, but for my first time i would give this place a 4. i would not wait another 2 hours to eat here. maybe 1 but 2 is a bit much.

For some reason, Hillcrest is home to a lot of eateries that are hyped beyond the quality of their food. I'm sure there are places that are worth impossible parking and interminable waits, but Phil's isn't one of them -- unless you like waiting hours to sit in cramped eating quarters and eat fatty ribs. When a place has to post a sign warning customers against complaining, that's probably not a good omen.

My husband and I were in town for a wedding and had a chance to meet a friend for lunch here prior to. Wow. I wish my friend had warned me about the HUMONGOUS portions (for under $7 each!)! Had we known, my husband and I could've easily shared a sandwich, but we ordered our own sandwiches and fries to share. He enjoyed his El Toro more than my Broham, and I enjoyed my friend's Beefy Ribs more than my Broham and his El Toro. The pulled pork shoulder on the Broham was okay, but I thought it could have afforded a bit more sauce and would have benefited from being more tender. I did, however, very much enjoy having it with cole slaw between two buns. You seriously have to pull off 1/2 to 2/3 of the meat before you can even pick the danged thing up. I was almost too full to start the sandwich by the time I got 1/3 of the meat down. (Then I realized I could push the extra meat to the side.) The El Toro was heavy on the sauce, so I would only recommend it for serious BBQers. Beefy Ribs were super tender and juicy and well complimented by cole slaw and fries on the side. Huge portions, great prices, and fun atmosphere granted Phil's BBQ 4 stars from me.

To the left of the line is what I can only Êdescribe as a modern day Êsaloon!..I expected to see Matt Dillon and "Miss Kitty" sittin over in the corner!.The buzzed crowd seemed to be having a nice quiet time around the watering hole! The pager went off and we were up...2 styrofoam boxes $40!..smh.When we got home it was more than enough!..altho i personally feel I got more char than meat but like Joe Pesci said..."they fucc you at the drive thru-(carry out)!"...They WERE personable tho...I appreciate manners at all times!....The taste is pretty good, a bit on the fiery side for me, but Êit's a formula worth the money!...I just wish for the sake of those that were waiting, it was bigger...coz momma will have to have been drained dry by Vampire Bill to stand in THAT line!....All in all?...I liked it!

Even a vegetarian can love this place. My husband and I have a mixed marriage- he eats meat and I don't. Phil's leaves both of us happy and stuffed. I get the veggie burger BBQ style (smothered in their delicious sauce). Veggie burger is consistently tender- not a dried out puck like a lot of places. Add some of those tasty onion rings and a side of buttermilk dressing and I'm in junk food heaven. My husband goes for the pork ribs and they smell so good I always have to ask him for a little bite. Meat usually doesn't even taste like Êfood to me, but that little bite is succulent! Well worth breaking the vegetarian rules!

i have never waited an hour for bbq before. but it didn't seem that bad with all of the ruckus and crazy people around in the area to entertain you. it was a random saturday night so i guess the hour wait shoulda been expected. it's kind of a half and half on fast food and sit in restaurant. you go up to the counter and make your order, then you seat yourself down and wait for one of the workers to give you your food. it's also self serve fountain drinks, which means free refills. holla atmosphere is very much like a sports bar fused with a family restaurant, along with the loud flat screened tv with the hustle and bustle of large families. ok, now onto the food. ordered the ribs, with coleslaw and fries. the bbq was really tender and pretty good. nothing bad about it. coleslaw was good too, and i guess the fries were also. there was nothing all too special about it, but i still consider it a lot better than average. i enjoyed my time there and i would definitely hit it up again if i ever had the chance.

PHILS BBQ...why are you so YUMMY?! If I could, I would come to this place twice a week. :) The baby back ribs are ALWAYS delicious although sometimes, the take out fries get soggy. I love the service here and the over all atmosphere. Ever since I found out that the owner actually donates much of his proceeds to charity, I've loved this place even more. I recommend this place to anyone that loves meat.

Just went to Phil's BBQ for the first time (and I have been in SD since August, what is WRONG with me?!). ÊOh wow, that was tasty! My first impression of the place what that the line was SUPER long, and the parking lot was pretty crowded (didn't help that it was a Sunday night with a Fleetwood Mac concert at the Arena). ÊBut after my experience, I decided the wait wasn't that bad - it gave you time to work up the appetite you will most definitely need once you begin gorging, and it helps you to appreciate this place even more. Ê I split the full baby back ribs with a friend, and we couldn't even finish them (and let me tell you, I can put food away like a dude...usually). ÊSooo yummy, the meat was fall-off-the-bone good, and they had the perfect amount of sauce. ÊThe onion rings were so-so, but I'm not a huge fan of fried food. ÊI liked that you could get up and get your own refills of drinks too, because considering how busy that place was, waiting for a refill would be forever. ÊDespite the hustle and bustle, the staff were all super nice. And to cap off my Phil's experience, I watched a friend devour 30 ribs. ÊNuff said. ÊI'll be back

I don't really like barbecue food at all, but Phil's BBQ is alright. Their sauce is pretty good. I had their cheeseburger and shared a portion of baby back pork ribs. They serve large portions for a decent price. I might go back, but I still don't really like barbecue that much.

Thank God I went to San Diego with someone who used to live there, otherwise I probably would have completely missed this carnivore's delight. I don't even eat chicken (really) and was impressed with the BBQ'd chicken pieces (can't seem to remember the more aptly-titled menu name of the item...but at least I didn't call it "road kill") I had during a delicious and tummy-pleasing meal. I can attest that the ribs and onion rings (like I had any room for them after a plate of pure protein, their plates come packed!) are equally pleasing from the bites I snatched while my dining companions were engrossed in a college football game. I tend to prefer quicker-paced, down-home style joints, so long as the food is the #1 rather than paying to have an ambiance. Here that is the case. My only beef (bad pun alert!) is the wait, which we narrowly missed by slipping in around 11:30 on a Saturday morning the day of a big Chargers game. But it would have been worth the wait, their sauce alone allowed me to consume poultry, which is usually only done if I'm drunk and craving Popeyes. Don't matter if bird, Piggy or Moo-Moo usually suits you, you will enjoy all at Phil's.

I've passed by this restaurant dozens of times while driving around Point Loma. My boyfriend lives here, and I can smell the aroma of Phil's BBQ from my bf's place. But every time we decided to go, it was super crowded and we ended up leaving. But yesterday, we decided to go because it was a Tuesday and mid-day. I ordered the the half-rib dinner (with a side of baked potato) and my bf got the BBQ cheeseburger (with baked beans and french fries). We waited a few mins until our food was done. OMG.....the ribs were finger-lickin' good! The sauce was tangy, but just right for the smoked ribs. The meat just fell off the bone as I sunk my teeth into those scrumptious ribs! The baked potato was pretty good, and so were the baked beans. The fries were so-so, but I could honestly live without them. I have officially experienced the BBQ at Phil's....and what a good one! I would most definitely come back here for some more grub :)

Love their food. Prices are a bit steep. Ask for sauce on the side! They drench everything in their BBQ sauce which tastes good in small amounts but overwhelming when they over do it (which is almost 100% of the time). Lines are crazy sometimes which sucks.

I would probably live off of Phil's BBQ everyday if I could! I am definitely not a fan of any kind of barbecue, actually not a meat type of girl at all BUT Phils is an exception! As a lot of Yelpers have mentioned before me, you definitely want to go during off peak hours which would probably be anywhere between 2:00PM - 5:00PM or just go really late at around 9:30PM unless you don't mind waiting one hour! it's always at least a 40 minute wait.....but it is truly worth it. I normally get the quarter rack with two sides. With each entree, we are allowed either two small sides or one large side, but how am I supposed to choose only one or two if ALL of the sides are just so good? I always narrow it down to either the potato salad, cole slaw, or fries. If you haven't tried it already, definitely try it at least once! It is also great for families with kids, groups of teenagers, or anyone who just wants to sit at the bar and watch a game. This place can accommodate to anyone, so try it!

As 400+ others have stated, Phil's is great. Definitely on the short short list of BBQ in San Diego and probably this side of the Mississippi. The only reason I'm reviewing is to compare it to"Famous Dave's" (my north county BBQ equivalent). Food quality wise I'd say Phil's wins on meat quality, though ribs at both places were excellent. I preferred Phil's brisket which is thin sliced and slathered in sauce, to Dave's thick drier chunks. Onion Ring wise , my other gauge of BBQ place quality, Dave's has delicious crumb battered strings and Phil's has fat tempura rings. Both are primo, though I love Dave's ring sauce. Price wise they are comparable ($10ish for a sandwich/drink, $15-20 when ribs are on your mind) and Phil's has a more homey authentic feel, to Dave's engineered southern decor. ÊAll in all, I would likely prefer Phil's, just because it felt more like a down home cooking kinda place to me. A very laid back comfortable atmosphere. That said, I won't be traveling to SD just to get it.Next time I'm down South I know where to stop for lunch.

i really only have 3 problems with Phil's (and one of them kinda isn't their fault) 1) Even as a 20-something, I appreciate keeping the bar area seperate from where families sit- it just makes a more welcoming enviroment when there are kids around. But PLEASE, there is nothing worse than waiting in a formidable saturday line, than having to wait in another line to get a beer. maybe this is just some weird city regulation at work, but it's kind of a bummer 2) It's my personal taste, but the sauce is pretty sugary. i recently ate a another bbq place out of state, and their sauce was as sweet, but they threw the whole batch in the smoker with the hog, and it was PERFECT! maybe a sauce option? 3) (the not fault one) BBQ is expensive! A meal of mainly meat is sure to rack up a bill and put you 6 feet deep in the couch for a couple hours. But any meal that you have to wear a bib for is not one a personally want to break out a Ulysses Grant for, but so is the nature of the beast. And I could have just missed it, but I don't remember seeing any straight pulled pork, which is mother's freakin' milk. That being said, i think the rating speaks for itself.

the line is always up to, our spilling out of, the doors here, so that should be your first hint that it is amazing. the scent of phil's bbq can me smelled from blocks away. as probably the best bbq in sd, phil's offers pork ribs, chicken and beef ribs that slide off the bone and are marinated in the perfect bbq sauce. the sides are so delicious that the two that come with the meal are never enough. pasta salad? potato salad? baked beans? corn? french fries? cole slaw? onion rings? TRY THEM ALL.

this place has the BEST BBQ EVER! highly recommended, its pretty crowded. the food comes out extremely fast, which is awesome. the only thing you really have to do is find a table for yourself, which is kinda hard though. the ribs are delicious and i love their onion rings! really big and verryyy crunchy! (theirs a lot of oil though, but its all good) expect to get your moneys worth.

large portions, awesome onion rings, phil's will definitely leave you stuffed or with lunch for the next day or wanting to diet immediately. prices are very reasonable and expect a huge serving of heavy but tasty bbq selections. thank god they have that hand washing station in the the back!

This must be the best place for BBQ in San Diego, but overall, if you've traveled around the country, this place is over-rated. ÊI must mention I ordered a full rack of baby rack ribs (true carnivores will say these are better then beef ribs) and it was a large portion, but the sauce was mediocre and the ribs were not as soft as other's ive had in the past. ÊTheir ribs scored a 4/5 to me....Other places such as Rocklands in MD or Dinosaur BBQ in saracuse are better IMO. ÊOne issue I had with this place is their limited menu. ÊIt seems to only focus on Chicken and Ribs. ÊTrue BBQ places should have beef brisket and Sausage too. ÊSo minus 1 star for them lacking in options. ÊSecond, they dont even have Mac And Cheese....For some people, including myself, this is ones favorite side dish with a delicious BBQ meal. ÊI opted with their macaroni salad (amazing) and BBQ beans (decent). ÊSo minus another star. ÊOverall this place is solid, but over-hyped due to its long standing history in San Diego. ÊIf i was around the area i would visit again, but not worth the travel if it is not in my route.

AMAZING! ÊI was daunted by the huge line and since this was my first time at Phil's, I almost left to find another place to eat. ÊBut I was outvoted 3-1 to stay so we got in line [I think it was about 30+ minute wait.] ÊAnd then we finally got inside and I must say, it was totally worth the wait! ÊWe got the beef ribs, the baby back ribs, and the chick-less dinner [basically chicken minus the bones]. ÊWe doubled up on coleslaw [which I loved] and also got fries and corn on the cob. ÊI must say the BBQ sauce is amazing and now I can understand why they would sell it by the bottle--I dipped everything in that sauce. ÊMy husband says the beef ribs are better than the baby back but I would recommend first time visitors to just try everything! ÊPortions are huge [good for sharing] and it was pretty reasonably priced for the quality. ÊI'm always on the hunt for a good BBQ place and Phil's has made it onto my list of top 5.

if you are in the mood for heavenly bbq, this is it. if i can't have rudy's in texas, then i will take this. the food is fantastic. the line can be VERY long, but it does move quickly & they have their system which works pretty efficiently. if you are in the mood to be waited on, this is not the place. you need to have a little energy to stand in the line & brave the crowd. but you won't be disappointed when you taste the food. the baby back ribs are AWESOME!!

Wholly BBQ! The food here is great! I came here last Saturday after touring UCSD with my niece. When we drove up into the parking lot, i was hesitate about eating here because of the long line but when we got in line, I was distracted by the music they were playing on the outside speakers and the menu above our heads. I was very indecisive on what to get because everything look so good. About 20 mins later, it was our turn to order and I ordered the combo meal with Chicken-less and 4 ribs. You also can choose 2 small sides or 1 lrg one. I haven't eaten pork in years but since I was at the best BBQ place in SD (base on Yelp), I just had to give in and try it. I split my meal with my husband. We were both fulfilled after eating the beans, potato salad (I'm not a mayo eater either, but this was the base potato salad I ever had), the chicken-less and the ribs. The reason why I gave this place a 4 star was because the seating arrangement we were given was on the Patio by the bar and we had to squeeze through another table to get to where we assigned. thank goodness for those open windows on the Patio because without them, we can be trapped if there were a fire or something, but with the open windows we can easily jump over. hee hee. I will deifnitely come back here for BBQ when I am in SD. Gotta bring the family here to try it out. PROS: -Delicious food -Reasonably priced CONS: -not enough seating. Very crowded. -Need more restrooms. There are only two stalls in the women restrooms.

Overall 3.5 stars on the food. ÊI think this place was way over-hyped for me. Ê4.5 stars and reviewed over 1500 times..i was expecting some the best!! ÊBased on the reviews, Êmy husband and i each ordered a full rack of baby back AND the beef ribs. Êwe also ordered the onion rings which were delish! clearly...way too much food even for good eaters like us! Ê the beef ribs came w/5 giant ribs w/a lot of meat. Êi'd say each beef rib contained between 4-6 oz of meat. Êthe beef was a little fatty and chewy, but tasty. Êi didn't like how 2 of my 5 ribs were burned....the entire rib was black! Ê the baby back had to be my fave, but they also burned a few of those too and drenched it in sauce. Êfor a BBQ place that got 4.5 stars, i'd expect to be able to eat all of the ribs on my plate! overall, i'd come back again, order less food (1 full rack of baby back, 1 half rack of baby back and small onion rings), and skip out on the beef ribs. Êoh and i'd order sauce on the side too.

best bbq you'll ever eat (unless you haven't been to texas, LOL) everything here is freaking delicious! prices are very reasonable as well. i get the baby back rib and chicken combo because it has a little bit of everything to try. macaroni salad is awesome, coleslaw is good, fries get soggy easily, and the onion rings are A MUST! el toro is really good too but i kinda get sick of it easily cause there's so much meat and bbq. its really good but heavy so you'll get full quick. everybody there is SUPER nice and friendly. the line is always out the door and around the corner but the most i've ever waited was about 40 minutes so it's not that bad. plus, the employees there feed you fries while you're waiting so there's really nothing to complain about. my piece of advice is to order to go. there's no wait for that, you come, pay for it, pick it up and you're done. plus you have the comfort of eating at home. but if you do decide to dine-in, tables are a bit hard to save. they also have a table with to-go boxes, bags, forks, napkins, everything you need to bring home food.

How do they do it? Everything is fresh and great! The french fries are freshly fried and cut from the whole potato, the beans are great and the mac salad is al dente. The pork ribs fall off the bone like none I've ever had before. We had an international group and I wasn't sure how everyone would like the BBQ, but it was a smash hit. Highly recommend you check out Phil's.

On top of the great food, the owner is great guy who cares about his customers and his employees.

If I had to walk the green mile, baby back ribs would be my last meal. Phil's bbq is way overrated. If you want to know what quality ribs taste like try baby blue ribs or the ribs at smokehouse in burbank. They don't try to cover poor quality meat with sauce.

I can't believe I forgot to write a review of Phil's while I was out in SD this past February. I believe we went on a Wednesday night around 8pm or so. The line was around the building but I was told that is not as bad as it could be. We actually made a beeline for the bar area and staked out some stools and lucked into a couple of folks leaving about 5 minutes into our wait. The bartender was friendly and promptly took our beer order and gave us menus after wiping the bar area down. I had the BBQ Broham (pulled pork sandwich with slaw) and a small order of onion rings. The sandwich was superb and the rings were fantastic. For a couple people to eat and a few beers the tab was about $30-$35 which I felt was very reasonable. My suggestion is not to wait in the line and try and check out the bar first to see if you can swoop in on some seats. Otherwise, a wait under an hour would be worth it in my opinion. I definitely will try and go back on my next visit.

Phil's Barbecue is by far the best ribs in town. I have been eating there since they opened in mission hills.

We were almost afraid to try Phil's at the new location since we had enjoyed getting 'down and dirty' - at least to our elbows - at the Hillcrest hole-in-the-wall. ÊThe new spot is sooo much better! ÊFrom the time wonderful, warm Rhonda, the hostess, greeted us, it was just a trip! ÊWe ordered the Brougham and El Toro sands, which we had always enjoyed, plus a large coleslaw and large onion rings with beer batter. ÊAlthough there was a LOT of food, we managed to eat every mouthwatering morsel except the bottom of the bun - c'mon, there's a limit here. ÊThe noisy ambiance and appropriate music was great and everyone working there from Rhonda to the guy who took our order to the busers was cheerful and friendly. ÊNo wonder it's incredibly busy - but don't let the lines fool you; they move fast and it is most definitely worth any wait you might encounter. ÊOne caveat: Do NOT come here if you're on a diet because you may pledge yourself to portion control but self-control goes out the window as soon as you smell that yummy aroma permeating the whole place.

Baby Back Ribs were initially sweet, but the spice slowly draws you in and creates a great balance. Fall off the bone tender and had a great char. Coleslaw was very good, fries not so good. I wish they offered sweet potato. Aprrox 35min wait in line, but plenty of inside seating and friendly service. I've had BBQ in Kansas City, Memphis, Texas and this would hold its own.

I found out about this place back in May 09. I can honestly say that I have come back at least about 30 times ever since. That is a lot. And there is a a reason why. That reason is because Phil's BBQ is the best bbq in San Diego, and it is the best I have ever had! Hands down. I had never been a fan of ribs, it just didn't appeal to me. I have had ribs in several places and it just never did it for me. I LOVE bbq sauce though, I really do. But coming to Phil's and trying their ribs, has made me a ribs connoisseur. I now LOVE ribs, and so far, Phil's is my favorite place to go for a finger-licking good BBQ. Their ribs are just so meaty and ever so tender. Fall of the bone goodness! But it's not just the ribs, EVERYTHING ON THE MENU IS GOOD! They have some super delicious burgers and sandwiches, I personally recommend their BBQ Cheeseburger, it is just burger heaven and always so fresh since they don't make them 'til you order it. Their baked beans have a little touch of spiciness to them which only makes it better, their fries are something different, they are not great but they are good, but it is not your typical fries you will enjoy them. Their chicken is also delicious and very well cooked in my opinion. I have not even tried half their menu(but I do plan to ;D) since it is so vast, but any combination will satisfy you. When it comes to their prices, some people might say it is a little pricey, that's what I thought at first, but when you actually get your food, it is worth it. They serve you heaps of food. You really do get what you pay for, believe me. I work at Sea World and the restaurant I work in sells a "full rack of ribs" for almost $18(which is around the same price for Phil's full rib dinner). That platter comes with fries and steamed veggies, But their portions are puny. The ribs are average when fresh, when reheated they are just shameful. Comparing their "full rack" to Phil's full rack is just an embarrassment. Phil's comes out on top by a mile. Take my word for it, you WILL leave here wanting to come back!

Phil's has the best BBQ I've ever had. ÊThe only thing that keeps me from going every week are the long lines and difficulty getting a table. ÊSauce is absolutely amazing! ÊNormally I get the half chicken dinner with sides. ÊI also love the beef rib tickler.

my wife and i were looking for a good bbq place, a friend from work said to try phils it was the best bbq he'd ever had. first off we waited for about 1/2 hour just to get inside, which is usually a good sign. well let me tell you, for a bbq place in san diego it wasn't a place i'd recommend. the ribs were over sauced, the mac salad was dry and somewhat bland, the baked beans were easily forgettable and the baked potatoe (a large side) was quite small. if you get the bbq sauce on the side, i'd imagine it wouldn't be that bad. if you are from anywhere that has good bbq, don not go here.

The sauce was good, though on the tangy side. The meat itself did not have that great smoked flavor that I crave in good barbecue. All in all, everything was fine but nothing mind blowing, and certainly no reason to slap yo' mama.

If you're from San Diego, you know Phils. ÊIt's a local legend, and for good reason. ÊI'm a BBQ junkie, and in a city that has a surprising number of good BBQ places, Phils is the best. ÊNow, I must acknowledge, it's not smoked, but instead grilled with liquid smoke. ÊBBQ purists have a (justified) problem with this, but in my mind, it comes down to how it tastes, and Phils is simply delicious. ÊI normally go with the baby-back ribs, which are fall-off-the-bone tender, with a great rub and a great sauce. ÊI've had their beef ribs, which are super tasty as well. ÊIf I'm there for lunch, I'll usually get the Broham, their pulled pork sandwich (although I get it without slaw). ÊMy friends have had the tritip sandwich as well the the BBQ chicken, both to rave reviews. ÊIn terms of sides, their fries are excellent, their baked beans are very good, and their onion rings are some of the best I've had (pro tip: put a couple onion rings on your sandwiches, it pushes them from great to outstanding). Ê The one problem with Phils: the lines. ÊPhils has a justifiably great reputation, and that's led to some significant lines, with waits usually between 20 and 40 minutes, and as much as an hour during peak times. Ê It's usually worth it, but be forewarned.

Just a totally delicious & fun experience both times I have been there. ÊAwesome price if you have a smaller appetite and you get the "Tickler" ÊI really love the fries and coleslaw & the ribs fall off the bone just as they should. ÊInitially thought sauce was too sweet but it grows on you fast and its great when it gets kinda mixed up with your fries and ketchup & coleslaw. ÊNice and happy servers. They pay attention to quality and details and that is why they have the longest lines in SD. ÊI'm not a line person so I only go on off hours.

Holy Buckets of BBQ this place is good. I'd suggest not going right at rush hour Êor to call ahead because this place is usually packed to the gills. The truth is, it's worth the wait, and probably longer. If you like BBQ then you are required to eat at Phil's. Cheers.

I am from out of town and found Phil's to be not only good food but a friendly place with the staff more than willing to help. In most of the restarants in the area service is not a stong suit of any. At Phils even though you seat yourself they make you at least feel welcome. This is not the best BBQ I have Êever had but it is in the top 3 or 4 I have eaten in and I have had some really good BBQ in KC and Saint louis, There is enough on the menu that all should be able to find something they like. The long lines are fast moving and also a good indication that the food is good.

Disclaimer: Lived in Virginia for 4 years and while it's not the Deep South, they still have a barbeque reputation. ÊHaving said that, Phil's is okay barbeque. ÊIn my opinion, it's not as good a chain as say, Dave's BBQ for the following 3 reasons: cafeteria-style dining area, super-ridiculously-long lines and pricing. ÊThe first two speak for themselves, but calling in ahead does make the wait dwindle to 5-10 minutes from arrival to picking up your food. ÊAs far as pricing goes, even to-go is about 25-30 dollars for dinner for two (ribs, sides and no drinks or dessert). ÊFor the length of the line and the dining area, we should be paying about 15-20 dollars for two people. ÊI am of the bbq-sauce-is-too-tangy opinion, too. ÊAfter all of that, I still go back from time to time (calling ahead, first). ÊThe call of bbq is too strong to ignore.

The best BBQ in SoCal! Originally being from the Midwest, I know BBQ, and this reminds me of back home. I have tried numerous BBQ places all over and hands down, this place is the best. The service is just as good as the food. The staff is extremely friendly and very fast. I probably haven't had better customer service at a restaurant. My wife and I always split the Broham Sandwich and the Rib-less Dinner with a side of fries and beans or coleslaw. You have to try these. All the sides are awesome, especially their fries, sounds boring, but they compliment any meal very well. The Colossal Onion Rings are pretty good too. It is closed on Mondays and it is always busy. Be ready to stand in line for awhile, especially on weekends, if you get there between 6 and probably 9 pm. The line usually moves pretty fast though. If you are hungry for BBQ, this is the place to go, no matter matter how far you have to drive.

Their Baby Back Ribs are AWESOME....but when it comes to everything else, they are just average. ÊYes I said it....average. ÊTheir Bro'Ham sandwich (pulled pork sandwich) is really not that good. ÊBut I also lived in Texas for a year and have seen how good pulled pork can be. ÊThe ribs though are definitely worth it. ÊThe line can be impossibly long (though its no fault of Phil's so I won't take any stars away for that.) ÊTry and order it to go, you will get your food much quicker. Ê The sides are decent and the chicken can be good too. ÊGo there for the ribs, and if you have never had a pulled pork sandwich, try theirs....but if you are a BBQ aficionado, then stick to the BBRs.

Best BBQ in San Diego (perhaps anywhere, but I have not tried all the BBQ places everywhere, while I have tried them all in SD) their specialty are the ribs (both pork and beef) but everything in amazing here. You might have recently seen this place on the travel channels Man Vs. Food. There is always a line around the door (don't worry it moves fast) but the people are there for a reason and the wait is well worth it. 5 stars, no questions asked.

Phil's obviously has great food based on all of these positive reviews. I just thought I would add my two cents, as if anyone cares. For meat, this is the best BBQ place you can find in San Diego. The fries and onion rings here are some of the best I have had anywhere. So what is the problem?? The Sauce! I don't know what it is, but this sauce just not cut it for me. Obviously I am in the minority here based on the lines in front of this place every day, but I cant stand the sauce. That being said, I eat here at least once a month just based on the quality of meat and sides alone. Oh by the way, the baked beans are awful too!

I was in LA and a friend recommended that I try Phils, over in San Diego. ÊIn a race against the clock, I sped over there from LA, barely making it before they closed at 9:40. ÊWe ordered the baby back Half Rib Dinner and the Beef Ribs Dinner, also got onion rings. Ê ÊThe ribs, I must say are the most tender I have ever tasted. ÊThe meat is literally falling off the bones, not sure if they are cutting the tendon on the bone such that it does that, but the meat literally pulls off the bone intact, leaving you with a big chunk of meat and a clean bone. ÊThe portions are huge and I quickly found out that we ordered too much food. ÊThe baby back ribs, tasted good and were tender, but I didn't quite like the sauce on it. ÊThe beef ribs were my favorite, tender, and the sauce was right, but the meat was a little fatty. ÊThe onion rings are very large and good as well, very very crunchy, first time I had it that crunchy. ÊLike one other reviewer said, I couldn't eat too many, as they were very greasy and oily, but yet still good. ÊOverall, if you are looking for ribs, Phils would be the place.

let's just say i have been hearing about this place for the past year, and since i didnt make it Êhere on my last SD trip i made sure i went on my second trip..my friend who lives in SD loves this place...we planned our day around hitting up Phil's for dinner..after having brunch and going to the zoo we hit up a dessert place in order to prepare for an expected wait here...apparently its THAT good....when we arrive in the parking lot we can clearly see a line, uh oh...but being that we expected there to be a line we went anyway..we get to the line and i swear i felt like i was at disneyland! the line wrapped!! LUCKILY we were that hungry and we ended up talking to the people with us in line as well as the waiter/worker who was tending the line...oh they also have someone walking around the lines offering samples of their fries!..after about an hour wait we were ready to order at the front of the line...my friend and i ended up ordering corn, onion rings, a full bbq pork ribs and the bbq chicken/beef combo...after you order you find a free table to sit..the food comes really fast literally 5-10 minutes and i whole order was done!..man oh man..the bbq pork ribs were soft and falling off the bone..the beef ribs were huge! with eating just one piece of enormous bbq beef rib, I felt like i was fred flinstone eating in bedrock! and the onion rings...super fresh and perfectly battered and fried to a crisp! definitely worth a try if you are ever in the SD area...oh did i mention i bought 3 bottles of BBQ sauce and a container of their dry rub? just in time to bring it home for a superbowl sunday bbq and everyone loves the dry rub and bbq sauce!

Hate to say it, but I was SERIOUSLY DISAPPOINTED with Phil's. ÊI had heard so many wonderful reviews...well talk about a build up...because it definitely didn't meet my expectations. ÊI am a native San Diegan (yes we do exist :)), so I can't claim to be an expert in good BBQ, but with a degree if Food Science, I should be able to know what good food tastes like. ÊOk, I'm being a little harsh, but I honestly was disappointed with everything I ordered. ÊTo start, the BBQ sauce was gross...it tasted like vinegar, so even though the chicken and ribs were cooked well...they were ruined by that gross sauce. ÊThe beans and the coleslaw weren't bad, but they weren't great either. ÊAnd the biggest disappointment of all....they don't serve any of the best BBQ sides: Êhush puppies, cornbread, sweet potato fries, or sweet tea. ÊThe best place I've found in San Diego is Joey's Smokin BBQ in North County. ÊIf you like a sweet BBQ sauce, yummy sides, and perfectly cooked pulled pork, you'll love Joey's.

One word. Disappointing. A few other words. Still the best ribs in the San Diego area (depressing). After reading all these great reviews and seeing the lines wrapped around the corner of the building everytime I drove by, I had to try this place sooner or later. First of all this is a reivew of their ribs only, I did not try other dishes on Phil's menu. I love BBQ ribs and have tried many in the area from Tony Romas (Ugh) to ones way out in Poway and ribs from around the nation in Boston, and in South and North Carolina. I have also attended a few rib cook-offs including the Best of the West in Reno, NV. So I have tasted my fair share of ribs and had some amazing ribs at competitions and in the South. Given the Yelp hype, and have tasted some award winning ribs from around the US, I had high expectations. Phil's disappoints as their ribs are not BBQ, but grilled. Yeah the ribs are moist and fall of the bone tender, but there is no smake flavor nor nice pink color to the meat you would get from slow smoke BBQ. That being said, their sauce is one of the best I have had and the reason for 3-stars instead of 2. Their sauce is probably the reason thier ribs taste decent given the lack of flavor from the cooking process (grilling versus smoking). The ribs themselves are fairly large so you won't be disappointed by puny ribs that barely fill you up. Prices are reasonable and on par with what you would pay at other rib joints. I'll probably end up going back to Phil's and given them a second chance and try other menu items, but Phil's certainly does not deserve the high praise it gets nor the enormous wait to get in. Unfortunately, when you offer a decent produce in a mediocre market, you get people rushing in and praising it so highly.

Wow what a disappointment. This place seem like a great bbq joint but what it turned out to be was a big waste of money. I first walk in with a long line of people. After about twenty minutes of waiting I got up to the cashier and saw the menu and asked a couple of questions. I ordered the ribs, el toro(brisket sandwich), bbq beans, fries and bbq burger. I also tried to order sweet potato fries and corn bread but they dont serve it here at PHILS. What bbq joint do you know that doesnt serve corn bread and sweet potato fries? After another fifteen minutes of waiting I got my food and was excited to chow down. What I got was burnt ribs, dry brisket drenched in bbq sauce and a some what tasteless burger. After just one rib and 1/3 of the brisket I was done. My wife couldnt even finish her burger because it was so tasteless. The beens were just beens with brown sugar and the fries were just fries. I've been to a lot of bbq joints and this was probably one of the worst ones. The price was way over what it should have been. I'll never eat here again unless I'm dieing for some burnt a** meat and over priced food. Oh and good luck finding parking after 4pm.

been coming here ever since they use to be in mission hills on goldfinch. im so glad they moved to a bigger joint! i gladly make the drive (and theres a target nearby-oh i love target...ok back to phils bbq). the line looks atrocious but its not so bad. if it wraps around the corner, id say around 20-30 minutes. for some reason, even though its hella crowded, seating is never an issue, large or small party. i guess peeps just chow down on the ribs and then bounce? its too loud to have a conversation in there so i wouldnt recommend this place for a first date (and also, rib sauce all up in your grill aint sexy ladies). we always get the ribs/chickless platter which consists of 3 ribs, 3 bonelss pieces of white meat chicken and either two little sides or one large side. if you arent that hungry, you can easily share that one platter. they have a wash station on the way out which is nice when the little wipes dont cut it. BEST ribs in SD imo. oh and the baked beans, mac salad and onion rings? cant leave w/o having some of those babies! its the whole bbq experience at phil's~finga' lickin' gooooooood...

Like some, I don't see what the big deal is about this place. #1? I don't think so. Only came here for the second time because it was my friend's birthday and he loves this place. First time I got half a chicken, and believe me, it was half a chicken. My brother had the rest of my leftovers and claimed he didn't feel so good. Second time I went for something smaller, so I got a bbq chicken sandwich (not a big fan of ribs). The server warned me it would take about 15 minutes and I said I'll wait. So I wait while all my friends are enjoying their plates. About 20 minutes pass and my buzzer still didn't ring. So my friend, the birthday boy, goes inside and checks it out. Turns out they didn't even get my order. Really? They brought out complimentary onion rings but I had already lost my appetite. My sandwich was dry and the caesar salad tasted foul. They say third times the charm but I don't think I'll give it another shot. Sorry.

I heard and read a lot of good things of Phil's BBQ in sunny San Diego from friends and online reviews so I had to find this place and check it out. So me and my friends drove here not knowing really exactly where the place and just had an Idea where it might be but we really did not need any directions at all because the Aroma of BBQ smelled so good the it took us there without the need of MapQuest. The place was packed this usually means that It's a good sign so we couldn't Wait to get some food but we had to Wait because there was a long line that took about thirty minutes before we can get some food! The wait was worth it only because I didn't eat breakfast or anything that day not even a Poptart (eww) so it was about one o clock and hungry as hell. I had the combo of grilled chicken with a baked potato and some ribs. The baked potato taste like how a baked potato should taste like no complain about that, Chicken was small and a little dry but good, the ribs were good, definitely can comeback for those and I also had some of my friends onion rings which I should've ordered myself because they were really good and would steal some off his plate when he went to the restroom,get some napkins, get a refill Etc. Overall the place is packed which I really liked because it felt alive and this was a place to be in SD for foodies at least and the food was good but not up to the hype people bring it up too but very good nonetheless. Service was pretty attentive especially since it was busy but there probably used to it.

Phil's BBQ has become a San Diego institution. ÊI love barbecue and like many San Diegans, I thoroughly enjoy eating at Phil's. ÊThe food is consistently excellent -- these are probably the best ribs I've ever had -- and the vibe is good (it just feels like a good place to be on a weeknight or weekend) but two things keep me from visiting more often: first, it's expensive. ÊThe full rib dinner is around $19, and truthfully, because I am a big eater and savor BBQ, I almost always want seconds, which is a problem considering my small budget (and the cost of BBQ). Second, the lines here are insane. ÊI've come here several times before with my parents and another time with a friend and just left immediately once we saw the length of the line. ÊThe line length certainly validates Phil's BBQ as being a great restaurant, but I'm usually not down to wait 50 minutes for some ribs. ÊI suppose it's best to plan your visit ahead of time -- e.g., during off-peak hours -- or you'll be waiting in BBQ purgatory for awhile.

Phil's BBQ definitely has some good BBQ but is somewhat overrated. The BBQ itself is very good, though not great. Their onion rings are just ok, though not the best I've ever had. They taste more like 2 different items rather than two flavors that are complementing each other. They also need a better selection of sides. The location sucks. ÊIf you have a new car, don't take it. Ask someone else to drive if you can. Why? Because the parking lot is so crammed that you are bound to get a ding or two. The 1hr30min+ wait also sucks. It probably would of been 1hr if people didn't keep cutting in line (Yes, the seating is more like a fast food restaurant than a sit down restaurant). Overall, going to this place was somewhat of a disappointment. Maybe I expected a bit too much but who wouldn't when you have to wait so long just to get your food. I probably will be going back, though not when the wait is as long. The wait is just not worth it since there are better restaurants in SD that will actually allow you to write your name and go have fun rather than wait in line (not fun).

Ok, first let me let everyone know that i am from Dallas Texas so my expectations for good BBQ are pretty high. I have had phils on several occasions because it was catered at a annual party so the two times that i have had it it was not at the restraunt but through their catering service my experience with their catering service mad it not necessary to try the restraunt. First thing great coleslaw beans and macaroni salad i have no complaints about any of that stuff. The chicken is ok it was kinda dry and very little BBQ flavor tasted more like roasted chicken than anything else. The pulled pork is good but could have more flavor as a pork dish should have a very distinct taste and flavors. Ribs were tough and most certainly not falling off the bone. The rolls taste like the ones you get from the plastic bag at the grocery store. This does not make phils bad in my mind but their BBQ sauce does! It is way to sweet and has a cherry base which resembles the stuff put on deserts. When i say sweet i mean really sweet making the stomach sick sweet. Their are not many places that i have fond which have good barbecue int eh San Diego area which is sad but there is one place off clairemont mesa blvd called "Abbeys" which is pretty darn good (and they got fried okra if you've never heard of that then no wonder you think phils is good BBQ)

Some of the best BBQ in San Diego. ÊThe onion rings are killer and made fresh. ÊThe ribs are the best thing on the menu, and I even like the side dishes. ÊBeans and macaroni salad are the way to go. ÊThe "ribless" pork was a bit dry and stringy, so I stick with the ribs. ÊMy friends swear by the sandwiches, and my wife loves the chicken. ÊThe sauce has a nice little back ground kick to it. ÊIf you are looking for a quiet place to have dinner, then go somewhere else. ÊThere is always a line. ÊOh yeah, they are closed on Monday's so don't be fooled if you pull up outside and there is no line to get in. ÊThe true secret to Phil's is to call ahead. ÊThere is a separate line for call ahead orders, so you are in and out in a few minutes. ÊWhen I have a craving for BBQ, i call up Phil's. ÊAside from the crowds, the main draw back is that they do not have brisket. ÊI guess I'll have to get that elsewhere.

This place is the perfect example of over-hyped. After being told by a few people that I have to check this place out, and reading loads of positive reviews, I figured it was worth a try. Being from Las Vegas, we have Lucille's which is unbelievably good BBQ in every sense. After arriving and waiting approx one hour in line, we finally got to the elusive front counter only to take a number and find our own seat. It is kind of a do-it-yourself approach to seating, which was weird. We got the food. The ribs were smoked, and had great potential of being delicious if they used a better sauce. The sauce they used was more like Kraft BBQ sauce. The fries were plain, and nothing to write home about. The coleslaw was the same. The best thing on my plate was the corn-on-the cob, and I savored it. I guess if you like a packed-out place, and candied BBQ sauce that tastes like it came out of a store-bought bottle, then this is your place. Is it me, or is San Diego is starved for decent BBQ?
