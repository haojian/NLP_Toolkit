Fantastic KBBQ here. Not AYCE, but that's ok, because the meat is quality. Also, on the menu, they indicate which items have wheat and/or soy in them. Meaning, yes, you can be gluten-free and eat here. Hallelujah! We ordered the brisket and unseasoned galbi. Even without the marinade, there was some good flavor. Add a bottle of Hite, and call it a meal. Definitely recommended.

I'm currently making my rounds on the Los Angeles KBBQ scene. And with 1000+ reviews, I certainly can't ignore this place. After my experience here, I would say this place is a good, AFFORDABLE Korean BBQ restaurant compared to others. But I have had better quality meat at other places that just don't compare. As I mentioned though, the prices are reasonable here, which is probably why I would come back. I came here on a Monday night with two friends. And even on a Monday, there was a 45 minute wait at 8pm. We ordered the Combo C special, which includes : -Pork Belly -Seasoned Beef Rib Eye -Chicken Bulgogi -Beef Brisket -Doenjang Jigae -Banchan (weird because banchan should ALWAYS be offered regardless) -Free bottle of soju, bottle of beer, or three sodas Nothing about the food really blew me away, but the meat was still good. Even though the seasoned beef rib eye offered in the combo was their cheapest rib eye, I think it was probably my favorite of the bunch. And I'm usually a pork belly kind of girl. This was certainly a good amount of food for all three of us. And we ended up paying a little over $25 each, which I'd say is a great deal. Service was perfect. And their vents work! We didn't have smoke blowing in our faces and clothes. Overall, great experience and I'll certainly be coming back.

I've been dying for some good K-BBQ for sometime now. Soowon Galbi was just the place to satisfy all my cravings. We had the Soo Won Wang Galbi (marinated large beef short ribs), Chadol Gui (sliced beef brisket), and Galbi Tang (soup). Their banchan (side dishes) were not as many as Genwa's but whatever they had were all very high quality and tasty. My favorite ones were their spicy cucumber, sweet seaweed, and spinach. What was surprisingly excellent, compared to other KBBQs I've been to before, is their service. The waiter was very attentive, cooked the food for us, and came by to check on us quite often. When the meat came, it was melt in your mouth good. I only wish I could've tried more variety and come with a larger party next time. This is definitely one of my favorite go-to barbeque places when I'm not looking for AYCE. I will definitely come back here again.

I've been back a couple of times since my original review, most recently this Friday afternoon. ÊMy daughter called me up the other day and told me that she was in town for a little while, and knowing that Korean BBQ is her favorite, I only had to decide between this place and Park's. ÊIt was an easy choice. We arrived at around 5pm, and the amazing service commenced immediately when the guy set the salad on the table. ÊThe service team continually refreshed our banchan and cut the galbi the moment it was ready. Ê At $27.50 an order, the price may seem a little steep, but is indeed a bargain when you consider the quality and quantity they serve you. Ê Prime Korean BBQ, some quality time with your grown children, and the afternoon off of work....life does not get much sweeter than this!

I went here with 2 friends Saturday night. Arrived around 6PM and got a table immediate without a problem (apparently, we beat the crowd there because a line started forming shortly thereafter). I thought the quality of the meat and everything else (side dishes, kimchi, soup, etc) was really good. Additionally, they label which of the items in their menu has wheat/soy! This was great for us because one of my friends has a glutten allergy.

Doctor: You have a serious illness.... Me: What is it doc? Doctor: You have meatavirus Me: What does that mean? Doctor: You can eat meat anymore... Me: (Gets down on knees and raises arms to the heaven) NOOOOOO!!!!! Ê (Wakes up from the nightmare) While living in Ktown I've had my fair share of AYCE bbq. So before leaving K-town, I've decided to hit up the most popular Êbbq in K-town with a buddy even though it's not AYCE. Once you walk inside, you will notice that this place is pretty clean and there's an absence of smoke and air of bbq. Lets start with the banchan side dishes (what would a korean restaurant be without the banchan). I remember 12 dishes, each one was fresh, and tasted great (I especially liked the bean sprout). We ordered the combo for 2 people which included brisket, pork belly, and chicken and a bottle of either hite or soju for $40. The waiters here were nice enough to cook most of our food for us. Arguably the best quality of bbq I've had in ktown and it filled my buddy and I up perfectly without giving us a food coma. Furthermore, they have a parking, I'm not sure if it's free though. Overall, I'm kind of over the AYCE scene, so if you're like me, give Soowon a try, you won't regret it.

Hands down my favorite Galbi restaurant in LA. You truly get what you pay for here. I always come here and order from the combination choices. The sides are amazing and service here is awesome (unlike so many other Korean places with old, rude, bitter waitstaff). Try to get here before the dinner rush, especially on the weekends as wait times can go up to an hour. There's valet parking in the lot for $2. Do yourself a favor and come here. It's so worth it. Well, DUH! lol XD

I couldn't be happier with every aspect of this place. We got the Bulgogi & samgyupsal and both were mouth watering. Our server was incredible as well! He was very polite & friendly, but also talked enough to make us feel more comfortable. ÊThis place could easily become a second home to someone because of how welcome they make you feel.

I don't come up to LA very much anymore since I got married and mostly live and work in Orange County. ÊHowever, today I had business in LA and it was noon when I was done. ÊGreat opportunity to do some LA eats while I'm here. I came here wanting something hearty but not greasy. ÊI remembered that the last time I was here about 6-7 months ago, I enjoyed the galbi tang. ÊAfter looking over the menu, I knew that's what I would order. Great decor - Nice upscale casual - Crappy parking though Great food - Quantity, lots of food - Quality, high quality meats and ingredients and fresh delicious side dishes. The last time I came, the broth was luke warm. ÊThis time, piping hot! :) Great service - Just enough attention. ÊI like my privacy but I want service. ÊPerfect for me Great prices - $8.xx for a bowl of this stuff? ÊAnywhere else in my neighborhood is $11. Nice. Ê$2 for valet parking though. ÊNo choice.

5 Stars for the meat quality! At first, I came here thinking it was going to be another typical AYCE kbbq restaurant, but boy was I in for a surprise. I walked in for dinner and noticed that it was relatively empty -- surprising for a kbbq place. However, I did notice how clean and polished this place looked with their fancy decor. Our group of 6 ordered the Combination A plate. The waiter took a while to bring our drinks but he bounced back by always coming back to cook our meat. Although I like the usual aspects that come to mind when going out to eat AYCE kbbq, I definitely enjoyed this place. The meat tasted sooo good and there was enough to fill me up but not to the point where I stuff myself and can't move. I would recommend this place for more fancy or business dinners.

Oh my, where should i start? I'm not even sure if anyone will care to read this far down because this restaurant has over 1000 reviews already! What can i possibly say that other haven't said. Like everyone said, this place is QUALITY over QUANTITY. Like everyone said, it's a little PRICEY. Like everyone said, the serving is PRETTY SMALL. Like everyone said, it is a 45-1 HOUR WAIT TIME on Saturday nights. Like everyone said, it's $2 for a VALET. Like everyone said, it's NOT ALL YOU CAN EAT. Like everyone said, you gotta ORDER BY PLATE. Like everyone said, it's UNLIMITED SIDE DISHES. Like everyone said, SOOWON GALBI is the best. BULGOGI is the second best. One quick tip for those that is not very FAMILIAR with KOREAN BBQ. You gott eat the meat from the LIGHTEST to the TASTIEST. You gotta start from the FRESH MEAT or LIGHTLY MARINATED then work your way to the TASTIEST OR MOST MARINATED one. Came out with 100$ TAB for 2 people, but all well worth it. :)

The best KBBQ I've ever had! It wasn't all you can eat, but you get what you pay for. My family and I ordered the B combination and two nengmyuns. It was the perfect amount to fill all four of us up. There are also about 10 side dishes and several sauces (to dip your meat in) that come out with your meal. Additionally, we received some nooroonggee (warm rice in water) and 2 dwenjang jjeegehs (Korean bean paste stew) towards the end of the meat grilling. Everything melted in my mouth. WOW. If you've had KBBQ before, you can definitely tell that the quality of meat at Soowon is excellent. I barely had any room left for the nengmyun, but I managed to eat half a bowl anyway. Skills! Service was ridiculously fast and friendly. The young waiters and waitresses came by once in a while to help us flip/cut the meat and refill any waters and side dishes. Highly recommended for when you have $$$ in your wallet and a big appetite!

From 4 stars to 5 stars! ÊHOLLAH! I ate lunch at Soowon Galbi last week and left a 4 star review. Ê My Yelp buddy Greg N. told me that I should try dinner and I would give it a 5 star rating. ÊMy Yelp buddy Travis I. told me that dinner is the best option there. ÊBetty N. told me that my review was wrong (in a nice way)! ÊAnd, my new Yelp friend Danny, told me that I should come to dinner and give it a second chance, and to ask for him as my server (he works there!). Ê They were all RIGHT! Went for an early 5:30 dinner on a Sunday night and this place was PACKED! ÊWe got the last empty table (Note: by 6:30, there was a line out the door with 6+ groups waiting to get in). Panchans: ÊWe were served 11+ Korean appetizer dishes. ÊGrade: ÊB+ Korean Salad: ÊNice and refreshing. Pickles daikon radish: ÊSweet and puckery. ÊNice! Honey Potato: ÊOne of my favorites! Ê Kim Chee: ÊMade the traditional way! Fish cake: ÊAnother one of my favorites! Spinach: Êboiled and marinated spinach. Bean Sprouts: Êboiled and marinated sprouts. ÊCrunchy!

Cucumber kimchee: Classic goodness! http://www.yelp.com/biz_É http://www.yelp.com/biz_É http://www.yelp.com/biz_É The first course was the Mool Naeng Myon (cold buckwheat noodles) - $9.00. ÊWOWZEE!! ÊI normally order the bibim naeng myon, which is the spicy buckwheat noodles, but Danny told us that the chilled beef broth version was the most popular dish in the house. ÊWe took his advice, and WOWZEE!!!! ÊThis was DELICIOUS! Ê It was a bunch of buckwheat noodles served in a cold broth of beef stock and vinegar. Ê SUPER delicious and refreshing! ÊLoved the chewy noodle texture and slurping the broth inbetween bites! ÊThis was the best Mool Naeng Myon that I've had ever! ÊDELISH! ÊGrade: ÊA+ The scond course was the SooWon House Galbi shortribs ($28). ÊThe meat came out in four slabs and cooked on a tabletop charcol grill. ÊFirst, you should know that the charcol used to cook is imported from Korea!!! It's a special charcol that gives the food a special flavor.

Soowon is a city that my boyfriend is very fond of and when he saw that the name of this place was Soowon Galbi, he just had to check it out. The first thing you're going to notice is that this place is very crowded and smokey. Their ventilation doesn't work as well but the servers are super friendly. You're probably going to have to wait though since it's pretty small. Note that this is not AYCE KBBQ. We don't eat a lot of marinated meat because in most cases, we find the marinade to be way too sweet so I have to admit I was a bit hesitant about ordering the Galbi here but we figured since it's what they are known for, we better check it out. We ordered an order of the Chadol and Galbi. They were really good. I even really loved the Galbi! The Chadol was also good and rather fresh. You can tell that the quality of the meat here is pretty high. The service is also pretty decent here considering how crowded this place is. They actually cook the meat for you which is a plus. The small side dishes were really really good. Much better than the small side dishes at the other KBBQ places. It is a bit expensive though. Our meal came out to be around $50 and if you're a big eater, it probably isn't going to be enough. If you want to eat a lot of meat then this place isn't the best place for you. Soowon Galbi is definitely quality over quantity. Super delicious though! 5/5

I had dinner at soo wan galbi last night. No wonder it has such high rating on Yelp! We ordered beef tongue, soowan galbi and tiger shrimp from the menu. It comes with over 10 appetizers and salads. Ê The best thing on the menu is Soo Wan Galbi(the first item listed on the menu)! ÊThe meat tasts increadibly tender and juicy and perfetly marinated. Last night was my first time ate at this restaurant, i used to be a big fan of its competitor Chosun Galbee. After last night, i would recommend Soo Wan Galbi for when you hang out with friends. I think Chosun Galbee has better business atmosphere. Ê The service of this restaurant is also good. Young and handsome waitors helped us grill all the meat and gave us advice of cooking tips. The only thing i don't like about the restaurant is the heavy smoke from the grill..... The restaurant is so foggy inside! I can barely see what people are cooking on the next table!

Since this was not AYCE, I was expecting to notice a difference in the meat, and I was kind of disappointed when I realized it tasted similar to the brisket, pork belly and chicken bulgogi meat I've tried at AYCE places, but for twice the price. ÊIf there is a difference in the quality of meat they serve here, clearly my palate is not refined enough to notice.

Love this place! This is not an all you can eat krn bbq restaurant. The meat is great quality, you're definitely getting what you pay for. The service was overall generally friendly, our waitress was a total sweetheart. The noise level is also pretty low which I really appreciate in restaurants. Most krn bbq places you can barely hold a conversation because of the blaring korean pop music in the background. Parking always sucks and there is usually always a wait, but I find it worth it. :)

Arrived at Soowon Galbi on a Thursday night at 7pm and there was a line of people waiting to get in. We had a 45 minute wait to study the menu so when we were seated we promptly ordered. The food took no time to come out and was greeted with hungry appetites. Now to the good part. We ordered the C combo for 3 people, butterfly shrimp, and the pancake appetizer. The food was outstanding! It was literally the best meal I have had in a long time, and I've been eating well this week with family in town. The flavors and textures contrast and compliment each other perfectly. The quality of the meat was very good and the sides were fresh and delicious, not to mention bottomless. My party of 3 were big eaters and I worried that the C combo for 3 would leave us hungry and unsatisfied. I was wrong. The portions were more than enough and we could not even finish. Bill came to $100, as we drank only soft drinks. Our waiter was friendly and helpful, as was service in general. They have valet parking in front but parking was free at the meter across the street after 7pm. Overall, the drive to K-Town and the 45 minute wait was most definitely worth it. Soowon Galbi is a great place to bring family, friends, a date or have a birthday dinner. It's no wonder they have 4.5 stars on Yelp with 1,000 reviews.

I am a regular here. I think the quality of meats are pretty good and their side dishes are plentiful. They will always refill if you want more. Sometimes they just bring it out and other times they ask. I prefer they ask since I hate to waste food. Êand most of the regular servers are very attentive. I would rather cook my own meat but they often come by and check to see if the grills need changing or if my meat has to be flipped. ÊI have never had bad service here. Its a small parking lot which is valet after 5:30($2). ÊI do normally have an early dinner when I come especially on weekends. It can get so crazy busy that I know to come early.

I am a big fan of Soowon Galbi ! My husband and I go to that place almost every saturday - I am not kidding - and we usually take the same old thing : Chadol gui ( beef brisket).

Fav' dishes : Mayo white seaweed Zuchinni Turnip with vinegar (See my pics on the album for more details ) Service is also Ênice & clean and the waiters/waitresses are very lovely ;) There's 2 negative points : you stink when you go out of the restaurant so just wear casual clothes when you go there.

Great experience here. told all my friends to stop by this restaurant. but they don't speak good English, even me.. so they always worry about ordering in any other place. couple of my friends already tried this restaurant but they told me they had a great time here always. All the servers were friendly and very helpful but Server Danny was the best they said. Because even all my friends got hard time ordering, he was listening carefully until he fully understand what my friends said. So starting to the end,everything was clear until my friends finish their stuffs. Danny. You are a great server We and I ever had before. Dear Soowon Owner, I feel jealous to the owner because we owns restaurant in Japan but we don't have a server like a Danny. You are so lucky !! Anyways soowon galbi has a best meat quality and best service! I will definitely come back soon or later.

We came at 4:30 PM, and so there was no wait. Ordered some soju, chicken bulgogi and butterfly shrimp. The appetizers came out right away and were plentiful. The meat was tasty and the servers were quick and polite. We were a little confused as to whether we should be doing the cooking ourselves or the servers, because as soon as we started to turn the meat a server would come over and do it for us. Maybe that was bcause the restaurant wasn't busy. It was packed by the time we left at 4:30. Might come back here with a group of people, but not for a date. Especially as your clothes smell very smokey afterwards!

High quality Korean BBQ! It is NOT an AYCE BBQ place. You choose two or more meats from their menu (and pay for each plate of meat) or choose the different combos. My friend and I chose two plates of meat Soowon Galbi and Bugolgi (because they were the few that were marinated). They had the grill in front where you choose to cook the meat yourself or the waiters would help you cook the meat. The meat was cooked with charcoal. They had a lot of side dishes that were unlimited. The meats were very authentic and juicy. It was very rich in flavor and tender. The staff was very welcoming and friendly. The ambiance was classy yet homey. The restaurant was very clean, even the restroom! Parking was fairly easy because we came around 2:30 on a Tuesday. Soowon had a tiny parking lot and we managed to park there but ÊI'm pretty sure there's street parking nearby the restaurant. Even though Soowon has tasty food, with higher quality comes higher prices. They use premium cuts of meat and it is never frozen, delivered to them fresh daily and marinated for 48 hours in their signature sauce. For one plate of Soowon Galbi it was about $27.99 and for one plate of Bugolgi it was about $22.99. It was definitely too pricey for college students like me, but I think it was worth the price. It filled me and my friend up really quickly even though it was only two plates. I believe that if you are tired of the average quality $9.99 AYCE places and are looking for something better than that, Soowon Galbi is a MUST TRY.

Came back today as it may be my annual E3 dining spot! Ordered "Combo A" $99.99 for 5 types of meat and the usual sides. For some reason, we got our salad today but NOOOO soup! They totally went from a strong 4 stars to a 3.5 star for that... We were seated right away for a group of 4, keep in mind that it is 10pm...lol..but hey we were starving and I would settle to eat here anyday. There was also no valet but there was front parking! I had to ask a few times for more banchans and they delivered some but not all of what I requested. There are 4 starving people at the table...sheesh! and is why it's still not 5 star spot! Meat and Soju was really good! I would still come back..and although I wasn't treated and spoiled like the last few times, I still enjoy the food...until next visit!

Food was very good. I don't think the ventilation was as good as Park's BBQ, but it was decent. I liked that they cook the food for you, BUT they stop by your table too often. I felt like there was always an arm reaching in front of my face. But service was quick, side dishes were decent. I'd return.

I had some of the best kbbq in my LIFE here. ÊThe quality and flavors of the beef was unlike anything I have ever had. ÊThe banchan was tasty and plentiful. ÊThe jiggaes were also damn delicious. ÊThe Koreans I was with ordered some sort of combo and it came with all types of meat. ÊWe also added on the soo won galbi and that was bomb. ÊWe also ordered a few bottles of beer and soju and the total came out to about $35 a head. ÊPretty good deal for the meal. ÊMy only gripe is that I live in SF and can't go here everyday.

We usually go to the same restaurant when we want to eat korean bbq. So we hardly try different places. But I saw so many good reviews about this restaurant on Yelp, and we decided to try it. We got a combo for 2 people. Banchan was all good. I got tenjan chigae instead of stew. We wanted to try bibim myon, but we got too full and did not order it. I dont really like chicken, but their chicken was good:) Parking is the issue here. I do not really like valet, but street parking is pretty much full.

For those who know me, Korean food is one of my top favorite meals to eat. I love the variety of things you can pick at during your meal. Since I had a great experience at Kang Hodong Baekjeong (http://www.yelp.com/biz/É), I wanted to give Soowon a try since their ratings were just as high. The restaurant is really nice and like most Korean restaurants, they fill up your table with a ton of sides. My two friends and I decided to split an order of Galbi & Bulgogi which I thought was already pricey. We considered getting a combo, but the meats we wanted were in the higher priced combos so we were SOL there. The food came out really fast and the servers even helped us cook everything. Everything tasted good and I enjoyed my meal thoroughly. For the three of us, we each spent $22 on two meat entrees and although the meal was good, I would've rather spent it at an AYCE place. I was still yearning for some meat after it was gone, but we just filled up on sides until we were full. The service was a little off too. It seemed like they were hesitant to give us more stuff when we asked for it. For example, I asked for rice wrapper and he said he'll go check if they still have some. He didn't bring any back for me. Later on, when some other friends joined us, he brought some out for them when they asked for it and I was already done with my meal by then. Our friends ordered a combo that came with soup that I guess the servers didn't bring out. When our friends asked for it, I believe the server said that some people don't eat it so they didn't make one for them. Why is it listed in the combo if you're not going to give it to your customers? Strange, right? Soowon Galbi was good, but too expensive for what we got. Personally, I fell in love with the food and service at Kang Hodong. At this point, I think I'm getting a little anxious about trying other KBBQ places because it probably won't be as good.

Five stars for the food. Five + stars for the service. But the wait is killer. We waited close to two hours for a party of six around 7pm on a Saturday. I have never in my life waited that long to eat KBBQ and started to get a little antsy as 9 pm was approaching. But the fact that I can rate this place so highly even after such a wait, speaks volumes about SG's great food and staff. Once we were finally seated, there was a noticeable difference about their service compared to other KBBQ places I've been to. Even with a packed house, our server never seemed to let the stressful environment get to him; he was extremely polite and even cracked a few jokes. Reasons to go to Soowon Galbi: 1. Their meat is delicious! (sorry vegetarians!) Try the following: Soowon galbi, joomuluk, pork belly and dip them in their garlic/sesame oil sauce or the gochujang. 2. BANCHAN PARTY! The best part of SG is the extensive variety of banchan. Everything was delicious: the spicy cucumbers, kimchee, potato salad, dried anchovies, pickled radishes, spinach... 3. Excellent Service! Friendly, attentive, and funny Only downside is the wait, which is only because they're so popular. If you need to park your car in the lot, valet parking will cost you only $2. Save yourself the headache of finding parking around K-town, and give over your keys.

Meat lovers: This is a great place to check out. They first start you with the salad, and slowly they will bring out the banchan: small dishes of condiments: the kimchi, pickled daikon, cucumbers, beanspout with sesame oil, slices of rice paper, soup, eggs, rice, And are replenished if empty. Our waiter is awesome, very attentive, she cooks for you and serves you too. Great services!! We ordered the Combo A plate The ribeye steak, unseason large beef short ribs, pork neck, pork belly, beef brisket, marinated sliced ribeye and shrimp. They served with high grade meat because it is so juicy and tender. The meat was grilled on charcoal which gives the meat a better taste. you can grilled the garlic, the yam, and mushrooms for extra taste

This place is poppin. Had to wait around 45 minutes for a table, but it was well worth it with the LAL Playoff games on the TV. We got the $79.99 meat thing with some other stuff, and it came with free Soju. It was a nice bottle and they were trippin when I asked to keep the cap, but I wanted to show the people who I was with the flicking cap game. The homie hooked it up with like 5 caps, though. Service is good and on point. Good grill and they put on the meat and move it around for you when needed. Some fools were drunk off that Soju and were super loud, but other than that, good environment.

Soowon Galbis is a great KBBQ place. On a Saturday night the parking and the long line could be a bit intimidating at first but I think you will find the experience well worth the wait. Parking is not so good if not impossible unless you pay for the valet. Service was great, the server was very attentive and was around constantly to cook the meat for us. The food quality was excellent, I really could tell the difference between Soowon and other higher end AYCE KBBQ. For example, the brisket cut was thicker, more marbled, and had a much more satisfying taste. Ambience was classy, clean, and Êcasual.

Came here for lunch with a friend and ordered the 2-person combo D for $39. It was the perfect amount of brisket, pork belly, and chicken bulgogi. I have to admit I was not excited about the chicken, but it turned out pretty good. The pork belly wasn't great but it's still pork belly so it's never BAD. I think they forgot to give us egg and our stew that comes with the combo, but we were full and decided it wasn't worth mentioning. The quality of the meat, in my opinion, was equal to O Dae San and it's $12 all you can eat there. However, I'm sure the other combos have a better selection so I can't say for sure.

Overrated and terrible service. I'm a pretty happy camper if you just plop down my food after a reasonable wait time and don't give me dirty utensils, so it usually takes a lot for me to complain about service, but Soowon Galbi's was bad enough that it overshadowed the entire dining experience when our group of four went there for Sunday lunch. Things started downhill when we stared blankly after the waiter rattled off for a minute in Korean. But we knew anyways that we weren't going to pass the compatriot-grade-service qualifying test that all Asians are subjected to when frequenting other Asian establishments. So we forged ahead with an order of Combo A, which for around $100, was supposed to come with a few sides, salad, stew, rice, and your choice of soda or alcohol. After putting in our order, we basically became invisible. The salad and side dishes came, and were never refilled despite their apparent state of consumption and our multiple requests. Minus one star for stinginess. Then the meat arrived, and even though other tables received help with cutting and BBQing, we were left to our own devices. Ok, whatever, we fancy ourselves as able-bodied youngsters who can maul our own meats. But, with no large bodies of fresh water next to us, the state of our hydration was left to the mercy of the staff. Sadly, (wo)man cannot survive on soju alone. Minus one more star for never bothering to refill our water. Lastly, after all the meat was consumed, we looked at each other (and at other tables) and asked ourselves, where are our rice and stew? Since our resident LA Times journalist didn't want to ask, I decided to polish off my dusty journalism skills and asked the nearest waiter the hard-hitting question--"um, are we getting any rice or stew?" The guy looked taken aback for a second, and then barked "What stew do you want?!" Major WTF. One, that tone--to borrow a phrase from Stephanie Tanner--How Rude! And two, how am I supposed to know what stew you guys have? We just want whatever the other tables (who ordered the same combo) are automatically getting. Five minutes later, we were presented with thin radish slices swimming in tasteless transparent broth. Calling that concoction "stew" would be like calling McNuggets "chicken". Both generously exaggerated and borderline untrue. ÊMinus a third star for making us Oliver Twist ourselves into getting a pittance of food. Overall, we were sorely disappointed by our experience at Soowon Galbi and would not recommend this place. The meat was better than your average AYCE, but for the price, that was pretty much expected. At the end of the day, the only taste that lingered from here was that of poor and biased service.

My friends and I had a bit of difficulty finding this place since it's a bit hidden in this plaza, but otherwise, we had a great experience with this place. We came here right after they opened for lunch on Sunday, and there were already a good number of people seated and eating. Upon arriving, we were promptly seated (they even gave us a choice of table vs. booth!), and the wait staff was overall very friendly and nice. We got the Combo C, which contained a good mix of beef, chicken, and pork, and was just enough for our party of three. The combo also came with our choice of drinks, and the waiters helped us figure out which soju to order. They were also very responsive and answered any questions that we had about the food items (one of my friends had a dietary restriction, so we needed to keep certain meats separate). Not only did they come over and help cook the meat for us, they also cut up the larger meats such as the pork and chicken, and they would stop by every so often to check on us (even without prompting from the call bell). The food itself was amazing! Even though the combo only came with 5 different meats, there were at least 10 side dishes (with unlimited refills!) as well as soup. The interesting thing about the soup is that they slice up daikon to resemble noodles, and then cook it in the soup with small chunks of beef. Everything was super flavorful, and even the ventilation was very effective. I actually came out not smelling like meat for once! Price was a bit high, but considering the amazing service and great food, I'd say it was well worth it!

You've heard it all before - this is good Korean bbq. General tips: -Gets crowded fast during dinner hours -Need to put your name on the wait list as soon as you get there -Need to eat your side dishes first before they refresh it but you do need to ask them to refresh it. ÊThey won't automatically refresh it for you like some other places will. -Bowl of steamed rice is not given (unless you ask and not sure if they charge) -If you ordered a combo meal - Eat your meat first, then the rice in hot water (noo roong ji) and stew will come after -Sweet rice drink (shik hye) is provided at the end of the meal (complimentary) Parking - private lot but valet $2

Princess and I went to an early dinner and craved Korean BBQ for days. ÊLucky to find a parking spot right in front curbside. Ê We got there before the dinner rush, and ordered combination C, which is for 3 people. ÊWe were really hungry, hehe. ÊOur server, Danny, was very friendly and even mentioned that they accidentally brought out combo D, but offered to bring us the meat that combo C included, without charging extra. ÊThat was a nice touch. Princess had raspberry wine, of which I had a bit, and I ordered a Heineken. ÊDanny kept our kim chee coming, which was delicious. ÊI really liked the bulgolgi chicken. ÊThe bathrooms even had mouthwash to offer the guests. ÊI really liked that touch. Another thing was that Danny brought Princess a tide pen to clean off a tiny wine spill on her shirt. ÊThat was really noteworthy. We left very satisfied and went to Market World for some more of the raspberry wine. ÊThat review is next. Thanks for the fun night and laughs, Princess! xx

I've frequented many KBBQ places and although this place is rated 4.5, they really get just a 3-3.5 from me. First off, try to park on the street and you can save yourself $2. This place is by no means cheap as compared to the other places I've been to. The place was def clean, service wasn't the best I've ever gotten at a KBBQ nor was it the worst, but the one thing that stood out for me was their side dishes (banchan!) I have to agree with all the other reviewers when they said that they have A LOT of different kinds and they are all so yummy! I couldn't stop eating the almond with anchovies, cold spinach, and cucumber. Most other places drench their cucumbers and/or kimchi is REALLY thick sauces but their versions were much more delicate and light. We got the combo D: Pork Belly + Chicken Bulgogi* + Beef Brisket. (serves 2) and it came with either a bottle of soju or beer for $40. I think this was the most economical option since some of the meats were $20-$30 for one single order. The brisket came first and it was nice and juicy. The pork belly was next and it was nice thick pieces that weren't overly fatty for me. And the chicken came last, and it was very nicely marinated and delicious. The meal ended with my favorite.. Den Jang Chigae! Their version of the soup was thicker but not necessarily more flavorful. Although I liked the quality of their meats and their variety of banchan, I doubt I would return since there are so many other options in the area.

3.5-3.75, My girlfriend and I decided to eat a late dinner to make up for the calories I lost during yoga. What better way is there than some sort of BBQ to achieve this? Especially Korean or Japanese (see American would load you down with all the good corn bread and Mac n cheese, so I had to stay away). So traveling up Vermont with iPhone in hand (not mine), we saw the extreme fervor for this place and, well, we caved in and entered the establishment. At first glance the doors looked a little dark and ominous, but there are a lot of places like this so we kept going. After opening the doors and having the wood charcoal smoke and the smell of BBQ hit us we couldn't turn back. We were greeted nicely despite out 9pm arrival and seated at one of the booths. Our waiter was extremely helpful in deciphering the large menu (not that it's really confusing but it makes statements like "* = you must order two orders." However, our waiter ignored the legend and said "you can order just one." Graciously, we accepted the offer (@~$30, so ~$60 for one dish wouldn't have left room in my budget for any other sampling) and decided on the house special marinated beef ribs and the tongue. We had seen a table with their salad bowl (not the sides yet... Wait for that) and thought two dishes would be enough. The salad and dipping sauces came with rice noodle strips and they were very good (the sauces that is). So onto the sides which arrived in numbers... 11! In total, the most I'd received previously was 9, so bravo on quantity. And if you finish them, they are quick to replace the whole batch (you can see from my picture what they look like). We enjoyed the mellow spice of the kimchi that surprised us. It had a great body of flavor. The others in simple oil marinades or fresh vegetables were good. The creamy ones were not quite that good. However, none of this mattered when we were practically stuffed before the meat came. The first out was the tongue. It was laid out beautifully by one of the women in white (who also magically cut the galbi). The guy who subsequently laid out the tongue just threw it out there. The tongue was very tasty, maybe the best I'd tasted. It was so simple but when paired with the sauces (especially the rock-salt and sesame oil) was fantastic. Then came the Galbi, unfurled like a carpet of its marinade. It was very tasty in the fatty parts, but in the areas that were leaner, the marinade was just too sweet. The look and the taste was indicative of the meat's quality. It was great. Next time we'll get the in marinated ribs. The dinner was finished with a glass of sweet drink with pine nuts (possibly... Sikhye? It tasted like rice or malt or gelatin). It was as good as a digestif. No need for dessert after. The service was 5-6*, and I the Galbi wasn't so sweet, I would have given the place a 4-5. But when we go back, we'll determine a final review. The price was moderately high for a $$ restaurant and leads me to believe its more on the $$$ side for quantity's sake (yeah this is a hard swipe, but realistic for the type of food). More art would need to be included to rate it at $$ with higher stars. We will definitely be back though.

Bottom line: Great Food, Great Service. Sides - Check Meat cuts - Check Helpful and pleasant staff - Check Shikhye - Check Reasonably priced - Check Went to Soowon for lunch on Father's Day after reading the Yelp reviews. Was not disappointed. My previous favorite was Chosun Galbi. I would rate Soowon a bit higher on service and food quality. Where this really scores is the price. We ordered way too much food and stuffed ourselves. Was pleasantly surprised with the check. Chosun would have been 50% more. Chosun is way swankier and therefore can be termed more upscale. But when it comes to the stuff that really matters, Soowon comes out ahead.

BEST FRIGGIN KOREAN BBQ YOU WILL EVER EAT. Definitely the best meal I had in LA. THE SERVICE Service was great and so patient, even towards this one drunk party of 10. And if it's your Bday, all the servers come by to sing Happy Birthday to the party while playing this big ol' drum. The staff was very festive and welcoming. Ê THE DINING AREA For a KBBQ place, the dining area was very clean and not at all sticky or greasy. There were many fans and they opened the doors when it got too smokey. The smoke cleared out pretty quickly and didn't seem to be a problem much of the dinner. THE FOOD Not AYCE but you don't need it. Generous portions of beef, ban chan, and even complementary salad, soup, and sweet tea as a dessert! The Kaibi was juicy, tender, and just the right amount of fat. They cut it up for you, scrape all the meat off the bone leaving no waste, and occasionally come by to help you tend the heat, in case you've never done this before. The Pajun (seafood pancake) was also the best I've ever had. Very fluffy and tons of seafood. Had more egg than usual but it worked. The Ban chan (side dishes) had traditional dishes that tasted great, like Kimchi, the beansprouts, and the spinach, but also had some unique dishes with a twist, like the anchovies with almonds. They all tasted delicious. THE CONS Beware: as you would have guessed, the wait is 1.5 hr+ and the parking lot is packed like a sardine can. We put our name down and went to a nearby coffee shop to pass time. I would advise others to do the same, otherwise, there's not that much space to wait indoors or outdoors. For a party of two, our bill was about $80. BUT SO WORTH IT. MUST TRY.

5 stars for food 5 stars for service Meat quality is far superior than all other places I've been to. Banchan is great. Their service is impeccable. ÊAll smiles, very attentive and prompt. Overall a very pleasant dining experience. I consider this place to be hands down the best Korean bbq restaurant in LA.

Soowon Galbi KBBQ Êis really such a good experience! We've tried a couple of Korean BBQ places & this one is really better! ÊThey really have top, quality meats. ÊTry the following: Êtheir specialty, the galbi, it's really tasty! Ê Also don't miss out on their Khot Sal (marbled rib eye beef), this is really yummy & of course their marinated bulgogi & brisket! Ê Almost all korean BBQ restaurants offer the same on their menu but what makes ÊSoowon better is their marinade bec. in other places all their meats just tastes Êthe same & only their sauces/dips adds flavor but in here the meat itself tastes good even without their sauces. Ê Also, another plus factor is the numerous varieties of their banchans or sides. You'll have lots of these & they're really very delicious! ÊBanchans are refillable & unlimited but the meats are not eat all you can here. ÊIf you happen to come here, it's better to call for a reservation during weekends. Ê Parking is cramped but it's valet so just be prepared to pay. Ê The only thing here is that Soowon Galbi is quite a pricey place so just expect this! ÊThey have the package of combinations which will turn out cheaper but not everything in the package is the kind of meat you like so we always end up ordering our own choices, Êkind of like an ala carte. Have been here for a couple of times already & I can say that staff here, specially the ladies are so courteous, patient (even on super busy days) , very accommodating! Ê Ê Pricey place but good to enjoy every once in awhile!

Attention: THE WAIT IS LONG AS HELL NOTE: The BBQ is one of the BEST IN K-TOWN I would say overall their beef was great but what stood out and what I would say is the AYCE, the go to dish, the mother F'in shit is the rib eye...you see that the RIB EYE. Damm that shit was good, I forgot to ask them if the rib eye was USDA prime, select, choice but after eating it, nothing in the world mattered. I was in beef heaven for that 1 hour sitting and eating I forgot about how shitty out economy is, my student loan debt etc. After eating a gang of rib eye, I went for one more order and this time I got the grand daddy- the beef rib eye bone in...... WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED!!!! Overall this place is solid, service was great, the other beef dishes were good nothing to separate itself from other places, side dishes were good but now you know what the go-to-dish is. I hope you all enjoy it- definitely worth the wait.

Oh man - for me this was a case of a Yelp rating giving me too high of an expectation for a restaurant. I assumed that since it wasn't AYCE, is more expensive than other places, and had a 4.5 star score that the quality of the Banchan and the meats would be excellent. Instead, I found it to be incredibly average: Banchan (i.e. the many pre-meal Korean items that come in little circular dishes): Standard banchan with the exception of crab and mushroom banchan. +1 for that! But -100 for not having Japchae (glass noodles) or Egg pancake as part of it - you have to pay for a large side dish for them here. House Galbi - well marinated, good tenderness. This was my favorite of the evening. Chicken, brisket, ribs, bugolgi - None of these were any better than other places I've been to in Ktown, Rowland Heights, Hacienda Heights, the OC. Service was excellent. Interior was clean and well ventilated. On another note, I tried to order their marbled beef - but they were out?? Seems odd to not have your most expensive and delicious cut available on a Friday night. Prices were slightly above average, but not ridiculously so as some may fear. Meat entrees ranges from about $15 (chicken) to $31 (marbled beef), and they do offer combo plates that have up to 5 meats ranging from $40 - $100. Hite/OB beer was $6/bottle which was about average.

Not AYCE, but I had been here before and recall how yummy it was, still is but...geez Ktown in LA, so many choices, so little time visiting. :( Pros: Meat is really good! I mean that's the gist of going to a BBQ right? yum! Clean and modern decor and we got seated right away, it was about 6:30 though. Larger parties were waiting Branchan (side dishes) are pretty tasty and good variety. Cons: Shrimp order had two that I had to spit out cuz they just didn't taste right, and lemme tell you, it is NOT worth the risk. Take it from one who has been on her deathbed from food poisoning. :( Kim chee was meh. Only served hot sake, but I get it, it's Korean and soju is the thing. ÊWe like sake though, soju bit hard core for us. The service seemed a bit "bothered" by us, was it my cracker hubby or perhaps that we like lotsa jalapeos, sauce, and stuffs ;) But we racked up a bill with tip of $100, which is probably the other big Con. ÊWe do Korean BBQ all the time and this was by far on elf the priciest.

I've been to Soot Bull Jeep and Chosun Galbee in Koreatown in the past, but not for a few years. ÊRecently I decided to try Soowon Galbi based on the Yelp reviews, and I wasn't disappointed. ÊBeen there twice in the last month. First time was a Friday night, we arrived around 7 PM in the pouring rain but there were still a crowd waiting for a table. ÊTook us over an hour's wait to be seated, but it was worth it. ÊThe banchan was varied, and samgyeopsal (pork belly--spelled "sam gyub sal" on their online menu) was delicious. ÊThere was just three of us, so aside from the pork belly, the chadol gui (thin-sliced beef brisket) was the only other meat we ordered, and it was very good with the salt/sesame oil dipping sauce. ÊI also ordered an al chigae (spicy fish roe and tofu stew) and found it had more "stuff" (vegetables, even shrimp) than I'm used to in the soup, but it was delicious. Second time was last Sunday. We arrived around 4 PM that time and were seated right away. ÊWe had six people total, so we ordered a Combo C, which consisted of pork belly, seasoned beef rib eye, chicken bulgogi, Êand beef brisket. ÊWe also added on the pork neck (hang jung sal) and shrimp (see woo gui). ÊEverything was delicious, as expected, with the chicken probably being the weakest link (though one expects that the beef and pork are the stars in KBBQ). ÊWe also ordered an al chigae again. Both times the meal ended with a sweet rice (and barley?) tea that had a couple of pine nuts floating on the top (I forgot what it was called). ÊWhat a great way to end the meal.

This place is simply delicious! I've tried several Korean BBQ places in Korea town and LA and so far this is my favorite place. I've been coming here for the past year and I have never been disappointed. The sides are plentiful and their signature meet is to die for. You do have to wait a while to get a table on Friday and Saturday evenings, but it's totally worth it. Their service is amazing and they tell you what sides you're getting even when you've asked them several times before. Lol! 100% recommend this place.

where have i been all this time (for those who know me i don't write my review right away) i came here from reading all the review and i have to say thank you everyone and yelp, you guys have teach me what is good and not and i have experience so much. came in around 8ish and sat down the server is very nice and friendly. my friends and i order combo B and they brought out the side dish and i must say the best i every had so far. when the meat came out the server, cook for us and OMFG i have never had meat this good, it was so good that i had tears building up (i really did, it was so good) one bite of the meat is so much favor and melts in your mouth not in your hands. at the end they change grill and it was cool, now this is real KBBQ style open flame boy oh boy the house special is a must and the banchan i have to say I'm am very very please with it so g-oo-d good. at the end when your done with the meal they give you a shot of dessert drink and is good. well if you use the rest room there is a small thing on the wall for you to use. as i look at it for a while it hit me (mouth wash) how cool is that??? they give you mouth wash in the rest room now that a +++++ for me at the end the parking was only on the street but is not bad on a day like today. i will come back here again and I'll spread the ward

Phenomenal! Thank you fellow yelpers for this one. ÊI tried your suggestions....spot on with the excellence on the food suggestions. ÊGalbi Meat- which is their special and what they are known for was excellent- full of flavor and incredibly tender. ÊThat will run you $29.00 bucks for this dish. ÊAlso tried the Bulgogi meat it too was so flavorful and I believe that was about 18.00. ÊThe variety of condiments and sauces for these meats change the taste with each bite which I loved. ÊThe other recommendation was the Seafood Pancake which was so tasty and the sauce that comes with it takes it over the top. ÊWe Êordered enough food I'd say for 4 people to finish but the two of us did a pretty good job on it. Service was excellent- they cooked the meat right on the table in front of you. ÊDifferent servers will check on the meat as they are passing your table which is cool. ÊI was worried for a minute I was going to have to cook that meat to perfection myself. :) Ê We got there at a really good time just before 6pm, so we beat the crowd but when we left there was so many people waiting. ÊParking is $2.00 dollar valet- so definitely head into the over packed lot and let the valet worry about it as this food is worth trying. ÊI've had Korean BBQ once before but I don't remember it being nearly as good. Ê I really wish this place would chain out near my neighborhood.

We had heard this was the place in LA to get our KBBQ on. We heard right! We dropped the car at the valet station and walked in. There was a 30-45 minute wait. Not bad. Although, smelling all the deliciousness around me was torture! There are too many tables in here, so I could see the wait getting pretty ridiculous during peak times. The restaurant is clean and nicely done up. Dimly lit and flat screens on the wall. Very nice ambiance. There is a small waiting area in the front and then there is a bench outside. It didn't look like there was much to do in the area, so we just sat tight. We were finally seated and promptly greeted by our server, Danny. We flipped through the menu and then decided to do the Combo D - Pork belly, chicken bulgogi and brisket. We subbed out the pork belly for pork bulgogi. We had our choice of soju (Korean liquor), beer or soft drinks. We went for the beer. First, they brought out a light salad. Tasty but nothing to rave about. The rice and banchan (side dishes) rolled out. Once again, it was all tasty but nothing special. I should disclose that I'm Korean and grew up with my mom's cooking, so I'm pretty picky when it comes to that kind of stuff. The combo also came with a choice of daenjang jikae or moo gook. We chose the daenjang jikae - which was really good! I'd recommend it. But then meat came and that's when the magic happened. ... Danny got to work helping us cook our meat to perfection. OOOOHHHH!!! I can't rave enough about the quality and taste of their meat. Take a piece of lettuce, put some rice in it, top it off with some meat and daenjang and eat!! Sooo good! We left stuffed and happy.

Move over Cho San, I have a new favorite non-AYCE KBBQ place. Lets start by saying that most kbbq place I've been to has a customer service range from so-so to rushing to rude. But this place gets solid 5+ star for customer service alone. From the girl at the door to our server everyone is super friendly and very patient and accommodating. HUGE plus! As for the food, the quality of the Galbi is marble-esque with the occassional few pieces that's got extra fat, the overall quality is great. http://www.yelp.com/userÉ They ran out of a few meats when I came with the family and the Combo is not an option (minus 1 star) so we got 2 orders of Galbi, 1 order of Bulgogi, 1 seafood pancake and 1 beef soup. I was in severe food comma on our drive home, dreaming about beef.

I love this place. This is our go-to restaurant for KBBQ. FOOD: Keep in mind this place is NOT AYCE. It's a little pricey, but the quality of the meat is fantastic...literally melts in your mouth. Last time we came, we ordered unmarinated cuts: Khot Sal (tender cuts of ribeye) and Chadol (thinly sliced brisket), and the marinated Soowon Wang Galbi short ribs. We like a mix of both marinated and unmarinated meats. It comes with a plethora of side dishes, some duk bossam (rice wraps), and a bowl of their daenjang jigae (a type of miso soup with tofu). For 4 people, this was more than enough...in fact it would've been enough for at least 5. SERVICE: The service is impeccable. The wait staff are very accommodating and quick. They change out the BBQ grills in a timely manner, and you're food comes out FAST. There can be a long wait, but they take reservations! Be sure to make one, especially on weekend nights. DECOR: Very clean and modern. Their bathrooms are probably the nicest bathrooms in Ktown. PARKING: There's parking on the street, but they provide a valet service for only $2.

Its common knowledge by now that the best Korean food in the States is probably in Los Angeles, and Soowon is at the top of their game when it comes to traditional Korean BBQ. Like most shopping squares around Koreatown, valet parking is required, which is both very affordable and convenient. ÊDriving up to Soowon reminds me of going to most Korean spots in the area, they all kind of look the same to me. Coming here on a Friday evening for a party of 3 required a 45 min wait without reservations, not terribly bad for a popular place like this and finding it on a whim. ÊThey have a few chairs inside as well as benches outside for your convenience during your wait. The decor is very contemporary and sleek; lots of straight lines give it that modern appearance. ÊThe tables are large and spacious, with plenty of privacy to spare. The hostess was attentive and very polite. ÊWe decided to pop open a beer while we waited and she served us the traditional Korean way with both hands touching the bottle as she poured. Of course we ordered the Wang Galbi which turned out to be the best galbi I have ever eaten. ÊWe also had the Hae Mul Pajeon or seafood pancake that consists of baby shrimp, octopus, squid calamari, among other things and it was delicious. ÊThe Soon Tofu topped off our meal just perfectly. All of the side dishes were extremely fresh and satisfying as we continuously asked for more throughout the night. ÊThey also provided a complimentary traditional Korean soup that I've never had and even that was delicious. The service was impeccabble, probably the best service I've experienced at a Korean restaurant. ÊYou could tell they only hire the best of the best when it comes to helping customers cook their food and our waiter was no exception. ÊHe was spot on with checking up on us and even cooking our entire meals for us, occasionally changing our grill. The real charcoal grill added immense flavor to our meat, something you obviously just can't replicate with gas or electric. ÊThe only downfall is that you really reek of Korean barbeque afterwards. As of now, I would have to say Soowon blows away any of the other Korean BBQ places I've been to up until this point in terms of the quality of the food and the service for the right price. ÊI can't wait to come back here again, hopefully soon!

I have NEVER... EVER eaten Korean food in Los Angeles before. Boy, was I in for a surprise. This place lives up to it's reputation and glorified Yelp reviews. I'm definitely coming back the next time I'm in LA, which will be soon hopefully! The super dense Korean community really brings out the best in the Korean food down there. The competition is so intense that you have to know what you're doing to run a successful Korean restaurant. Located in a small market square, this place is tucked away with a crowd of people waiting outside. I'm not familiar with how things work in SoCal, but the $2 valet parking for this restaurant is an excellent idea since the parking lot is small. Our wait for 3 people was no more than 20 minutes, so we decided to enjoy an ice-cold Hite as we waited. I was really surprised with the decor and the staff. All you see are young Koreans, male and female, working the dining room and front desk. All very pretty people. Compared to up here in NorCal, you usually see older Korean women. It was actually really refreshing to see such young faces. The hostess was able to accommodate a booth for us like we had requested (big plus). The service here is impeccable! I have NEVER received such great service at a Korean BBQ house before. I barely had to touch the tongs and the grill because there was always someone checking in on us and making sure our meat was being cooked. The KALBI... God, what can I say about the most delicious kalbi that has ever landed in my mouth?! haha... Well it was freakin' delicious! Melt in your mouth delicious. Tasty, well marinated... Not quite where what they do to their cows down there, but there is definitely something different about the meat. As I looked closely at the raw kalbi, I noticed that the amount of fat to meat was very well-balanced which is probably why the meat tasted the way it did. All of the banchan was spot-on and some items that I rarely see at other Korean restaurants. What REALLY got my attention was the rice paper. I had absolutely no idea that SoCal eats their meat with rice paper. It was the first time I have ever seen this land on a table. However, their spicy tofu soup could have been a little better, but then again, it's probably because it was mild and not HOT (I love spicy food). The damage at the end of the night was about $60/person. Well worth it.

I went with a few of my friends and it was great. Definitely one of the better KBBQ restaurants I've been to in Koreatown in Los Angeles. We got the combo pack, and most of the meat parts I wanted came out. The price isn't the cheapest in the world; but that's only expected if you ever been to a decent KBBQ restaurant that's not a 'all-you-can-eat'. I actually reserved the seats through phone and the guy was really nice and generous. It was one of my friend's birthday and they even had this small event and brought out a cake piece for him. It was great. Definitely leave alot of tip for these guys!! Oh yeah btw, there is a valet parking for $2. Yes VALET for $2. ;)

Okay so I decided to take my family here for my Mothers birthday dinner. We got the $100 dollar package and I also ordered a plate of shrimp ( $19? ). - Didn't give us our soup till the END of the meal... I reminded the waiter twice before it came out. - Didn't have the rice ready towards the middle of the meal. My dad can't eat anything without his rice. Sigh. - The service was not up to par as I had previously experienced and expected. ÊOur waiter looked uphappy and when we asked for anything he didn't say a word and just came back with it. It was annoying... he felt it in his tip. - WHY did we not have sesame oil ? I had to request that as well.. - On the other hand, the meat was delicious as always. The beef brisket was everyone's favorite.... -Another waiter came by that was helping our waiter and I wish he was the one serving us INSTEAD. -Would consider coming back.. but maybe not after this experience.

The boyfriend took me here yesterday, and it was definitely worth the 2 hour drive from Santa Barbara! It was my first time in Koreantown and first time having KBBQ in SoCal and what a great choice! Parking is valet ($2) because we couldn't find any parking on the street that was more than 1 hour, but it was not too bad. We went right at 12:30pm so we expected a wait, but surprisingly, there wasn't. It filled up more as we were eating, but I'm glad we didn't have to deal with a huge crowd. It's probably really crowded at night and weekends though. The restaurant was very clean and nice. The service was great; they were very attentive and they kept coming over to help us with our meat. Before the meat came out, they served salad and 10 side dishes. Some of the side dishes were pretty special because I've never had it before - one dish was angel root (never had before) and one dish was this glazed nuts dish. Both very good and different! The meat was DELICIOUS. We ordered the Soo Won Wang Galbi and the Kkot Sal. The boyfriend was raving about the marbling of the meat and you can definitely taste the good quality of the meat. This place isn't all you can eat, but you definitely get enough food to get full. My mouth is still watering just remembering how good our lunch was yesterday. After we were done with the BBQ, they brought out a soybean soup with rice and a small cup of rice water. Yummy! I think that everything about this restaurant was great. If I was back in SoCal, I would definitely come here again for KBBQ. I definitely definitely recommend this place for anyone who wants great KBBQ.

What kind of businesses are open on Christmas night in K-town? ÊPretty much all of them actually... Our hero found himself here on December 25th with a large party, and the wait was actually fairly short. ÊThe servers here were nice and attentive, even though they had to work on Christmas day! ÊService was fairly fast, although they never bothered to change the grills even when they got fairly charred. Their pork belly and brisket were way too fatty in large clumps instead of a pleasant marbled distribution, which really cut down on the taste. ÊThe unmarinated galbi was a bit bland and needed help from their dipping sauces. ÊThe chicken bugolgi is a good choice if you're into Asian style dark meat. PROS: - Free large beers with KBBQ combo platters. - Service is fairly fast and responsive. - Banchan is large and refills are plenty. - All you can eat salad. CONS: - Their meats are all fairly fatty and char fairly quickly. - Really small waiting area where you're subjected to drafts from the door opening all the time.

YAY!!! The reviews do justice for this place!! It truly is an amazing experience for all KBBQ lovers out there. The quality is good, thus reflected in the price. Best of all, I loved their appetizers!! They have fish and almonds and this creamy mayo noodles appetizer. REfills for appetizers, but not meat!!

Cute casual place Food: -Meat - we ordered one of the Soowon combo meats. I think thats the best bang for your buck cause you get different varieties of meat. -Cold clear noodles - came with spicy sauce, cucumbers, and ONE slice of apple.. pretty good -Hite beer Service: Great.. because they actually noticed us! If your not Korean.. you know what I mean.. Its hard to get good service @ a Korean place unless your Korean yourself.. or if you bring a Korean friend...

I've been to Soowon twice, and both experiences have been really great. The first trip, we split one of the bigger sampler orders between five people with an extra order of meat. The second trip was for Valentine's dinner. Both experiences: the staff have been really nice, attentive, and not too intrusive with how much they are returning to the table. The sides have been delicious every time, and they also include rice. You might have to ask, though. My favorites are the bulgogi and the house galbi. My only complaints are that it's always freezing inside, and that I wish they would maybe include a cocktail or two. Thumbs up for the sake, though!

This might just be my new favorite Korean BBQ place in LA. ÊIt's not AYCE, but there's plenty of food and the prices are reasonable. ÊPlus, since you don't feel like you have to eat til you drop to make it worthwhile, you can walk away still feeling like a human being. You can get things a la cart, but they also have these combinations depending on how many people you're with. ÊWe had 5 people and got the combo meant for 4-5 people. ÊIt was the perfect amount of food. ÊNot too full, but far from hungry. Ê Make sure to make reservations and even then you might have to wait because this place gets pretty packed, so be patient. Ê My only problems was that they brought out the rice 3/4 through the email, which made it sort of useless, and they ran out of rice-paper (which is my favorite side).

I should have written this update months ago. After writing my original review I was contacted by the hostess from Soowan Galbi with an apology for coming across as rude and she gave me her cell phone number to call or text if I wanted to make a reservation in the future. A short while later I took her up on that offer and texted her to make a reservation for 8 people. She wasn't working but made sure that a reservation was made and everything went seamlessly and smoothly. We ordered one of the combo meals along with extra butterflied shrimp and veggies. The shrimp, pork bulgogi, and soowan galbi were all delicious. We had never ending sides including those tasty little pancakes, rice, kimchee, daikon, a very yummy salad, and all sorts of other yummy tits and bits. We walked out of there absolutely stuffed to the gills with a bill that came out to only about $20 a person. Definitely some of the best Korean BBQ I've had to date, great service, very clean and organized, and the waitress spoke English much better than at most places I've tried. I've gone back since, recommended to friends, and will likely continue coming here for KBBQ for years to come. Two stars bumped up to four. Thanks for caring and giving me good customer service... without it I might never have come back and I'm oh so glad I did. :)

Yes, it's true that you may have to wait for a while. ÊThey don't have a separate parking facility other than a few spaces in the strip mall in which they are located. ÊFinding a spot on the street (not a very good area) can be challenging, especially if you are there during the peak hours. ÊAnd the valet guy (not sure if he is a valet, or a parking lot enforcer) is not very friendly nor is he very fair (likes to powertrip). ÊAll these negatives could remove one star when it comes to the full experience rating. ÊThat said, I am sticking with five stars because: 1. The restaurant is clean and well maintained ... not as common for a Korean restaurant 2. The food is very good and fresh. ÊTheir meat is excellent ... this is one of the few good Korean Galbi restaurants where you do not need to know the owners to get fresh meat served 3. The side dishes are tasty and fresh and seemingly "unlimited"! ÊYou ask for more, and you will get more... such generosity is uncommon for a Korean restaurant 4. (and perhaps the most important) Their service is awesome! ÊThe reception and the servers/waiters are friendly, sincere, polite and PROMPT... ÊEXTREMELY RARE QUALITY that is very hard to find in Korean restaurants in Los Angeles or San Francisco. Hope their owners/management/chef/cook and overall philasophy of doing business will never change. ÊOne of the finest finds in Ktown. 5. You are likely to see an ethnically diverse crowd of patrons, which is a plus. ÊYou do not feel awkward or get attitude from servers for not ordering dishes in Korean

3.5 stars. You've likely heard of Soowon, an awesome Korean barbecue restaurant in Koreatown. ÊLess awesome is the parking situation. ÊWe came on a Saturday afternoon, the lot was completely full and the few empty spots were reserved for other businesses in the plaza. ÊWe drove around the neighborhood a few time and finally parked. Ê The place was pretty empty and not so smoky. Ê Frozen raw beef: ÊI didn't order this but ate a lot of it and wow it was frozen, raw, beef, drenched in some kind of sweet sauce, with sesame oil. ÊI think this led to some unpleasant diarrhea afterwards. ÊB Squid bibimbap: very spicy, pretty good. B+ Brisket: Good. ÊB+ Galbi: Standard quality, not as good as I had hoped. ÊB+ Banchan: nothing too exciting. ÊI really liked the one with the black seaweed. ÊThey were not so good about refills. Ê We got a beer and some tea. ÊThe tea cups were small and we had to ask for refills a few times. ÊThe servers, like many places in Koreatown, did not speak much English. ÊIt's a good barbecue place but I think I prefer Park's. ÊThey were a good 25% cheaper than Park's though. ÊSo if it came down to it, I guess they are comparable.

Went to Soowon yesterday for lunch and thought it was pretty average. The interior looked new and clean. Had the chicken and beef brisket combo. The banchan was very good but the service was a bit on the slow side as there was only one server during that time. The salad they give out uses their kimchi dressing which I felt they could be more creative and come up with a different sauce for it. The meats were pretty tasty but I think you can get more bang with your buck elsewhere.

This place has close to 1000 reviews so why am i reviewing it? Because this is simply the best Korean BBQ place for us! We go to this place a lot that they should give us some sort of discount already! My husband refuses to eat to AYCE places saying, " We don't need quantity. We need quality!" We always get the Combo B and Êwould cost us about Êa little over $100 ( with tip). Ê The Pros: Quality meats- It's not AYCE but the amount for 4 people is more than enough for us. Best side dishes. The servers are fairly quick, cook for you ( most of the time) and speak English! Clean restaurant The Cons Tiny parking lot-- Only valet service ($2) Always packed so expect a long wait time Only a bench and few seats in the super small waiting area so people are standing by the door/ waiting outside

The only one condition when "freaking expensive" is not a problem -- the food must be yummy, that's it. Let alone service, because when I go out to eat, it is absolutely not to enjoy fake people acting nicely because they're being watched... if you know what I mean. This place is on the pricier side, and the food is not better quality... not at all. And no, I do not have extreme expectations... just personal experience. How could I not know that this place was NOT AYCE??!! Looks like someone only relied on the 4.5 rating rather than doing adequate research. Sorry, I was just craving for KBBQ last night, and when I do, I prefer AYCE. But I'm not writing this review merely because it is not ayce; this is not the point at all... it is something else. I came here with the man yesterday in the afternoon. It was my idea to come here; I bookmarked it last year. There was no wait line, so we were seated rapidly, in front of the mid size screen television with football on air! It didn't get crowded until an hour later, which was around 4pm. We ordered the pork belly, chicken, and beef brisket combo, hereinafter as PCB, a seafood soup, and two soft drinks. Our food came out pretty fast and the waitress (in a nice uniform) cooked the meat for us; I liked the service in case you're wondering. The PCB was 39.99, seafood soup was around 18 and the sodas were 2 bucks each; our total turned out to be 69, excluding tips... good bye 80 dollars :( I still feel bad that he spent all that money when we could have just spent $20 at Ma Dang Sae (an AYCE kbbq restaurant) also located on Vermont Ave. The bbq is much tastier there too. Here isn't any better. Actually, this review was based solely on our food, not the service. Two stars because I had great company! Not so reasonable huh?! Extra words... Saw a Rolls Royce in the lot... REV REV! We were lucky to spot parking space, but it does seem to get packed.

This place is expensive but oh so worth it! my lovely friend and i walked in around 4pm and found the place really quiet and VERY clean. you wouldn't even know it was a Korean bbq, there were no cooking remnants at all. we were greeted by a very friendly guy (Danny) at the counter who seated us at a nice booth and brought us our beer and black raspberry wine (very yummy!) we ordered the combination C, as it had more meat and more choices but only received combination d (minus the rib eye, my personal favorite) so he admitted his fault and gave us the extra meat for free! i was enjoying my drink so much that i had spilled it all down my shirt. our server came right over with a wet cloth and a tide stain corrector pen for me to blot out the wine. The sides were also delicious. the Kimchi here is the best of had in all of america and i ate 4 bowls full! i cannot recommend this place enough!. the service is excellent, food wonderful and atmosphere clean and inviting. i just wished they had music on in the background, that would have set the mood nicely. The dessert was strange, a glass full of sweet seaweed tasting extract. haha. luckily we were heading out afterwards for some pie around the corner will definitely be back next time i want to open my wallet and rejoice all things Korean :)

Pros: As everyone says, the meat is quality. For sure. Four people cost roughly $90 with tip. That's average price. It's more than enough to feed us and it's not necessary to be AYCE really. They cook/cut the meat for you. Lots of side dishes. Always ready to refill anything you need. Healthy? Not optimal, but meats are relatively OK. They do butter up some things or have marinade in the meats but overall, it could be worse. Cons: You must valet park even when the lot isn't filled. Some of the meat ordered isn't marinated. Could be a good thing or bad thing. In terms of taste, some of it might be perceived as bland, though the meat is is quality. Think of it as steak cooked without anything on it. But you could always dip it in their assortment of sauces and spices yourself, so I guess it's not really a major con. Conclusion: Chicken was amazing. Short Ribs are a must. ÊRibeye was a bit more bland and slightly chewy but still of high quality. Probably better than 85% of the Korean BBQ places in LA. I'd say this is probably second to Genwa.

This is very tasty kbbq. I love kbbq when the quality of the meat is top notch and Soowon has very good quality meats. The flavors in the sauces/beanpaste etc is delicious and adds solid value to the already high quality meat. Service is a little rushed and they for sure want to turn tables asap to generate dollars for the restaurant, but other than that, Êthe bbq is great. If you are in LA koreatown, go to Soowon and come here to add your 4 or 5 star review, like everybody else...

Came here on a reccomendation. ÊReally, really good food. ÊSome of the best Kbbq I've had in a while, really good meat. ÊThe banchan was varied, plentiful, and kept on coming, which always makes me happy. ÊFour of us hungry people split the big combo, and it was more than enough, very generous quantities. ÊThere was kind of a wait, but luckily we found a bar not too far off to pass the time. ÊConsidering we got drinks and how much food we actually got, I thought the bill was quite reasonable. ÊWe got lucky and found street parking not too far off. ÊWill definetly be coming back. Ê P.S It was my birthday and they played a drum for me, pretty classy.

First time in Koreatown and my first impression was... WTF is this place safe? You're lucky if you find parking on their lot otherwise you have to park on the streets. Inside was nice, nothing like I pictured based on its location. We ordered the $99 meat combination and honestly, its expensive for the amount of meat they give you. You're definitely better off at an all you can eat. They never really came around to check on us, and we had to call them everytime we need a refill on drinks.

Treated my brother to dinner here. There was a 40 minute wait when we went. Food was delicious. We ordered Combo C which was more than enough for three people, and my hubby can eat a lot! Loved all the sides. Bro ordered mackerel but had to take it to go because we were all stuffed! The waitstaff was fabulous! Very attentive. My only warning: Pay attention to the bill! I think we were overcharged for drinks, and by the end of the night, we were all too tired to inquire and were ready to go home. Yeah, we were THAT lazy... I'd definitely go again...

I love SooWon! We drive up from San Diego to LA periodically to eat here because: - the quality is really great - tender meats and fresh veggies - the staff is really friendly (better than the average quality of service you would get at any other korean restaurants). There are plenty of booths in the restaurant to ensure privacy so that other customers aren't bumping into you. Also, this is where you can bring a date to impress with great ambiance. The only slight complaint is the valet parking ($2) but since SooWon has no corkage fee, that's still fine. :)

LA continues to deliver! ÊSoowon Galbi offers the best KBBQ. ÊPeriod. No; its not the quality of the meat. ÊYou can find the same excellent quality, marbled beef and fatty pork elsewhere. No, its not the seasoning. ÊMarinades are absolutely delicious and the dipping sauces are outstanding but very similar to other places. No, its not the quantity or the price. ÊThere are a ton of AYCE places. No, its not the banchan. ÊEveryone has their own, in house made specials. ÊSome better than others. This KBBQ is top because it delivers the complete dining experience. ÊOutstanding, welcoming, highly attentive service (they will cook your food for you if you ask); contemporary ambiance, and quality food. ÊThere is zero intimidation for the KBBQ noob. Ê(No yelling if you ask them to repeat something, no ignoring you if you don't speak Korean, no plates being dropped on the table if you ask for more banchan). The menu offers a large assortment of Korean dishes from soups through stews but its so hard to pass on the bbq. ÊThe combos offer the best value and selection for a group. ÊIndividual items can be ordered. ÊPortions are large. Dining alone is NOT a good idea. Always trust your yeeps. (800+ reviews and 4.5 star average rating). Highly recommended.

I came to KTown for lunch yesterday specifically to go to my all-time fave restaurant (I'll call it "BC") - only to find out it wasn't open for another two hours. I nearly cried and decided my Fat Tuesday was ruined. RUINED! My friend and I decided we'd stay in KTown for lunch anyway since we don't come out here often. We Yelp'd nearby restaurants and ended up here at Soowon Galbi. The reviews looked solid, but I was still feeling mopey about my BC fail (seriously, I'm obsessed with that place). I came here thinking there was just no way I would be satisfied - here or anywhere else at the time. I wanted my BC! To my surprise, I forgot all about BC and enjoyed a super delicious meal at Soowon Galbi. Of course there's no comparison between the two restaurants - they're completely different. Anyway, we ordered their signature beef galbi and chicken bulgogi. WOW! The meats were so tender and had so much flavor. We almost didn't need any of the sauces, but even they (the bean paste and spicy red sauce) were so great, we polished em anyway. I really enjoyed the sides too: three different types of seaweed salad, two different kinds of kim chi, spicy squid, honey potatoes, anchovy almonds and cashews, pickled radishes, bean sprouts. The kim chi wasn't as spicy or flavorful as I'd like, but it was fine. Everything else was great - our favorite was the spicy squid. Jacob was our server, and he was excellent! Super attentive and friendly, and he really knew what he was doing. We washed our food down with Hite beer, and were beyond satisfied with our meal. It wasn't exactly the Fat Tuesday cajun meal we were looking for, but it was an all-around fantastic lunch and we certainly felt FAT afterwards - the portions are Êreally generous! I'm definitely a fan of this place and am excited that I now have *two* reasons to come to KTown.

A idea of a late night dinner after an adventurous afternoon brought us to the this highly rated place. With over 800 reviews, this place should be a perfect match to your Korean appetite. Let's dive right into the area. PARKING: Driving into the lot there is valet parking for $2, instead of driving around looking for parking it's cheaper to pay the valet beside circling around the busy neighborhood. (Tip: If your parents never told you, don't leave anything valuable in the car) WAIT TIME: This place is well known amongst the locals, so expect a 35-45 minute wait. FOOD and SERVICE: It's a bonus when you order a meat combination plate and they give you a larger bottle of beer as part of your meal. Our party of 2, we had the combination B from their menu. Beside all the juicy parts of the food and the nice cold beer to wash it all down, the waiter was very helpful in cooking our meal, while we chatted away about the perfect day we had. We helped ourselves to the small dishes of appetizers that usually comes with the meal, while re-ordering our favorites of the bunch throughout our dining experience. Unfortunately, not everyone that comes to this place will experience the same rating as we did. But if you take the time to talk to your waiter, I'm sure you can change a bad situation into a positive one. All it takes is a smile and courtesy amongst your fellow "brother and sister of the world" Cons: You will come out smelling like BBQ.

ive been in korea for a year and just recently came back. despite the fact that i was in korea, i found myself craving soowon galbi! maybe it was because ive been surrounded by alot of pork bbq places, or perhaps it was becuase beef in korea was so expensive that i couldnt be satisfied...but i was cravingggg gogi haha. Naturally, the first bbq place i went to upon my return was of course, soowon. ÊAnd it was just as i had remembered- DEEEELICIOUS! i nagged at my friends to come here and they pleasantly obliged. Yay for great friends hehe. their kkotsal was unbelievably juicy and perfectly marbeled, it reminded me of korean beef (hanwoo) that i had while in korea. their marinated galbi was of course spectacular- as it should be since it is their specialty. the chadol was yummy and had just the right meat to fat ratio. Another plus to this restaurant would be the great service. While im busy stuffing as much meat into my belly, i dont have to worry about the grill burning or flipping the meat because the servers come by often enough to cook your meat to perfection and bring you any banchans or salad that need to be refilled. Finally, their nengmyun. i love love love nengmyun and soowon does it right. Wonderfully thin and chewy noodles swimming in an icy tangy broth. so refreshing after all that meat! what i like to do is save some of the marinated galbi and roll it up in the noodles and eat it. That way you get sweet, warm, meaty goodness surrounded by chewy noodles. such a great texture/flavor combo lol but thats just my opinion. Anyways, im so happy that everything was so yummy even after i had been gone for a year. It shows quality and consistency which i am a def. fan of!

I've been drooling over this place for this longest. Ê This was not AYCE and you can definitely tell! ÊThe quality of the meat was exceptional. ÊThe short rib and rib eye was juicy and it was so marbled. ÊThe meat was definitely melt in your mouth. ÊThe brisket and beef tongue was also very delicious. ÊYum!

Just went back to this place last weekend. I've been to a ton more Korean restaurants (a lot of them while I was in Korea) since my review of this place in 09 and I'm downgrading it to a 2 star because... Korean food is supposed to be tangy, salty and spicy and their side dishes (banchan) are anything but that. ÊThe potatoes and salad especially are really bland. They really need to push the flavors more. Ê Their marinated beef has way too much sugar, like candy beef, which might sound good but you shouldn't have to do that to beef to make it appealing. The thinly sliced beef brisket (Chadol baki) was the highlight of the meal, but their sauces again didn't have the same "korean" vibe too them, just some simple sauces that didn't explode in my mouth like they should. I haven't been to many other Korean restaurants in LA, but there's got to be better, more authentic places that adhere to the korean flavors better.

Soowon makes me so happy! It was a great dinner, and I was satisfied. The waiter was excellent, cooking the meat for us. However, I will complain about some of the meat being a tad tough. I also didn't like how small the portions were (being used to all the AYCE and what not), but I was satisfied. Soowon made for an enjoyable evening and a perfect date :) This is not all you can eat, and that was perfectly fine with me. My boyfriend enjoyed this place, so that was a win :) The banchan is great. The atmosphere is clean, trendy, and fun. It's a fun date spot or group gathering place. You have to part in their lot (doing valet), but it wasn't a problem!

This place easily is the best Korean BBQ I've ever been to! All the meat's fresh and perfectly seasoned. On top of that, the servers're really attentive, which you don't see in most Korean BBQ places. Hyuk Mit Gui - Thinly Sliced Beef Tongue. It actually doesn't really taste like tongue, very delicious. Ê **4 stars Sam Gyub Sal - Thick Slices of Pork Belly. Perfect balance between fat and meat in each pork belly. Make sure you eat it with some grilled kimchi, it's awesome! Ê**4 1/2 stars Joomuluk - Sliced Beef Rib Eye Seasoned & Lightly Marinated in Sesame Oil. Very delicious, the seasoning's perfect. Ê**4 stars Soo Won Wang Galbi - House Speciality; Large Beef Short Ribs in their signature marinade. The best meat they serve over there; it'll blow you away. Everyone should definitely try this! Ê**5 stars Overall: Great food, good service & they put on football on their TVs (not those Korean channels lol). It can be quite pricey and the portion's not all that big, but it's worth it - Korean BBQ heaven.

Delicious. Absolutely delicious. Went here with my boyfriend for our first anniversary. It was also my first time trying kbbq so I wasn't exactly sure what to expect. All I knew was that many of my friends seemed to sing its praises and that Yelp seemed to love Soowon Galbi. Now I know why. Though the place was definitely busy our servers were very attentive and friendly. I was surprised that we were even seated right away! No wait at all for a Saturday night? Everything's better than I expected already. We got the combo C ($39.99, the menu says it serves 2) and I was worried that it wouldn't be enough. Boy was I wrong. Though it's not AYCE, they definitely give you a good amount of scrumptious scrumptious meat. I was actually already full by the time we got to the chicken bulgogi, but I kept eating for the sheer fact that it was just too good to let sit there. Even the portion that got slightly burnt still tasted as savory as those perfectly cooked pieces. The sides were all good as well. I was surprised we got so many! (Though then again, this might just be traditional with all kbbq places.) You can definitely tell that the meat they use is high quality and a-ma-zing. Being the first kbbq place I've been to, this has definitely set the standard for me. If I ever do decide to go get kbbq elsewhere hopefully they'll be just as good. The only negative thing is parking. $2 for valet, which isn't an issue with me. The only problem is by the time we got out of the restaurant the place was packed, and so were the cars in that TINY little parking lot. It was like watching the valet attendants playing some sort of game trying to figure where to move which car where so that they can get a different car out. We had to wait what felt like 15 minutes in the freezing cold to get our car. Such a pain! But still, I can't help but give 5 stars overall. (: Absolutely wonderful experience.

Went here for the first time tonight, and my friends and I decided that this will be our new non-AYCE Korean BBQ. Delicious. (and we go to a lot of Korean places) We ordered galbi, pork bulgogi, and veggies. Awesome. Great, friendly service too. One caveat: if you ask them to make a kimchi pancake (which isn't on the menu), they charge $16, which is absurd. It's not the best pancake either; so it's best to skip it. ÊNot holding it against the restaurant, but more of a tip for diners.

I think this place is one of the best ko bbq places in LA! It's really clean and the quality of meat is also really good. It's not the fanciest, but it's still nice enough to come for a date or another occasion and also the presentation is clean as well. Downside: small parking lot and valet only. There may be nearby streetparking but the valet is $2 so it's not too bad.

This place gives Woo Lae Oak a run for its money! -------------------- We initially decided on a shabu shabu dinner, but decided to high tail it outta there when we found it completely empty. Based on exceptionally high Yelp reviews, we ended up here - and this place didn't disappoint! We got the combo D (which came with pork belly, chicken, and beef brisket), as well as an order of the seasoned Kalbi. As an added bonus, it comes with a bottle of soju. Yes, the grilled meats were flavorful and tender, & the soju was smooth. But you know what the best part was? The panchan. It was an amazing mix of honey-infused baked potato, savory anchovy, black seaweed, and citrusy spiced kimchi. In fact, we enjoyed this more than The grilled meats. We got multiple refills (and by we, I mean me). Will definitely be back.

All of my friends recommended Korean BBQ when in LA, and my best friend MZ suggested Soowon Galbi. You can't go wrong when you listen to people that know you well. This restaurant is the bomb dot com! DH and I just expected fire and smoke but we got so much more at our table top. We shared the soo won wang galbi (beef short ribs) and the sam gyub sal (pork belly). The galbi was flavorful, juicy, tender--like a kid at Christmas, I couldn't get enough. I wasn't crazy about the pork belly, but it was enjoyable smothered in various sauces. My favorite part of the meal was the banchan (side dishes). There must have been 10 of them. I can't name most, but they were excellent at best and good at worst. The kim chee was so fresh and the spinach was addictive. DH and I grew up in Hawaii, which has superb Korean BBQ. It's difficult to say whether Soowon is better than the stuff in Hawaii because no matter how delicious it is, Hawaii will always have MEAT JUN. I'm not certain if meat jun is even Korean, but I can't imagine Korean BBQ without it anymore.

I did not see the bill since I was treated by a buddy of mine... so I cannot attest to the final tally. ÊThe prices seemed a bit high, but considering all the amazing sides and salads we got, we left stuffed... And the quality seemed quite good. ÊThe short ribs were phenomenal... perfectly seasoned and with the right dips and sauces... delicious!!! ÊLoved the black seaweed and the rain forest sprouts and those almonds... Wow! ÊWhere do I get those to snack on????? ÊThe salad dressing was also really good and we had two bowls of that salad. ÊNo soup though... Hmmm... did we miss that? ÊThe rib eye was good, but perhaps got a bit overcooked... and since that came second it did not hold up to the flavor of the short ribs... My only issue was that since the tables are a bit tight, you get a face full of heat... So despite the sweating sauna course, it was still fun and I will definitely be back.

I've been to MANY Korean BBQ places in LA. This place is GOOD. GOOD quality. GOOD side dishes. (banchan) the cilantro salad was delicious- had to try making it at ho me. i am a huge fan of cilantro. BAD location. in a small plaza with valet parking. Usually a long wait and a fairly small restaurant, but going on a weekend for dinner I only had to wait 20 mins. Staff is friendly and fast. Some could argue it is slightly pricy, but for quality, you pay for what you get. Definitely coming back

I came here because I saw the yelp stars on my map. Ê #1, the waitresses are not that friendly. ÊThey always have some kind of stink eye. ÊI don't like it when they look down on people and get annoyed when people ask for something. ÊThat's super annoying and cheap. ÊNo real professionalism, but it's much like any other busy Korean restaurant. ÊBut yay for bells on the side walls. ÊRing away. #2 the suwon galbi is super tender and juicy. Ê2 servings are enough to feed 3 and possibly 4 people. ÊBut that's if you don't eat too much. ÊI think all their dishes have meat as their main star. ÊAll the meat in their soups are tender and flavorful too. Ê I got to try their octopus/meat soup, and it was "refeshing" in a warm way and tasted very clean. Ê # 3 their banchans (side dishes) are okay, nothing special. Ê #4 valet parking $2 fee

My new favorite KBBQ place! I was out with a friend who had never tried it before. We were in the area, so I pulled it up on Yelp and discovered this place that had a four and a half star overall rating out of 800 something reviews. Color me intrigued... Needless to say we were not disappointed. The parking was a bit sketchy, but the valet is only two bucks, so what the heck. The place was busy, but since there was only two of us they sat us right away on one end of a large table with two grills, and later sat another couple of girls on the other end, which was fine. At first we were a little surprised at the prices, which seemed a little high considering my own limited experience with the low budge KBBQ places I've been to before. But we settled on the combo D which included beef, chicken bugogi, and pork belly along with all the fixins (which were plentiful and delicious), soup and a big 'ol bottle of Hite (yep, the beer came with the package). All this for a mere $40 for two people. Not too shabby. The food was really good, and the side dishes, oh the side dishes! Everything was wonderful. I usually tend to avoid one or two dishes at KBBQ, but I really liked everything they served up here. The meat was tender and flavorful (especially the bugogi) and the wait staff was very attentive and not at all shy about stepping in and manning the grill for us. Definitely will come back next time I'm in K town.

This is NOT AYCE BBQ. Came with a large group of people. Each table had about 7-9 people. For a table of 9 we ordered a Combo Set A and Set B. Combo A - Unseasoned large beef short rib + ribeye steak + Sliced ribeye + pork neck + seasoned beef ribeye + beef brisket - serves 4-5 people Combo B - Basically the same as Combo A but it's marinated instead of unseasoned large beef short rib and no ribeye steak - serves 4 people In regards to both sets (since they're basically the same except the semi-huge price difference), they were good. The meat was very tender. I like that the grills use charcoal to allow a more smokey and authentic BBQ taste. Of course polluting my lungs at that expense. The only one I didn't like is the pork neck. It's had a fishy taste and but a cartilage-like texture. Would not order that again. Banchan was pretty good. They had fish cake, turnips, kimchi, and other stuff. Probably about 8 side dishes? Environment: loud. Not sure if it's because we were in a large group. The place is fairy small so I can see why there are usually lines. To the point where the valet is full and you have to test your luck in the parking world. Valet is $2 which is probably cheaper than driving around the block 5x trying to find a spot. NO frustration is worth a lot. Service: don't matter if you Korean or not. They treat you good. When they bring your meat to the table, they'll place it on the grill for you. Refill your water. The only thing was they didn't refill the banchan automatically, but I'm sure if you asked them they will. Overall, good Korean BBQ place. It is definitely pricey but you get what you pay for. However, I definitely was still hungry after what we ordered. If you are a big eater, may have to order a bit more or just get dessert after the meal. The latter option shouldn't be hard since there are many places nearby willing to give you more calories. Soowon Galbi is a place of quality NOT quantity.

D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S Ok, so this place is not where you go for all-you-can-eat kbbq, BUT what they lack in extreme quantity, they make up ten fold in quality. The bbq is awesome. Period. Bypass the chicken and go for the marinated short ribs. The vegetarian/mushrooms are pretty good, but beef is king in this place. The atmosphere is one step up from casual - perfect for a date or for a bbq first-timer.

My Extreme Foodie Friend from L.A. was excited to have lunch here. He was proclaiming it to be a place that doesn't mess around with Korean BBQ... So hurry the Hell up cause I'm freakin' hungry! 3 hungry guys order: *Another one of those table side cooking stations, order your raw meat and it gets cooked by your server.. Combo special C: Pork Belly, Seasoned Beef Rib Eye, Chicken Bulgogi + Beef Brisket. Pork Belly: could you go wrong with pork belly? A few thick strips with almost an equal amount of fat and meat. Got it cooked a little crispy and it was a done deal! Seasoned Beef Ribeye: Didn't taste the seasoning much but a mild saltiness. It was pretty tender though. Good but expected a little more somethin'.. Chicken Bulgogi: Lots of sweet/salty barbecueness, Very tasty! Beef Brisket: Super thin slices of beef. Always one of my favs at kbbq spots and this one didn't disappoint. Easy to chew and cooked fast! (Not part of the combo) Sliced Beef Rib Eye: Marbling Galore, Very evident of High Quality Meat. It tasted as good as it looked, just purely the meat doing the talking! Bibimbab: this was prepared/mixed tableside. Every single thing in that pan just paired graciously together! MMMmmMMM.. Sweet Rice Tea: complimentary, not too sweet and a nice little liquid dessert to end a great meal * The dipping sauces gave everything a whole new perspective of flavors.. Experiment yourself to find out what fits your palate best. The menu explains in detail the dipping sauces and condiments (pretty informative). * All the Numerous sides were Great or Better! Gives this place the edge over most other similiar korean bbq spots serving sides of their own. Great Service, Pricing not cheap but its quality more than quantity and Atmoshpere was quite classy. Interactive dining is always fun and a great way to mingle and conversate with friends, family or hot date! If your into Korean BBQ and haven't tried this place yet, you may find yourself here more often than you think!....

When I came back from living in Korea for a year, I wanted to share with my dad a little bit of my experience. We came to Soowon Galbi for the first time in late 2010 and came every week for several months. Once I got a job and started school again, we sadly made it only once a month. I tried getting him to try other KBBQ places, but we didn't like any as much as we liked Soowon. My dad is adverse to trying new things so getting him to try Korean food was a little bit of a miracle. He loved particular dishes and it was hard to get him to try much else so, our usual order was as follows: - a double order of various meat for KBBQ, usually choosing from samgyupsal, kalbi, chicken bulgogi, chadol gui or kkot sal. - galbitang (short rib soup) - dolsot (stone pot) bibimbap I desperately wanted to try the yuk hweh, but he wasn't about to try some raw beef. Darn! I have always been beyond satisfied with the service and the food. I have yet to go to a place (here in the U.S.) that tops Soowon's galbitang. The BBQ meat is great, but it usually is at other high-rated places, along with their bibimbap. I tried their kimchi jiggae once, but the portion was too large for me - I'm used to it as an appetizer like they serve it in Korea. The banchan (side dishes) are plentiful - we surprisingly gobble them up though we usually order enough for four for just the two of us. I really miss Soowon Galbi and all the servers whom we've come to befriend. I can't wait to return to LA in a few months - my first stop will be Soowon Galbi with my pops, just like we used to! P.S. Come during high traffic times and expect to wait 30-45 minutes and when you are seated, service time can be slow. We never minded this as we tended to dine slow anyway and enjoy our conversation and meal. If you are in a hurry, don't come here unless during lunch time. On a Sunday.

If you want immediate gratification, go to Soowon. Seriously, it's delicious. From the side dishes to the samgyeopsal (pork belly), you'll never be unsatisfied. Salads are amazing as well. I never leave without a stomach pregnant with yummy goodies inside. It is no surprise to me that the restaurant is always bustling, but no matter how busy the place may be, the service remains swift and the waiters attentive. Not only is the restaurant's decor and ambience crisp and stimulating, but the meat platters come presentable. Perfect for rousing my appetite.

**THE BEST KBBQ ON THE F'ING PLANET** Holy Mother of Carnivores. Was it that good? Yes, it was THAT good. I had to change my underwear TWICE. They didn't take reservations, so my brother arrived there beforehand to put us on the list. Total time of waiting on a Saturday night: 30 minutes. Very friendly staff. ORDERED: *COMBO B - Enough for 4 peeps. Beef brisket (chadol gui), marinated beef short rib (galbi), sliced rib eye (kkot sal), seasoned beef rib eye (joomuluk), and pork neck (hang jung sal). The meats were AMAZING! Melted in my mouth. Mmmm. Premium, fresh, and unfrozen quality. Love! Inhaled everything with some daenjang and grilled kimchi, with the sesame oil and salt. Combo also included rice, salad, stew, and choice of beer, soju, or soda. Good deal for around $30 PP. The bachan was off the hook. Fresh, gourmet, and plentiful. HANDS DOWN my favorite KBBQ joint in LA. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.

The boss suggested we come here for lunch since my coworker wanted to try a good Korean BBQ restaurant. ÊI was thinking of Soot Bull Jeep but this place is much better because you don't smell (just a little bit) like you do when you go to SBJ. ÊAlso, the meats seem to be higher quality too. ÊSomeone coned off some of the parking spaces in the parking lot so we had to park in a metered spot on the street. ÊNot so bad except it's only an hour max so I had to dash out in the middle of our lunch to put in more money. We decided on Combo B for 4 people. ÊIt's very advantageous to have to boss eat with us when we're dining at a Korean restaurant cuz they treat us so much better since he speaks Korean. ÊThe three of us ate this huge tray of meat. ÊI don't remember it all but of course the marinated bone-in Kalbi was the best, along with two other types of beef. ÊThe banchans were delicious and they were great at refilling our favorite ones. ÊI also liked the tofu stew, nice and spicy. ÊWe split a Hite beer and had sodas the rest of the time. Ê When it came time for paying, the boss told us he'll expense it since it's Christmas time anyway so it'll be on the company. ÊYay, yummy free meal! ÊWay to end the year on a happy belly.

I thought my sweetie was cheating on me. ÊShe's not Korean, but all of a sudden, she started watching tons of sappy Korean dramas, eating Korean mocha cakes, and going several times a week to K-town "just by herself". ÊOne time she came back smelling like grilled galbi, and even I know NO ONE eats Korean BBQ just by themselves. As it turns out, my sweetie was not hiding a secret K-lover, but was suffering from a contagious condition they call Korea-philia. ÊAlthough it usually afflicts female Asians, I believe that I've also now been infected because I'm drooling on my keyboard as I review Restaurant Soowon, plus I've Googled "SNSD" three times today already. If you're an Angeleno, chances are you've been to quite a few Korean BBQ's. ÊMany other K-BBQ restaurants are more palatial and modern, but few can outdo Soowon when it comes to taste. ÊSimple reasons: Êthe meat is high grade; the secret marinade is heavenly. ÊIf your table has the standard slitted grill plate (easier to clean), nicely ask them to swap it out for the wire mesh grill. ÊThis allows the meats to be kissed by the flames and fully absorb the smoky flavor from the glowing hardwood charcoal below. Like their food, Soowon's service is outstanding. ÊAs long as the men in your group are not fighting each other over control of the tongs, your server will gladly come to your table and cook your entire meal. ÊThis allows you to concentrate on consuming a feast that is nothing less than delicious-nida.

When I get disappointed at such a highly recommended place, I usually like to think it was an off night. Unfortunately, I don't think I'll be coming hereagain unless someone gives me a really good reason to go again and personally tells me "Hey, you really ought to give this place a shot again. It's my favorite and I personally vouch for the quality. It's so good I dream about it Êand I know what I'm talking about". Let's get some context here. I wasn't feeling AYCE that night and wanted something tasty. Part of the problem this evening may have been my lack of appetite. However, I still wanted to try multiple things. My visiting BF only wanted Samkyapsal though. It started to go downhill when the table across from us got their panchan and order before we did even though we ordered before them. Then when the head waiter dropped off the panchans, he just left it on the stand and no one came to actually put it on our table. Our dining group and the other table both ordered in English and Korean. I was really irritated by this~it's a simple rule- you order first, your food comes first. It left a bad taste in my mouth for the meal. A place that prides itself on something more high end should perform that way. That night, the fans must've been broken because smoke was filling the restaurant. We ordered the Combo C Êthink~ it came with chumuluk, sam kyap sal, chicken, cha dol baegi. That was my first mistake- order the Kalbi. But even the sampling of the meat, which for $60.00 is really small, I didn't find a quality THAT exceptional. The chumuluk didn't exactly melt in my mouth and the Samkyapsal was like any other frozen slab of fatty pork at an AYCE. The chicken, I'll admit, was tasty...since I never order chicken, I suppose it was alright. Their salad mixture is more like a cole slaw and I didn't find their panchans amazing, but their mushroom dish they served was different and rather tasty. At some point, I think the head waiter noticed how the other table was getting served first and he sensed our frustration. We got chiggae with our meal as service Ê(which I was surprised about since it wasn't including and we were already getting shafted). Anyway, it sucked to be disappointed. Is it worth just going for the kalbi? Or are there other places just as good in ktown? I think i'll explore a bit before I thinnk about coming back.

The best korean bbq I've ever had. We ordered the $99 meat combo that came with a free bottle of soju, beer or soda, and a seafood pancake. The side dishes are unlimited (kimchi, glazed cashews and anchovies, seaweed, etc.). The waiter we had was very attentive and quick. The combination of side dishes and beef was delectable. The waiter heated the charcoal stove in the table and placed the meat onto the stovetop. The pancake was very good, it had an excellent combination of crispiness and chewiness in the seafood. Parking is valet for $1. Place is nice and clean. Food is excellent. Definitely will come back when in LA..

I've been to a majority of the Korean BBQ places in LA and this one is truly one of the best! The food quality is great and the staff is friendly and prompt. I've been meaning to check out this KBBQ joint for a while. We ordered the combo meal for 4 and it was plenty. It comes with generous portions of all the main meats along with soup and drinks (soju or beer). What I liked best about their grilled meats is that you get a really nice flavor from the wood/charcoal chips under the grill. There are other places that have this but you can never really taste it. But here, the flavor was so prominent it added another level to the meats. I noticed the taste from the very first bite. The side dishes were also delicious and unique! They have the usuals but also some specialties like this spicy marinated cilantro dish that I enjoyed, and I don't normally eat cilantro. I've never seen this dish anywhere else before. Great job on the food! Other positives: clean grills and facilities, nice presentation of food, great ventilation (I hate eating in a cloud of smoke), no crazy club environment like moo dae po, play sportscenter on their tv's, nice modern decor (doesn't look like a shed from old Korea or the backyard of a house converted into a restaurant). Highly recommended. Will be back for more!

Service: My server was danny. There were only two tables occupied,yet he stood about 3ft away from us the entire time and was very attentive to our needs. Outstanding service. Bibimbap This is where I had my first bibimbap experience. The dish is beautifully presented. It was presented in a stone pot with shitaake, carrots, spinach and an egg on top.The quality of their ingredients was top notch. The bowl was hot enough to get the rice nice and crispy. I find that this is one of the most important factors when it comes to bibimbap. Banchan Since experiencing bibimbap at Soowon, I have since had it at many places.Soowon's banchan surpasses them all by far. Once again, the ingredients were fresh and high quality. I'm vegetarian, so my options were limited. The only thing I would suggest is that they throw a Korean pancake into the mix. I now go to Genwa most of the time. This is one of the reasons. Ê;)

I am surprised that they were able to accommodate our party of 14 on a Saturday night at 7:30 pm. ÊA member of our party called an hour ahead, and we were seated at around 7:45. The interior is upscale, and the service is attentive by the waitstaff. ÊThe food was okay. Our half of the table ordered the set meal for $99. ÊThe portions were small, for the price. ÊEven after ordering more, many of us not even hungry in the beginning of the meal, were not full after the meal. Overall, the service was good, but the it wasn't a good value. ÊEach person paid $27 after tax and tip, and for that price, I am expecting all-you-can-eat.

This place is actually my favorite place for Kalbitung. I know what you're thinking...ITS A KBBQ PLACE....still I guess they manage to make a mean soup as well. The bancha was plentiful and diverse. My only compliant is that you have to valet park if you want to use the lot or spend time finding street parkting. But it's K-town so what are you gonna do?

To be start with, I never ever write a review, but I can't help writing this one. I trusted yelp, the 900 and more reviewers, and no wonder it was good. Galbi was awesome too, but I must tell you, the server was super nice. We had this guy with glasses, I think his name was Kay. He knew what we needed already. napkins, forks, you name it! I'll be there next week again to experience the excellence in service.

My co-worker recommended this place to me and I saw the 4.5 stars on Yelp. ÊIt was between here & Chosun Galbee. ÊI saw how expensive Chosun Galbee was and didn't feel like paying an arm and a leg just for lunch so we went to Soowon and waited a couple minutes before they opened at 12. ÊWhen we pulled into the lot, I was thinking really? ÊForced $2 valet (street parking wasn't existent) in this janky ass lot with only 2 or 3 spots for the restaurant. Ê I was so craving galbi but, we decided to go with the combo for 2 people since I wanted to get more of an assortment for our money. ÊPrices still seem up there but at least there were combo deals. ÊThe combo came with pork belly, beef brisket, and chicken bugolgi with salad, tofu stew and choice of beer, soda, or soju for $40. ÊWe took awhile to decide, but the waiter took forever to come over to take our order. ÊWe pressed the buzzer a few times but no response (I guess it was broken) & I looked over at them, and it still took a few minutes for them to come over. Ê The salad was just some finely shredded cabbage which was not impressive at all. ÊThe banchan that we liked the most were the bean sprouts, the potatoes and the noodles with the light mayo-like dressing. ÊI've noticed that a lot of KBBQ places don't practice food safety....1 tong for 3 DIFFERENT types of meat (from different animals)?! ÊI think I saw one or two tables with two different tongs even if they only had 2 types of meat. ÊEww so gross..but luckily I had no food poisoning or anything of that sort. ÊI could understand if it was an AYCE deal with like 5+ types of meat, but it wasn't! ÊAnywhoo...the best tasting meat was shockingly the chicken! ÊThe marinade was quite yummy on it. ÊThere was no marinade or much flavor with the beef brisket or pork belly. ÊThe beef brisket was super fatty and I didn't care for the pork belly. ÊHow can you ruin pork belly?!! ÊI guess I may have high standards for it after eating it at Gary Danko & Prospect back home, which both make super drool worthy belly! ÊThe tofu stew had meat and other veggies in it but we're used to kimchi tofu broth, this was not and had a taste that we didn't care for (it was some soybean brown broth I believe). Ê The place is clean and besides the hiccup with service initially the guys here are quite friendly. ÊBut the food was not up to par for me. ÊI was upset to have a bad experience here because I was craving delicious KBBQ here in K-Town. ÊIf I go back to LA in the near future I would try to give another go at the hunt for delicious BBQ but would not return to Soowon as there are a plethora of Korean restaurants in LA.

I've gone a handful of times, but this is my first review of this place after coming here for my birthday. First off, the quality of meat here is superior to that of any korean bbq place I've ever been to. (and i've been to countless places). ÊThe meat is perfectly marbled and the banchan (side dishes) are exquisite. ÊAlso, service is good -- the servers are very friendly and always helpful, but very busy, so try to understand if they aren't at your immediate beck and call. ÊThe combos are great and come with soju and beer. ÊI always leave this place utterly satisfied. The facilities itself are standard -- it's clean, has good valet parking, and does not try to be extra hip by playing club music at annoyingly loud volumes. ÊEvery time I've been here has been a good experience. ÊGood food, good company, good times. ÊI can't think of how this place could be any better. Keep up the good work. ÊI'll definitely be back.

This is the place I had the best Wang Galbi. You know they mean business when their name their Wang Galbi after their restaurant. The restaurant is located in an unassuming strip mall in k-town. Don't let that fool you into thinking Soowon is a hole in the wall place. The service is beyond excellent and decor is modern and neat. You don't have to worry about parking at all. The valet will take good care of it. They use real wood charcoals here! If you had those before you would appreciate the flavors these goodies add to the meat. Gas or electric grills are no comparison. Their banchan here are one of the best I have had. Love the variety and quality. The kimchi is great and so is the white seaweed and anchovies. The Wang Galbi is of very high quality. The meat is perfectly fatty, tender with not even with the slightest hint of stringiness. The seasoning was sinfully tasty. The Hang Jung Sal (Pork Neck) was every bit just as amazing. Pork neck meat is almost as fatty as pork belly but with a dramatic crunchy texture. Give it a try if you feel for something different. Our server was knowledgeable and attentive. We didn't have to lift a finger and everything was prepared to perfection in front of us. He suggested having some sour kimchi to pair with the Hang Jung Sal and he was right on. Soowon is the best Korean BBQ restaurant I have been to. There is no place quite like it in the Bay Area unfortunately. How I wish I could have this every week. One could only dream. If you are ever in LA area, hit this place up! You won't regret it.

This was my first experience with Korean BBQ. I specifically planned it this way because I had a friend that tried Korean food and equated it to fermented garbage (don't worry I am not easily swayed). So I counted on my fellow yelpers to help a girl out...and help you did! The decor of this restaurant is very nice, even quaint I would say. So what makes this place...? The sides. The sides at this place are AMAZING. Each one of the sides (it seemed were very traditional) had its own unique flavor that provided a nice contrast with the meat. Their daikkon (sp?) soup was beyond delicious. I have now deemed this as one of my happy spots if I am nearing any sort of breakdown. Yes, it is that good. The servers were also very nice about allowing you to somewhat do your own thing with the meat. Our waitress was also very nice about bringing unique eats for us to try; which I thought was very thoughtful. If I am in the LA area again (which why wouldn't I be) I will be checking this place out again.

This was one of the first stops on our recent KBBQ quest for greatness. ÊWe actually went here for my grandma's birthday upon my suggestion and based on Yelp reviews. ÊHowever, I goofed and neglected to call ahead for our party of 7- big mistake at 8:00 PM on a Wednesday night apparently. ÊWe waited for about 40 minutes, drooling over all the gorgeous platters piled with meat. ÊAnd it turned out to be well worth the wait (good thing, or both the family and the bf would have had my head). The place is not AYCE unfortunately, but the platters and combos are good values and excellent quality. ÊThere is a large and yummy assortment of banchan, including these unusual yet fantastic little dried anchovies with almonds (my fave). ÊMy sister liked their funky sweet potato dish. ÊThe salad was good too. ÊMy family decided to get the Combo C- thin brisket, sliced pork belly, rib eye, and chicken (it also came with a bottle of soju for us young'ns, woo hoo!). ÊWe underestimated the portions and ordered, in addition to our Combo C, not one, but THREE Galbi Tang (short rib) soups. ÊWay too much food, but delightful! ÊThat soup was bone-suckingly good. ÊThe meats were oh-so-pretty and we were able to sit back and let our server do our cooking- ah. ÊSpeaking of which, service, despite the place being packed almost the entire time, was excellent. ÊIt is a well-oiled machine at Soowon. Ê So what started as a possible cluster turned into a delicious meal. ÊMy family was happy and I also know a certain someone who woke up the next day whimpering for more. ÊSoowon definitely ranks high on the KBBQ scale for me and I have (sadly) not seen that anchovy-almond dish anywhere else!

OUT OF THIS WORLD KBBQ (that's not AYCE)... haha! Their meats are totally delicious and just has a melt in your mouth affect. If this place was AYCE, I would totally live here. But since it's not, it's a treat every once in a while. My boyfriend took me here for my 22nd birthday and boy was I in love (with him and the place) lol. Their service was quick and the workers are really friendly. I love how their meat is always presentable and not just plopped on a plate. They're quick to respond too, sometimes I feel bad cause I seem to eat up all the food and ask for extras of the sides. The ambiance is comforting and altho it's an open area the booths give more privacy since they're high.

WOOHOO!!! MY 300TH REVIEW!!! My Yelp dilemma was mulled over for two weeks. I had several reviews that I contemplated posting for thee big 3-O-O milestone, but with my visit to Soowon Galbi KBBQ on Saturday, July 9th, the choice became very clear...Soowon would be the rightful owner of my landmark review! I was reminded that I needed to try Soowon three weeks ago when the yelp app on my iPhone notified me of Betty N's check in. Having read the glowing reviews of Jennifer L, Fia R, Amy C, et alia, it was imperative that I'd experience this amazing KBBQ restaurant! My brother Loren L, our friend Mark, and I arrived at 4pm. Parking is super small and each business has it's own set of parking stalls with parking blocks clearly marked. If you arrive at 5:30pm, Soowon offers valet parking for $2. 4pm appears to be ideal to dine here as only 3 parties of patrons (our party included) were dining at that time. Wait staff greeted us wholeheartedly upon entry. Their unrivaled graciousness and hospitality is something many restaurants should take note of. We settled upon Combo B, which included: Marinated Large Beef Short Rib, Sliced Rib Eye, Pork Neck, Seasoned Beef Rib Eye, and Beef Brisket. Combo B was designed to serve 4 people. All Combos include your choice of soju, beer, or soda. Combo B: 5/5 Breaking down this review by individual meat rating is unnecessary. Soowon's brisket slices and cuts of rib eye are chock full of marbling! Certainly their beef is thee best of all the KBBQ restaurants I've tasted. From starting with brisket to finishing with short rib, each cut was remarkably tender, possessing distinct and vivid flavor. We automatically assumed Combo B included pork belly, so it was a welcomed surprise being served pork neck slices instead (well, it shouldn't have been a surprise...that's what happens when you don't read the menu thoroughly!). These slices were perfectly trimmed to include the ideal amount of fat needed for flavor. Banchans: 4.5/5 Although Soowon serves amazing sides, there was one banchan we all did not care for. It was a dish of sticky almonds and peanuts. OMG, the tiny chunks of sardine permeated the entire dish. Perhaps I cannot appreciate the taste of almonds and sardines, who knows! Whatever the case, I'll pass on that one in the future! :P Service was impeccable. There were frequent visits by the attentive wait staff ensuring our party's satisfaction, monitoring our sides and placing meat on the grill. I'm glad I finally tried Soowon Galbi. This restaurant has dramatically sculpted my expectations for KBBQ restaurants and I can't wait to go back!

I just realized that I haven't written a review for this place until this late.. if anything I think it's cause I'm super greedy about this place and want it all to myself, haha!! omg, I LOVE this place! Best Korean bbq ever! It's funny, I've taken so so so many people here and it's no surprise that everyone I bring here thinks it's amazing, too. #1 thing is the quality of their meat is excellent; it's better than any other Korean bbq place I've been to. I LOVE THEIR YUMMY SIDE DISHES.. so many of them, so little stomach space :) !!!! #2 I cannot compliment their servers/service enough. All of the servers here are super nice and accommodating. I've been to other places where the service is "good" but just not as friendly like it is here. And although the parking lot is tiny, the valet is a huge relief in dealing with that. I'm told there are similarly good places but I'm uninterested in missing out on one single great experience at Soowon by checking them out. I always have a great time here with my friends and leave super happy. I'll definitely be bringing more friends here to introduce them to this place! Oh one personal side story ... I once brought my parents here for dinner for my Mom's birthday and I decided to bring along with me a banana cream pie that I made for her. I wasn't thinking that we'd do anything like sing to her since it was a pie as opposed to a cake, but when they brought the pie out to us after our dinner, they brought it with a lit candle (one that they provided) and it just made the whole experience so much better. It was such a thoughtful and detailed gesture and was totally unexpected. BTW, my brother and husband both posted reviews on Soowon and both reviews are completely aligned with mine .. Ê5 stars!!!

Holy crap! ÊLooked good from the reviews but I was not prepared for the excellent quality of food and the awesome service. Prices were high, but it was the little lady's birthday and she deserves it. My mouth is still watering. They kept making sure the food did not burn, we had a ton of side dishes, and we're set for drinks. They even brought my wife a piece of cake and all the servers sang happy birthday. Made it easy to make her day. We will be back.

My friend and I got Combo D (includes pork belly, chicken bulgogi and beef brisket) which also includes unlimited salad, some type of radish soup, rice, soy wraps for the meat, unlimited banchan appetizers and a drink (I chose a beer as this seemed like a better value). Ê Loved: clean restaurant, food was tasty (pork belly was thick with minimal fat unlike other places) , service was excellent (waiter filled cups of water without asking, helped to turn the meat over and asked if we wanted refills on the banchan! Also, the menu explains everything you wanted to know about the dishes with definitions of each type of Banchan. Loved it! Not so loved: valet in a small parking lot...got here after work about 5:30 pm so it was still pretty empty. By the time we left, it was packed and there was a wait.

Okay. I am a very picky eater, mainly because I cook most Korean foods and so the korean restaurants I go to have to serve food that's equal to or better than what I make at home! I have to say I was really amazed at the quality of the food at Suwon Galbi, especially with their banchan dishes and BBQ meats! The place is very clean and nice with very affordable valet parking, not to mention great, friendly staff. It's not the cheapest place and my advise is to not always go for the cheapest when it comes to FOOD! Of course, it depends on your budget too... but all I can say is you will get your moneys worth if you eat here. My favorite appetizer is the Korean beef tartar... Yuk Whoe. Simply Delicious!!! Just have to try out for yourselves! You won't regret it. :-)

Free-flowing salad. ÊI loved it. ÊWe ordered the Soowon signature Kalbi and the spicy pork. ÊThere were several complimentary side dishes, which were also complementary to the high protein meal. ÊMy favorite was the sea kelp. ÊI really enjoyed the crunchy texture. The server was very accommodating. ÊHe explained to us what the side dishes were instead of just plopping them on the table. ÊMy date appreciated that since he was completely unfamiliar with Korean food. The meat was very tender. ÊThe dipping sauce accentuated the flavor, but wasn't really necessary. ÊOverall, I had a good experience.

Ooooh, yummy! ÊI haven't eaten Korean BBQ in a very long time. ÊOne of the reasons is because my fiancee and I have become flexitarians (vegetarians that dabble in fish and shrimp). Ê So while we didn't try the Galbi beef that Korean BBQ is famous for, we did have shrimp and veges on the grill, and grilled mackerel, which was all delicious. The service was great - they continually bring out these small Korean appetizers throughout the meal (and replenish upon request). ÊWe had a friend with us and it was her first time trying Korean BBQ and she liked it a lot. Ê All in all, Korean BBQ, whether you eat meat or not, is a fun experience and a great place to go out with your friends - you get to grill your own food on a small grill in the middle of the table, so you're eating little by little, not all at once, which is actually better for digestion too. ÊYou really just can't go wrong with Korean BBQ!

Okay. ÊFirst off, please note that I was starving when I came to this place; therefore, my review might be a bit skewed. The side dishes were addictive. ÊI couldn't stop munching on them before the food came out. ÊThe seafood pancake was delicious. ÊNothing to complain about. ÊThe kalbi was juicy and locked in a lot of flavor. ÊApparently, they marinade their kalbi for 48 hours before allowing it on the table. Pretty intense if you ask me. We got a nice old Korean lady as our server and she was super sweet.

Okay... so the main reason I always come to visit LA is for the Korean BBQ. ÊNo offense to my friends in LA, but you guys are just the icing on top of the cake, or rather... banchan to my galbi. ÊNormally, I stay within my regular restaurants because I'm familiar with their banchan, prices, and typically I enjoy AYCE. ÊBut this past trip I decided that maybe I should look up what Yelpers recommend instead of just going based on word of mouth alone. Ê HOLY MOLY! ÊI really love Yelpers, I do. ÊThis place was amazing, and actually fairly reasonably priced when you consider the environment, the service, and the variety and quality of the foods. ÊPLENTY of banchan, rice paper, salad, soup, rice, and that's without even ordering the entree. Ê I was very tempted to grab any of the combos, but none of them included dwaegi bulgogi, so my table opted to order entrees, so we got: - signature galbi: perfectly marinated, tender meat, would order again. and again. and again. - dwaegi bulgogi: not as good as the galbi, but loved the flavor, very spicy, and I'm luckily I'm a Êfan of spicy, but beware those of you who aren't. Anyways, the service here was fabulous. ÊOur server could tell we weren't very seasoned at cooking kbbq (I happen to have wonderful friends who normally do that whenever we go out), and cooked everything for us. ÊHe changed out the cooking trays at the appropriate times, kept our waters filled, and even put on the tennis match on the tv for us. ÊParking is limited, but there is valet, however, if you go early like I did, then it's a breeze. ÊSoo....WON me over.. haha, get it? Ê... I'll stop doing that.

5 stars based on my restaurant experience alone. I say this because I'm definitely not a big fan of the tiny parking lot and their valet staff (fool was parking my car and "barely bumped" the car in front of my spot). One look at me, and you can probably tell that I will not resist the temptation of going to the great AYCE KBBQ joints that K-town has to offer. However, I do like to go to the a-la-carte BBQ restaurants once in a while, especially since my beloved Woo Lae Oak from my adolescence is no longer what it used to be (WLO BH is shit, and I have no idea what they've done to the former lot...) Since I've heard good things about Soowon Galbi and noticed the yummy pics that you Yelpers have posted, I decided to give this place a try. It was just me and the gf, but we decided to pig out and order Combo C (chicken bulgogi, pork belly, beef brisket, beef ribeye) which is enough to feed 3 hungry stomachs. Great variety on the banchan, and of course, free refills. Each of the meat selections were quite yummy. Needless to say, the two of us completed our meal and were STUFFED. What surprised me the most was the attentiveness of the staff. On one occasion as we were cooking our meat, flames came through the grill as the charcoal heated up. We're used to this, and it wasn't like we freaked out "OMG, that shit almost burnt my f-ing face!". But our server (who looked like one of those Korean boy group members a la 2PM or something...) noticed this, came right to our table, took the tongs, and handled the flame while checking up on us asking "Are you guys OK? Let me take care of this, I don't want you guys to get burnt and stuff." Points, major points. Oh, and he spoke English quite well so I'd say this place is non-Korean friendly. I didn't have to use my limited Korean skills at all... I'm sure I'll try this place again. It's a toss-up between Soowon and Park's for me at the moment - both being great KBBQ places not called Cho Sun Galbi.

Came here for lunch on weekend afternoon. ÊSurprised it was not as full as I expected. ÊParking lot is tiny and during peak hours you'll need to valet. ÊRestaurant is not gigantic by any means. Ê2 - 3 servers working at the time and we were seated immediately. ÊIt took a little time for service, probably because there was a large party there. Ê We ordered the combination BBQ for 2 and an order of bimbim naengmyun. ÊWhat stood out was their version of Galbi, the marinade was fantastic, not overtly sweet like some of the other BBQ places and just enough that you can still taste the quality of the beef. ÊAlso superbly tender. ÊBrisket was on the fattier side, quite greasy, but I know some people enjoy the additional flavor and fat. ÊSide dishes and salad were plentiful. Also came with soybean soup. ÊWay too much food for 2 people, but from what I am told that is the Korean way. ÊNaengmyun went well with the galbi BBQ. Overall the service could use a little organization, seemed chaotic. The brisket could be a little leaner. ÊParking situation could also be better. ÊWill I return? ÊYES, their galbi kicks ass.

Found this place from Yelp and i was not disappointed. This was the BEST meal of my mini trip to LA. I still dream about this place. The banchan was so good that we asked for seconds! There was only 2 of us, mind you. We had the galbi and the bulgogi. My friend isn't so adventurous so we played it safe. Still, the meat was perfection. Marinated just right and tender. I have yet to find a Korean place in SF that closely matches Soowon. I can't wait for the next time I'm in the area so I can try the other highly rated items.

As far as Korean BBQ places goes, this is definitely as good as it gets. Everything from the service, banchan (side dishes), meat, cleanliness, are all 5 star quality. This is your typical Korean BBQ restaurant with a grill in the center of the table. What really makes this place stand out above the rest is the quality of their meat. Keep in mind, you will be paying more than your usual AYCE places, so this may not be a place you want to dine at if you eat KBBQ daily...but, if you're in the mood for quality this is the place to be. -- Valet parking :/. Understandable, being that it is in a small plaza. -- NOT AYCE. -- DELICIOUS and FRESH MEAT -- Helpful and attentive service! -- Family dinner? Want to impress coworkers or friends with some good kbbq? Need to take the lady/man out for a good eat? (don't expect any action after..you're gonna stink!) -- Make a reservation!

Anyways as I was yelping korean bbq this place isn't even ALL YOU CAN EAT i guess now we can't really RELY ON YELP REVIEWS. Its pretty good and clean but a lil bit way too pricey =X The host is really nice and sweet we get candy lollipop and cookies for dessert =) i'm rating this 3 stars because of the reviews that other people post who said it was ALL YOU CAN EAT which it WASN'T. OH AND THE PRICE ITS NOT BETWEEN $11-30 you guys could stop lying now haha. ITS OVER $30.

Very, very good service and food. ÊI really enjoyed that you get so many sides to try with your food. ÊThe kimchee was unreal and they offered you around 5 different types to pick from--or order them all like we did! ÊThe anchovies were really good too. ÊMy lunch dates ordered the chicken and it was amazing. ÊI had the shrimp and although they were good, they weren't that flavorful and really lost some attraction next to the chicken. Beautiful decor and tons of eating fun.

Meat. Meat. Meat. It's easy to see why this place got so many great reviews. Food was excellent. The Galbi is a must. Really flavorful. We also got the pork belly, was not a fan. Tasted like cheap bacon. Way too much fat. Still, that might be how it is and since the rest of the meal was so good I can only assume it's my culinary ignorance. Valet parking in the lot only, which seems pretty standard in LA (Norcal here). Highly recommend.

Beautiful atmosphere, great service (especially for an Asian restaurant). ÊThey make their own kim chee there, which I thought was crispy in every bite--hands down the best kim chee i've ever have outside of Korea. ÊPlenty of Banchan. We ordered marinaded galbi, fish roe soup, octopus with rice, and mackerel fish. ÊGalbi was good, fish roe was ok, octopus was good, but slightly too sweet for my taste. . . but stay way from the mackerel fish. ÊThe skin of the fish was too chewy, like it has been frozen for a long time and slightly under cooked. Ê Ê Ê We find everything we had here was slightly on the sweet side. ÊStill great place though ÊI liked it, but I would rather explore a few other places before returning.

OVERRATED How is this place so highly rated? ÊYes... The meat and banchan (side dishes) are definitely better than your average AYCE BBQ but that is expected. Ê If I am paying that much for non-AYCE portion, the meat better be good. But, I was also expecting better service. ÊTwo tables of six was left vacant for 20 minutes before the next two group was seated. ÊThe banchan was given to us 10 minutes after the meat was served and we had to ask 3 times. ÊHalf way through the meal, they tell us there is no more rice paper wrap. ÊThey did not change our grill even once. ÊI had better service at an AYCE joint. There are plenty of places with meat just as good or even better with better service and no crowds.

I guess it took me forever to review this place, because I have nothing to say except "it's GREAT!!" Hands down the BEST Korean BBQ place I've ever been to. Excellent banchan selections, delicious meat, and great attentive service make this restaurant a solid 5 star place. Ê I seem to always find street parking fairly easily but this is not the best neighborhood, so if you don't want to walk a block or two, valet is a good option. My favorite things on the menu are: marinated galbi, pork belly slices, and shrimp. I don't know what they put in the marinade, but the galbi is soooo freaking good!! Very tender, full of flavor, excellent quality. Just thinking about soowon makes me hungry!!!

This was my first time at a Korean BBQ restaurant, so my rating is not in comparison to other Korean BBQs but more from the perspective of an American girl venturing out of her food comfort zone. The service was super fast and the food was very, very tasty (though some of the cuts of meat were extremely fatty; I'm not sure if this is characteristic of Korean BBQ or not). ÊSo I can't recommend this place if you only eat lean meat, but if you're willing to eat meat that is half fat, then this place is excellent. ÊThe side dishes are plentiful and also very tasty. The service was...I'm not sure....I was hoping for a bit of the "Have you been here before? No? Well let me show you how Korean BBQ works!" kind of attitude from the waitstaff, but all that the servers did was chuck stuff onto the grill without a word. ÊI even asked what each of the meats were a couple of times - no response. ÊDon't get me wrong, the service was excellent, but the whole nonverbal deal caught me off guard and left me a bit confused as to what I was eating. Among three of us, we each paid around 25 bucks for the dinner (combo C plus an extra beer), which I think is a very good price given the quality and quantity of food. Overall, it was a fun, delicious, and filling dinner. ÊAnd also - parking was not a problem at all - they have a $2 valet service. ÊI might come here again evenutally, but I'll also be interested in trying out other Korean BBQ restaurants.

Getting a combo is well worth your money. What the restaurant suggests as enough for 3 is for 3 people in eat-until-I'm-going-to-burst mode. All combos come with all the banchan, a choice of soda/soju (yogurt soju for an additional $4), all the meats, soup, porridge, and sikhye at the end. And it's nice they cook it for you. It comes down to about $20 + tax per person, so not too much more than most AYCE joints. Definitely would recommend Soowon for the quality of meat. The cuts were just beautiful to look at - thick, juicy cuts. Plus, you end up just as full. :P And the prices are low enough where if you really wanted something else, order it off the regular menu. So good. :)

Great Korean BBQ.. customer service was above average and price was a bit high so a 4 overall, but the quality of the food (from the meat to the side dishes) is top quality. My friend and I ordered a Combo B and finished the whole thing by ourselves.. it was seriously that good. There really isn't much else to say.. cleaner than other Kbbq restaurants and their service, although not perfect, is better than most Kbbq places. I hate the parking here, but it's LA. If I was in the area, I'd definitely come back.. otherwise it's to Rowland for all you can eat value.

I have nothing but LOVE for Soowon Galbi!! Over the last year I have enjoyed my favorite Korean BBQ restaurant at least eight times and the experience keeps getting better. Awesome food and good service keep me coming back. Tuesday night's dinner - the place was packed with patrons but I had a table reserved with a perfect view of the NBA Playoffs on tv. ÊOnce again the food was great and my primary servers were Danny and Yang (and a new, beautiful, server- in- training but I did not get her name.) They were all very attentive, polite and had a sense of humor. They made us feel special and they deserved a 20% tip. Kudos to the owners - I have dealt with the two sisters over the phone or via email regarding different things in the past. They are truly committed to customer satisfaction by being pro active and anticipating the customer's needs. The sisters are genuinely nice people and it reflects in the restaurant. They truly make an American customer feel welcomed, wanted and valued.

We came here for lunch on a Saturday based on reviews from fellow Yelpers. ÊWe got here around 11:15am. ÊWe were the first ones to be seated for the day. ÊWe thought it would be busier based on the high Yelp reviews, but people probably come here for dinner rather than lunch. ÊNo need for valet at this time of the day. ÊThe restaurant is clean with a modern decor. ÊThe service was excellent, we were quite surprised about how good the service was. Ê We ordered the house special kalbi, vegetables to grill, and chap chae. ÊThe banchan/side dishes were delicious and they had a few different dishes not normally given in other restaurants. ÊThe beef tasted great, it was good quality, better than average. ÊThe vegetables were good especially the mushrooms with the dipping sauce. ÊWe normally don't get vegetables at a Korean BBQ as you come here for the meat not vegetables, but we thought 2 meat dishes for lunch would be too heavy. ÊThe chap chae/glass noodles were also delicious. ÊThis isn't an AYCE place but with the quality of food they would have to charge some pretty hefty prices to make it AYCE. ÊI thought their prices were higher than average, but this isn't your average Korean BBQ place. Great recommendation from fellow Yelpers!

Korean food is without a doubt my favorite food to eat, and I'll never get sick of it. With the abundance of options around the area, I've been to a decent amount of k-bbq restaurants. This is, hands down, my favorite place to eat, and I'll gladly sit in rush hour traffic to make that happen. The service is friendly and they even have no problem taking care of a silly white guy like me (I'm working on doubling my vocabulary from 10 to 20 words). As for the food, it's mostly the typical k-bbq fare, but it's very high quality. They have a lot of the normal banchan you'd expect, with a few unique ones. If you leave here still hungry, you're doing something wrong. Prices are average, parking is a hassle. Valet takes care of that problem.

This is the best Korean BBQ ever! The combo D includes a good portion of beef, pork bellies, and marinated chicken. All the delicious side dishes of course, and some onions and garlic to make your grilling experience an even more marvelous adventure. The BBQ was excellent. Out of the handful of Korean BBQ places I've been to this year, this one has been the best.However, our second BBQ dish was pork belly and it was pretty much flavorless and disappointing, so stay away from that dish. Oh and it covers drinks. Your choice between soda, tea, or Soju. I ordered the soju thinking it was gonna be like two shots but they give you a whole bottle. Driving through Koreatown just outright SUCKS! But the good thing is we found parking pretty close so no need to valet in their crowded little parking lot.

Location/Parking: Valet lot. It's Korea town... But there are meters a block away but park at your own risk in the dark streets. Seating/Wait: During dinner and lunch times...it's harsh to get a table. I'm not sure if they even take phone reservations but it's hard when you don't speak Korean. Service: Good service. Limited English but they answered all our questions. It's one of the Korean BBQ places that will cook and cut all your meat. Let them. Food: From my few experiences, the meat you get from the combination is okay. I only order it because it comes with all the banchan (side dishes) and everything else you need for kbbq. However, the galbi is to die for! I mean it. Do expect around $30+ a person though. Dcor/ Ambience: Clean and enough ventilation! You should still dress light because the after kbbq smell that seeps into your hair and clothes can make one gag (or maybe I just eat too much). Dogs: no outdoor seating, no dogs allowed

First time eating here.. We were actually looking for a soon tofu restaurant but ended up here.. First of all, the service was superb! The staff were really nice and the service was fast. We ordered soon tofu and galbi. The food was way better than the kbbq places around our area and they gave us so much banchan which was really really delicious.. I usually don't eat much but i ended up eating a lot.. 2nd time eating here was to try their kbbq.. We ordered combo b and oh my GOD!! Everything was so delish and i like the fact that they cooked it for you and the waiters are very attentive to you.. It's pricier than regular buffet style kbbq place because it is not eat all you can but the quality of the meat is superb! Did i talked about the banchans? They were just so GOOD! I will be back soon! Definitely will recommend this place!! The only thing i don't understand is the valet parking in front of the store..

Hankering for some authentic korean bbq? Happen to be driving through Ktown? Soowon is the place to be! I've tried korean bbq in Oakland as well as San Fran and Soowon is hands down the most authentic flavored korean bbq in Cali(that I have tried so far). We decided to go all out and ordered 3 orders of their house special galbi(short ribs) as well as 3 orders of their ribeye. Unlimited salad to go with your meat and endless flow of side dishes makes it a very memorable experience, even with soju and hite involved. Food Highlight: House special Galbi(short ribs)

((A long one, but worth it.... TRUST me, baby birds.)) Sometimes relationships sour against our will and we find ourselves alone with our thoughts. We obsess about our lost love. Our minds stray endlessly back to the same topic, no matter what other issues are pressing on our shoulders... The mind wanders back to unrelenting images of the good thing we had, which we no longer have. The outside world no longer exists and we are consumed by the tortured microcosm we tragically fashion for ourselves. I woke up this morning feeling alone. Obsessed. Confused. Can I go back today? Maybe if I return often enough, they'll allow me to take up residence. Eat ALL day and then, after the grills have cooled after the evening service, put a mattress on top of the table and simply fall into one glorious meat-induced coma after another. Could this be arranged? Maybe I should learn Korean to make this happen more rapidly. Yes, this morning, I awoke a different person. ((Go back to the prior evening)) I stood there, in the waiting area, watching in astonishment as the waitstaff and front desk staff worked liked bees to a silent symphony... A ballet of perfectly smooth choreography. It was beautiful, witnessing these professionals doing something I'd rarely seen in ANY restaurant: working in flawless harmony. Waiters (or servers, if you're a stickler) were checking the reservation books and seating customers, hostesses were clearing tables... It was hypnotic. And here, my friends, is where my obsession began--watching one waiter seeing another in peril and rushing to his aid; without verbal communication, sweeping trays off one anothers' hands, and rushing them back to the kitchen. Busboys steering their cleaning carts through the organized, premeditated madness, clearing tables with blinding speed for the next diners. It was official: I was consumed with the beauty of this establishment. Once seated, after a 40 minute wait (on a Wednesday night, at 8pm), we ordered a Combo C ((see photos for the description)) and 3 bowls of Galbi Tang, a short rib soup with mild broth, clear noodles, and green onions. The soup was presented in a curious manner... Women received small metal bowls filled with a single ladle of soup from the large bowl; Men received the large bowl. This was a challenge and imposition that I accepted with enthusiasm. The meat was fall-apart tender, broth needed some kick from the chili paste on the table, and the noodles were perfect. A delight. The banchan came in abundance, alongside rice. They brought a full assortment of banchan--nearly 7 or 8 dishes--for every two diners at the table. We received three full sets. Want more of anything, you Korean food virgins?... Hit the "Call" button on the wall. It's like the flight attendant button on a plane; a tone sounds and someone comes rushing to cater to your needs. A mark of how amazing the service at this restaurant is: we didn't use the service button once and still received some of the best and friendliest service I've ever received at any restaurant. These are no part-time actors... they are professionals. They have mastered a craft and they are providing an amazing service to the public. A note: Here, they cook your food for you, even though the grill is a few feet from your face. Talk about paradise! Like I said: service here is impeccable. The Combo "C" (thin brisket, sliced pork belly, rib eye, and chicken) was simply fantastic. My hunger did not cease. With food like this, you get as much as you can before you're either cut off or the place closes for the evening. My only complaint is that the charcoal grill kept dying. It may have been our table... I don't know, and quite frankly, I don't care. The waitstaff was happy to re-ignite it and it had absolutely NO impact on my enjoyment. -------- I wish I could live here. I wish I could take all my friends and family here. I wish that I could properly express the sheer urgency... the unrelenting preoccupation... the desire I have to return. I have passed an event horizon, an inescapable gravity that will inevitably draw me back, time and time again. This is my new gospel, and I will spread it like a determined missionary. Soonwon Galbi is simply the finest Korean restaurant I've ever had the privilege of dining at, and I can't wait to go back. A marvel of culinary achievement and an example of everything service SHOULD be. Five enthusiastic stars and two HUGE thumbs up. An epiphany... a gift... an obsession.

After gorging at many AYCE korean bbq places, my wife and I decided to try a different concept. Not all you can eat but better quality food.

OK, on to the important stuff...the food! ÊAs it was our first time here, we decided to get the Soowon Galbi. ÊIt was EXCELLENT!

This place is the REAL DEAL!!!! Get their house special Kalbi. You will not be disappointed. They also have other meats like chicken, pork, shrimp, etc... And they are pretty good, especially the shrimp. But that is not where they shine. The Kalbi is the one Luke... Use the force... Great service and lots of banchan.

There are many reasons why I like this place. I am from Korea and most of Korean restaurants I've been to here in CA was garbage-like due to the quality, cleanness, service, but most importantly, taste. PROS 1. Clean!!!! Side dishes are simple and clean. They don't serve you bullshit mayonnaise deluxe potato salad or crappy Ê ÊCabbage with ketchup on top. Real banchan, not 'American style' bullshits. 2. Good service. Polite, quick and friendly. 3. Decent quality meats. ( Yang nyum galbi is definitely the best item on their menu) 4. Good naengmyun. ONLY mul naengmyun, though. Bibim naengmyun is too sweet but mul baengmyun here is pretty good. CONS 1. Parking. The parking lot is the size of a cat penis. But whatever, they park it for you so I guess its not the worst. 2. Their soups, stews and appetizers are pretty average tasting but definitely over priced. I'd never order them again. I only just do BBQ. 3. Their yook hwei ( raw beef) was pretty disappointing. OVERLY sweetened and bland. Great quality beef but the seasoning made the dish pretty boring. 4. You ALWAYS have to wait to sit. Not a big deal though. Overall, especially here in southern California, this place should be considered one of the better places. ( Don cuco, Wokcano etc) I'll go back for their yangnyum galbi for sure.

This place is really good except it is packed! ÊWe had to wait even though we got there at like 9pm. ÊI thought that the Korean ribs were really tender and well flavored. ÊThe side dishes were authentic and all pretty fresh as well. ÊThe only problem is that they are so busy that sometimes it is hard to find a waiter. ÊAlso, the parking lot is really tiny so you either have to valet or park in one of the residential streets. ÊWe all know that the residential streets in K-Town are kinda of scary at night.

Yes, this is a pricey place. But quality really does matter over quantity. Maybe it's because I'm getting old, but AYCE KBBQ just really doesn't attract me anymore. Stuffing ridiculous amount of beef into my body just isn't fun any more.. in fact, it feels more like a chore. Thanks to Soowon, I have options now. This is not your Ma Dang Sae, Sanya, or even O Dae Sang. Sure you can go to those restaurants and get away with $10~15 with more meat than you can swim in. But to be sure, you will start getting the stink eyes starting your second plate. And the service only goes downhills in those places. But I have to mention those other places to contrast how Soowon reminded me what it means to be served as a valuable customer again. The waiter/waitress are attentive to your needs. The meat are well display when they arrive on your table. And man... do they melt in your mouth! I can't remember which Combo I got but it was for 2 people. The Ê(banchan/side dishes) were not too memorable but I don't recall them being bad either. As for parking... a lot of people complained about the validation... it's true that K-town is not well known for easy parking, but I tend to not have any trouble street parking (meter ends around 6~7pm) ÊI figure I can afford walking a little after all this meat anyways =P

If you like Korean BBQ, K-town is the place to be in all of North America. I've tried numerous different places in the area and way beyond. Nothing can compare and Soowon is one of my absolute favorite places for marinated korean bbq, especially kalbi. The pricing is similar to any of the other restaurants and the quality and taste is FANTASTIC! It's honestly very hard to compare the top spots in K-town as they are marginally different. Dishes: ALL the meats are good, including the side dishes. I prefer eating the marinated meats at this joint, though both are good. Hint: It gets pretty busy so be prepared to wait or just come early. There are other comparable joints in the area. If you don't know korean bbq, try the combinations so you can see what kind of meats you like and have a taste of soju (korean rice liquor). Then you can order more of what you like moving forward. Asian BBQ can be split into two types: marinated and not marinated. From there it goes to what types of marinades and/or types of meat and sauces to dip in. Disclaimer: I don't rate on service or decor, this place is quite decent inside though the outside looks sketchy as usual in k-town. I know Korean food very well as does most of the people that eat in K-town/LA/OC.

A group of us came here tonight to celebrate Anthony N's birthday, and had an awesome meat-filled experience! Daniel L made a reservation for the four of us, so after scoring an easy and free (after 7pm) meter practically right out front, we were seated within minutes of when we walked in. ÊThe decor was nice, and looked like a newer restaurant, even though it's been here for a while. As soon as we ordered, the meats and banchan came out, and our (uncharacteristically, for a Korean BBQ place) excellent and friendly service began - and never stopped til we walked out the door! Between the 2-3 servers (Danny's was the only name I got) who helped us, we never needed to lift a finger to cook anything. ÊThey brought out all our raw meats, kept them on a tray at our table, and asked us which we wanted them to cook next. ÊThey cut the larger pieces for us, turned them over to cook them evenly, and refilled our banchan as the dishes emptied out. They even started us on a wire grill top for a few meats, and then switched to a clean and more closed grill as the first one became crusted with meat juices. What we got: Beef Tongue - super thin, still frozen when it hit the grill, this unseasoned tongue was tender and delicate when cooked Ribeye - unseasoned, well marbled and tender and delicious! Short Ribs - super marbled, very tender, very juicy, and MY FAVE! ÊBrought with the bone in, and cut in bite-sized pieces for us as they cooked. Pork neck - strips of flavorful fatty pork, cooked in the center of the grill so that the oils and juices ran towards the edges of the grill - where they let kimchi get porky oily and caramelized. ÊA yummy way to cook them both! Pork belly - huge and thick pieces of bacony-looking meat, cut in pieces for us as they cooked and got caramelized Trumpet mushrooms - huge slices of trumpet mushrooms were laid on the grill and cut in pieces as they became cooked and juicy. ÊThis was one of the banchan, or came with one of the meats, and was a nice surprise! Banchan: Salad - shredded cabbage with green onions and a light vinegary, slightly spicy dressing Seaweed salad - traditional, stringy green seaweed with sesame seeds and a light-sweet vinegar dressing Creamy seaweed salad - this was new to me - a creamy dressing tossed with a ramen-looking seaweed Toasted seaweed salad - pieces of nori, still with the telltale toasted nori texture, tossed with a light dressing Candied potatoes - stewed or boiled in a sweet-ish soy sauce til tender Broccoli salad - tossed with a silken-tofu-looking slightly creamy dressing, a little al dente, and yummy! Spinach - very lightly dressed cooked cold spinach Bean Sprouts - traditional bean sprouts salad, with a light-sweet vinegar and sesame oil dressing Spicy soft shell blue crab - this was a nice banchan surprise that they brought towards the end. ÊPieces of a little blue crab, dressed in a reddish spicy sauce, and tossed with jalapeno pieces. ÊThe crab shell was soft enough to bite and suck crab out of, but not soft enough to eat. Rice wraps - lots of thin and chewy rice noodle wraps for our meats! Fresh raw garlic cloves - they threw a bunch on the grill for us, and also brought a little aluminum foil piece shaped into a cup, with oil and garlic cloves in it. ÊThe cup was set on a cooler edge of the grill, so the garlic cooked slowly in oil til the pieces were tender. ÊYUMMY!! The kimchi, miso, chili paste, and the vinegary and oily-salty dipping sauces for our meats were all super yummy too. Between the meat quality, the excellent level of service and the friendliness of everyone, they were at 4.5 stars so far for me. ÊBut then they put themselves into the 5-star category by acknowledging Anthony's birthday with: Cake House Chocolate Mousse Cake - a mini mousse cake, with a lit candle in it was brought over and the waiters sang ÊHappy Birthday! ÊI NEVER see this at a KBBQ - in fact, they usually don't have dessert at all. ÊThe mousse cake was lightly sweet and creamy, with two distinctly different mousse layers and a thin layer of chocolate cake as its base. Ê Sweet Corn Tea - at the very end of the meal, they brought us small glasses of cold and sweet corn tea The total came to $150 (without tip), including a bottle of soju, for the four of us. My meat tooth was definitely satisfied tonight, thanks to Soowon! ÊAnd I left smelling only a little bit smoky : D. Happy Birthday Anthony!! Ê: D

Quick Review: - Great food with plenty of meat choices and side dishes - The meat is quite tender and flavorful. - They cook the food for you (especially recommended for people who are constantly stuck being the chef and missing out on a lot of the food, or having to eat cold food due to tending the grill!) - Not too smokey so you don't end up with as heavy a kbbq smell as most places. - Valet parking for 2 bucks, but a lot of parking on the side streets if you don't mind walking a block or two. - Sweet drink (not sure what kind it was) as dessert is a nice counterbalance to all the saltiness, but not very satisfying. - Decently priced given the quality of food. - Nice serving staff... though some don't understand English very well. - Extra bonus: They allow unlimited splitting of credit cards. Recommended.

It's hard to stand alone at times. And considering the reviews for this place, it's more than likely that we just came by on a bad day. Or that our waitress didn't like the looks of us and punished us accordingly. To start - the Banchan were kind of bland as other reviewers pointed out. The selection of what we ordered (and these were chosen from the most recommended items from fellow yelpers) were a huge let down. My guests were glaring at me like I was crazy for recommending this place. I didn't say much but the meat was really poor quality and the price for all 3 of us was around 100. Certainly the worst KBBQ that I've had in LA. So yes, I'm going to assume that they just tossed some garbage at us on a lonely afternoon with no one around in the restaurant and so we suffered. I would love to come back with someone who is a regular and loves it, oh and they can pay as well because I'm not giving these fools another penny. The thing is, I believe that consistency is the hallmark of a great restaurant. Living in Little Tokyo, there are several sushi and yakitori spots which I love, but one has inconsistent pricing, and the other inconsistent service. The food though, is always good. Soowon has lousy food, a hefty price and service was not great either. Probably a bad day for them but then again, I feel like people who want to trash this place probably read the 5 star reviews and perhaps don't want to be the lone contrarian. Luckily, that's what I do best...as a talking Japanese hamburger...

We came here to check out all the hype about this 4 1/2 star place, and I was disappointed. We chose the popular and highly raved about Galbi bbq. And yes it was good, but no, it didn't impress me. The meat could've been marinated more and more tender. The side dishes were good, but I do feel that there wasn't that much of a selection. They gave us kimchi and your standard side dishes, but they were lacking fish cakes and anchovies (both of my favorites). Sundays are slow, so we got good service. Tip: Don't do Valet. Find street parking.

It was better than the last place I ate mul naeng myun in LA but I've definately had better. I haven't found a place that has good mul naeng myun yet. ÊI guess i was going to all the wrong places...

It's the best KBBQ "ever"--according to my well-traveled Mom. She's had KBBQ in Vancouver, Hong Kong, New York, etc. We got two orders of the ribs, one order of pork belly, and one order of the grilled fish. For four hungry people, this was more than enough food. Surely, the ribs had a savory, memorable taste--something that is lacking from most other KBBQ places. The sides are very, very good as well. There's 17ish tables, so be prepared to wait.

The standard for Korean BBQ in LA has always been Parks, but I believe Soo Won is better. ÊThanks to Yelp for helping me learn about this place. ÊI went on a weeknight at 7:00 p.m. and the wait was only a few minutes. ÊIt is in a small strip mall / valet parking (you could park on the street, but I wouldn't do that around here) - the valet is only $2. Ê Service was attentive and they do speak English. ÊYou won't feel out of place here if you are not Korean. Ê In terms of food, the meats run around $27 per order / comparable portion sizes to most Korean BBQ in town. No, this is NOT all you can eat, but the quality is better. ÊFor three people we had two orders of beef (marinated and non-marrinated) and seafood pancake. ÊFood was really good / I liked the fact that they do a charcoal BBQ here - adds flavor to the meat. Ê They do take reservations, so if you plan to go on a Friday or Saturday evening, I'd highly recommend that. ÊPlace is small (probably 1/3 the size of Park's), so I can easily see how the wait could be long on a busy night.

My former Korean church pastor recommended that I try out his family's restaurant whenever I am in Koreatown. Thinking back on the times our church congregation had banquets, his family would always cook up a storm. Just had to try this place out since he's been nagging me about it. Came here with a group of 9 people and we were seated almost immediately. Impeccable timing since we drove up, got out, let valet do their thing and was whisked to the table. Majority of the patrons eating here were either Korean or businessmen of some kind. I guess I knew what I was getting into when we walked in. Since I was the only Korean at the table, my friend's dad thought it would be cool if I did all the ordering for everyone. Also, we had out of town guests who had never tried Korean cuisine before, so I thought it would be cool to throw some delicacies into the menu. xP We ordered Butterfly shrimp, Dak-gogi (Chicken), Kkot Sal (marbled rib eye beef), Hyuk Mit Gui (Beef tongue) and Soo Won Wang Galbi (the house galbi ribs). It sounds like a lot of food, except we were all big eaters. Think of that, except times FIVE. Mas~iss~eo! (Delicious!) When the food comes to the table, there are about 8-9 different dishes of banchan w/ kimchi and rice of course. Service here is friendly, really attentive and the servers refilled my glass of water constantly. Overall an amazing experience grilling my food, eating my food and being served some delicious excellent quality meat. This is as fresh as you can get! General tab per person w/ drinks is about $30~40.

Went here for my mother's bday with a party of 6 people, so we ordered Combo A. The beef brisket is excellent, we ordered an extra dish of shrimp because my pops loves shrimp, totally overpriced and not worth it. ÊSome of the banchan was good, but who gives cilantro and onion as a side dish?... boo. ÊThere was pickled daikon, kim chi, and a variety of others. ÊHowever, the ones that I love were the kim chi cucumber and the rice paper, always have to have that with Korean bbq! They also had a white creamy banchan called seaweed rice paper that my parents and brother absolutely loved; I thought it was good, but nothing extraordinary The place is a bit pricey (about $20/person), but for special occasions I would say it's a nice korean barbeque restaruant. ÊIt's more upscale, ventilation is good so you pay for what you get. Not bad, but not wonderful as my younger sister kept raving about. I would give it an 8/10. ÊFor the regular, lunch ayce places, I would much rather go to o dae san.

Came here with a group of friends. It's a good thing we had reservations because the wait was at least one hour long. I'm not a big eater of meat these days but it's hard to pass up KBBQ! 1) Waitress was friendly given that we didn't speak Korean and her English was limited. She cooked our food and was busy bringing back large HITE beer every 10 minutes. 2) We ordered the $99 family combo that serves 4-5 people. We had 12 people in our group so we ordered two of those bad boys. I believe it came with 5 different kinds of meat. This place is not AYCE. 3) Try the house special Galbi which they are famous for. We ordered that after we polished off our first round. It was definitely worth saving space for because that's some of the best marinated meat ever. I would come back if I remember where this place is located. I didn't drive so I suffer from CRS (can't remember sh*t) syndrome when I'm a passenger. And you know how confusing K-town is if you don't read/speak Korean. Maybe this was a one-night stand. I'll have memories of the delicious Soowon Galbi.

Good quality of meat and sides you don't typically get at other Korean BBQ places. There was a tasty almond dish. Good nutty flavor to it. There was also a sweet seaweed that was very good.

The following review is for set A. I've had 2 great experiences at Soowon but yesterday was simply well below Soowon's past standard. ÊWe were the largest party in the restaurant at 4:30pm. Service was poor: We had to do everything ourselves from the get go and had to ask for one refill for drinks. ÊMind you our waitress was not the same as the previous occasions. ÊUsually, Soowon staff would start off with the first round of cooking and may even follow up at a later time. ÊWhen we asked for a refill of just 2 items of banchan (not a refill of everything) the waitress acted frustrated with us! ÊSeriously, she wasn't happy she had to bring me spinach and more bean sprouts which are two very inexpensive items. Again we ordered Set A for $99 and really counted on some of the great service we received in the past. Most importantly, the portion of meat did not seem significantly different from set C. You can look at the pic on the restaurant's website for A and I assure you that's not what we got for combo A. ÊIt was like we got combo C or B minus the chicken. I envied the other tables which were serviced by the great attentive waitress. ÊI wish I could've given her my tip monies.

Came on Tuesday night at 7P. Waited about 30-40 minutes for a table for 4. Great banchan. Fresh, original, and delicious. Changes regularly fro my understanding. Ordered the combo B, which has the wang kalbi (kalbi rib with meat wrapped around). LEGIT. Enough to feed 3 guys and 1 girl. They give you bean curd soup, rice porridge, and shik kae (dessert drink) at the end of your meal to fill up any empty space you might have left. Great place for KBBQ lovers. $2 Valet parking.

Yum! And the price isn't bad either. I came here with a group of 6 and we got a combo and added the pork belly. It was a LOT of meat! Another weird thing is they told us they'd give us 5 sodas with the combo, but since there were 6 of us I just volunteered to be happy with my water. Not really a big deal though, unless everyone at your table is dying for a coke. Some of the meats had a lot of fat on them which can be good or bad, depending on how you look at it. The galbi was my favorite. The flat pancake side (sorry I don't know the name!) was so good they ran out at the end of the night. I also loved the potatoes, but then again I don't think I've ever eaten a potato I didn't like. Parking is almost non existent here so we also paid the $2 valet. The valet was closing before the restaurant closed so they came inside and gave us the keys to the car. Side note: Wear something machine washable. You will smell like your food at the end of the night, which should be expected from any Korean restaurant.

This is my favorite Korean BBQ in LA. The panchan is amazing and fresh. Their meat is delicious. I usually order unmarinated galbi, marinated galbi, and marinated pork. I've also had pretty much all of the meat on their menu and have never left disappointed. They are also accommodating for birthdays etc. We have had three birthday dinners here with over 15 guests without a hitch. ÊWhen I leave LA I always go to Soowon when I get back. Scrumptious. I would also like to address some of the bad reviews that I've read on yelp about Soowon. ÊI'm not Korean and I get great service here. I've taken groups of 15 people here, all not Korean, and gotten great service...at 8:00 on a Saturday! What many people fail to notice is the button on the table that you have to push to call a waiter. Maybe many of you frustrated with the service need a tutorial on Korean dinning in K-town. Soowon, like many Korean restaurants, is very efficient. If you need something you have to push the button. ÊI actually love this about Soowon. There's no waiting for a waiter to pass by, no waiving someone down, no getting up to serve yourself....JUST PUSH THE BUTTON!! No need to get all racial impatient ones. JUST PUSH THE BUTTON!!

this is the absolute place to go for high end korean bbq. this is NOT an AYCE place.. with low quality meats.. The sliced beef that they have needs almost no seasoning whatsoever, and it looks as marbled as the best steaks you find in beverly hills. Honestly, i ate some of it without even cooking it, its just that tasty and it melts in your mouth. The service is top notch, and the ambience isn't overly smokey like you'll find in some other korean restaurants. Ê The food that you get here is definitely worth the money that you will spend.

It's been about ten years since I've last eaten here. It's changed. Though I can't exactly remember how it was before. ÊPlus I was a total Korean food virgin back then so I probably thought it was heaven. While this certainly isn't the best korean bbq, it is really good. The meat (marinated kalbi) is a little fatty, and the service, a little slow. Oh, and surprise, surprise: the parking lot sucks--welcome to Koreatown. Ê The bibim nengmyun is not to be missed.

Ok, it isn't AYCE. But coming from out of town, knowing about the LA County health rating system... I saw an A, not a C which I've seen at other Korean BBQ restaurants. It's clean.

You can bleach it all you want, but if it don't come out, to quote Dave Chappelle, "That shit is gross, son" It is high quality cuts of meat, kalbi, sides and more.

My first KBBQ experience. Pretty awesome. Good banchan, friendly service, nice design, clean space. Reservations recommended. I made one, and was very very glad I did. I also did not have trouble with any language barrier here as I was prepared for. I only minus one star because the service was a bit slow to start once we were seated. I hear of these rice paper wrap things that are supposed to come with the meal, and I did not get any. I was not sure because KBBQ is still new to me. My good Korean friend told me this the next day. :( I was glad to have tried their cold noodle soup too. What a beautiful dish it was. Anyway, everything else was great. The prices are intimidating when you share everything, so it is hard to determine what you are spending, but the total came to only about $30 per person including a couple rounds of soju.

When I moved to LA early last year, the first thing I had to find was a good Korean BBQ place. I'm Korean so we need to eat Korean BBQ at least once a month to survive, otherwise, we die from lack of deliciousness. It's true. So I turned to Yelp to find this place and was not disappointed! It's become my go-to place when I'm craving BBQ that's a little fancy. I usually come with just one friend so we get the "D" combo which comes with beef brisket, pork belly and marinated chicken. With that, you get rice and an assortment of yummy side dishes. You also get two sodas or one bottle of soju. All for just $40! I believe it also comes with steamed egg and soup but you have to ask for it. The meat quality is always excellent and its flavor is enhanced because you cook on a charcoal grill! Not a lot of BBQ places have that, so that makes this place extra special. I also love the rice paper and radish wraps for the meat! They don't have this where I'm from (we just wrap in lettuce) so I got a real kick out of seeing it here. And now I can't live without it! Service is always very good here as well. They cook the meat for you when they can and everyone is always super friendly. And if you ever need anything you can just push a button on your table and someone will come over to you quickly. Parking is valet only but there seems to be a lot of street parking when I go, though I usually go around 9 or 10pm. Area around here is a little sketchy so be careful if you park on a side street. If you go any earlier, expect to wait a bit. I once waited close to 45 minutes on a busier night. I do have to take off a star however because later at night, they sometimes run out of rice paper and this radish kimchee side dish that I like. I don't think it should be that hard to keep in stock especially when you know it's a staple. Stock up on it! But despite that little negative, I'm still very happy to have found this place. They've definitely SooWON me over!

So you've tried a lot of Korean bbq places and you decide hey, it's time i go to the best place that exists in Southern California, so you make your way to Soowon Galbi and boy are you not disappointed. The wait was 30 mins when we got there and i'll tell you this, I'd wait an hour to eat here. This place is the Rolls Royce of Korean BBQ. Best meat I've ever had at a Korean BBQ restaurant. Yes, it's a little bit more pricey than your standard AYCE places, but there's a reason for that, the meat is top notch, it's seriously perfection in your mouth. When I tasted it I looked up at the waiter as if he just put 5000 dollars cash in my hand and I was about to shed tear of joy. The atmosphere is nice, it's much more pleasant than a lot of places and it also has a few tvs in case you're wanting to watch the game while you eat. The staff spoke perfect english and was happy to talk to us about the meat and even a small discussion of other eateries in the area. They let me know that the charcoal is actually flown in from Korea. Now I'm not sure if I believe that, but the way this stuff tasted, i have no reason not to. If you're ready to reach the highest point of taste perfection in the Korean BBQ game then you really need to make your way here and get the galbi, it's what they're known for and there's a good reason for that. Pure perfection. I honestly almost cried it was so good. If there is a heaven and food is a part of it, they serve this there.

Over priced and Overrated. :( -Poor Service, Asked for a coke once, then twice and then once more. -We waited about 45 min for our uncooked meat was served.(Odd) -The meat was great, but for half that price you can have an all you can eat elsewhere. -I loved the sides, but to come back you need a lil more. -Rice didnt come till after we started eating.

First off, this is NOT a AYCE place. ÊKeep that in mind when you go there. ÊSoowon is known for high quality meat and amazing bonchon (side dishes). Ê I went on a Saturday night with a group of 15 and made reservations in advance. ÊI wanted everyone to sit together and they were nice enough to reserve a private area with 2 side by side tables for us. ÊWe had a great waiter that attended to all our pesky requests. Food: You must get the soowon galbi. ÊIt's their signature meat. ÊIt is so juicy that it just melts in your mouth. ÊThey also have combo meals which can easily feed 3 people and with some left over. ÊThe bon chon are delicious, especially the kimchi and the candied potato. ÊThey always give you more bon chon when they see that the bowl is empty... you never have to ask. Service: Like I said above, the service is top notch. ÊWe never had to cook our own meat (yes!), the waiter will take care of all the dirty work for you. ÊOur waiter spoke perfect English and was courteous. Bottom line: If you want good quality meat and great service, this is the place to go. ÊDon't expect AYCE prices, you are paying for better meat. Ê Make a reservation in advance, parking is valet (only $2). Ê I've been there countless times and it has never failed me.

Ok so it's pricey here, I think we paid about $29 for the Kalbi, but damn it was good as was all of the food. Very fresh and high quality from the meats to the sides. Service was excellent, the best I have ever had at a Korean BBQ, everyone was friendly and attentive (and we didn't even have any of our Korean friends with us:) The restaurant is also very clean, and nice to relax in, it felt fancy without being uncomfortable even if you walked in wearing a t-shirt. On a side note the hostess was so cute my single guy friends were ready to propose on the spot heheh I can't wait to go back, what a great place. Bumping up to 5 stars today since I'm over the cost issue and it isn't fair to downgrade stars on that account especially when I really consider how good this place was.

This is my most absolute favorite place ever. I dont even care that this review is almost exactly the same as my others. We came in the other night and it took about an hour and some to get us(6) seated with no reservations on a friday night. 4 people in my group had never tried this place and weren't happy with the wait but by the end of the dinner they had absolutely no complaints. Besides having awesome meat and sides what REALLY makes this place shine is the staff. They are just SO great, on our last visit Danny was our server and he was really funny, nice and on top of it. But, every single time we come in we have just the most amazing service ever. THe quality of the meat is really top notch too and i loooooooooooove the sides. Especially the kimchi cucumbers! and rice paper!!!!! This place makes me really sad I live so far because I crave it ALLLLLLLLL the time. I know its a little pricier than other kbbq places but the service and quality are worth it. LOVE THIS PLACE!...and so have all the people ive introduced to it. Êawesome!

Ain't gon lie. Although it seemed a bit pricey, it was goooood. But then i thought about it and other AYCE kbbq joints cost per head, and it would have added up to the amount we (gf and I) paid for. So it was actually fair. I wouldn't mind coming back here again. Oh, its location was strange. Gotta get in there in Downtown LA. Parking was tight. There's a private lot available but its full of the valet-parked cars. So i valeted mine for the price of $2. The funny thing was, after i left my car with them, they moved it Êabout 15 feet away in an area within their lot, close to a wall. I could have done that myself. Just didnt know if i was allowed to park there. So at the end, i slipped them the cha-ching ($2) and just asked for the key since it was pretty much parked in front of the restaurant. Basically paid for parking, but its was all good.

After discovering that our favorite Korean BBQ spot in L.A. Dae Sung Oak went out of business :-( we looked to Yelp to find a backup. ÊThis place showed up as highly rated so we decided to give it a try. We ordered the Combo A for $100 (feeds 4-5 people) which included galbi, pork neck, and the rest of your typical KBBQ fare. So, shortly after we place our order, out comes the banchan (side dishes). I knew right away that the food quality was above par. ÊBut, just like someone who is fresh out of a relationship with the perfect longtime girlfriend/boyfriend and started dating again within the first 48 hours, I wasn't ready to admit that the food was better than that of my beloved Dae Sung Oak. So here it is in a nutshell my fellow Yelpers: Food Quality: ÊThe food here rocks!!! ÊOnce you see and taste the food it will become obvious that they have some very high standards in the kitchen! Ê5 stars for the food! Overall Experience: ÊWhen I go out for KBBQ, I expect the atmosphere be to fun, lively, and full of happy customers toasting shots of soju. ÊInstead, we got a relatively quiet, dimly lit dining room filled with trendy decor.....sort of like what you would see if IKEA started seating customers for KBBQ. ÊCome here for the food, not for the mood! Ê4 stars for the overall experience.

This HAS to be the best KBBQ in Los Angeles. If it's not, I need to know what is, because I dream about Soowon Galbi ALL THE TIME. Drooling now just thinking about the delicious meat at this place. The quality of the meats and the banchan here is outstanding. Our faves are the bulgogi, the brisket and the pork belly. I also love that you can get any kind of wrap you want for the meat -- rice wraps, lettuce wraps, radish wraps... Might go again this weekend...

*100th review* WOOOOOO!!! Seeing that my girl is just as carnivorous as I am (possibly more), she wanted to do KBBQ, despite the fact we had just hit Fogo last week! Of course, I agreed... We came on a Saturday night with no reservations and had to wait 45 minutes, which was decent. When we were finally seated, we were immediately attended and went ahead and ordered combo C, because we're both fat-asses. I requested we get the beef bulgogi instead of the chicken, which they were just fine with. I think we both felt a bit of shame as they brought over the load of meat, but got over it as soon as the meat hit the grill. Pork belly... beef brisket... beef rib eye... beef bulgogi... Each and every piece of meat we had was ridiculously delicious, especially after I figured out the right combination of dipping sauces and hot sauce (it's a secret). But the star of the night was the rib eye, which led to a chopsticks fight with the girlfriend for the last few pieces. In addition to the several pounds of meat we devoured, we also had the steamed rice, and the beef soup which accompanied the meat beautifully. And as for the banchan, the sweet fish, potato and spinach were awesome. To say the least, we left insanely satisfied and beyond stuffed. Service was insanely good for a Korean establishment, most definitely the best I've experienced. And our tab at the end of the night was more than reasonable, considering for the quantity and quality of meat we consumed. Soowon, I don't want to scare you, but I think I love you.

POSITIVE The service was great. I don't usually see Korean waitresses smile and this one she was middle age and genuine even not fluent in English. I love the Kimchi side dishes, the cold noodle was ok (not my cup of tea since I'm a hot foodnavore). The Galbi and bulgogi...I can see why people love it so much here. The flavor is not over sweetened with the sauces they used to marinate. When it is grilled, the meat is grilled crisp, tender, juicy, and just plain delicious. NEGATIVE However, two down side. Service was slow if you ARE NOT KOREAN or did not come with a Korean, which I HATE. And the seats of the table are small because the stove really takes up the majority of the space underneath the table. I'm 6ft with long healthy legs and it was a major discomfort.I wished I had more of the meat but the prices are quite pricey for the quantity I have to say. Because each order is approximately starts at $15 for small portion for two.

So that's what banchan is..... thanks Yelp! And yes, it's certainly quick to be refilled, though you will have to flag down a waiter and make unhelpful descriptions of the dishes you want if you're as un-korean-savvy as myself ("uh... the potato thing, and that doughy roll thing, and the pickled stuff, and kimchi too!") The service is good and very accommodating. My party of six made reservations ahead of time, but got stuck in worse-than-usual LA traffic and called the restaurant to change our time. They happily obliged and also didn't get upset when two people in our party did not show up... they seated us immediately. We ordered Combo B for $79.99 (serves 4) because we wanted the marination and didn't have a craving for pork neck. It also came with a bottle of soju/beer/soda (yes, we were carded, so no pulling fast-ones, young ones!) and all in all it was a pretty good deal for $26 including tax and tip per person. It was a satisfying amount for four. 3/5 Rating: While the BBQ is very tasty, I'm not too picky about the quality of meats or the authenticity of the experience. I want to grill. I want to eat. I want to smell and enjoy my company. I've tried many of the other top-rated AYCE joints in the area and think the food there is comparable to Soowon Galbi, but you get more bang for your buck! Minus points for terrible parking, but what can you do right? It's K-Town. SOOWON GALBI vs. AYCE KBBQ - Better service (+) - Higher quality meats (+) - Less food (-) - More expensive (-) - Equally terrible parking (/) Overall, I would be more well-fed and equally happy with any other less-expensive restaurants in the area. Some aspects of dining are more important to me than others. Everyone to his/her own. Call me a value-eater who is happy to pay more when it's worthy.

I had high expectations because of the simple fact that SO many people could not be wrong. The restaurant looks like a winner on first glance but lacks the service to make it great. It seems that in MOST Korean restaurants if your not Korean you dont exist. Although we where seated quickly, not much happened after being handed the menu. Waiting, waiting and some more waiting. We ended walking out and eating across the street. Next time I should squint my eyes before I walk into a Korean Restaurant and speak in broken English, maybe then I would get some type of service.

4.5 rating - this place is excellent. I only took off points because our table had to ask a couple of times for water and I didn't get rice. That's no big deal, especially when it's a Laker Game night on a busy Thanksgiving weekend evening. The waitresses here are nice. The banchan was plentiful and tasty. Our dishes did not get cleared away quickly but it was a busy night. We got a lot of food with the package we ordered. We started by ordering an appetizer, the pajun (seafood pancake with egg). The package we ordered included two bottles of rice wine. This rice wine was unfermented and quite tasty but very strong. That's why I wanted water. I had to flush that out. The meats here (brisket, chicken, pork, etc) were not my favorite out of all the Korean BBQ establishments I've visited. The meats are very good but my trip to Ten-Raku in Korea Town years ago yielded the best meats, in my opinion. I ate a lot here. Our package was ginormous, to say the least. Kalbi, soups and a good amount of banchan. This is not an All You Can Eat restaurant but I was stuffed nonetheless. Toward the end of the meal, we were served the burnt rice soup. They served shikae (sweet tea) afterward. I almost put down a 4 star rating but I went with 4.5 because the servers were very nice on a busy night. Soowon has a couple of flat screen tv's. There's a framed William Blake poem in the ladies' bathroom. The restaurant offers valet parking.

I am a definitely a fan. From their wide variety of banchan to their great customer service, I think it is safe to say that this is my favorite Korean BBQ along with road to seoul. I arrived here, paid $2 for valet parking and got seated right away. Combo C seemed to be the right choice of meat and it came with a free beer/soju. ÊFor $59.99, I got beyond stuffed, and they let you take the left overs home. Not a bad price considering that the meat was high quality, you get a free alcoholic beverage, and they give you a ton of food. Definitely putting this as one of my favorites.

FORGIVE AND LET LIVE... Oh how I let you down Gilmok (aka Corner Place for the wide-eyes), will you ever forgive me? ÊI was just around the corner and did not visit you. ÊI did not lay in your supple bed of green onions and kimchi. ÊI know, I know, but don't hold it against me. ÊIt wasn't my fault. ÊJust look: Ê525 reviews and a rating of 4.5 stars. ÊThe temptation was just too strong and I was led down a path of disgrace. ÊI know you don't want to hear anymore, but let me just point out some of the amazing highlights of this night astray: - HER TINY NOOKS AND CRANNIES WERE AS CLEAN AS A WHISTLE Ê A well-earned "A" rating. ÊThese desired quality attributes are well hidden from the faade of motley surroundings outside. ÊParking probably the worst thing around - but the valet option will never let you down. ÊAnd for $2 - well worth not having to stress at all the wickedness outside. ÊThere are only 17 tables inside, so given there are ~5 million people in LA, expect a wait unless you come during the off-peak hours. Ê(helpful hint: Ê2:43 pm to be exact) - SHE SERVICED MY EVERY WHIM Staff come by every 5 minutes and cook your food (I have finally given in and let the experts cook for me without giving them the "leave-my-food-alone" evil eye). ÊThe dinner servers spoke near-perfect-English and would actually recommend dishes if asked (lunch servers are very helpful, but aren't as talkative). ÊService with a smile - what strange concept be this? ÊLost in translation within most K-Town abodes. - OH WHAT A VARIETY OF BANCHAN SHE PROVIDES Multiple platelets to tickle one's pallet will keep you asking for more and more. ÊOffered are varieties of kimchi, bean sprouts, and my favorites of Go Sah Ree (seasoned bracken fern stems), black seaweed (http://www.yelp.com/biz_É), and white seaweed (http://www.yelp.com/biz_É). ÊRice paper wraps, daikon wraps and mixed green salads are all standard fare. - SHE HAS A KARMA SUTRA OF KOREAN 101 Step-by-step instructions on how to flip one's shrimp and skewer one's tongue without sticking one's meat. - HOT COOKING OVER WOOD COALS Flavorings come from the diffusion of wooden embers which are assimilated into the variety of meats cooking above. ÊSomething that a gas flame cannot accomplish alone. ÊThis is the best way to heat one's nightly desires. - SHE POSSESSES UNFORGETTABLE MEAT By far this is the best thing around. Gilmok is known for the wet cold noodle. ÊSoonwon is known for the supple seasoned meat that melts in one's mouth. ÊThe house specialty Soo Won Wang Galbi (27.99) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_É) is the best Galbi I've had enter my mouth - perfectly seasoned and buttery smooth. Ê Stick with two orders of this and forego all other meats. ÊThe Kkot Sal (marbled sliced beef rib eye) (30.99) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_É) was good, but for the quantity, quality, and high expectations - I was not as impressed. ÊJoomuluk (sliced rib eye marinated in sesame oil) (22.99) was a bit more seasoned, but nothing can stand up to the Wang Galbi. While the above was far too much to partake in one night. ÊI feel that I will be led astray yet again. ÊFor I yet to consume the Yuk Hweh (seasoned beef sashimi with garlic, and asian pears) or the Hae Mui Pajeon (seafood pancake consisting of baby shrimp, octopus, squid, calamari, scallops, and green onions).

Last night, I had yet THE BEST Korean BBQ experience ever!! So I've been to Soowon before and I came back last night (smarter this time - we made a reservation! We came way late due to crazy rainy-friday-night traffic, but we called and they extended our reservation). Once we got there, it took them 5 minutes to prepare the table (the restaurant was packed with people waiting, but they honored our reservation & held our table). Since I had an all-star experience the last time, I came with high expectation. But last night, our server just went above and beyond just to make sure we're all happy (& returning) customers! He anticipated everything we need - made sure our side dishes were refilled pronto, bringing us the lettuce wraps (I don't think this is their standard side dish offering, but when we asked for them, he didn't hesitate), brought us "fresh out of the kitchen" new side dishes without us asking for them - he said he wanted us to try, filled up our dessert drink to the brim of the glass when my friend mentioned I love that stuff, even cooking for us almost the entire time. I'm not usually easily wow-ed, but, WOW! Now THAT's customer service! Oh yes, of course, the food was as great as ever. :) We ordered 2 marinated galbi, 1 beef tounge (extremely thin cut - the way I love it!) for the 4 of us. Soowon, you're now my number one favorite K BBQ spot! I can't wait to come back here...

Went here with a close friend since we were sick of AYCE and wanted some good quality meat. ÊSaw the good reviews for here so we took the risk. ÊWe came in at 10PM so there was only a few tables occupied. ÊWe got the marbled rib eye and two orders of marinated galbi. I don't think I can ever do AYCE again. ÊThe meat was amazing. ÊSo juicy and soft, the ribeye melted in my mouth and the galbi was some of the best I've ever had in LA. ÊThe charcoal grill makes a huge difference. The banchan was also really good and the deng jang even tasted better than other restaurants'. Ê I've tried both Genwa and here and would have to give meat quality to Soowon (but both are fantastic), but the overall building quality goes to Genwa. ÊBoth places had great service. ÊI would say Soowon is the more traditional Korean restaurant feel, while Genwa is a more Americanized Korean atmosphere. Soowon definitely deserves its high rating!

This is my go-to KBBQ place when I don't want AYCE and DO want quality meat and food. Their meat is tender. They have a variety of different side dishes that are all really good.

It's a little pricey but it's definitely worth it.

One of the best darn Korean BBQ's I've had in the states. I would say Soowon Galbi house tops almost all the BBQ's I've had in the state of CA, NY, and WA. And the price is just right. For about 6 of us, it came to about $32 per person w/ beverages. In the last few years I've been to Soowon, the price really hasn't gone up that up at all which I'm so grateful for. We ordered Soowon Wang Galbi, Chadol Gui and Sam Gyup Sal. The meats are very fresh and tender which made this dining experience spectacular. Banchans are delicious and they kept filling us up. The service was good when we went and the Dwenjang Chigae was excellent. The waitress was very attentive (but not overly) and walked by several times to check on our beverage refill needs. I can't wait for my next vacation. This will be one of the very first places to go eat again.

I've only been to Korean BBQ once before and I don't think I had the full experience. This time, I came with an experienced Korean BBQ-er and I LOVED it. I was a little worried about the vegetarian options, but the banchan (like a variety of little appetizer dishes) were all vegetarian. I'm not crazy about pickled stuff, but this was actually good. I loved the mixed green salad too. And you get free refills on the banchan and salad. For my entree, I got the Dolsom Bibimbab. I highly recommend this as a vegetarian option. I ate every bite. We also got the seafood pancake (Hae Mul Pajeon) to share and that was delicious (easy to dodge the chewy squid pieces -- I'm not a fan). We split a bottle of Soju (Iike Korean sake). The first sip tasted like Windex to me, but then it grew on me. I'd definitely do this again.

This was my first korean BBQ experience (I'm asian, and living in LA, so yes, pathetic), and my first thought after walking out of here was...wow KBBQ just made it on the top 10 list of foods I'd take to heaven with me. Ok in all seriousness though -the meat, tender and well-marinated. The banchan - plentiful in variety and flavor (the nut+smallfish thing = A++, I ate 3 containers worth by myself). The service- the illlest. I mean, theres a reason this place has so many reviews. They don't mess around.

Born and raised in Koreatown, I've been to one too many Korean BBQ restaurants. ÊSome have better quality meats, some have better service, and some have better side dishes. ÊI'm all for all you can eat dining too... but there's some things you just can't pay one set price for, especially when you're talking about quality meats. Ê Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ is all the above and more: the best meats, the best service, and the best side dishes. First off, their service is amazing. ÊUnlike other Korean BBQ restaurants who barely pay attention to the customers unless you ring the call bell, barely make it in time to switch the bbq grill before it's burning all the meat to a char, or whose waitresses speak to you in a loud and curt manner, Soowon's waitresses (and overall service) definitely make an impression. ÊThey're extremely friendly and nice, side dishes rarely run out without attention and if they do, they bring out more right away, and the grills are changed on time, always. Ê Their side dishes are great. ÊA huge selection of them, and they're all really good. ÊIt's not rare that you go to a korean restaurant and find a few side dishes that just don't satisfy your palate. ÊI've yet to find a side dish at this restaurant that isn't good. ÊI just feel really bad because they keep bringing more and more of the complimentary goodness when I go. ÊBut i can't help it! Ê Last and most importantly, the MEAT. ÊI've been to this restaurant several times already, and I usually get some unmarinated and some marinated meats. ÊWhat's funny is that at most Korean Restaurants, I really don't like the marinated meat, because it tends to be too sweet or too salty, or the quality is bad since they tend to mix the not-so-quality meats into the marinade. ÊNot at Soowon though. Êi LOVE their marinated meats, super savory with a hint of sweet, and super delicious! :D Êmakes me happy. ÊTheir meat is really good quality, you can just tell with the first bite. ÊEverything from texture to taste is amazing. Êi LOVE. ÊI think ive tried more than 10 different styles/types of meats here so far.. and everything's been excellent. Ê Yes, its a bit pricey compared to others, especially since there are many places in koreatown that offer all you can eat deals. But if you're talking Korean BBQ, you need quality meat. ÊAfter all, thats what you eat Korean BBQ for right? Meat? Ê Korean BBQ without good meats is a no-go. ÊTop that with their great side dishes and exceptional service.. i say Soowon Galbi is the best Korean BBQ around.

I had a visitors from new York so I been Looking for a best Korean BBQ place because he loves Korean food especially Korean BBQ which is not a all you can eat. So I bring him to soowon galbi. One of waitress set up the table for party of two and she got me a menu so I recommand him what's good in this restaurant. We been discussing for a while and now we finally made a decision what to take which is house special marinated galbi. We had a seriouly good time eating BBQ in soowon and my visitor told me that soowon is the best BBQ he ever had been before. So I promised him to go soowon in next time traveling LA.

I'm swooning over Soowon Galbi. Cute waiters and delicious food - what more could you want? Food: If you've ever done the Korean BBQ thing before, coming to Soowon will be a mix of all your favorites. The meal starts off with banchan (http://www.yelp.com/biz_É) with all the favorites including bean sprouts, spicy cucumber, salty seaweed, broccoli, fried potato pancake (http://www.yelp.com/biz_É), and potato. You also get a heaping helping of bottomless salad (http://www.yelp.com/biz_É). But let's face it. This place is all about the meat and they have plenty of it. We pigged out on components of two combos to save some moola. Since there were rather ravenous eaters present, I sampled the beef brisket (http://www.yelp.com/biz_É), pork belly (http://www.yelp.com/biz_É), beef AND pork belly (http://www.yelp.com/biz_É), and beef rib (http://www.yelp.com/biz_É). We also had chicken bulgogi but I didn't get to try it. And of course we got some soju with the obligatory hot girl on the bottle (http://www.yelp.com/biz_É). Delish. My only gripe is that the total came out to be a little more expensive than I anticipated. Atmosphere: This place is in a pretty small strip mall right by the street. There's a $2 valet at the front, but it's likely that you can find street parking as well. The interior is a bit cramped if you have a large party, but nice nonetheless. Not as fancy as "Cow Country" on 8th. One nice aspect of this place is that it doesn't seem to get as crowded as other locations. Ê Service: Why do I feel like all the waiters here are former or aspiring Kpop stars? Our waiter was super friendly and cute. All tables have the ridiculously convenient Korean button. Press. Wait. Ask. Get. Synopsis: This is now on my list of great KBBQ joints.

This place is a little bit of a hit and miss. The first time I went here I ordered take out and they were very prompt and very hospitable. The host wouldn't even accept the tip I tried to give her. I ordered the Galbi combo and it was $30. This place is a little pricey especially for a college student like me but it was worth every penny. The second time I went here the service was not quite as good. They were a little slow and didn't really speak much English so I could order my food okay but couldn't modify anything since she didn't understand. We ordered a coke which we had to ask for about 5 times before we finally got it. It's a little pricey and the service may vary depending on whose working but overall I give this place 4 stars since the food is absolutely delicious and the meat is very high quality.

This place is in a hidden corner on Vermont. It took forever to u-turn to get to this spot. I find parking in front of the office then some valet guy comes up and asks us if we were eating at the restaurant. I said yes. (mind you..i was super tired and cranky looking for this spot) He said you have to valet. I said why...there's parking right here ..where i already parked and got out of my car. He kept jibber jabbing and I said this place is closed therefore I can park here free of charge. Then he has the nerve to say tip me and you can park there..I said no and walked in. We're all trying to hustle but his game was whack! blah blah..we get in the place, which was very empty for a friday evening at 7pm. This place is exactly like shik do rak w.out the good sauces (no lemon juice) and sides but the jelly fish seafood side was AMAZING but that's all folks Pros: Large Restaurant Good for Groups Easy to get reservations Jelly fish seaweed Mah: Took forever to get sake Sauce Meat Cons: Parking Location Weird awkward cold vibe

5 stars for ban chan side dishes. Ban chan dishes were superbly prepared and really tasty. 5 stars for gal bi marinated ribs. The meat was oh so tender with right amount of marinade. 5 stars for yook hwae beef sashimi. The meat was so fresh and well seasoned. 4.5 stars for naeng myun.

Meat lovers: This is a great place to check out. They first start you with the salad, and slowly they will bring out the banchan: small dishes of condiments: the kimchi, pickled daikon, cucumbers, beanspout with sesame oil, slices of rice paper, soup, eggs, rice, And are replenished if empty. We ordered the Combo A plate The ribeye steak, unseason large beef short ribs, pork neck, pork belly, beef brisket, marinated sliced ribeye and shrimp. They served with high grade meat because it is so juicy and tender. The meat was grilled on charcoal which gives the meat a better taste. you can grilled the garlic, the yam, and mushrooms for extra taste Our waiter is awesome, very attentive, she cooks for you and serves you too. Great services!!

It is such a great alternative to eating bowls of rice.. 2. their meat is quality! it's NOT AYCE, but the portions are more than plentiful! We always get a dish each and always leave feeling full. 3. Sides heaven. and the service is great, always quick to replenish everything! 4. CLEAN. need i say more?

I brought a large party of 10 here for my pre-birthday dinner on a Saturday night. ÊThey gave us the semi-private area up-front that's separated from the waiting area by a half-wall. ÊIt was super-crowded in the restaurant, but being in that area seemed to keep the noise at bay. ÊThe woman who took my reservation was very nice and when we arrived, our tables were ready. ÊThe hostess who seated us told me to press a button on the wall when we were ready for our server. ÊSure enough, within seconds of the button being pressed, our server appeared! ÊSo efficient...! I ordered two COMBO Bs, which features: * Marinated Large Beef Short Rib * Sliced Rib Eye * Pork Neck * Seasoned Beef Rib Eye * Beef Brisket * Rice * Stew * Salad * Side Dishes * Choice of Soju, Beer or Soda (whichever choice you only get one bottle so you have to order more) They say that each Combo B is good for 4 people, but two orders was good for our party. ÊI love KBBQ. ÊI love it even more when I don't have to cook, esp on my birthday! ÊOur server/table-side cook was great!

Soowon Galbi didn't come through this time - like Din Tai Fung, it decided to get worse right at the time I recommended the place to my family by bringing them along. ÊSometimes I wish restaurants would pick a different time to have their bad days. Maybe we just seemed extra-super-white that day, but we got the blandest collection of banchan - not a spice to be found, nor an anchovy in the mix, or a single fish cake. ÊThey were still good, of course - I'm not sure what Korean restaurants put in their potato salad but it's the only potato salad I'll eat - just not something I can write anything about. ÊAlso, they didn't replace our empty banchan until we specifically asked - twice. Part of the problem was our fault for ordering both pork and beef bulgogi. ÊI wouldn't have done that, but I wasn't going to tell my family they couldn't order what they wanted. ÊFor me, the marinade was too sweet, particularly on the beef. We also got shrimp, which was my recommendation. ÊI think it was better than the meat simply because the way they butterflied it made it grill quick and tender, and the marinade was tasty, but it tasted a little bleachy and old under the flavoring. Also, we kept running out of rice paper. ÊThey initially brought us like 15 sheets for 6 people and then didn't come back. ÊWe had to keep asking for more, and then reminding them when it didn't come, and eventually we just gave up and started eating the meat alone without wrapping it. Two stars this time, but still a three star average. ÊI would be leery of returning. ÊI give restaurants a little more leeway to be inconsistent when they're cheap, but this place isn't, and so I think, "do I really want to spend $25-30 on a crapshoot?"

went to this place after i found out there was a hour wait for moodapo ii up the street. fuck moodaepo ii. i say that with the utmost respect, as i do enjoy all you can eat bbq. however, soowon takes a massive dump all over anything that moodaepo ii has to offer. ordered the pork belly, joomuluk, and soowon kalbi. after checking the prices and seeing that we only got 3 strips of pork for $18, i was ready to throw a fucking chair and give the hostess the rock bottom right through the grill. good thing i waited till i tasted the food. if my mouth could grow an erection, it would have. as soon as i bit into the pork i hallucinated of a carniverous utopia where bacon was a religion. and it kept getting better. joomuluk was up next, and even for lean chunks of meat, it was more tender than some of the filet mignon i've had. a generous portion was served and we didn't have to cook shit on our own even though we had a table top grill (which had smoky wood chips in it btw. fuck yeah.). the waiter was super attentive which is weird for k-town. usually our servers are assholes. we saved the best for last. the soowon kalbi came in BIG FUCKING STRIPS. i'm talking 4 inch wide strips. the marinade was perfect and didn't need any additional dipping sauce. the marbling on the meat itself was perfect. top notch beef was used and if you don't agree, i feel sorry for your mother. everything here was great. we ate pretty much all the banchan as well. for 3 people with 3 main dishes, a couple sodas, and a bottle of soju the tab came out to be around $115. totally worth it. this isn't all you can eat but i left pretty full and happy as hell. i'm writing this review out after a 2 day food coma from soowon, no lie.

I hate to be a party pooper, but I will be honest about this place. My girlfriend and I came to this place on a Friday night and our lady server was very inconsiderate and did not help us at all. After getting seated, I had to literally get up and find her to get our order after waiting for 15 minutes without anyone to help us. After that, it just got worse. She did not bring the side dishes until another 10 minutes later and did not offer to help cook the meat (not to mention she placed the meat behind our table so I had to move the meat table myself). It's little things like this.. I had to ask her to bring the rice and broth, which were supposed to be included with the combo meal. The meat was not marinated (which I do not like) and was not good quality. Just brisket and chicken. Plus, I had to get up and ask for our side dishes to get refilled too. It was not a busy night when we came either at 5pm so I do not see the problem. Quite the horrible experience and will not come back again. There are better services and kbbq elsewhere..

Me and a couple friends came here after a long day at sea (don't ask). There was a 30 minute wait to be seated, but it was a Friday. The prices were ridiculous, like $30 for Kalbi (feeds 2), but since it had a 4.5 star rating we decided to try it. I think we got off on the wrong foot with the waitress because she just wasn't having it. To be fair, me and one of the other guys were pretty drunk. We were asking her how to say things in Korean like 'thank you' and I'm pretty sure she was teaching us curse words. We ordered Galbi, Bulgogi, and Jumulleok. It was hands down the best Korean bbq I've had. Although the waitress hated us she did come back every 5 minutes to make sure the meat was cooking well and cut it up for us. The side-dishes were also top-notch. They were served in tiny little portions but the waitress brough refills regularly. Except for the mushrooms, she said no refill on mushroom, which was pretty weird b/c the mushrooms were probably the cheapest sidedish. They also had a bunch of a korean wines along with the regular assortment of drinks and a handful of beers. A+ would buy again.

This is the best korean BBQ experience I've had. I went with a friend on a Friday at around 6 and waited for about 30 minutes. We got the combo D (pork belly, beef brisket, chicken bulgogi + side dishes and a bottle of soju) and asked if we could substitute for the chicken bulgogi. They let us get the beef bulgogi instead. What you get doesn't seem like a lot but it was enough to satisfy us. The servers are super prompt and basically cooked everything for us. It's not that we didn't want to cook it, but our server was so prompt he was around every 30 seconds or so to turn our meat or add more. When the soju came, he brought us a lemon and used the cap of the soju bottle to make a hole in the lemon and squeeze the juice out! My friend and I had a really great time. The nice modern atmosphere and yummy meat really made my night. My experience was so much better than those AYCE bbq restaurants where I feel like I have to stuff myself silly, eat more ice cream, and end up regretting it afterwards! Parking was valet, but very cheap.

Best meat quality. ÊI feel for these non-AYC KBBQ places, the cooking technique becomes especially paramount because if you F it up, it's virtually game over. Thankfully, our main server did an excellent job and the Korean pop star-like side servers were very attentive to replenishing our side dishes. ÊMan...I wish I could have cool hair-dos like them. Even though the meat quality easily surpasses even that of ÊPark's KBBQ's unmarinated "Kobe" Beef I'd still prefer an AYC KBBQ joint in the end like Gui Il Bun Ji BBQ or Tahoe Galbi. But if you are a KBBQ fan, I think it's necessary to come to a place like this at least once to be cognizant of great meat quality.

When I leave the house to eat, I want someone to cook for me. ÊIf I have to barbecue my own food at a restaurant, I might as well stay and home. Luckily, this place will bring the food to you cooked. ÊNo need to break a sweat over the coals. ÊThey will also bring you an astonishing array of side dishes (banchan) that varies every day (the spinach is full of iron-y goodness and the sprouts were full of good crunchy flavor). ÊWe opted for the vegetable bibimbap and the beef rib eye and the two of us ate like the queens we are plus had enough leftover for my breakfast the next day. Ê(Mmmm, nothing like hot spicy food to start the day!) Ê Ê This place delivers more than a meal, it's an event. ÊGreat place to come with a group of friends or as two couples so you can try lots of different foods.

ÊAfter the meal, they bring a small glass of "fruit juice" which is syrupy and not to my taste at all but my girlfriend downed hers and mine.

I often hear stories about how Cham Soot Gul, a local AYCE KBBQ restaurant isn't that great, but it's the best in the area. And then we get to Soowon Galbi. This visit was thankfully paid for, but even still the combo was $100, and sure it may have tasted great, but the amount of meat was definitely not worth $100. It was over-priced, over-hyped, and over-full of itself. Now at least when I was at Cham Soot Gul I'd be full when I left. And I mean, sure, going with about 14 other people to Soowon Galbi didn't help matters very much, but I found that at the end of the dinner, I was craving more meat, only to realize that we had no more money to spend on more food. FINAL SUMMATION: Next time I'm going AYCE in K-Town, I can't do KBBQ that's over-priced.

Just called to try to make a reservation for 3 people, because I know the wait can be long. ÊMy father who has never experience a korean bbq place has been looking forward to trying this restaurant I once gave a 5 star rating... However, upon calling the restaurant a server answered the phone... while he spoke english he had some comprehension problems. ÊHe told me that they couldn't take a 3 person reservation on a Sunday evening at 530pm because they were booked for reservations between 6-8pm... Clearly that makes no sense, so when i asked him to explain why, this is where the comprehension was poor... or maybe it was an act.. I'm not sure... but he couldn't give me a reason why. ÊThen after speaking to someone else... all of a sudden within a span of 15 secs... they all of a sudden had a reservation for 15 people at 530p.. Êwhen I asked why he didn't say that before.. again.. I'm not sure if its a comprehension problem or an act.. he couldn't tell me why... Ê Honestly, I'm extremely disappointed because I really do like this place.. however, you can't run a business using servers to answer the phone and have them tell your customers various conflicting stories as to why they can't make a reservation for 3 then expect them to happily come to this restaurant to wait for a table...

I feel really bad saying this, but 5 star for quality and taste of meat and food, but 2 stars for service!!!!! The restaurant is small, so I had to wait about 30 minutes on a Tuesday night. The staff was very courteous to the waiting customers. But once we sat down, the staff was super hard to hail down. We waited 5 minutes to get water, 10 minutes to order our food, another 10 minutes to get our appetizer dishes, another 5 minutes to get our meat, then 15 minutes to get tongs/scissors and someone to cook the meat for us, and we just never got dessert after asking for it..... They were able to stop us while we were leaving to tell us sorry they didn't deliver our dessert because they ran out. If that was the case, they should've definitely told us earlier. Food wise though, everything was delicious. I would recommend their galbi, bulgogi, and brisket. The bimbimbap was also very very good. It is served in a wider flatter stone pot, instead of a deep one, so you get tons more crispy rice on the bottom. yum!!!!! SOOO despite the great quality meats, I don't think I would come back. There are many other places in ktown to fill my hungry belly.

Mmmm!!!! Some friends and I came here to celebrate a friend's birthday. We had a total of 12 people, down from the original party of 16 that we made a reservation for. The restaurant happily obliged with our request and changes throughout the day. Upon arrival, we gave the car to the valet attendant. I think my friends said that it was approximately $3-4 for valet parking. Nice. We didn't have to wait very long for our table, which was great. We were split into 2 tables in a private area to the right of the hostess table. We decided that we'd have a separate bill for each table so as to minimize confusion over the bill later. For my table of 6 people, we ordered the beef tongue and pork belly in addition to combination A for the table-side BBQ. I was a little disappointed that the salad only came once, whereas at other Korean BBQ places, I've had a great helping of salad to enjoy with my meat. Nevertheless, the salad was good, not great-- It was somehow different than what I'm used to. Where are the diagonally sliced green onions?? Hmmm. I thoroughly enjoyed the banchan though. The mayo grapes were different though. I've also never had the little rolls of rice cake. Those were the only two that really stuck out to me as being unique to the restaurant here. With our combination A order, we also ordered a bottle of sake and two large bottles of beer. Yeah, I know, it was kind of a bad idea to mix our alcohol. We definitely paid for it later. The meat selection was delicious. I was a little disappointed in the pork neck though. They were small and not as tasty as I remembered them to be at other restaurants. Plus, they didn't give us the long kimchi for the pork belly... I had to order it. I'm guessing it's because of the cabbage shortage in the world. ÊIn addition to that, it didn't come with raw garlic slices and onions either. What?? Blasphemy! Sadly, I decided to let that go. I was also surprised that our server hadn't asked if we wanted cold noodles or miso soup after our meal... Isn't that the tradition? Instead, we got a dessert drink that tasted mildly of ginger and cinnamon sugar. Yum. My friend said that she liked that our server actually cooked the meat for us. I didn't know that that wasn't common at Korean BBQ places, so kudos to our server. For the few shortcomings of the restaurant, I'm giving them a 4.5-star review.

This is the BEST KBBQ i've had!!! Not because the marinade was special or anything, but because the quality of the meat is delicious!!! I always order the BRISKET and the SLICED RIBEYE! The ribeye is deliciously marbleized and it is so buttery when you eat it! Their selection of side dishes is not as large as many other kbbq joints, but I am OBESSED with the "spinach" (I don't think it's actually spinach but I don't know the name of what it is), bean sprouts, kimchi, and rice paper so I don't really need many sides. It's a bit pricier than many other places in KTown, but it's well worth it. They even have combo dinners that include a beer! If you like a lot of variety in side dishes this may not be the place for you BUT the meat is scrumptious (that's what she said) and fresh so it's definitely worth a try! The service is also excellent. The servers are attentive and they often cook the meats for you (although the lowered requirement to lean over the fire won't save you from smelling when you leave). They also put pieces of charcoal in their burner so there's a great char flavor in the meats!

This has got to be the best Korean BBQ place I've ever tried. You will not be disappointed, food is fantastic, service is flawless! Valet your car for 2 bucks and hop in for some great grub and soju, hite, or ob! No need to worry about people messing with your ride here. They have attendants to handle that. Sit down and let the Galbi and soju scent woft through your nostrils.... ahhhh!

My friends and I were in K-town and wanted to find a really good kbbq place... a place that was different from what we can get in orange county so we checked yelp and saw all the great reviews so we knew we had to come here. This place is , without a doubt the best kbbq ive ever had. It gets pretty packed here though so be prepared to wait. The quality of the meats is sooo good here and all their side dishes are also really good. Everything is very fresh and delicious here. The quality of the meat is amazing. The service here was really good they even occasionally come by and grill some of the meats for you and our server was really nice and helpful. I will for sure come back to this place whenever im in the area!

It's been a while since I've found a place worthy of a five star review but by golly gee willickers - this place deserved every single one of them. We ordered the Combo C and it came with plenty of food and soju for two hungry grown-ups and one heffette (me). It included sliced beef, marinated galbi, intestines and the most awesomely thick pork belly slices I've ever had the pleasure of drooling over at a Korean barbecue. But... intestines? What a waste of stomach space! As a carnivore - I want meat, dammit! We subbed the intestines for more sliced beef instead and they accommodated our request without a single death stare. Beautifully sliced, fine cuts of beef arrived at our table and we got to sit around and blab at each other while our Korean-mom waitress lovingly cooked for us. I wanted to hug her and pinch her cheeks! Everything tasted juicy and absolutely delicious - especially after I wrapped it with the rice wrappers or thin radish slices and dipped it in the chili sauce. Banchan replaced promptly on request. The diced, crunchy cucumber was my favorite. Not only was the food and service superb (or "supurb" as Frank would put it) but their bathroom was immaculately clean. Who doesn't appreciate a clean bathroom? Ê:) I can't wait to come back and pig out some more. (And go potty.) P.S. Parking is valet unless you get lucky like I did and find a spot on the street. .

My friends and I had been craving KBBQ for a while, and I found this place on Yelp brimming with 5 star reviews. I told them we should go here instead of Chosun, so we all agreed. Driving up to the place was interesting. Most places in K-town are seedy looking and a bit ghetto, but my friend and I were lucky to find a parking spot right up front. We walk in and the restaurant is very clean, bright and doesn't smell completely smoky. Yay, my hair and clothes won't stink! We sit down and the 5 of us start to order. Combo A, seafood pancake and some beer. Soju came with the comb, but soju is not one of my fave drinks. I mostly drank some beer, but I was really there for the food. Combo A ($99) had brisket, beef ribs, beef sirloin, pork neck, marinated beef sirloin and soup. My fave was the brisket cuz it was thin and not chewy. I found some of the sirloin too chewy for me. The pork neck was surprisingly good, although I am not a fan of pork, ok, except for BACON. I think Chosun still has better quality beef though. OMG.. the banchan came out and I was sooo thrilled! Bean sprouts, broccoli, radish, seaweed, kimchee, pancake, and some other stuff I don't know what the names are. My faves were the seaweed, bean sprouts and the pancake. We had 2 of everything for the 5 of us. I also liked the lettuce salad they gave us. Goes well with the meat. It makes you feel less guilty about ingesting all this cow. Speaking of meat, the rice papers were awesome. Those are another must have to eat at KBBQ. Oh, and the soup was pretty good too. Seafood pancake was delicious! I love octopus and calamari. It was just a wonderful accompaniment to our meal. Would I come back? Yes, for sure. At $25 per person for insane amounts of food, this is def worth the drive. ÊJust remember to wear your stretchy pants. And put your hair up so it doesn't smell like meat. *pix*- http://pandaliciousformeÉ

This is def one of the best korean bbq places i've been to. I came here for lunch on a Saturday afternoon and it was quite empty. I'd say the banchan was just average but the quality of the meat was good. We order the galbi and brisket. We got two orders of each, split amongst four people, and we were all stuffed. The place was much cleaner than some of the other bbq places in ktown (with the exception of the restroom). The service was great. The waiter was super attentive and came to check on us frequently. I would definitely recommend the place if you're not looking for an all-you-can-eat type joint.

Since moving back to LA I've long anticipated a return to Koreatown for another round of bbq. The reputation of Soowon Galbi has been ringing loud and clear with stellar reviews across the board on Yelp. I decided to make a visit with Yelp buddy Tony Y. Jr. as we were both looking for an impressive feast. Since they were not taking reservations, we managed to get on their waiting list while we were on the road and quickly seated upon arrival with a flood of people patiently waited by the door. The dcor was very clean with a soundless ventilator above each table of which were equipped with a shiny gas grill in the middle. The smooth fluorescent blue lighting above our spacious leather seats brought a younger, trendier atmosphere to set them apart from those that embody a working class persona. I did not do my homework ahead of time and was bummed to learn that they do not offer AYCE bbq. However, their 10-item complimentary banchan was impressively assembled with kimchi, marinated white seaweed, tofu, glazed potatoes, tiny Korean pancake, cucumber, radish, fruit salad, fish cake, and broccoli. The selections and quality were not as impressive as Ondal 2 but the marinated white seaweed and fish cake really stood out as I had to ask for repeats several times. We ordered a plate of Marinated Galbi ($25.99) and Marinated Bulgogi ($17.99). I initially wanted to try their Rib Eyes as it had been raved on Yelp but the server suggested Bulgogi as the better gateway dish to try. The marinated meat was very flavorful and tender. We had several servers who came by to grill our meat at the table which I thought took away the fun of grilling it ourselves. While the thick pieces of tender juicy deboned glabi were outstanding, I also thought the bulgogi was really fatty and overcooked. The quality of the meat on both plates was on the fatty side and no better than the nearby restaurants that offer AYCE meals. The complementing dduk wrappers were less refined than the ones at Shik Do Rak, the originators of such product, but they more than made up for it by introducing their own razor thin radish wrappers which I find it innovative and a major hit. The choice of siracha as their hot sauce was quite generic, but the salad was nicely shredded to which added a pleasant element of freshness once the meat and wrappers were carefully assembled with my skinny steel chopsticks. Even though they were super busy, service was fantastic and very attentive. Overall, I thought the fatty meat quality did not justify the steep price, but the strength of Soowon is anchored in their collections of banchan to ways they go about to tenderize their meat. Portion-wise, it was very solid as we were also entertained with a bowl of beef soup and steamed rice. However, I didn't feel this particular experience was necessarily better or different from the nearby AYCE restaurants, which further castes doubt about whether Soowon is truly 5 stars superior to the rest. Not yet a fan, 3.5 stars for the overall experience.

Last weekend, during peak dinner hours our party of 4 had just sat down and gotten our drinks here when we heard a stampede of footsteps toward the back of the restaurant followed by several screams. I looked over just in time to see TWO LARGE RATS running across the the floor between the two rows of booths in the back. One customer crouched on her seat and whimpered while the rest of the customers appeared to be confused. We quickly paid for our drinks and left. Granted, most restaurants in korea town probably have a critter or two running around - but it's different when you actually see one on the premises!

Screw AYCE. Really, throw it out the window if you truly care about flavor and taste and service. Service - very strange for a KBBQ restaurant. Meaning, it's actually very friendly and attentive! Also they will gladly grill and cut the meat for you if you'd like! (Or show that you don't know what you are doing.) And they are still friendly about it. BBQ - charcoal grills. Good ventilation. Place - typical cheap $2 valet. Not too hard to find. Clean and spacious atmosphere. Meat - a-m-a-z-i-n-g-! You really pay for what you get for. The various meats are all well marinated, and usually tender. The tongue is also very tasty, but galbi and bulgogi was as well!! Everything was tasty!! Banchan - the side dishes were all great. It's hard to bring attention to these despite them being delicious since the meats were so standout already. If you love KBBQ and don't mind spending a bit extra over a typical AYCE price, go go go here! You won't regret it. Quality over quantity, for sure.

Soowon makes me swooon (like the anagram?) with the finest cuts of meat that I've ever seen hit a Korean BBQ grill. ÊThe Galbi was well marinated and the amount of marbling in their short ribs was plain ridiculous. ÊAll it took was a little bit of grilling to create the most succulent bites of Galbi I've ever tasted. ÊWe also had the Sam Gyub Sal (thick sliced pork belly) which was just straight up porky goodness in its simplest form. ÊAs if this wasn't enough, our table also ordered a bowl of Kimchi Chigae and the Hae Mul Pajeon. ÊBoth were excellent, and don't be dissuaded by the chigae's devil red color. ÊIt was perfectly savory/sour and I didn't find it to be as spicy as it looks. ÊThrow in no less than a dozen different banchan Ê(the steamed egg is my favorite) and you're in for one heck of a meal. Now Chicago Korean restaurants are known to have terrible service, and I'm not sure if that reputation is the same in L.A. ÊIn either case, I found our waitress to be very attentive and she did a great job in making sure we didn't overcook any of those succulent cuts of beef and pork. ÊI'll add a caveat that my coworker is Korean so I let her do most of the talking while I stuffed my face. ÊOverall I had a great experience and would definitely come back again.

I finally got to come here last night after my uncle's family who just arrived from overseas was craving for Korean bbq, his kids definitely know where to take him and as a cousin, whooppee I got invited and again, that means, another FREE MEAL for me! Score! It was pretty late, around 9ish, not so many people on a weekday, but I was definitely looking forward to this meal. Heard a lot of good stuff from here. Yes, I know it's not AYCE, but that's what made me curious of what so different about them. I realized one thing different in the ban-chan, it was the radish sheet wrapper, I'd never seen that anywhere else, that's pretty neat. We ordered Galbi, Brisket, and Tongue. I must say all the meats were great, not a fan of Galbi, but the quality of the meat was really nice. I would come back for its brisket. The ban-chan was plenty, our big table for 6 not even enough for them to spread out. And the best part, they cook the meat for us so for sure, we're going to get the best out of it, because they always told us when the meat was done, so we were ready to devour them. Very friendly service and the fact that they cooked the food for us was awesome. This was the third kbbq joint that does this service, other than Park's and Chosun Galbee. I would definitely compare them to Park's for the quality of meat, but Soowon won over, due to its nicer place and great ventilation system. Although I came out smelling like KBBQ, it wasn't too the extreme. Valet parking is just $2, but I found street parking right in front of it. Overall, this is one great dining experience, I'll be back for sure.

ÊAs usual valet parking at KBBQ places and as always I recommend street parking. Ê We ordered galbi, brisket and bori cha. ÊThe lady said ok but gave us coke instead of the tea. ÊBanchan was pretty tasty: kimchi, brocolli, fish cake, sweet potato (me like), seaweed, raddish, pancake and 2 other items I can't remember. ÊThey also give you salad, 2 dipping sauces, garlic & jalapeno and miso sauce. ÊOrder rice and you'll get spicy sour soup too. I liked the galbi more than brisket. ÊOverall the meat was ok. ÊI still prefer Soot Bull Jeep and Chosun Galbi for KBBQ. Ê3.5 stars for Soowon Galbi. Soowon Galbi is yummylicious!! ÊHappy New Year!!

I sort of smell quite delicious after walking out of this fantastic place... well my clothes and hair I think have appreciated it most as they both absorbed and hoarded every fume of fantastic that went on in here. Ambiance wise, I prefer Chosun for an upscale Kbbq experience (smitten w/ their patio), but the service and food quality here was absolutely outstanding. It is only because of KBBQ that I need to come to terms w/ the fact that I'll never turn vegetarian. We were served a fantastic house salad (I want the recipe to that insane dressing), then some terrific banchans (reminded me of how much I've frequented way too many mediocre kbbq places on the westside as of late... why even bother!) The banchan selections were absolutely impressive, as we were thrown down an abundance of Êfreshly prepared, superbly seasoned and flavored... like the sort of nonsense I have dreams about level of tastiness. Highlights were the cucumber kimchee, which I got seconds for and the veggie pajeon. And the caramelized sweet potato cubes. And the bean sprout salad. And the marinated broccoli. Wow did I pig out and the entrees hadn't even arrived. We ordered the Kalbi special as well as the marinated chicken. So much food for 2 people! Next time I'll be sure to order one meat, then one grilled veggie platter if dining for two. In addition, we ordered the gosul bibimpap which was excellent. Our waitresses were entirely pleasant, attentive, were constantly checking on us, were really proactive on watching our meats being prepared and providing us with constant banchan replenishment. Highly important. ÊAnd just when you thought this couldn't get any better... ÊRice wrappers were involved for your wrapping pleasure. Ê Ê Washed down with a few glasses of Hite - I think I could use a nap and hibernate for the next 6 months. ÊAnd have real happy dreams.

Not bad! I actually liked their Korean bbq here. I wish they were a bit flexible with some choices of meats on the combination menu. ÊMy bf and I ordered the D. It came with cha dol, san gyup ssal, and chicken bbq. However, I'm not a huge chicken bbq fan. ÊOh well. Service: 3.5 stars. They are awesome with service. They can't hear you call for them? Just ring the bell! I love that obnoxious bell. Just don't abuse it. Êwhile we were cooking our meat, I kept telling my bf that they still haven't given us our daenjang chigae and our egg jjim. ÊFinally, it came when an ajuma found we didn't have any and muttered something about how we waited so long. ÊI'm glad she noticed. Also, the way they cook the food for us annoyed us a lot. ÊI don't like my pork belly touching my beef and I don't like my chicken bbq touching anything else either. ÊThey really love mixing things around. ÊTowards the end, I just started to get disgusted. Food & Quality: 3.5 stars. Food is clean, quality is good and it's the perfect amount of food. ÊHowever, the banchan...I noticed how some of them were too salty and some were too sweet. The salad was eh. I'm a green onion girl. I love green onions, but this was salad wasn't what I was looking for. I will probably return again.

With over 250 reviews, I highly doubt my review will make much of a dent for Soowon Galbi, but I felt I had to add my 2 cents' worth purely due to the fact that we had such a great meal there. Two of my best friends (and longest friends -- both over 25 years and counting) were with me -- they have only met once 20 yrs ago -- for a wonderful weekend in LA and this was where we ended up for dinner one of those nights. We had to wait a little while for a table, but it wasn't too long. Once seated, I immediately knew what I wanted to order! We got chadol, jumulluk and their house special galbi. The banchan arrived and we were on them like a hawk on its prey -- we were so incredibly hungry and just pounced. The meat arrived shortly and soon enough, the servers were helping us cook the meat on the grills. The only issue we had was the ventilator system not working all that well. At one point, BFF asked the cute server dude if the vent was on. He did a little cute listening motion and then said "yes it's on". So funny. All the meats were really good quality hence the wonderful flavors. Banchan was good, but the variety wasn't as fab as some other places I've been to. This isn't AYCE so you won't find some things like the egg stew, but at the end of the meal, I asked for 'noroongji' the burnt rice soup and when they brought it, they also brought a little pot of daengjangjigae for us to eat the noroongji with. We were so stuffed at the end and they still brought us a little cup of 'shikhae' as well. For $28 each tax and tip included, we had a really fantastic meal and the service wasn't bad either. We were always happy when the cute server dude came around to help us out!! 4.5 stars!

***400th Review*** Ê Don't get your meat from the same place you get your bread! Eat KBBQ! 3.5 Stars. Chose to celebrate my 400th review at this highly rated KBBQ place with good friends and fellow yelper, who was also celebrating a yelp milestone (Yelp Mate Maggie C). I wish I could give it five stars. I, as most know, am a very generous yelper. I just could not go past 3.5 Stars. I must have come on the wrong day! Banchan?? Better at Chosun, Soot Jeep, and Road to Seoul. I have to say that I was expecting a lot more. The quality was decent, but far from the best. 3.5 Stars. Meats..AOK. Brisket was not the best but ok. Galbi was a little too sweet for me. The quality was fine. 3.5 Stars. Service.. AOK-3 Stars. Question.. How do you confuse Coke with Bori Cha. Bori Cha PLEASE! Parking- SUCKS. With so many good KBBQ places in the area, I doubt I will come back. Even if I came on a bad day, this place will have to wait sometime before I return. This was a first for me.. the first time I left meat on the grill, ever! Good thing I was surrounded by good company. Otherwise, This review might have one less star. Nothing like eating KBBQ with good friends!

Even though I'm all grow'd up, my mommy and daddy (mainly my mom) still love to baby me; telling me to get enough sleep, exercise, Velcro my shoes, zip up my fly, put on my helmet--you know, the usual stuff. Ê Their latest obsession? ÊHave me eat less red meat. ÊME! Oh, Ma. ÊYou and your old fashioned sensibilities. ÊThis is just like the time you INSISTED on chaperoning me on that date and kept whacking my hand with a ruler every time I tried to hold my date's hand. Ê(You know, the bruise is still there, and it's been a week already.) Well, anyway, being the respectful and dutiful son, I attentively listened to EVERY SINGLE WORD my mom said as I drove us to dinner the night before they went on a trip. ÊNodding my head pensively while trying to keep my eyes on the road--not an easy thing to do when my helmet kept slipping down over my eyes (yeah, I forgot to tighten the straps again). ÊI think I saw a faint upturn of the corner of her lips as the thought of her youngest finally beginning to "understand" made her joyous. Ê Right up to the point where I turned into the driveway of Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ. Ê(Hey, I said I listened, I didn't say I was going to obey.) I think I heard my dad snicker, but I was too busy trying to sell them on the idea that high quality meat, albeit red, was actually good for your body--especially now that I am training for Mr. Universe, that I really didn't pay that much attention. ÊSighing with marked resignation (but I know she was laughing on the inside), she conceded and gave me(at) another chance. ÊI also promised her I would not eat red meat until they returned from their trip. We ordered combination B (marinated beef rib, beef ribeye, pork neck meat, marinated beef sirloin, beef brisket, bean paste stew, and, of course, soju), and chop chae. ÊThey brought everything out at once and cooked most of the meal for us, which was over real charcoal--I just had to feign moving the meat around and not burn myself. ÊAnd, most importantly, scarf down the meat with the duk (rice "paper") as fast as humanly possible while my mom pontificated how important it is to eat lots of protein if I wanted to grow up big and strong. Oh, how hard it is not to gloat when you're right. Needless to say, service was top notch, and one of the waiters even spoke fluent Mandarin, which made my parents happy as it was so unexpected in a real Korean restaurant, and laughed at my three words of Korean. As my parents aren't going be back until after New Year, I'm thinking I'll have plenty of time to come back here at least once and still purge the smoky charcoal flavor that will permeate my clothes....

The moment you walk into Soowon you know you're in for a treat. ÊFirst off they have this really hot hostess with a quirky personality working the front of the store. ÊUsually I'm skeptical of these type of places but all my worries were dispelled when they brought out the meat. We ordered a combo B between 5 people which included brisket, marinated galbi, thin sliced dekkle, pork neck meat, and soup. ÊThe meat, presented on a glistening white platter, looked delectably fresh and finely marbleized. ÊThe pork neck meat was a real surprise as I have never had that cut of the swine. ÊIt is much richer and more sinful than the classic pork belly. ÊThe meat literally melts in your mouth. ÊCouple this with some kimchi fried on the pan, and you have a flavor explosion of unparalleled heights. Ê(make sure you ask for the fermented kimchi, special just for the pork) Have a bit of soju with your meal and you will be rolling yourself out of the restaurant in sheer ecstasy. ÊReally rolling.

This is my favorite Korean BBQ hands down! First of all I want to note that I've been to Korean BBQs in New York, San Francisco, San Jose, Garden Grove and various other OC cities and of course Los Angeles. The impression through visiting all these places have been from dull to absolutely stunning. Soowon blows me away with its elegant interior and absolutely opulent atmosphere. The quality was worth every penny and I usually take the time to stop by once or twice a month to cure my feigning for high quality bbqing. With high grade cuts of kalbi this place is a must for any true korean bbq lover. For me when I'm dieting down, inhaling large portions of meat is one of my tricks to get me to quickly drop weight for whatever event or occasion is in the near future and so I LOVE korean BBQ. Its my secret trick to enduring some brutal dieting! When you want quality, ambiance, decor and a memorable night starting with good food I recommend this place highly. I can only think of one place in Northern California that is as nice and it doesn't serve Korean BBQ!!!! So without much further ado I leave my highest rating ever for a korean bbq restaurant!

I think I mentioned this in some other review but I'll say it again...I'm extremely picky when it comes to Korean BBQ, I don't like eating at AYCE places because I prefer quality over quantity. ÊI also don't wanna risk getting gout from stuffing my face with cheap meat and soju. ÊI like places like Chosun, Genwa, etc. ÊSo when I found Soowon Galbi on Yelp, I had to convince the hubby to take me. ÊHe's a kalbi lover and I told him he would not be disappointed since that's their specialty. ÊWe went there on a Friday night. ÊThe restaurant was small, smokey, and packed, there was a wait but it wasn't a long one. ÊI sat at the front waiting for 5 mins then went outside for some fresh air and my hair and clothes were already reeking of bbq'ed meat smell. ÊDo NOT plan to go anywhere after, you will stink. ÊI think we only waited for about 10 minutes for a table. ÊThe service was extremely fast, friendly, and efficient, just the way I like it. Here's what we ordered: -Soo Won Wang Galbi: they were perfectly marinated and flavorful, the meat was tender and juicy, really really great quality beef. -Sam Gyub Sal: I'm a huge fan of pork belly but these were just ok. ÊI wouldn't order them again if I come back. Ê -Galbi Tang: SO good, the soup was delicious and the short rib was tender and the broth was tasty. The side dishes were really good, I liked their kimchi a lot. ÊI would definitely return and maybe try one of their combos next time since we weren't that hungry when we went. ÊParking is valet in their tiny lot and they stack park your car super close to other people's cars, I would recommend circling around to try to find street parking first before pulling in.

Decent Korean BBQ. Got to eat here for a family get together. One person in our family doesn't like any other asian food except Korean BBQ so he recommended to come here to eat. Surprisingly it was pretty decent. The food was good and the service was even better. If you are a meat eater and you are in the area looking for some KBBQ please do not hesitate.

Soowon Galbi KBBQ is the current "hot" KBBQ place in Los Angeles' K-Town. There are a lot to choose from, but this is the current Chi-Chi place people are flocking toward. And for good reason, as the decor is new and modern, they cook at your table with real wood charcoals, and they have a huge amount of meat selections, both raw and unflavered, and marinated. There is always a line now, especially on the weekends. 2 friends and I came here on a recent Saturday night, about 6:30. We waited about 15 - 20 minutes for a table. There is valet parking in a small lot, but we found the one stall that wasn't part of the valet system, so we saved a couple of bucks, with a nod from the Valet. Otherwise, parking can be a bit of an issue. Even on the street is a bit of a challenge on a busy Saturday. We ordered Pork Bellies (came out like 3 huge slabs of bacon, enough for Shaquille O'Neil to be satisfied) which were perhaps 70% fat. Too fatty for me, personally, and my freinds, who work out daily, didn;t really go for it. Also Galbi (aka Kalbi) which instead of the strips with small bones in it, this was a large bone with a rolled hunk of meat dangling from it. Also we had the Rib Eye, as I recall, unseasoned. These slabs of meat are large, and they throw them on the grill and scissor cut them after they start cooking. The banchan was great, tasty and a good selection. However, they served small korean won-ton type squares, which were hard to separate from each other, and we stuffed these with a piece of meat, sort of like a Korean Potsticker. I have wrapped the meat in lettuce at some KBBQ places, but never this way. It was good, but technically challenging even for the best chopstick experts! It gets pretty smoky in here, so I wouldn't recommend it on the first date, as she will probably not appreciate the BBQ perfume afterwards in her hair and clothes! The service was spotty, as they were super busy, and forgeting us, and it took several tries to get more wonton wrappers, water, etc. The sweet Mama-san doesn't speak much English, so we had to try and flag down the next generation for help. We ordered rice at the beginning, for example, and got it at the very end of our meal. They don;t have assigned tables per server, they simply roam up and down the aisles and help cook and serve wherever it is needed, so you may have 2 or 3 people helping you, which theoretically sounds good, but it lacked continuity and accountability, ergo, our less than stellar service. The bill was $72.50, and that is with just water to drink, no booze, sodas, desserts, or sides beyond the banchans. So a bit pricey, but if you love meat and smoke, this is the spark after dark!

Came here for my anniversary with K after work and was delighted. This is a refreshing upgrade from all those all-you-can-eat places I usually frequent. The service is fantastic (especially at dinner) and they even told us that if they weren't fast enough to cook and serve us, they'd get in trouble. (So don't try to help them flip the meat, haha) The galbi was definitely my favourite but everything else I tried was fantastic as well. (They kept asking if we were sure we could finish 4 orders- we showed them! *burp*) The quality of meat was so impressive and the price really wasn't that expensive considering what you're eating and the full service. I know I'm always "that person", you know, the one stuck cooking while everyone else is scrapping the salad bowl and peeling rice papers. This is a nice change! Banchan was generous and delicious as well and no problems in refills. ÊParking is annoying because Ktown, duh, but they do offer valet if you can't find street or space in their tiny lot. Not too crowded at lunch so you might try that too if you're in the area. Love the meat, love the service, no complaints except the drive!

Being from Seattle, where there is no such thing as all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ, that was definitely on our list for the weekend we spent in LA. Imagine our absolute sadfaces when I yelped all night only to find out that the only AYCE KBBQ with daeji bulgogi on the menu in reasonable busing distance was closed on Sundays. Heartbreaking. So instead, we made it our task to go to the highest rated. And we did. If the average after 200+ reviews is a 4.5, it's probably for a reason, right? It totally is warranted, because Soowon is my heaven on earth. We had a half hour wait, but that was fine because LA was only ~81* as opposed to the triple-digits we'd been hitting in Seattle... I'm surprised we were so lucky! As soon as we were seated I ordered two plates of the spicy pork... the lady told me we could get more than one type of meat but I reassured her that's all we wanted... and a few minutes later out came a HUGE plate of delicious, bright red meat. I may have drooled while ordering -- I don't get to partake in KBBQ often. It took a little bit longer but eventually the banchan and a variety of dipping sauces and salad came out, after half our meat was on the grill. The lady was replaced by two of the hottest guys I've ever seen [yeah my boyfriend was at the table, and I'm sure he saw me drool] who were incredibly attentive at making sure our meat was cooked perfectly, and switching out the grill before the second batch of delight was put on to cook. No complaints on the speed of the service, for the most part. Only qualm is that our rice didn't come out 'til half the meat was gone... but even that wasn't enough to detract from five stars. Ordered a bottle of Hite to share with the boyfriend -- I'm a lightweight. In an attempt to recreate a scene from "Conan's Tabloid Moments" [you know, like the child in front of a car while the driver (Conan) holds an obscenely large bottle of alcohol? it totally made sense in my slightly tipsy head!!] with the boyfriend I knock one of my chopsticks onto the floor with a loud metallic clink. Oops! Stole the boy's chopsticks [he uses a fork, psssh!] and resume eating. Not a moment later, a set of wooden chopsticks slides onto the table next to me. I turn to see hot Korean guy #2 [our primary server's sidekick] grinning at me. So. Caught. I turned even more red and continued to partake in the deliciously fresh red meat which matched the tone of my face oh-so-well. I love this place. I miss it already.

Have you ever ruminated about the past? Laying there absolutely still and replaying everything that had happened. Pondering about what would have happened if the timing was right. Wondering, if you even had the right elements to make it work. Did it work out and end, only to have you marinating in the juices of sweet memories of yore? Soowon will not marinate their meats in day- old marinade. Soowon provides a perfect and seamless matrimony of beef and marinade, banchan and naengmyun, and service and style. Soowon is as good as it gets. Perfect blend of ingredients, elements and timing... ÊCook time that is. While you are at it, make sure the element of fire doesn't scorch your meat. As for ruminating about the past, maybe it's best to stop kicking the dead horse and enjoy eating the cow during the present. Soowon, I've had some great times with you. (If you have enough in your party split a combo and it would be about $17-25 per person for a four person party. Valet parking lot is a bit small but cheap.)

I could eat KBBQ all day everyday...:-) And Soowon has definitely upgraded to be one of my new favorites in LA. The banchan is really good - I love places that give you the rice paper! The meat is really tender and the marinade is just right, not too salty or bland. More important to me than food sometimes, especially with a cuisine where options are plentiful, is ambiance. What sets Soowon apart from the other thousands of KBBQ restaurants in the area is service and cleanliness. The staff is very attentive and helpful, they don't rush you through your meal, and they are very good with drink and banchan refills, in addition to cutting up the larger pieces of meat for you. I went in a group of 8 - we are carniverous and annihilated 2 plates EACH of the thin slice brisket, the marinated beef, and ribs, along with a night's worth of beer, and it came out to $30/person WITH tax and gratuity. Not bad at all.

Now I have been to lots of Korean BBQ places. ÊThey all have common traits. ÊSmoke, loud noise, lots of banchan (small individual sides), and loads of meat brought to the table. This place tries to stand out from the others by trying to be more upscale. ÊFirst of all this place DOES NOT SERVE ALL YOU CAN EAT MEAT. ÊPersonally I think AYCE places are ditching these options because they are losing money. ÊThere is a plus side to ordering meat by the plate. ÊThe meat quality is good and much better then AYCE meat stored in a massive fridge waiting to be slapped onto a plate. This places uses matching fancy looking white plates and bowls. ÊThe meat is served in wooden platters, not Êtrays. ÊYou order meats by the plate and other Korean dishes are available. ÊEven the greens that accompany the meal is a salad variation composed of cabbage, carrots, lettuce, and asian dressing. The wait staff even try to cook everything for you. ÊNow personally I like to cook my own meat, but that is just them trying to better their service. Parking is in a shared strip mall parking lot where it is valet only. ÊAlso the valet attendants are not Korean. ÊI made that mistake in trying to communicate thinking they were Korean, but they are actually Mongolian. ÊThis place is great for people that are curious about Korean BBQ and want a friendly experience that is not overwhelming. ÊFor me it just tries to be too fancy.

Tasty banchan/panchans. They keep 'em coming too. You needn't know the names. ÊJust point at it with your chopsticks and go "Mmm! Hmmmm mmmm?" while chewing and nodding vigorously and they'll get the point. 3 people, 3 meat dishes: pork, chicken and beef galbi. It was way too much for even 3 carnivorous piggie-outers. ÊThe marinated beef & pork BBQ was insanely delicious. The chicken was a little forgettable so next time we'll stick to our other animal friends. ÊThey also keep switching out your grill so it doesn't get too blackened from all your food but...that means that some poor bloke is back there in the kitchen scrubbing these f***ers down all the live long day. Bless that little man! Can I have more of this...what is this? ÊDried eel banchan thing? ÊThese little pancake-y bastards are good too. More of this shredded radish in a light vinegary broth too. ÊMmm mhmmm hmm? ÊMore rice wrapper. More of everything. Bottom line: I was so full, I had to be pulled out of our booth. ÊI declared loudly for the other diners GOOD GOD I ATE TOO MUCH. ÊI said KAMSANIDAHHHH as we walked out and then probably burped epic-ly in the parking lot. ((Also, Yelpers. Can we please stop saying that K-town is "ghetto-y"?

WOW!! Ê=) Ê i'm glad i finally got to try Soowon Galbi. Êwe found street parking on a friday night. Ê ordered Combo A for five people. Êmany kinds of meat, little dishes, AND choice of drink included!! Êyes, that's right...you can choose soda, beer, or soju. Êmeat is kinda bland if you don't use their many dipping sauces (good flavoring). Êthey put different kinds out for you for a reason. Êthe galbi was my fav. Ênext time, i would order the seafood pancake, bulgogi, galbi, etc...not get Combo A. Êbut it was nice to try more things since it was our first time there. food quality - fresh, good variety of banchan service - 5 stars ambiance - nicer than most places, not too smokey not your typical korean service where they pretend they don't hear you...and ignore your requests. Êyou don't get the usual attitude and annoyed looks. Êthey are generous with their banchan, fill your tea w/o being asked, and help cook your food efficiently. i liked how the banchan was filled on both sides of the grill. Êbanchan includes fish cakes, thin rice cake, kimchee, soft tofu w/spicy sauce, potato w/sweet sauce (sooo yummy!), cherry tomatoes w/brussel sprouts, bean sprouts, broccoli, pickled shredded daikon. Êcomes with a salad but if you ask for lettuce to wrap your meat, they will give it to you. Êrice is also available. Êthey give you some cold ginger dessert drink w/some pinenuts at the end. for about $22 per person, you get A+ service with many meats, banchan, and drinks, tax included. Êwe had more than enough food.. Êthink i was more full than i am at AYCE places. Êhaha.. solid 4.5 stars!!! Ê*yelp should really let me give a half star but it's closer to 5 than 4. not five stars cuz i like korean pancake and/or steamed egg to be part of the banchan but that's just a personal preference.

Not Korean? ÊNot a problem! Ê Usually you need a Korean to help you out if you want a great meal in k-town but Soowon makes any non-korean / kbbq newbie (if you happen to be one) feel right at home with their genuine friendliness and easy-to-read explanations of kbbq and panchan (side dishes) The Combo A feeds 4 (easily Ê5) with more meat (with variety) that we ever wanted. ÊPrice? ÊComes out to almost the same as AYCE joints, without the unspoken challenge to stuff your face until solid meat comes out of your rear. The side dishes are tasty and they refill that, the duk bo sam (rice paper wrapper), and salad (huge bowls) frequently. Charcoal is freshly replaced when you sit down. ÊWater refill service is frequent. ÊFlat screens let my boys watch their game while I eat up all the tasty beef and pork. ÊWhat an awesome idea! Gotta say, this is my favorite Korean place right now (if not for a long time)!! ÊSoowon, you deserve all the stars i have to give.

Finally, a satisfying meal from a Korean restaurant without the feeling of fear, fear of bitchy Ajuma. And Finally, the search of the best Korean BBQ is over - this is it! You really get what you pay for: great meat selection and quality, charcoal grill, and dope service. All the side dishes are better than average - especially sweet potatoes, egg soup and crispy white seaweed, unlimited refill won't hurt either. And charcoal grill does make a difference, it bring the juice, smoky, and tenderness out of the meat. All you need to do is just relax, sip your soju, and the ajuma will cook them goods! Combination B stands for da BOMB - marinated beef rib, beef ribeye, pork neck meat, marinated beef sirloin, beef brisket, mushroom and, of course, soju. pics - http://www.yummycrave.coÉ

Came here with five other people and we got Combo A. It was not enough for six people so we ordered more chadol and samgyupsal (beef brisket and pork belly). Meet quality is pretty good but their service wasn't as good. I had to ask for steamed egg about 3 times and I was so irked by the end so I asked for one bottle of soju as service, which kind of made up for it. The bill came out to about $200 for the six of us which is about $33 per person. But it's because we had couple bottles of soju and beer. Note: If you're a fatty, you wont like the little portion they give for meat.

Don't let the location or looks fool you. This place is number one in my book for Korean BBQ. From the start to the end service was awesome. We got the combo C and thought this was a little pricey, but the quantity of food could have easily fed a party of 4. This combo also included drinks. This included 4 different kinds of meat. Side dishes were tasty and our waiter took the time to place our meat on the grill. For first timers, meat may be bland. They provide dipping sauces and have ones that vary in spiceness. The only bad part was after the meal we smelled like smoke. I noticed that when I got in the car. Luckily we were heading straight home. Just make a mental note when you come here. I know I will be definitely be back again. The food and service made it a perfect date and perfect location. Our bill came to about $70 which is not bad considering the quality of meats. We had enough take home good for two more.

Yummm. ÊMeat. ÊBarbecued meat. ÊKorean barbecued meat. ÊDroooooolllzzzz. ÊMmmmm. ÊAhhhhhgargledroooool. So a group of friends and I went out this past Friday night to celebrate my birthday, and I wanted meat. ÊNot that kind of meat, pervs. ÊI wanted some kbbq. ÊI debated going to Oo Kook, but it's a little pricey for a big group. ÊI thought about going to an AYCE joint, but I like pork and I want to eat pork and to enjoy my pork without waking up sick the next morning. ÊA few people had recommended Soowon Galbi, so I called to make a reservation. The girl who worked the front was very nice and accommodating. ÊEven though I said that we would have 20 people (2 of the large tables), she reserved a third table for us just in case. ÊThe service was excellent. ÊThe waitress didn't speak very good English, but we had a Korean-speaker with us who was able to bridge the language gap. ÊIt was funny, however... the waitress kept speaking to one of my Chinese friends in Korean, thinking that he was Korean. ÊShe did it three times until she finally remembered... it made for some good entertainment. ÊThey were very good about doing all of the cooking and serving, so we could just sit back, enjoy ourselves, relax, and drink a ton of soju and beer. ÊThey included bottles of soju, and since it was my birthday celebration they brought out a couple of large flasks with some cocktail concoction that they had made. ÊFree of charge, very nice. The interior of the restaurant is nice and clean, no problems there. ÊThey also have some HD tv's, and the girl at the front was more than happy to change the channel to the Dodgers game. ÊScore! ÊBonus points! I will now expose my whiteness in discussing side-dishes. ÊPlease don't judge me for not knowing the actual names even though I've been for kbbq so many times. ÊThe potato and vegetable pancake was awesome, with a great consistency and a nice little sweet factor because of the pieces of corn. ÊThe hot sauce and the kimchee were also especially good (I love kimchee). ÊEverything else was excellent as well, and the waitress was great about bringing out refills on everything (except for the potato pancakes, we couldn't get any more of those). And the meat? ÊNom nom nom. ÊEverything was very good. ÊSince we had two tables, each table handled their own orders. ÊAt the table where I was sitting, we had eight people. ÊWe ordered the biggest combo ($100) and the next size down combo ($80). ÊIn theory, this should have fed 9-10 people. ÊWe did have some big eaters, although my gf didn't really eat very much (I happily took her servings), but we still ran out of food pretty quickly. ÊI would say that my only complaint about Soowon Galbi is that the portions are somewhat small for what you pay. We had the brisket and the thin beef, both of which were delicious. ÊWe also had the boneless short rib, which was tender and tasty. ÊBut it was really the pork that got me. ÊThe pork belly was some of the best I've ever had. ÊMove over Honey Pig, who prides themselves on their pork belly. ÊFatty but not too fatty, and it crisped up perfectly on the outside while remaining tender and flavorful inside. ÊWe also got a little taste of the pork neck (it was supposed to come with our combos but when we asked for pork belly to be substituted for one of the combos, the waitress didn't understand and substituted for both). ÊNonetheless, they brought out a nice sample of the pork neck for us to try... and it was my favorite part of the whole meal. ÊNot too fatty, and so tasty... delicious. ÊFantastic. ÊI would go back just for this alone. All in all, I'm going 4 stars. ÊSoowon Galbi certainly didn't fail to impress, and I will definitely go back. ÊOh, and a big thanks to everyone who works there for making the meal so enjoyable, and for the excellent service... you guys were great! ÊAnd an even bigger thanks to my wonderful girlfriend, who served me like a king, organized everything, and refused to let me pay for myself. ÊThanks babe :)

I don't remember if I had written a review of a few locations but this place certainly ranks up there in comparison to a few secret locations. I'm sharing a few secrets with someone as I don't mind recommending this place instead. The quality of meat and service is excellent. I'm sure it also helps having a friend who speaks Korean as well. Trying to beat out traffic on Christmas Eve, there were 3 of us that decided for Korean BBQ. Great idea on a gloomy sprinkling day as it was. After overlooking the whole menu, the combination B over the combination C was better. More meat selection and I wasn't going to attempt to put away intestines when it's not a real favorite of ours to eat. Pork neck meat was certainly the better trade off in the two combinations. Hospitality was good too and the lady looks familiar as if she was at the secret spot previously when we were last there. It wasn't AYCE but the quality of meat was the better treat. I wouldn't mind ordering a few more meats on the side but I was content in what we had. 1 bottle of soju between the 3 of us was fine since I only had 1 or 2 shots. Wasn't feeling all that good either so water and soda was the choice for me. I would come back here in a heart beat if there were those who want to try this place but damned if you will crowd any of the secret spots my friend has shown me to. Just like grade school, it's for me to know and you to find out. Nee ner, nee ner.

At first we thought it was a Korean buffet, but it turned out it wasn't & so we ordered combination C because it was the 4 of us & wanted to spend $15 a person. ÊOh my goodness, everything brought to our table was exceptional & worth our money. ÊThe friendly waiters cooked our tender & juicy meats for us--I never thought their brisket would be amazingly scrumptious compared to all the briskets I've eaten--so I saw it as paying a teeny part of this combination entree for their service. ÊWe were served with so many different kinds of yummy side dishes. ÊAnd finally, the kimchi is to die for: it's very tasty and crisp--not what I expect from this typical additive. ÊOh, despite that it's not a buffet for the meats, you're served with unlimited amounts of the side dishes, & that's why we requested the rice paper seven times =P. Next time I'm bringing at least 3 people with me to dine there again. ÊA++ for Quality!

Luckily I was surrounded by friends. The food there is amazingly good. For the price you pay it's worth what you get. We ordered the 4 person specialty combo which has so much food! Around 20 dollars per person. The servers are all so nice and cook the food right in front of us.

I have no idea what to compare it to (or really what the heck I was doing or how I was supposed to eat most of the dishes.) That being said... DANG! This place was gooooooood. I am glad a friend gave me a few pointers (like they bring out lots of appetizers - and try the galbi) because I would have wondered what all I was getting. To those of us with no clue, all you really know is you ordered a grill item. If you do look at the back portion of the menu, it tells that they will bring you a selection of the appetizers, but I noticed this after we started to order. We ordered the marinated galbi (their signature dish), the spicy pork and the veggies. As if by magic, all sorts of little dishes appeared with tasty bits of kimchi, seaweed (I loved this stuff), radish, broccoli, sprouts and a few other things I had no idea about. We finished a few items and they brought more! Portions.. holy crap.. there were 2 of us and we ordered waaaayyy more food then should be allowed. I am glad my volleyball playing friend manned up and did some justice to the pork and veggies, I just couldn't hang. The meat was juicy and tender and had a lovely marinade. The pork was indeed spicy but had a lovely flavor to it. They brought out a steamed egg that was pretty tasty.. I am not even sure I can cover all the things that were brought to the table. SO MUCH!! I seriously feel like a tick about to pop.. but it was so worth the discomfort. The service was very friendly and prompt. I felt for all we ordered, the prices were very fair and the food was awesome. I would love to know how many of those grates they go through a night... they changed ours numerous times. I will definitely be back - next time in stretchy pants, I think.

This place gets my carnivore stamp of approval. Love their chapchae! Great bahnchan choices! I would definitely drag (if I have to) my other friends back here for more! For Korean BBQ, this place deserves solid 5 stars!

I am giving this place 4.5 rating. Ê The food was great. ÊPlenty for all of us to go around. ÊThere wasn't any meat that I could say that I didn't like. ÊService was a bit slow; it seemed to be a busy night for this place. Ê From our table, we had a pretty good view of the Laker game that played that night. ÊToo bad they lost. ÊThe good thing was that we got to stay at our table until the game was over. ÊWe had already finished our meal awhile ago. Ê We all enjoyed a great meal; too bad the Lakers lost.

The story begins with three bored friends on a saturday night... We decide to try new locations for dinner, and we agreed on koreatown. I had very, very high expectations of this restaurant considering that it has 4.5 stars with over 180 reviews on yelp!. I was not disappointed. THIS SH** WAS BOMB! If God was korean, and he owned a korean restaurant, this would be it. To the actual review, when we first arrived at the location, we were a little surprised that the parking was valet parking only. $2, not bad, but it was surprising because the restaurant was in a little pocket with a liquor store next to it or something, and a taco place. When we walked into the restaurant, we were greeted by a friendly hostess that promptly directed us to our seats. Our waiter was a really chill guy. He sat us down, chatted with our korean friend for a bit, took our orders, and had everything brought out swiftly. The only thing we had to wait for during our whole experience was for the meat to cook, and that was well worth it. Our waiter accidentally burned his hand while trying to pick up the lid for the grill at the beginning, but he worked through the pain through the whole time we were there (hard worker, major recognition). I believe the service is one of the main reasons why this restaurant is so well rated on yelp!. Ê The food was outstanding. As a side note, this is not a place you would come to if you are trying to save money. You pay for the high quality that is served to you here. We had three orders of meat, all different types (bulgogi, sam chy something, and the beef briskets). All three were flavorful and tender. You could tell the difference in quality immediately; example, the bulgogi wasn't just randomly shredded beef as you would see at other restaurants, with strings of fat attached to them. The side dishes were good in their own right, and they complemented the meat well. Nothing overpowered the meat, everything just went down smoothly. The environment was clean and maybe a little "sophisticated." They had a few flat screen TVs where everyone could see them, and the set up was sharp and spacious. It did not match the outside environment at all. The experience was faultless, as nothing (quality, service, food, etc) was sub-par. I have never met a more friendly staff than the people that work here. What would have made this an even better night was if we kept the keys to an acura sl. The person in-charge of parking handed us the wrong keys, it was quite an upgrade from my friend's corolla. But we didn't, since we are honest people :] If you never compromise on quality, this restaurant is for you. We will definitely be returning to Soowon Galbi in the future, and we are looking forward to it!

Great KBBQ spot. ÊNot one of the many AYCE spots that are popping up around K-town these days, but still a pretty decent spot. Ê They're very generous with their side dishes, and very friendly. ÊFriendly isn't always the easiest to find amongst jaded waitresses who are used to people getting drunk and rude. Ê The food, was pretty good. ÊA little bit too much on the sweeter side with a lot of the dishes, but it's made up for by the great service. ÊInteresting that they actually use the charcoal on the grills. ÊAs much of a carnivore as I am, I don't necessarily taste a difference with meat cooked over charcoal. Ê Oh, and for those who might be afraid of venturing into a Korean restaurant without a Korean friend to help you out, the servers here looked very patient and helpful in the tables around us.

I LOVE THIS PLACE and I would much rather dine here rather than at Woo Lae Oak or Chosun Galbee. Soowon is located in between koreatown and the hispanic part of downtown right next to a lavanderia. Location may not look too great, but DAMN the food was just amazing, totally blew me away. Two reasons: the good quality of the meat and their droolicious marinade! Try the house special short rib (the meat is thick, juicy and falling off the bone, almost), the plumpalicous bulgogi and the beef tongue. The prices were very reasonable, but there is a minimum of 2 orders of meat per table (I come here with a friend all the time and we have no problems finishing 2 big portions of beef). The only scary thing about this place is the bad design of the tables and the super ghetto hot charcoal fire pit in the middle. The tables are too small for the charcoal pit thats huge btw, and so whenever I dip my face below to eat, I would always feel a super uncomfortable, hot wall of heat to my face. Also smoke will be coming out from below your table. And yes, you will really stink of Korean BBQ when you come out of this place. Compared to many other Korean BBQ places I've been to, I think the stink factor for Soowon is the highest of all. So...don't forget to shower after coming here.

I brought my friend from Chicago here, who had never been to K'town LA. We both agree that Chicago, surprisingly, has some very good Korean food. Of course, I already knew that LA Korean food can't be beat, and Soowon Galbi did not disappoint. The meats were all so tender, and I'm not sure what they put in the marinade, but it was probably CRACK! It was so good! ÊThe panchan was all very good, but pretty typical. [Side note: Ondal 2's panchan variety and quality is still the best!] But I wasn't here for panchan. I was here for BBQ with wood, but I didn't want to walk out totally smelling like smoke and having a smoky film on my eyeballs like I did when I finished eating at Soot Bull Jeep. The ambiance is great. It all looks very shiny and new. And there's good lighting, which is good since the servers are working with hot chunks of wood. I also like the flat screen tv's, which were very good since it was Bowl season when I went. Speaking of the servers... this place appealed to the feminist foodie in me. All these Korean aunties were clearly in charge, and there were all these very very cute Korean men who were servers. My friend commented on how it was a restaurant run by Korean cougars with attractive young men at their beckon call. ÊHey... A little eye candy never hurts! ÊOh yea... and the service was great. Very attentive, which is always rare at Asian restaurants. So to sum up... food was amazing! Servers were very cute! ÊBut I'm sure the overhead on running this place isn't cheap. ÊSo, save up a lil money and hit this place up.

Went there for lunch with friends on a Saturday. ÊOnce everyone arrived, we ordered the $80 combo and two OB beer. As for the food, I wouldn't say it's better then any other BBQ joints in K-town... their banchan's were okay as well, nothing special as well. The waiter came over from time to time to flip the meat and put more on the grill, but when I asked for more Kimchi and water, it took him over 10 minutes to bring them and couple of times forgot... ÊNow, if the place was busy, yeah maybe I could have looked the other way, but minus our table, there was only one other table, where they were finishing up. I know the level of service depends on who you get, but I think this guy did not want to be at work that day... because it showed it on his face... I'll have to say, the level of service in k-town is going down... it isn't what it used to be... what is going on!!!

Other reviewers have been very detailed about this restaurant. Based on their suggestions I went here last night. It is in, predictably, a crowded ugly mini-mall in the crowded ugly Vermont Avenue district near Wilshire. There is hardly any parking on the street, so you must valet. It is only $2.00 so the parking charge is not obscene. The restaurant is beautifully and slickly designed. Aluminum hood vents hang above every table. The atmosphere is very clean, very professional, very friendly. The hosts will come up to you immediately and seat you. The menu slants towards BBQ-beef, pork, chicken, shrimp. The server will bring you hot tea, water or beer. Someone will come to adjust the black charcoal and add new soaked pieces to the pile. ÊYou won't be waiting long when an armada of vegetables, mostly soaked in chili and garlic, are piled onto the table. ÊOne enormous fresh green salad, lightly dressed in vinegar, is also included. And then the raw meats arrive. The server puts them on the grill and he also places many spices and side dishes on the table: raw garlic, soybean paste, spicy chili sauce, two spicy vinegar dips, rice paper wraps, sliced paper thin white radishes. There is kim chi, sour pickles, beans, potatoes, spinach. ÊPerhaps 9 side dishes and half a dozen ways to flavor everything. The meat was so tender, so well flavored, just exceptional. A lot of food to eat. The chicken was enough to feed four people, but just one person ate it. The restaurant does not, unfortunately, allow you to order less dishes than the amount of people seated at a table. Ê One warning: the smoke from the bbq can blow into one's face, despite the high-tech venting. ÊYour clothes will smell of BBQ too. Just when we thought the meal was over, they served a cold rice drink, followed by a bowl of rice, and a hot miso soup. This was for DESSERT! This is healthy eating, well prepared, professionally served. Even the bathrooms smell nice and have automatic waste-baskets that sense the motion of your hand and open intuitively.

Wow! ÊThere is no Korean BBQ place even half as good as this place! ÊCame here after 13 hours of poker spread out over two days at Bike Casino. ÊWhat a fun place to eat at. ÊThe inside Êis very nicely decorated in a modern, cozy style. The service is perfect; the meats that I tried here are out of this world. ÊTry the dish for three (I think it's the letter C dish, which goes for about 59.99) and you have the liberty of eating the ribeye (beautifully caramelized meat), pork belly (ummm!), chicken, and an awesome brisket. ÊThey come with a sweet soy sauce and a nice salty sesame oil sauce that you dip the meat in. The staff even assist in cooking it for you. ÊAlso, you get the usual kimchee and other pickled vegetables: all first class. Easily, I will find a reason to come back to Los Angeles just to come here again. ÊThe best Korean BBQ experience of my life. ÊThe Korean in the SF Bay Area just doesn't come close to this.

Pro: marinated meat is delightful. Con: unmarinated galbi isn't quite as decadent as dae sung oak, Parks bbq, the now defunct tofu village, or even the gui il bon AYCE. This place has gotten quite a following, and the clean modern update to its decor is great, and needed upgrade to what was there before. Price are average in terms of value, i stlll consider gui il bon AYCE better. Their banchan is average, nothing to sneeze at. I guess i'm still bitter tofu village on wilshire closed down.

At first, my roommate and I tried to catch the last hour of the Street Food Fair in downtown L.A. last Saturday, but the place was at capacity. ÊAlways lines in L.A. no matter where you go. ÊHorrible. ÊSince we were already downtown, we decided to go to K-Town for some tasty BBQ. ÊI suggested Soowon Galbi since it has been the #1 Korean BBQ spot on Yelp for the last two years. I was pretty excited to taste Soowon Galbi BBQ to say the least. Maybe like most things in life, my expectations were so unreasonably high, that I give this place three stars. ÊEveryone talks about the quality of the meat, but I really didn't notice much difference in the meat quality versus any other decent Korean BBQ joint. Ê We ordered the combo for two people and the jap chae. ÊWith tip, it was about $75. It was good. ÊNothing spectacular and orgie-esque as I was hoping. ÊI did like that the combo came with a salad, Êa large beer and plenty of banchan. ÊI was just expecting... synapses to fire left and right, oh well. Jap chae was awesome, although I am a sucker for jap chae, that is my kryptonite. ÊService was good and prompt, though not being able to speak Korean, I sometimes get the gist that I am a little less welcome and looked down upon to a degree, but I think that is the protocol for most Korean BBQ places in L.A. it seems. Ê For the money, quality, and quantitiy, ÊI still think Beverly Soon Tofu is the best deal I have found thus far.

I'll try keep it short and sweet. Had dinner here last night around 7ish for a party of four dudes. Wait without reservations was about 20-25. We ordered 3 different plates of meat, 1 bimbimbap, and 1 mool neng myun (cold buckwheat noodles). We all walked out of there full and satisfied. It wasn't that ugly full feeling that you get after eating Korean AYCE bbq either, it was just right. Total with tip came out to about $27-28 per person. I brought my friends here and they all agreed that it was a great meal. AYCE is awesome but sometimes when you come to a smaller place like Soowon Galbi, you forget about all the mportant stuff to take into consideration when dining at a Korean joint. From the numerous and tasty side dishes, to the friendly and more intimate service (you're not being treated like cattle), and just the overall quality of everything especially the meat. Soowon Galbi does it right and brings me back to the reality that AYCE Korean bbq is not always the best option. It was my second time here and I hope that there will be more satisfying experiences at Soowon Galbi in the near future.

Parking here in the congested parking lot, if there is space, you'd best have good comp insurance as it is a nightmare! If you are faint of heart, be prepared for 911, when you get the bill! Meat ÊChoices for Bbq. begging at $25! And there ain't much for $35 bucks being spent on 'family' style divided dinner bills! Meals come with typical Korean Restaurant salad, side dishes, Free water, and free hot tea! This place is upscale Korean Bbq. in a run down neighborhood, charging upscale prices! Service is 3rd rate! Slow, to take order, slow to get food, and with an attitude! Korean Service sucks! There is Ênothing special here, maybe antiseptic ambiance! I amnt into Black & White background cloors,,and like somethng showing traditional ambiance with character, here it is about Money! All around here on Vermont are 'hole' in the wall Korean Joints, which most charge reasonable prices for meals!! If you want value, great Bbq., all you can eat, with all since dishes - check out:"Ma Dang Sea Korean Bbq. Buffet , right down the street at 901 S. Vermont!

Highly recommended Korean food! Great service! I took my brother, my sister in law, sis, my sis' bf, and my nephew here since my sister in law wanted some good Korean food. They were all satisfied with the quality (especially the Jap Che we ordered! My sister in law raved about the quality of the noodles). We ordered the combo meat platter for 4-5 people, and it was definitely enough for all of us, and a side of Jap Che and bim bim bab. The best meat had to be their Soowon Galbi! YUM! Great marinade on those! The meat was on a bone, for crying out loud! YUM, YUM! Parking is $2. I am definitely going to come back here with some friends for some Korean food when we're craving!

Went for the second time yesterday. ÊThe first time I went I took away a star because of the service. ÊYesterday I realized it was my fault because I went in so late the first time (30 min before closing) that they were probably understaffed and tired. ÊWhen I went yesterday, the service was superb. ÊThe servers take initiative to BBQ the entire meal for you so that you may focus on the delicious flavor party going on in your mouth. Ê The meat was still fantastic. ÊI was a bit disappointed because they ran out of the marinated short rib so I had to get the one that was not marinated. ÊIt worked in my favor because the tastiness of meat without marinade is how you can really tell how good the meat is. ÊIt was still BOMBAY. In summary: Good meat, good side dishes, good service, good ventilation. ÊKorean BBQ at its absolute best. Ê Added benefit is that they have nice flat screen HD TVs so we got to watch the Lakers game as we ate (too bad Lakers lost though!)

I just went to this restaurant tonight for the first time and all I've got to say is WOOOW!! I was thoroughly impressed with everything! When I first walked into the restaurant I was first astounded by the atmosphere and also was warmly greeted! This is the cleanest Korean BBQ restaurant I have ever been too. Meat Quality: As far as meat quality this is as good as it gets. I usually go to AYCE spots but the quality of the meat doesn't come close to Soowon. As they say QUALITY over quantity. This is SO true for Soowon Galbi. Service: The servers came to our table like every 5 mins to check if we needed anything. They also came to the table to flip our meat! Where else are you gonna get service like this!? All other Korean BBQ restaurants you have to keep pressing the ringer or flag down a server. Even before you think of something you need, it shows up on the table. For example my girlfriend wanted some more Kimchi and next thing you know there it was on the table. She was like "where did this come from"? It also happened with the water... haha Ê EXCELLENT SERVICE!! I highly recommend this place over any other Korean restaurant! Trust me you will not be disappointed! My new favorite Korean BBQ restaurant!! =)

This is the best Korean BBQ ever! The combo D includes a good portion of beef, pork bellies, and marinated chicken. All the delicious side dishes of course, and some onions and garlic to make your grilling experience an even more marvelous adventure. Oh and it covers drinks. Your choice between soda, tea, or Soju. I ordered the soju thinking it was gonna be like two shots but they give you a whole bottle. Yep! you can also get drunk for just the cost of your food. if you choose from the combo side of the menu and it says serves 2....It'll easily serve 3 and maybe 4 without gluttonous appetites

Although I was a little disappointed they didn't have an all you can eat BBQ, I was very pleased with the overall portion size. The quality of the their meats and side dishes are probably the BEST I've had. The special seasoned galbi is mouth watering. Although the service was outstanding, the only thing that bothered me was the the servers would place the meat on on the grill and cook it for you. Almost felt like we were rushed. They were cooking faster than we can eat. Overall, I would come back here. Only thing I would change next time would be to make a reservation. Wait time can be anywhere from 30-45 minutes...even with 2 people!

While I'm frequently mistaken for being Hawaiian, mixed, or Vietnamese, I occaisionally get spoken to in Korean, usually in Korean restaurants. Luckily, I like Korean people...annnnd Korean food! :) This place is BOMB. It was a bit of a buzzkill walking into Korean BBQ with a vegetarian - I know, what kind of a friend am I!? I couldn't help it though, here I was, in LA, capital of top tier Korean food...i just couldn't give it up! With only two girls Êable to eat meat, we were wondering if it would be a moot point, but luckily, this place had combo meals, which I had seen before, but never wanted to try because there wasn't anything interesting! Boy, was I wrong. We went with the smallest (and lowest in price) combo meal at $39.99 which included pork belly, marinated chicken and galbi complete with banchan AND - included in the price - a whole bottle of SOJU! WHHHAT!? Man. We were happy little people as we chomped and boozed away, all for $40! Pork Belly - This had to have been my FAVORITE of the night. I don't believe it was marinated, but we let the belly cook up right crisp as the grill sizzled, the fat melted and omg, just became a big ol' mess of juicy, tender, and crispy. Perfect for the shitty weather that was outside. Soft and juicy. SRS, this is 1337! Galbi - Mmm, thinly sliced, high grade meat meant to make any carnivore happy. The meat was perfect and I really had NO complaints about this one. I was glad we did the Pork Belly first though, because then the grill got oiled up nicely and our meat didn't stick! Marinated Chicken - This one was tasty too, just enough marinade and not too salty. The chicken cooked up tender and juicy, which surprised me because I thought we had left it on the grill a little too long...but hey, glad it turned out well. Banchan - I was kind of sad that they didn't have the sugared squid or anchovies that day, but the kimchee was FABULOUS, I just kept eating and eating. The sugared potatoes were a favorite too - who dislikes sweet starches!? :) Service - almost over attentive. Our waiter was really cute once he figured out that we had a vegetarian in our party and he kept hesitating everytime he said "meat" hahaha. The lady who later calculated the bill for us was also super cute, instructing me to "put the Soju in my purse" in her motherly Korean tone. :) ÊThey keep the water filled up and will come back to put more food on your grill, unless you tell them no. The only thing is that sometimes they forget to bring things that you ask them for, but who can blame them! They do charge $2 for valet parking, but the guys are so nice that they said "Free for you!" Ahh, the perks. You bet your buttocks that I will be back here anytime I'm in LA. My next plan of action though is to visit Beverly's to see how they compare. :) YAY!!!

I'll try to avoid being overly verbose. Top 10 Things I liked about Soowon: 10. ÊParking - $2.00 valet isn't so bad, I can live with it. ÊParking can be quite difficult in K-Town, and $2.00 valet is pretty reasonable. 9. ÊClean - this place was really clean. ÊThere were a few tiny guffaws, like a tiny spill underneath a friend's feet, but that's forgivable. Ê 8. ÊPajeon - The korean seafood pancake was pretty good. ÊThe bottom of the pancake was nicely crisp, while the eggy dough and fillings were all done well. ÊThe dipping sauce wasn't as strongly flavored as I normally like though. 7. ÊThe beef presentation - The meat was gorgeous. ÊBright red, with clean strips of marbling. ÊEverything looked amazingly fresh, and it was presented on a nice little wooden platform that made me voraciously hungry. 6. Êbibimbap - I'm a sucker for this dish. ÊIt really can't fail for me. 5. ÊPork Belly - goddamn, I'm not usually a fan of the unseasoned grilled pork belly, but it was fantastic here. ÊIt had that great mouth filling aroma of the pig fat and a nice layer of earthy smokiness from the grilling. Ê 4. ÊReal charcoal bbq - adds a nice smokiness to everything. ÊVentilation is a bit problematic because of the added smoke from the charcoal, but it's an overall huge positive. 3. ÊRib-eye steak - wow, this tasted great. ÊFatty beef + charcoal grill = even crazier delicious than red vines + mr. pibb. 2. ÊService - everyone was attentive, nice and they worked really hard to make everyone happy. ÊI have nothing bad to say about anyone here. Ê 1. ÊBanchan - very fresh, very crisp, and very cleanly flavored. ÊNothing was muddled, and there was a huge amount of it. Ê 1-5 are all pretty much a tie and I randomly assigned them an order.

This place is just.... Words can't even describe it. Prices, portions, and service are all VERY generous. I picked this place for my boyfriend's birthday party after reading rave reviews and having never ventured into the realm of Korean BBQ before. We made a reservation on Thursday for 12 on the next Saturday night at 8 and they had no problem accommodating us. We show up and they seat us in this semi-private space near the door with two grill tables but, just like it always is in LA, 4 people ended up canceling last second so we're taking up much more room than we really need. I felt bad about it because it was a busy night, and being a former server, I know how shitty it is to have people cancel and then the party is taking up valuable table space. I offered to have us all squeeze onto one table, but the servers were very nice and thought I was being crazy for even suggesting that. For 8 of us we ordered 2 combination A platters for $99 each that came with a bottle of soju or a large beer, salad, sides, and about 5 different kinds of meat. The description said that the platter would feed about 4 people, but oh. my. god. it could have fed 10. Everything was delicious and we were all impressed by the table grill, we didn't even ask what it was we were eating, but the servers very kindly told us what everything was and what sauces go with what meats. The whole meal and booze for 8 ended up costing around $250, but we easily could have gotten only one combo platter and maybe an extra meat for half the price and still have been stuffed. For carnivores, this is the jam. Especially if you're a carnivore that doesn't speak any Korean, they got you covered.

This place has the best Kalbi Korean BBQ ever! The kalbi is perfectly seasoned, super flavorful, and oh so juicy!! I love it so much I'd come back despite the long lines and the horrible ventilation system that leave you smelling like you've been BBQ'd yourself! (hence the 4 instead of 5 star review).

SooWon!! where have you been all my life... Not to turn my back on Yang San Bak but OMG they're delicious!!! It's a small little tiny place in a strip mall next to a laundry mat. (WEIRD) ÊThis place is very popular so call ahead or be prepared to wait at least 30 minutes for a table. It is obvious that a lot of non Koreans come here since the waitresses help you do everything. I don't get that kind of service at yang san bak. (But my favorite spicy pork belly spot will forever be yang san bak! ) The food is delicious; their meat is really great from the pork neck to the beef. Everything was scrumptious. The truth is, I was really impressed by the service, we never ran out of sides because they always kept bringing more, they grilled the meat for us and they even gave us new ideas on how to eat our meats! Hahaha.. Anyway, if you're craving some KBBQ check this place out its worth it.

Step aside traditional blugogi and kalbi, say hello to brisket, short ribs, sirloin, and pork neck. When you walk in, the aroma of korean bbq fills the air...that's how you know you've walked into a great place for korean bbq. You don't smell grease, you don't smell burnt meat, and you don't smell anything fishy...you smell heaven! By far one of the tastiest Korean BBQ I've had in a long long time. We pretty much ordered all the different types of marinated beef on the menu with a party of 15 people. Since they use real charcoal, all the meats taste even better. Their combonations are a great way to start if you want to have a taste of all the different types of bbq Soowon has to offer for 1st timers (and they throw in a bottle of Soju). The service is A+ since they actually put the meat on the skillet and cook it for you, staff is very hospitable, and you feel right at home since everyone is so attentive. (they also constantly change the skillet which is also important unless you like the taste of burnt pulverized ashy meat residue) $25 / person including tip for 15 very stuffed people is always good in my opinion for a korean bbq place...so all of my friends and I will be coming back soon the next time we're craving korean bbq.

I've been to way too many Korean BBQ joints for my own good (both good and bad). And if there's a place that's better than here, I haven't been to it yet. Sorry, Park's. Yes, they have rice paper wraps. And there were plenty of side dishes. Me and my friend ordered the galbi (I don't remember what the full name was, but i know it was #1 on the menu) and bulgogi. I've never tasted BBQ that good and that flavorful. The meat was marbled to perfection and the marinade was something I've never had before. Usually I need my sesame oil with salt and pepper to bring out some flavor, but with this meat there was absolutely no need for it. The service was top-notch. As to be expected, they helped cook our meat. Not just that, but when they accidentally burned one piece of the galbi, they brought out two more for us! Can't complain with that whatsoever. Valet parking lot on the outside. This place will get busy later in the night, as I went on a Sunday and it was filled up by 6 PM.

Another visit to Soowon resulted in another amazing night. Soowon has won my heart many times over and she just might be the sexiest thing in K-town (if not sexiest, she certainly smell the best). Soowon possesses the keys to my heart: delicious goodness + buttloads of alcohol. I love food and I love alcohol, but there's nothing like having them both at once in perfect harmony, it's kinda like sex but only better. The meat quality of Soowon is unrivaled from anywhere I've been to for Korean BBQ and trust me I've been to a lot. Granted that you do pay a slight premium for quality, it is worth every penny and if you're not willing to pay for quality, you're not worthy. You can always judge the meat by the marbling and tenderness and Soowon has some of the best. They serve up the meaty goodness with ~8 different types of delicious (not to mention endless) panchan along with moo and duk. I also really appreciate a Korean BBQ spot that uses charcoal cause you really just can't replace the flavor generated by a real fire (besides it makes me feel manlier cooking over real fire) On this visit, we ordered up Combo A (this meat platter is serious food porn) between the 5 of us along with 2 bottles each of soju, baek se joo and mah goh lih. The combo from I recall comes with chadobegi, kalbi, pork neck, rib eye steak and marinated beef. Though the rib eye seemed a bit leaner (and tougher of course) than usual on this visit, everything was still delicious and we chowed down and left no meat behind! We also topped off our meal with the korean styled chawanmushi (steamed egg), which is a must have IMO. I was kinda sad that we didn't order my two personal favs here this time around: the thick cut samgyeopsal and the cow tongue..but oh well, it gives me a reason to come back. Soowon, though it's only been one day since I've seen you...I'm a mess without you. I miss you so damn much. I miss being with you, I miss being near you. I miss your scent; I miss your musk. And btw those two young ladies(think they might be sisters) that greets me everytime I walk in when I visit aren't so shabby either ;-)

worth the wait! what i ate: - chadol: couldnt eat fast enough so they got to be a lil crispy, but the meat was still good. - koht sahl: tender tender tender. slightly marinated to give it more of an umami pop, but what does it matter? the meat had a nice balance of bite and tenderness. pros: - meat quality. this aint no AYCE kbbq joint. i expect good quality meat and soowon delivered - service: the servers were incredibly attentive, people were constantly coming and flipping our meat for us, adjusting the heat, offering us more banchan. whatever we wanted it was provided quickly - the taco shop in the same lot. hahaha the hour wait drove us to get a quick appetizer. the carne asada tacos tided us over until we were seated cons: - the wait. table for 2, arrived around 730 on a saturday night, no rez - the wait was an hour. yea, not so great. i was tempted to go in and make friends with someone who was sitting at a 6top by himself and help him out with his food, but i didnt think my date would enjoy that so i waited. - price: not cheap, but honestly, like i said, this aint no AYCE joint. expect quality meat and quality service. its worth the money. for two plates of meat, dinner came out to about $55 without tip would i come again? if i wanted to treat myself instead of gorging myself, yes!

Soonwon is the real deal. ÊHad the please of 2 of my Korean friends hosting and it delivered. ÊThe meat blows away both and Chosun (the Disneyland of Korean Places) and Park's. The Galbi was the best I've ever had by far. ÊAmazingly tender and off the bone. ÊThe Bulgogi was also amazing and the best I've had in LA. ÊThe pork Bulgogi was too heavily covered & spiced to enjoy the meat. ÊThat plus skimpy on the pan chan gets it 4 stars, but great nevertheless. I feel like a Boa constrictor after eating a crocodile right now.

The last time I was here was a few months back. Despite of the huge gap between my visit and this review, I still remember what I liked about this place. Meat, meat, meat. The meat quality here is great. The non-marinated short rib here is good as Park's BBQ and Dong Il Jang in which I had written a review for. I realized that good bbq beef isn't too hard to find in K-Town. What really made this place memorable was the Black cod fish soup with assorted vegetable. I don't quite have a picture of it but I'm quite surprised that no one mentioned it here. ÊBut I managed to find a picture on http://conniemchung.blogÉ. The soup hits the spot. It's amazing and it's awesome to share! If you love fish and meat, this is a must-order item. I've never visited this restaurant during busy hours so it was very nice. The service here is pleasant.

My friend Greg has raved about this place for a while, and finally we came here one night, it was a great experience. There were only 2 of us, so we got a combo special D, it comes with Pork Belly, Chicken Bolgogi, and Beef Brisket. ÊI really wanted to try the rib eye, but I thought it would've been too much food for the 2 of us to get the C item menu... and I was right! ÊThey give you a massive amount of banchan, plus a HUGE starter salad... (refillable by the way) I was kinda full before the meat was cooked to be honest. The service was the best I've ever gotten from a Korean BBQ place. ÊKudos Soowon Galbi! ÊThe wait staffs are attentive, and they pay attention to customer needs. ÊThe manager also came by and taught us to grill kimchi on the grill... and gave us a little lesson about kimchi, awesome! They are also not shy about refilling your banchan. ÊThe variety of it is impressive, from glazed potato, to fish cake, to korean pancake, kimchi, cucumber...etc. The meats were a little on the fatty side, I made a fat pile next to the grill... Êthat's why I can't give this place a 5 star, but everything else was GREAT! You also get a complimentary bottle of Soju! Êeven better!! A perfect Korean BBQ would be meat from Soot Bull Jeep, and everything else from this place.

The last kbbq I visited was Genwa (4 stars). Coming from that place, we had hoped Soowon would be comparable or better since it had so many reviews. I was dissapointed. Banchan selection is standard. Not a mind blowing experience on the meat quality or flavor. We ordered the Soo won Êwang galbi and Joomuluk. The marinated galbi was good. The Joomuluk was okay because it was a little tough. Jap chae was the star of the meal. The waiter was attentive and tended to our grill frequently. We were lucky to be seated immediately on a Friday at 7:00. By the time we left which was about 8:00, they were packed and had lots of people waiting. Parking is crazy. They do have valet which is only $2.00 which is worth it because this place is in a small plaza with other businesses so, parking is very limited. Pricing is comparable to Genwa. I would pick Genwa over Soowon for quaility of meat, flavor, banchan variety, and you don't walk out smelling smoky. Truthfully, I don't care how I smell coming out of a restaurant as long as the meal was delicious.

Maybe it was the failed outing to the hyped-up Kogi truck that made me love this place. ÊMy friends and I were heading out to Hollywood to see a show at the Key Club and thought it was a good idea to find Kogi in Burbank anyway. ÊWhen we got there, it was shut down by the police already. ÊAn empty-handed customer said they weren't allowed to serve food in Burbank. ÊWe left disgruntled (I personally blame the Kogi management). Ê Regardless of that failed attempt, Soowon Galbi was superb. ÊThe interior was clean (always a big plus in my book). ÊThe decor was modern and not cheesy. ÊThe four of us got a Combo A, which said would serve 4 people. ÊIt included a plethora of side dishes, rice, soup, salad, and choice of beer, soju, or soda. ÊOne note: the choice of drink is not for every single person. ÊWe asked if every person gets a beer and they said no, just one bottle of beer for everyone. ÊSo we just got one bottle soju to share. Ê The meat was plentiful and we were thoroughly satisfied. ÊThe rice, the side dishes, the salad, the small rice wraps, the sauces--all good! ÊThey even cooked the food for us even though the grill was on our table. ÊThat was a little awkward, but it did allow us to "concentrate" on eating and not worry about cooking. ÊOne thing was I had to explicitly ask for rice and soup, even though it was included in our meal. ÊIt didn't come out automatically. ÊDessert was a simple "rice drink" that I didn't really enjoy, but the rest of the group liked it. Ê Combo A was $80; so $20 per person. ÊNot too bad for a very satisfying meal. ÊIt also killed time for us because our show was later in the night. ÊI enjoyed the slow eating. ÊI never felt like I was stuffing my face and there was down time as the meat was cooking. ÊSo I would highly recommend this place for couples and groups.

Came here with the family, was lucky enough to get a large table.. you know us asians eat in packs. anyhow the 9 of us sat and was greeted quickly and given menus. ordered the seafood pancake... (it was okay, the kiddies didnt devour it like they usually do) the meats we ordered was good. pork belly was good, rib eye was cooked a bit too long but still yummy. the galbi was yummy too... they gave lots of refills of our sides and the salad. so we were happy. bill wasnt too bad so this wont be a bad spot to stop in while driving.. always good to know of decent options.

Wow. Just, wow. You would never expect such awesome service from this place. Smack down in the middle of the k-town/m-town ghetto is this amazing gem. There's definitely no parking, so just find some residential area place to park in and walk it. You'd at most walk a two blocks. They have 'valet parking', but there's only really 5 parking spaces...so I have no idea how they would manage that. We went on a Saturday late morning and there were only about 3 other tables dining. We've been to an AYCE Korean bbq joint before, but this was not that type of restaurant, and the host and waitress/server immediately could tell we looked like deers caught in headlights. We ended up ordering two sets of meat. Their special short ribs, and the bulgogi. Pre-warning: They were AWESOME. The side dishes came out first, and they were laid out around the grill. I enjoyed the pickles, potato with some syrupy sauce, and whole cloves of garlic. Like my fiancee said, there was no seaweed, which was a disappointment for me. I did ask the host, and he definitely looked for some in the back and came out with some weird white thing that had a mayonnaise taste to it. It crunched like seaweed, but it definitely did not taste like seaweed. The real kick when the meat came out was that the waitress/server started cooking for us. Whah?? Is this normal? I always though we cook for ourselves, and I can only imagine that she thought we were quite new at this and decided to take it into her own hands. It was really cool and very awesome to get such a service. Anyway, I do really like this place, and hope to come back. It is a bit expensive (given its location, too!), but for what you get, it's definitely worth it.

This place is amazing! So glad we found this place on yelp. We ordered the Soowon Galbi and Rib Eye Prime for 2. The rib eye was beautifully marbled. I think the Galbi is the best deal. The portion was more than enough for 2. The Galbi is perfectly marinated. I'm not a fan of banchans but my friend really enjoyed it. The sides looked really fresh. We can't stop raving about how great the meat was. My only critique is that they don't have green onions for the rice wrappers! Oh and you get a huge complimentary salad. I don't know what the dressing was but it was delicious. Service was great. There was always someone there to cook the meat for us. Parking is tight and valet is only $2 so it's not too bad. It's a bit on the pricey side around $60 for 2 but I'll definitely come back for their special Galbi. It's a must in K-town!

WOW. as i was leaving Soowon, all i can say was "WOW, this is absolutely the best korean bbq i have ever had in my entire life" Literally come with you're (entourage crew..haha BTW I LOVE THAT SHOW) four of your closest friends and BAM you're set. order combo A it's about 100 dollars and you're set on food/prices/service. As Adam Richmond would say, "OH MY WORD, OH MY WORD" this place is that good. The meat takes a while to prep, but that just means it's better than the other places that bring it out instantly. Before Soowon, i usually found myself going to Road to Seoul or any number of the cheaper all you can eat places because they're cheap, pretty awesome, and cheap. Upon receiving my food, the meat quality is much better than the other places, with the brisket, at usual AYCE places they are filled with fat, however you could instantly tell it was fresh and high quality. Combo A includes a drinks (beer,soju,soda) alongside PLENTY OF MEAT, and Side dishes. Service, is better than the all you can eat places, because simply they're less busy and because they are less pre-ocuppied with difficult all you can eat orders. Overall, this place is a MUST-EAT (for KBBQ lovers) and a wonderful experience because of the great service, HIGHQUALITY MEAT, and comparable prices.

I was in town this past weekend and my parents asked my sister and I to pick a place for lunch. ÊI was debating between Soowon and some birria joint, only because my Korean parents are incredibly picky when it comes to Korean food, but for food where they do not have a reference point, they tend to enjoy what's put in front of them. ÊMy sister ended up making the executive decision to go Korean. ÊI was a bit nervous. First, the bad. ÊThe ban chan here was not great. ÊNot terrible, but pretty mediocre. ÊMy mom made the typical Korean mom comment that her ban chan was better, and I actually think that is probably true. ÊAlso, the selection was on the smaller side, though we did go for lunch, so I was not that surprised. Second, the okay. ÊThe heating system here is a mix of gas and charcoal, which I do not love. ÊI think that charcoal only gets better flavor, but I understand that the temperature is more difficult to control. Third, the good. ÊThe den jang chigae, which was service, was pretty tasty. ÊThe dolsot bibimbap came in what looked like a stone paella plate, which gave a lot more surface area to crisp up the rice. ÊThe service was pretty attentive, though we were there at lunch on a Saturday and it was not busy. Fourth, the great. ÊThe galbi here was excellent, and they gave a lot of it. ÊReading the other Yelp reviews, perhaps this was an anomaly, but I eat at Korean BBQ a lot and our order for two people was very generous and was similar to an order for three. ÊTo put it into perspective, we were able to get about five "grills worth" of meat. Fifth, the superlative. ÊEveryone at the table agreed, the naeng myun here was the best. ÊThe noodles had the right amount of chew to them, not too mushy, not too rubbery. ÊThe broth, which was of the sweet variety, had a good flavor, I think they grated Korean pear and mixed it in. ÊMy dad's favorite thing to eat is naeng myun, and he gave it a big thumbs up, as did the rest of us. I have seriously never heard my parents speak so well of a Korean restaurant before (minus the ban chan). ÊFive stars from the grouchy parents.

SWEET. My friends and I were looking for a place in k-town to eat on friday night. and saw that soowon has a 4.5 star so we decided to try it. We called them to make a reservation but they didn't speak that well of english nor did they take reservations. We decided to meet there at 7:30 anyways, without reservation. Couldn't find it the first round of drive - the front of the store is facing the small parking lot but there is a small yellow sign that says soowon galbi. The window is clean and the interior is nice and upscale looking. The lady greeted me, the first one to get there, and told me that I can write my name down - a group of 5. ÊWithin half an hour, my friends all arrived and we were seated. You can order a combination set or individual plates. Since we had 5 people we ordered combination A - a lot of meat, side dishes, drinks, etc.. ÊThe big tray of meat came out and from there it was very quick. The servers will come to your table every 5 minutes to cook more meat and give you refills on your side dishes. We had so much food !! ÊWe couldn't even finish the meat !! For 5 people, including tax, the bill came out to be $130 - normal cost for korean bbq. The meat was really good and the service was super nice. Thank you Soonwon Galbi, we'll come back again.

We came for a friends birthday, the place is super cute and clean, they had a reserved room for us that was quaint with just the right amount of room.

We attempted to hit up the KBBQ Festival in K-town a few weeks ago but were amazed with the turn out (never under-estimate the marketing power of Yelp I guess, lol). ÊDue to the long lines, we knew we were never going to be able to chow down at the KBBQ Festival and Yelp'ed the surrounding area on our iPhones for a decent KBBQ place, preferably within walking distance. ÊOur unluckiness at the KBBQ Festival led to our SUPREME luckiness in stumbling on Soowon. We walked over here and had to wait about 10 minutes for our group of 9 people to be seated (not bad considering we were a group of 9 people, it was Saturday night around 6:30pm). ÊWhile we waited for our table, we agreed on getting two combo meals with a variety of meats (pork, pork belly, thinly sliced beef/brisket, chicken, short rib, etc.) ÊThe quality of the meat is DIVINE. The portions were enough to feed everyone (our group of 9 consisted of 6 girls and 3 guys) and the combos came with beer and/or soju. We also ordered two orders of babimbap and one order of cold noodles. ÊHands down, the best cold noodles I have ever eaten. Service was pretty attentive and for the most part really friendly. ÊThey cook the meat for you but they can be a little bit slow in re-filling side dishes or getting the check. Ah-mazing. My new go-to place for KBBQ in K-town.

At the moment, this is the "IT" place for korean bbq. Chosun is less smoky and more upscale, but their meat is not as tasty as Soowon. Their banchan is more crazy delicious than Mr. Pibb and Red Vines. I have been here twice, and the third time we didn't get reservations and the girl told us politely, "don't bother wating." Make this place bigger dammit! Valet parking is cheap, but be aware sometimes k-town valet just finds a street parking if there is no vacancy in the parking lot. i.e., don't bring your shiny new Porsche.

step aside Shik Do Rak (good for chadolbegi), SOOWON GALBI is my new FAVORITE Korean BBQ restaurant! Food quality: - meat: AMAZINGLY fresh and DELISH! - sides: good variety----waaay better than the ones given at the Korean joints in the Valley. - love the the thinly sliced radish and rice paper wraps - salad: FRESH greens with a flavorful dressing - dessert: yummmy rice punch Service and Ambience: - 2 thumbs up! all the waiters/waitresses were VERY friendly and attentive - despite the 'ghetto' area---this restaurant is very modern and clean---even the bathroom!!! Value: 1 order of Galbi, 1 order of Chadolbegi (sooo FRES H), 1 order of the ''thick bacon" (the BEST i've ever had), 1 order of the seafood pancake(a bit bland, BUT good size and texture(crispy outside--soft inside). ÊTotal bill: $100((including tip))/4= $25 each!!!! One day later, i am still full....and very satisfied!!! :) only Êdrawback: $2 VALET parking (literally stepped out of my car to have it valet a few feet away)----BUT eating there is worth every dollar!

With so many reviews, I can't imagine how much more info I could provide here, except that I am a novice at Korean BBQ. I don't know all the meats and certainly would be lost when ordering. Luckily, we had some smart Korean foodies at the table who knew exactly what to order. I just ate and the food was fabulous. You do pay up for it but its worth it. I imagine it helps to go with someone who knows a little Êabout Korean BBQ when you go here. Oh and be sure to make a reservation. We had to make a reservation even though we went on a Wednesday!

My cousin wanted us to try this place, so we obliged. Firstly, I want to point out that this isn't an all you can eat kbbq. They take orders on meat and bring them out to you. That being said, these restaurants are typically more expensive, but give you higher quality meat. This restaurant is pretty fairly priced in regards to what you get. The meat was VERY good. The marinade they use gives the authentic korean bbq taste. I believe the owner was the one serving us when we were eating, and she was VERY helpful and attentive to our needs. They have several workers who speak english decently well, so don't be afraid to come here without a korean speaking friend :) The bban chan (appetizer dishes) were yummy, and they were quick to refill empty dishes. The bean sprouts were a little blander than I am used to, but not enough to make a fuss about. I came here with 8 people, and the bill came out to be about $140. I didn't order the set combinations, but picked specific selections of meat. If you DO pick the combos, you'd save $10-$20, but might not like EVERYTHING.

(Update) Upon reading my review just a few minutes after I posted, I got a message from the owner who's also a Yelper and it was so nice to hear from them personally and see them try to make sure customers are happy by willing to improve service or whatever if there's any room for improvement. ÊI am very impressed with the attentiveness and the promptness. ÊYes, don't we all love personal touch?! ÊAnd I'm glad they assured me that they are not going to kill me! lol Ê I'm so relieved lol ÊThus, I'm taking back the earlier comment about the service and giving the 5-star that the restaurant duly deserves. ÊKamsahamnida. *********************** (Original) I know the restaurant is going to hate me by posting this, but here I go anyway. One of the reasons we go to restaurants in a large group is that we can try different foods for less money. ÊIt's especially true in the case of Korean BBQ place with lots of Banchans (little side dishes). When we had an event called meetup at this famous Korean BBQ place last year, I wanted to take a full advantage of going in a group (of 10 members) : http://www.meetup.com/LAÉ And we didn't want to spend more than $20 each, so this is what we did: They have all kinds of combinations, and of course servers will recommend ordering several combinations as one combination is supposed to be for 5 to 6 people. ÊBut, usually if you order 2 combinations... I have seen the food being left untouched and I hate to waste food! ÊSo, sorry, servers, but I didn't listen to them (and the reason I didn't give 5 stars is that I was mildly turned off by it, thought it was a little too pushy, but without that, the service and food were just excellent!). ÊI stuck with one order of combination, which is $99 for the following meats and ordered additional Galbi and Bulgogi, one order each. Ê Beef short ribs Rib eye steak Sliced rib eye Seasoned rib eye Beef brisket Pork neck Vegetables Some members ordered extra food on their own, including Yuk hwae and other side dishes. ÊI could have ordered my favorites like pajeon, chap chae, naeng-myeon, or chigae, and if you're a serious meat eater, you might want to add more meat. ÊBut we had nice conversation and just enough food (don't you hate the bloating sensation after gulping food after food at buffets?), I think everyone was happy to pay $19 including tax and tip (beverage excluded, paid individually). Now, next time I visit here, I should go in disguise as they might want to kill me! lol

Korean BBQ is a hit with my family. ÊIt satisfies everyone attending and it's always a good time. ÊWe came here for my Sister and Brother in Law's birthday. ÊHaving the Laker game on was a huge plus for my father since Game 2 Lakers vs Nuggets were on! We arrived with reservations and got the best seat in the house (by the TV). ÊFood here is plentiful and delicious. ÊThe banchans were all tasty in my opinion. ÊWe also ordered the Seafood Pancake (the Korean name is forgotten..) and the Dol Sot BiBimBap. ÊWe also ordered few orders of Bulgogi (Chicken and Steak) and Galbi. ÊDefinitely came out full and stuffed. My husband also commented about the charcoal grilling and how much more flavorful the meats were due to it. ÊI was impressed that I was left with much of the dinner w/o worry of my waitress flipping my meat onto other areas that had raw meat prior... without proper time to heat up the area..kinda skeeves me out (weird I know, but I hate risking food poisoning) The valet made the cramped parking area much more easy for us to endure, since I hate parking in cramped spots. ÊDefinitely a place to hit up again!

After several attempts to find good Korean BBQ, tonight I finally nailed it. Based upon good Yelp reviews, I decided to check it out and see for myself. I wasn't disappointed! The place is in a part of the neighborhood that doesn't stick out as particularly beautiful. Surprisingly, though, the interior was quite nice... modern and clean. Service was prompt, the food was delicious, and the price about the same as the mediocre places I've tried before. This is my new place...

WOW! this is one of the best KBBQ places I have been too. The meat is so tender and juicy and marinated perfectly. My favorite was the short ribs, which they are known for. We even got the vegetables which were grilled and slathered with a special sauce and tasted amazing. The banchan is plentiful and tasted very good. Also had the pancake which was huge and served in a hot pizza pan however it was only alright. I dream about going to this place all the time. It is just that good.

I normally hate KBBQ. ÊNot because I actually hate it, but because it makes me feel like I'm mindlessly stuffing my face to get my money's worth (as with AYCE KBBQ). Thank god Soowon is NOT AYCE!! ÊOur group of 4 ordered Combo B, which has all the beef (brisket, short ribs, sirloin, and pork neck mixed in). ÊThe brisket was my fave by far because there was SO MUCH FAT!! ÊIt tasted SUPREMELY AWESOME, and was not just the crappy leftover beef that most places scrap together to offer you AYCE deals. I also normally don't like pork, but the pork neck order was DELISH. ÊAnd because they do cook EVERYTHING for you, you don't have to worry about cooking your own meat and can thus enjoy conversation and company among friends. ÊLet me also add that the panchan is really good and really tasty here as well. And yes like everyone says, soju is included in the meals which is cool. ÊToo bad it's just one bottle... we had to order a 2nd bottle for our table. Ê So we also ordered an extra order of brisket because it was so good. ÊI don't know how we managed but I feel fine today (morning after!) All in all, Combo B + 1 extra soju + 1 extra beef brisket = $140 including tax and tip. ÊFor 4 people it was more than enough food but being the gluttons that we are... we finished it all. ÊPWNED! $2 valet parking. ÊThe parking guy is super nice btw.

What is there to say about Soowon that hasn't been said? Not that I actually read all 418 reviews. ÊWell, aside from the greatest variety of banchan I've seen so far, this is one Korean BBQ joint where I don't have to grill my own meat (and no, not my meat) 4 stars! Anyhoo, one of my friends was so excited to see a picture menu - and an instruction how to grill meat - Êbut another friend quickly countered and retorted that he finds it very unappetizing and disturbing to see pictures of raw meat on the menu. And come to think of it, this actually makes sense. The sight of uncooked, red meat is not something we'll be drooling or salivating over - no matter the marbling nor how hungry we are, especially right before a meal. I mean, it's not like we're dogs. Ê Just sayin' And like any other Korean BBQ restaurants, be prepared to smell like one for the next 48 hours and try not to have Spot sit on your lap when you get home unless, of course, Êyou want to be his dinner.

Just your standard korean BBQ joint. I initially came here because of the 4.5/5 rating and pretty good reviews. To my disappointment, the place had average flavor and rather expensive for the quantity. Maybe I'm just spoiled with other all-you-can eat korean BBQ places where I cook it myself the way I like it.(Because I eat a damn lot) Average flavor = -1 star, and bad value = -1 star.

This was my first time doing Korean BBQ. ÊSo, I picked this place based on some well-written Yelp reviews. ÊI was certainly NOT let down. Soowon Galbi is a gleaming jewel in the midst of dozens of dumps on Vermont. ÊIt's tucked away in a mini-mall. ÊJust look for the big Jalapeno Taco sign. Anyway, by the time I finally showed up Tyson had already ordered and the first round of meats were sizzling on the grill. ÊMe and the boys did a couple of Soju shots as we waited for the beef to cook. ÊThe plate of uncooked meat was BEAUTIFUL and humongous. ÊI understand that at other KBBQ restaurants you're encouraged to cook it yourself, but I like how the waiters took care of it for us. My favorite part of the whole meal was the dozen or so side dishes that the staff continuously refilled. ÊThe waitresses were suitably hot and gave us a few free drinks. ÊThis places is the bomb. ÊGo.

Went here with friend and 11 month old baby. ÊWe chose this K-BBQ over others becasue they; Ê1) have some of the best ventilation of all K-BBQ places and 2) will cook the food in kitchen for you if you don't want the table burner on. ÊBoth of these were important due to the wandering hands of our little one. The food is top notch quality, and some of the best tasting K-BBQ I've had. ÊService is fast and easy. Ê They have Valet parking for $2 which is what I recommend as parking in K-Town is always a bit dicey.

Very Nice. I had lunch w/friends. we ordered the naengmyeon and kalbi combination. It was very good. Good flavor. Panchan were good, too. Besides kalbi, we didn't try their meat but others seemed to be enjoying it. Good service, clean place Update: Went back for another lunch. The naeng-myeon was good as usual. The panchan (side dishes) were even better than the previous time. The grilled mackerel was 'pretty damn tasty'; expertly cooked and seasoned, juicy, flavorful and tender. It was not at all 'fishy/smelly', as mackerel sometimes can be. Also, the 'bean-paste stew' we got this time was even better. A little spicier, with even more vegetables and good stuff in it. Hoo-ah!

3.5 stars. The ONLY reason I wanted to eat Korean BBQ in LA was for the rice paper. ÊSeriously. ÊWhen I ask for rice paper at Korean BBQ joints in the Bay Area, they have NO idea what I'm talking about. ÊMaybe it's because they don't speak English - but I'm pretty sure they don't offer it either. ÊThe only place I found with rice paper in the bay area is in San Jose, next to an adult store and a homeless camp. ÊPretty sketchy especially at night.. But meat just tastes better wrapped in a giant flat noodle. There is a 2 plate minimum when ordering meats for BBQ. ÊNormally that's fine, but the prices were a little high AND the portions were huge. ÊBetween my boyfriend and I, we were struggling to finish the second plate of meat. ÊThough the quality of the meats were high, it was expensive AND we could barely finish. We had the brisket and the chicken bugolgi. ÊYeah, I know, who orders chicken when eating Korean bbq? ÊBut my boyfriend eats too much red meat and needs to cut down. ÊThe brisket was fresh and the bugolgi was perfectly marinated. They give you a stack about 7 rice papers. ÊNot enough! ÊI could've eaten 3 plates of those at least, but I didn't want to keep asking. The meal comes with a soup, salad, and some sort of steamed egg. ÊI had never had the soup before - it was tasted kind of odd and we didn't finish it. At the end of the meal they gave us the dessert drink - they do make it better in LA. ÊSigh.

This review is a long overdue...but Soowoon galbi rocks! The only "beef" I have with this resto is that their chadol is too fatty sometimes. Ê=p Also too much banchan options. It's really distracting actually. Other than that everything is top quality and they also have a wide range of cuts/varieties. And the presentation is killer...in wooden box/tray. Very good for your money. The combos are great! I have a hefty appetite and spend about $30-40 avg. with tip. The ladies working here are great...always there to flip your meat and refill your banchan when in need. And they have smiley faces on...like real ones. I dread having to eat in large parties, but I don't worry about that here. And I think they also provide you with a small cake of some sort if you tell them it's for a birthday ahead in advance. Parking is always a biotch in k-town.

Geez this place is good. We came here on a Saturday night for a birthday celebration for about 14 people. ÊThey provided with with the section right next to the entrance. ÊIt wasn't bad but since all the tables are bolted down our party got split in two but at least we had part of the restaurant to ourselves. We order a combo A and combo B for everybody. ÊI absolutely loved everything. ÊWhen all the protein was brought out, everything was a beautiful hue of red which meant it was a fresh. ÊEverything was good but I loved the kalbi and the pork belly. ÊIt definitely makes you want to order additional items off the menu. ÊThe seafood pancake was awesome as well. ÊA slight crunch on the pancake and loaded with lots of seafood makes my stomach happy :] Like everybody said, they are generous about their banchan. ÊThere's a few banchan I rarely see at other Korean restaurants so it was fun trying everything out. ÊI especially loved the salad, which is refillable as well. ÊWe must've asked our waiter to refilled it over 6 times. ÊOf course, it comes with unlimited rice paper and thin-sliced radishes to go with the meats as well. Another great thing about Soowon? ÊTheir A+ service. ÊOur waiter for the night was very helpful with all our requests, not to mention he pretty much helped cooked our meat. ÊA lot of places they'll come by, put it on the grill for you and leave, but not him. ÊHe was hovering around our area, helping us out for pretty much the whole night so we can have more time to drink and celebrate haha. As for drinks, they have the usual Korean beer and soju selections, but something that made me like this place even more was that even though they didn't serve flavored soju, the girl up front was nice enough to go out, buy yogurt/calpis and make yogurt soju for my friend since it was his birthday. ÊI don't know if it was just cause we were spending bank or they do it for everyone, but to me, that's going beyond and just made our whole dining experience even better. Overall, a great KBBQ spot with great service and delicious food. ÊIt can be hard to find street parking and some people might rather not park on the street but they do have valet which makes life a little easier on the weekends.

Don't know why there are so many good reviews here. The menu is quite straight forward. Not a lot of BS. My buddy and I got the combo with Pork Belly, Beef Brisket, and BBQ Chicken but we substituted the Pork for Galbi since both of us don't like the belly. ÊAlso came with a bottle of Soju, steamed egg and Soybean Stew. ÊThe quality of meat was very good, the sides were good as the Soybean Stew was actually some of the best I have actually had. The only gripe I have was the server that we had was very aloof and lack luster. ÊWe even spoke Korean to him and they kept forgetting things, etc. Overall, I would come back, just hoping I get a different server.

I've come to expect less than stellar service whenever I eat at Asian restaurants (mom and pop and hole in the wall restaurants that are geared toward the Asian community, not the posh Asian fusion restaurants geared toward the rest of America). We aren't known for our customer service in restaurants. It's part of our culture I guess, so imagine my surprise when service was actually good here! They actually checked on our table multiple times. God, my expections are so low. The BBQ was excellent. Out of the handful of Korean BBQ places I've been to this year, this one has been the best. I recommend the regular/default BBQ dish (at the top of the page). It was awesome. The meat was tender and packed full of flavor. However, our second BBQ dish was pork belly and it was pretty much flavorless and disappointing, so stay away from that dish. Oh yeah, they bring out more banchan if you ask nicely. :)

The meat is mediocre, and small in amounts. ÊEven though I was here with three friends of mine, the Combo C was not enough for all of us. ÊIt was overpriced to say the least, and I was not happy with the poor service. ÊI understand it was closing time, but service was rushed and the quantity of banchan was tiny. ÊI'd have a better time making the banchan at home myself. Ê Its being clean is nice, but that in itself doesn't score points with me. ÊQuality with quantity is what matters when I look at a Korean BBQ place. Ê I know this it not AYCE but it's considerably expensive for the quantity and quality of the meats your receive, when there are so many other cheaper places in Koreatown for Korean BBQ. ÊI am not sold on this place, and the fact that Yelpers all claim that this is the best doesn't make it so. ÊI would rather go to some other place other than Soowon. Ê The parking situation is also rather annoying, as the parking lot was tiny. ÊI'm still hungry. ÊSoowon is not all the hype.

Not bad! but not Great! Pros: The side dishes were plentiful and pretty good. The pork belly and spicy pork were good. The place had a modern decor and it was pretty clean. 2 private "clean" restrooms. Nice! Cons: I wasn't interested in food poisoning! Perhaps it's a KBBQ thing, but I was really shocked when the waitress came over to cut my cooked pork belly on the grill with scissors covered with the "raw" marinade from the uncooked spicy pork, (earlier she had placed the cleaned scissors on top of the "RAW" spicy pork!?!? Before I could ask her to replace them with clean scissors before cutting into my cooked pork belly, she quickly and robotically did her thing before I could get a word in,... damn she was fast! You know what it's like, they buzz in and out with expert speed. Being concerned about food poisoning, I let the pork cook a little longer than I wanted. Argh! It's located in a really small strip mall with limited parking, I had issues giving a guy $2 dollars to move my car 3 feet to park it and then have the same guy give me back the key during lunch because his shift was over. Lame!!! I gave the food 4 stars, but deducted 1 star for "eh" / "questionable" service. Who knows, perhaps ÊI caught them on an "off" day.

Well, the food was very tasty. (That's good.) Waiting for over an hour for a table was not tasty. (That's bad.) However we did get a free beer for waiting so long. (That's good.) But they were out of OB. (That's bad.) So we had Hite instead. (You get the idea, nerd.) They were also out of rice skins, but radish skins made for a good substitute. Add it all up and you get a bit of a mixed bag. Delicious food, a good vibrant crowd (saw a guy in riding pants and a ascot), attentive staff, but a long wait. Really we should have showed up at 10 because that is when people who had finished hours ago finally left their tables.

Though I've only been to two Korean BBQ places so far, this place knocked my socks off when we dined there. 4 of us ate for about $100 total (we had the most expensive combo meal) and were plenty stuffed when we left.

The best Korean BBQ in LA. ÊWe love meat, so this place is perfect for us. We order "B", which is such an incredibly large amount of different types of marinated beef (Rib eye, Galbi, Bulgogi, brisket..). ÊWe exchange the "pork neck" for more bulgogi, and it works out perfect for us. ÊThe place is very very clean, the waiters are professional and nice, they even let me add an extra $2 to my tab to pay the valet. ÊWe love this place, we've been twice, and the food is constantly great. The beef short rib is so tender and flavorable. ÊThis place is great, we think it's amazing, and they deserve the Ê5 stars I'm giving them. ÊEverytime we go, we are stuffed to max, obviously do to the large platter we order.

Meat was great, service was great. Fitting for a high ranking korean bbq joint. However, I can't give this place 4 stars simply because of the unit food per dollar ratio. It's not that I don't want to pay $25 for dinner, it's simply because I'd rather choose to be smart enough to pay less for more elsewhere. There are plenty of All You Can Eat korean bbq out there with great meat and food for the standard pricing that is under $17. Can I justify paying over $20 for korean bbq for merely better service? No that is what tipping is for. I wouldn't mind as much if i didn't feel hungry at the end of it all. Hungry and not satisfied with the amount of food we got for the amount of money we have to pay. -It is just not smart.

Indeed: AMAZING! My bf and myself went this past Saturday. ÊWe gave the car to the valet attendant upon arrival-- $4, I believe. We went inside, with no reservation, and had to wait a little, since it was PACKED. But it was SO WORTH IT! We had the Galbi marinated ribs with the sides the order came with (about 8?), and extra steamed white rice on the side. ÊThe meat was deliciously marinated and the servers were very attentive, so our meat never burned. ÊWe did flip the ribs on the grill a few times ourselves, too.

ÊIt wasn't a problem for us, though, since at the time we both wanted to order Galbi. ÊBut it's good to know for next time. ÊNot sure if 1 person (alone) can have Galbi tabletop grilling, though.

This Korean BBQ place is #1 on the list of korean bbq places in Los Angeles for a reason. The food here is GREAT and the service is pretty much FULL SERVICE! My wife and I have been here a total of 5 times, with 4 for dinner and 1 for lunch (today). We usually order their "D" combo on their menu and substitue the "Pork Belly" for "Bulgogi". Some of the waitresses may say it's not allowed, but it usually is, so just have them ask their supervisor. Pros: Great food, great service, EXTREMELY clean Korean BBQ place with little to no oil on the leather booths/seats. Cons: HORRIBLE parking unless you valet for $1 lunch or $2 dinner, streets are practically filled all the time, too much service at times. The marinated meat is very tasty and the staff stops by more than enough to help you change the sizzling tray or help you place meat on it. I usually tell them not to help us with the meat, but they stare at us like we broke a law. However, they are extremely nice and try to understand you as much as possible because their English aren't well. The combos usually fills up 2-3 average eaters and the sides are unlimited, so you should be full. The combos also come with free Soju or soda, soup, and rice. I absolutely love the "Miso Soup" that they have during dinner, but my wife loves the "Dakon Soup" during lunch. The Miso soup is TOTALLY different because it is completely red and a bit spicy. This place is definitely stop if you are in Korean town. My wife and I even stopped by here 2 days in a row! :D

I could of swore I already rated this place. What can I say. The place is great. The meat is always fresh and the service is spot on. I almost always go in a group of 4+ where we order one of the combos that come with free booze. I try various Korean BBQs around the area, but I come back here more often than any other place. I actually always pick this place when it is my choice. I go to others when it is another persons event. So, come here. Enjoy the food. Enjoy the service. And, if you are not driving, drink a lot.

This place is good but I don't think it's worthy of all the 5 star raves.. Ê I used to come here a long time ago, before all the hype, and the food was much better then, especially the banchan. ÊThey used to give you leek pancakes which were more tasty than the plain ones we had recently. ÊAlso, the kimchi was pretty bad this last time. ÊI'm Korean and when we eat bbq, the kimchi needs to be well fermented so that we can throw it onto the bbq with our meats. Ê I complained about it so the waitress actually brought me some well-done cabbage and radish kimchi from the kitchen. ÊI guess they're trying to cater to a broader palatte now so it seems to be less authentic. We ordered the chadol and the marinated kalbi. ÊBoth were good but the chadol was better. ÊOne of my pet peeves at korean bbq joints is when the waitress/server dumps practically all the meat to cook and this was the case here too. ÊIt doesn't allow you to enjoy your meal because you're in a mad dash to cook it right and stuff your face. ÊWe finally told the server that we'd cook it ourselves. ÊDinner was much more enjoyable after that. The bean paste stew and rice porridge was included in the meal and both were good. ÊI like this place but think that there's better and more affordable places for korean bbq.

After reading great reviews, I've been here twice and have been really impressed. ÊThe quality of the meat that they serve is excellent. ÊThe decor is upscale and modern - nice for a date or going out with friends. ÊDefinitely call ahead, they'll take your name and put it on the waiting list. Ê This place is perfect for groups of 4-8. ÊWith a larger group, then request the space to the side of the hostess stand where there are two 6 ppl tables next to each other. Their banchan is definitely more westernized (egg salad, caramelized potatoes, avocado and cherry tomato salad, etc...), but the ingredients are high quality. ÊYou get kimchi and cucumber kimchi in the banchan. ÊI love cucumber kimchi and that was quickly replenished by the staff. Ê They've got rice paper wrappers, radish wrappers automatically for your meal. ÊIf you want the lettuce leaves, then you'll have to request it. Ê We haven't had too many of the other sides. ÊThe korean pancake was studded with seafood and a big favorite of my fiance. Ê The chapchae is tasty and addictive - nice mix of veggies with the noodles. Like Dan H said, they like cooking the meat for you - so sit back and relax. ÊYum.....And I agree if it's just 2 of you going here, then get one meat dish and then get something smaller like prawns or veggies. ÊWe ended up taking half of our BBQ home to go. We had a little mixup with the waiting line during our dinner, but got really nicely compensated for our trouble by the super nice hostess. ÊA++ service here! Ê Will definitely come back with friends and recommend this place for a long time to come.

Maybe I expected too much - I am always hoping to find places that will beat at least Chosun (yeah, it's clean, yeah, it's nice, but the meat quality? Only so so). ÊThe service was okay. ÊIf I were to go to this place again, I would get ribeye and that's it. ÊThat ribeye alone gets this place an additional star. Valet parking only (albeit cheap).

Food was good, fried tofu side n potatoes were delicious. Enjoyed my Korean BBQ with a raspberry wine ( Myungjak Bokbunja). But I do think that it was overpriced for the amount of food that you get served. Another thing was that our grill was never replaced with a clean one, so we grilled all our food on the same burned grilled.

Everything I tried was tasty and filling. Their pork belly with old kimchee is probably one of the best things I have ever ate. Sometimes a little smokey inside, so keep that in mind, but it is by far the best Korean BBQ restaurant in Los Angeles.

This place should be dubbed "SOO WON-derful!" ÊExcellent customer service, very pristine, delicious pan chan, and tantalizing meat to appeal to even the most discriminating K-bbq'ers. ÊThe portions were very generous and fresh. ÊA few of us took some out-of-towners-carnivorous friends here, and well, this place exceeded their expectations of galbi heaven. Carpooling and wearing stretchy clothes are highly recommend.

The rib-eye and beef tongue was fantastic, but the pan-chan was mediocre at best and not that varied. ÊThe neang-myun was less than appetizing but I was so jonezing for it, I finished it (didn't bother with the broth which was insipid and oddly slightly sour). ÊThey told us they were comping a free teng-jan chi-gae but then we had to ask for it repeatedly along with rice. Ê I agree, the staff was attentive but only until it appeared we finished our ordering a sizable number of dishes. ÊDon't know how/why the reviews are so high but I noticed the crowd wasn't very Korean heavy. ÊOff night or maybe more of a non-Korean crowd restaurant? Either way, I've had better for less ($$$, waiting, crowd, take your pick).

I'm Korean, and I've been living in L.A. 34 years, and been to countless establishments all over Southern California...and this restaurant is hands down, the best. The quality of meat is SUPERB! I swear, I thought I was eating filet mignon, but I assume it's the jumulluk. My friends and I didn't bother to ask...we were too busy enjoying the delicious meat like cavemen. The portions are very generous, and the prices are more than fair. The pork belly and brisket has very little fat...many places offer low quality cuts where the fat makes up the majority of the meat, but not here. The cuts are lean and very fresh. Side dishes were great. I love to cook, and I noticed every side dish was seasoned and presented perfectly. The doenjang-jjigae was the bomb! I couldn't help but eat more, even tho I was stuffed silly. Service was friendly and great, even tho the place was packed. Their unpretentious and honest approach to the food is also reflected in the decor. It's cozy, yet not stuffy. Atmosphere is bright and everything is immaculately presented on their granite table tops. You're not going to see a thousand pics of celebrities posted on the walls in this restaurant. I think they are secure and confident enough in their food and service (as they should be) to adorn their walls with unneccessary displays of popularity. As long as they keep doing what they are doing...this place will become a landmark, if it isn't already. People were still filing in well after 9 pm. I know their specialty is Korean bbq, but I have a strong feeling their other dishes are equally delicious. You should valet, it's L.A....live with it. But if you seriously don't want to spend a few bucks, then find street parking. My only complaint is...I wish it was closer to home. But I have finally found a great Korean restaurant in L.A.! Compliments to the chef and owner! Bravo! and Thank You!

I totally enjoyed eating here! My friend and I split the combo that is recommended for 2 people. It included beef brisket (yum!), pork belly and marinated chicken. It also came with a starter salad, plenty of the vegetable side dishes and a bottle of soju for us to split. Beef brisket was a winner, pork belly was good (but oh so fatty), and chicken was the least interesting meat, but we also ate it last after our appetites were waning. When I think of what makes a KBBQ place good, one of the important details is whether they have good banchan, and whether they bring you a little more when you ask. I've had the experience at another KBBQ place of being completely ignored when I asked for more banchan (twice). The staff at Soowon is friendly, and was very obliging when we asked for more rice blankets, kimchi, broccoli, and bean sprouts. They also offered to bring us some steamed rice, but we had plenty to eat without the rice. With tax and tip we spent about $50, which was a very fair deal considering how good the experience was. That included the small bottle of soju (which was enough alcohol for us to enjoy a little buzz throughout the meal, but of course, your mileage may vary on that). I would definitely return to Soowon.

Surreal. By far the best Korean restaurant I have been to. I try not to give out too many 5 stars, but under the Korean cuisine category, Soowon Galbi takes the cake. The second you arrive inside the atmosphere is very modern and clean. Two characteristics that are not norms at a korean restaurant. With the amount of people that go through this restaurant, it is amazing how clean they manage to keep it. It being busy made me know from the start that the food was going to be fresh and delicious. The first thing i noticed when i opened the menu was that it was fool proof. it explained everything from the basics of how to eat korean bbq including the side dishes and how to cook. This comes in very handy when you bring friends along that have never eaten korean food before. The ambiance of the restaurant is a mix between a homely, family outing but is also is perfect for a group dinner with friends. But the real story here is the food. If you are a carnivore, prepare to be wowed. The choices are endless. You can start off with the traditional galbi/bulgogi, which is seasoned perfectly and trimmed of gristle. It is not overly salty which tends to happen when restaurants sit on the meat for too long in the marinade, but a perfect light seasoning that compliments the charbroil cooking. The chicken and pork were also amazing; well prepared and the ability to cook it to your liking is definitely a plus (along with something to do while you socialize with family and friends). Then you have your choices of rib eye steaks and for the connoisseurs thinly sliced beef tongue, which has the perfect taste of beef and chewiness when you get that nice sear on charcoal. Along with all the meats, you get the unlimited side dishes which tasted all fresh. Everything from the fried sweet potatoes to the quickly tossed steamed spinach in sesame seed oil, everything was divine. With all the lettuce wraps and rice paper, each bite of meat mixed with a side dish was like eating a different entree. You have so many choices, but when you find the combination that you like, each bite is like heaven. Then we have the "real" korean food in my opinion. Being korean, I feel i am pretty particular about korean restaurants. But the dishes I have tried here made me feel like i am at a family reunion and my aunts from korea made my favorite entrees. The chigaes(soups) were just sublime. Perfect balance of savory and spicy that balances out with a spoonful of rice. The different layers of flavor is just amazing. I was able to taste the broth, meats, and veggies as it supported each other, unlike other korean restaurants that tends to be overpowered by spicy red pepper paste and the bean curd in their stews. I guess I could add in about the service, which i feel is not as important as the quality of the food, but our waitresses were phenomenal. They were all very kind and attentive and made sure we were comfortable. I think the main thing most yelpers should know about Soowon kabli is that their staff is very helpful and if you simply ask, they are willing to make your night out very memorable.

This is the reason why you come to LA. It makes the traffic, smog, and pretentious drivers all worthwhile. As if the long rib gal bi that melts in your mouth and endless panchan was not enough, the staff was super friendly and happily will bring you more water, beer, panchan - even if you don't ask in Korean. =) Simply fantastic.. and not too expensive either!

Where to begin? ÊThe gluttonous amount of meat brought to the table? ÊThe copious amount of intriguing yet unknown side dishes? ÊThe large and incredibly cheap bottles of Hite and OB beer? No, I'm getting ahead of myself. ÊPerhaps we should just start at the beginning. ÊOr so I was hoping to do when I started this review. ÊUnfortunately I became overwhelmed with life's other responsibilities and have now mostly forgotten exactly what we ordered. ÊI guess I'll just have to go back, poor me. I do know that nearly every item was delicious. ÊI think we ordered a combo meal that came with several different types of meat, all cooked excellently on the communal stove, and served with more side dishes than I could count. ÊThere was barely enough room on the table for our forks and plates. I know this review isn't much, but I highly recommend this place. ÊI know I'll be returning.

Disclaimers: I went with people who could speak Korean, so they did all the ordering and such. I'm not sure if I was on my own as a non-Korean how that would affect the experience. Food: Good. Fatty meat. Unlimited side order refill apparently. 6 of us, all we could possibly eat, and some drinks (beer) cost us about $20 a piece. For the amount the guys were ordering (which was crazy and obscene), I would say that is very fair. Parking: Pull into the parking lot in front if you can. I was barely off the sidewalk I believe. Cost me $2. By the time I came out it was nicely parked. MAKE RESERVATIONS, else you can wait easily for 45 minutes before being seated. They will call your cell phone if you ask them and go to a bar while waiting. Bathrooms: Clean. Yay. Enjoy!

Getting hungry for some good quality korean bbq. ÊHmmm where should I go eat? ÊKoreatown sounds great. ÊI have eaten here before and it was a pleasant meal: And, It getting close to dinner time, ÊLets call them. Hello ( everything in korean) Are you guys open? ÊYes. Are you guys busy? No. If I get there in 30 mins will I need to wait? ÊNo. Can I make a reservation just in case? ÊNo need to. There is tons of seats open. Arrive and Park in valet. ÊWalk into restaurant. Talk to the hostess. ÊWe ask for table. ÊShe says will need to wait 30 mins. (Translation for you yelpers Ê30 min wait does NOT mean 30 mins wait). I tell her that I called. Hmmm nothing but a rude stare back. I informed her that I tried to make a reservation. Ê She points to her wall and says that all reservations have been taken. hmmm interesting. Ê She then points out that everyone just came into the place and were all seating at the same time. Ê Really???? All at the same time?? The whole place??? And it will only take 30 mins for someone who just sat down to order the meat, grill the meat, eat the meat, and pay promptly. Me thinks not. ÊI inform hostess of my opinion of her, the person who lied to me on phone, and of the place. I ended eating at Moodaepo just down the street.

Soowon Galbi is now my FAVORITE Korean BBQ restaurant! Went with a few friends and we ordered combo B.......more than enough for the three of us. The Pan Chan was fresh and tasty and they bring refills without giving you a dirty look(unlike some other KBBQ places that I've been to) The meat was SOOOOOOO Êgood and beautifully presented. Service was friendly and fast. The restaurant is in a typical strip mall, but once you get inside, you will not think about that.....the restaurant is clean and modern. The Hostess was super sweet.

What else can I say about this place other than it's off the HOOK! I was not too excited about the parking since the lot was small, but luckily there is a valet service ($2). When you're there be prepared that you're going to have some good shower after eating since all those charcoal smell will get to your clothing and stays. What makes them good is that they have charcoal on the burner, whereby usually other places just uses gas. I went with two other friends and ordered the combo. We're all hungry coming from Disneyland and by the end of our meal, we are VERY satisfied. The combo comes with the pork belly and then some bulgogi and chicken. The appetizers were very generous and delicious too. We finished off our meal with shikye, it was really good. I was quite impressed since that was the first time I am having that drink. It's non-alcoholic, the waiter said that it was rice water and some tea. Service was really good too. They are very attentive and not rushing you to go after finishing your meal. We even got to think that they don't want us to go, LOL. We came in for dinner on a weekday and they are packed when we came in and when we left. We end up paying $25 each including the over 15% tips. This place is definitely a keeper. It's the BOMB!

I've been to better in K-town. The meat quality is good but the price outweighs the benefits... The sides were also "Meh...". It was super busy Saturdays around 6pm.

As we were planning our trip down south to Disneyland and LA I looked up Korean restaurants. I found Soowon and started to read the reviews. I instantly wanted to check it out, mentioned it to my hubby and it was on our agenda. I didn't look at the pictures of the restaurants just read the reviews. It's definitely in a ghetto looking place BUT the restaurant in itself was nicely decorated and modern. It is one of the NICEST Korean restaurants I've been to and believe me I've been to a LOT in the bay area esp being married to a Korean :) We arrived around 3pm on a Monday afternoon. We were seated away from everyone else because we had kids with us. Good thing too cause our kids can get pretty loud hahaha. We ordered the galbi, shrimp and side pork. The galbi was REALLY good along with the sides but our favorite has to be the salad. ÊService was great. The lady cooked, cut and served us our food. We plan to visit again but next time with my father-in-law :) Definitely check this place out if you're planning to visit LA for some awesome Korean BBQ!

Excellent KBBQ! ÊExcellent service. A Rated. Our party of 23 took over 1/2 the restaurant and they gave us one section of the restaurant that has 32 seats with 5 tables so our group from http://www.AsianFoodies.É had a sorta semi private KBBQ party. ÊThat paired with the 1/2 off Soju, our table rocked! We had a table of 5 and we ordered the $80 Combo B. It was great. The meats and presentation was all very high quality! Love the King Oyster Mushrooms... wished we had a few more slices of the mushrooms. I also ordered the Chap jae and it was also great... I do wish it had some black fungus and a bit more beef, but it was very tasty nonetheless. I ordered a plate of the spicy marinated pork which was probably my fav. Bold flavor, a little heat and very tender. I'm very glad we ordered it because it was one of my favs, but we probably shouldn't have as we were so full it was over the top. We drank a LOT of Soju taking full advantage of the 1/2 off special deal. The service was excellent and especially great because fellow Yelper Alyssa was working at the restaurant this evening and was very helpful with our order selection. Food and service definitely 5 stars. Just a couple minor suggestions... In addition to the rice noodle wrappers and the pickled daikon to wrap the meat, I'd suggest you also add lettuce. (Update: Alyssa said that they do provide lettuce free upon request) I didn't request lettuce and you might serve if we had asked, but that would be nice. I found it weird that the server didn't want me cooking our food. I was a little annoyed when he took away the tongs to make it more difficult. Some diners enjoy/prefer to cook themselves and should have that option. The restaurant is clean, modern and a good menu. The panchan was all good. The bean paste for the meat was excellent. This is the most important sauce as it will make or break the flavor of the meats that don't have any marinade. Our BBQ grill is gas and charcoal with good ventilation. No smokiness, no problems. I thought is was a gas only grill. They put a water pan under the coals which I'm told also helps reduce smoke. Prices are average, maybe a little higher than average, but the quality and quantity of the meats make it an excellent place and fair value. The beef had absolutely gorgeous marbling of fat! Our table cost us $30/person after tax before tip. A good price considering we over ordered and drank a ton of Soju. I think we could have been full and no Soju for under $20 before tax/tip. So with this quality, it's a far better deal than most AYCE KBBQ joints which has meat quality many notches below this place. We are definitely coming back here again! This place is in my top 5 KBBQ places in K-town! With the Soju special it nudges ahead into my top 3. I had Steph at my table... the Spice Princess, so we could have used some really hot peppers/spice for her. I didn't use the restrooms but the place does have an A rating. I set the meeting time for 7pm, but in the future, I'll set it for 7:15pm so that if you arrive at exactly 6:59pm you can snag free street parking on Vermont. Otherwise pay $2 for valet parking or look on 9th for free parking after 6pm which is what I did. No valet, free parking from 2-5:30pm.

I can't believe I keep forgetting to put up a review of this place. ÊMy last outing was with Craig H. ÊThere were amazing vittles to be had. ÊWe split a combo #3 (I think), which had beef brisket, marinated beef something-or-rather, chicken, and pork belly... all tasted great. ÊIn addition to the numerous side dishes, we also got soju with the combo. ÊEverything had great flavor, and only the shear pain of my bloated stomach kept me from ordering more. This wasn't a perfect dining experience, however. The broken English posed a problem, as we couldn't communicate with the servers well. ÊBut in summary, I wish they would trust us to cook our own food, instead of their doing it for us (I guess we looked like we would maim ourselves). ÊOne other thing, they ran out of rice paper. ÊHow does a Korean restaurant run out of this? That's like an Irish restaurant running out of potatoes. Also out of principle, I don't like the idea of paying $28 for a ribeye steak... it's not better than the Ranch Reserve steaks you can get at Vons on sale for $3.99/lb. ÊCan we bring our own and they just charge us a "steakage" fee?

Wayyyy better than those all you can eat buffet style places. The seafood pancake is bombay!! Service was exceptionally great! The side dishes were on the small side, but considering you can ask for more, it was fine. We had 7 people sharing 2 sets of side dishes. I don't recommend going to this place with more than 7 people unless you're willing to sit at different tables. They place charcoal over the fire to give that extra bbq kick. SOoo good...The meat is tender. We ordered 4 plates of meat, a seafood pancake, 2 sodas and 4 Hite beers. We paid about $186 (meal + tax + 15% tip) Highly recommend if you're the typical all-u-can-eat korean bbq eater. Try it, now!!

Alyssa Min L., the owner, wrote me a message apologizing about my experience and invited me back for kkot sal on the house. ÊLike I have said before, I don't write Yelp reviews to get free meals so most likely, I will not go back to claim my free kkot sal (although I should never say never). ÊI do appreciate her message and sincerity. ÊIt looks like they care about customer service after all. ÊFor that reason, I'm bumping up my review to 3*.

Soowon BBQ is a la carte Korean BBQ, and a pricey one much like ChoSun and Park's BBQ. Nonetheless, you get what you pay for, and the food doesn't disappoint. When I went a couple days ago with a friend, we ordered the house special kalbi, the kkot sal (sliced rib eye beef), and samkyupsal (pork bacon). First off, the house banchan was solid. I was expecting more in variety and original selections considering the restaurant's price range, but it was still decent. The dipping sauces were the typical oil and sweet soy sauce combo. As for the beef itself, the kkot sal rib eye was good stuff. The meat quality was good, as was the taste and texture. The samkyupsal was good, although the one at Park's is better. The highlight of the night is definitely the house special Soo Won kalbi. It was sooooo good. Perfect taste and texture. In all, I would give this restaurant a good recommendation. Although the food at Park's, ChoSun, and Soot Bull Jeep are slightly better, SooWon is still a top notch ahead of much other Korean BBQ restaurants in K-Town. Definitely above all the AYCE places. The restaurant uses real charcoals under their metal grill. The restaurant ambience is nice and clean. And the service is phenomenal. The waiter literally cooks the meat for you and slices it up very often. You'll probably never find a Korean waitstaff in K-Town that's so attentive to your food. I'd recommend the restaurant just for that. But my 4 star rating goes to the food taste/quality only.

I am in 'love' with this place! I am a big KBBQ eater, so the quality of the food is really fresh and tasteful. Since I'm also really picky, I couldn't find anything wrong with everything I ate...bc it all tasted SO GOOD! The price is a bit more pricey then what I normally pay for KBBQ but it was really worth it. I'm saving this spot for every LA trip :}

Since i was lonely in my dorm, i called Êmy family and told them to come to la and take me out to eat. i had the privilege to decided to eat (YESSSSSSSS), and being an avid meat eater, i chose to eat at a gogi place. ÊStill a ktown noob, i had to yelp a place to eat at, and lo and behold, this place came up first. and guess where i took my family. whoooooo gogi! Their meat wasnt the greatest but their service was awesome! Êno annoyed ahjumas mad doggin' or unresponsive waiters. Êfreakin' awesome. Êmaybe it was because we went during the lunch time and there was barely anyone there. about their meat: my famiry ordered the $99 combo. Êhigh balllin'! ...... kinda. beef brisket- could have been more fresh. Êthe color wasnt the perfect ruby red that it should be. Ênonetheless, i ate like a hippo since this was the first kind to be grilled. others- fresh enough. Êyummy yum yums. one more thing: ÊTHEY HAVE THE BEST BANCHANS (side dishes). Êthe potato thing is the bestestestestest. Êi wanted them to give me seconds and thirds, but i had to control myself and save my tummy for glorious gogi. i think that's about it. Êif you're a noob like me, go to this place. Êit's not disappointing. ÊIf you know a better place, tell me and maybe we can go and be hipppos together.

Although I was waiting for someone who was running late, they sat me at a table... even after waiting an hour or so and observing that a line was forming during this period, they were still polite enough to take my order and provide quality service when my friend arrived. They provided a wide variety of banchan and cooked our meat. The beef was delicious and the seafood pajeon had a lot of flavor. There was more than enough food to feel stuffed without feeling like I should have opted for AYCE haha. Highly recommended! =)

Frequency: Regular :) Valet parking for $2. They have to maximize space in tiny parking lot and I get to eat so no complaints. **If you arrive after 2PM/before 5PM, parking is FREE. No Valet service required.** Service is to the T. Always so attending! Lunch: Very good price, excellent choices, and abundant serving. Husby and I only paid $22 + tax. YUM! Dinner: Had the D combo for only $39.99 and 2 rice bowls, 2 soups, salad, soda, and got three diff kinds of meat: pork belly, chicken bulgogi, and brisket. It was absolutely delish! Overall: Prices are reasonable for the amount and quality of the food.

The service is excellent here. The seating is a bit compact though and I ended up smelling like Korean BBQ for the rest of the night. This place seems extremely busy, the staff is fast and they even have a button you can press that will summon your waiter. The food was excellent, I wish my colleage from Seoul had been around to evaluate the food, but I think he would have enjoyed it. The meats were great and the side dishes were also great. The beef tongue and spicy pork ended up being a win win. Next time I will try the raw beef and the pancakes.

I went there this past weekend with my family. Based on the 4.5 stars reviews on yelp, I went with high expectations. Service was steller. Most korean restaurants don't have waitress/waiters who smile each time they come by. Service is the best I've ever experienced in a korean restaurant. The meat and the side dishes were good, but I've had better/fresher in other korean restaurants. I might go back with a big group. It's pricey though, but I think their combo menus are good for big parties. Our price per person came out to be about $35/person. Everyone was full afterwards.

The food here is just down right awesome! The taste and service is definitely top notch in LA area. All the complimentary banchan are soooo delish!! The large short rib beef is sooo tender and yummy! ÊIt's a great place for a small group of people to get together and order the combination of meat and share. The price is really good for the quality and quantity of meat. The best part is that this is the first Korean BBQ that I've been to where you don't come out of the restaurant all smelly. The don't use butter on the grill which minimizes the fume and smoke, and makes food just that much healthier and tastier. (I'm not a fan of excessive and non-meaningful butter).

Came here for my birthday this year. This place is not AYCE. ÊBut their meat was good and tasty. ÊThe rib eye was the best. I was a little disappointed b/c I thought the meat would have more of the marinade taste. ÊOr, perhaps, I remember another AYCE Korean BBQ that had really tasty thinly sliced beef/pork and I was comparing it to this place. ÊPlus, it wasn't AYCE. ÊBut ÊI guess that's a good thing! =) The restaurant is kinda small but it looks modern and new and clean.

I don't what happened. This place is raved about on yelp and I thought it was going to be a slam dunk. My friends from NYC were in town, one of whom is Korean and has taken me to some pretty solid places, so I wanted to return the favor. I had gone to Genwa the month before which set the bar and Soowon fell short. The food was good... nothing to really complain about. But the quality of the meat wasn't anything special, the banchan didn't have much variety and it was just ok, service was a bit lackluster. Just... not... that... great.

WOW...WOW. ÊI have never been to Korean BBQ, but this place made the first impression phenomenal. ÊThe hostess was so attentive and, even though we were not waiting long for a Friday night dinner, she was extremely apologetic. ÊThen when I scoped out the place, every table had its own grill. ÊThat meant for me, "Playing with my food when my mom wouldn't let me!" ÊYAAAAAAAY! ÊWhen we started our meal, all these little dishes were brought out to us as appetizers. ÊI didn't know what a whole bunch of them were, but it was exciting to try every dish! ÊThe BEST part was the meat, lots and lots of meat. ÊI was in heaven! ÊGO TO THIS PLACE WHEN YOU ARE CELEBRATING A SPECIAL OCCASION (because it is pricey). The only complaint I have is, I understand it is a Korean restaurant, but it's a Korean restaurant in L.A. ÊCome on. ÊThe waiter has to minimally speak and understand the English language. ÊWe would ask the waiter what we were eating and he explained through sign language. ÊUuhhh, thank God I don't have a certain food allergy. ÊYikes.

I've recently found myself frequenting many AYCE KBBQ places, you know, the ones that serve you two types of meat for ten bucks a pop in shady unclean areas with even shadier service. ÊYeah, those. ÊThe visit to Soowon last night was supposed to be yet another one of those mundane AYCE experiences. ÊThanks to my friend's misinformed decision, it wasn't at all like anything I've ever experienced, oh no, not even close. Immaculately pristine shiny grills sitting in dark marble table tops. Ê ÊIncredibly clean eating utensils. ÊChairs that actually looked inviting, stylish even, and not displeasing in the slightest. ÊWait, am I even in a Korean BBQ restaurant? After being seated, our hostess warmly answered all of our questions, making sure we all felt comfortable with the menu. ÊWe ordered both the B and C combos and expected much less than what we got. ÊWhen the banchan started coming, they seemed never ending. ÊThere must have been at least 10 different dishes! ÊI usually only eat the kimchi, but after tasting the potato dish, I couldn't help myself to the whole dish; it just melts in your mouth into a sweet/savory paste of deliciousness. ÊAmazing. ÊWhen we saw our order of meat stacked in the most visually appealing way a platter of raw meat can be arranged, we knew this place meant business. ÊI particularly enjoyed the sliced rib eye: a rich beefy taste with slight nutty undertones from the interlaced fat. ÊYou could literally taste the freshness as it slowly melts away on your palette. ÊDamn good. What's even more amazing, though, was the service. ÊNot only did the servers help us cook our meat to perfection, they were able to keep track of how much meat was going onto each of our respective grills. ÊWhen my friends couldn't wait to take the seemingly done pork belly off the grill, one of the servers swooped by and told us, in a motherly Korean tone, that the pork belly wasn't ready to be eaten yet and subsequently helped our meat reach its optimal level of deliciousness. ÊWho does that nowadays? ÊWhen we finished with our meat, we looked at the time and realized we were running late for the concert we had to catch. ÊHaving not yet been served the soup and rice that was meant to round off the meal, we asked our hostess to just cancel it for us. ÊShe sincerely apologized even though it wasn't her fault and made sure we notified her of our next visit. All-in-all, incredibly hospitable service, true charcoal grills, extremely fresh quality ingredients, and a clean enjoyable setting provide for the best Korean BBQ experience you can get for your money . ÊSure, it's a bit more expensive than your average KBBQ joint, but after eating here, I don't think I can stomach anything less than the standards set by Soowon. ÊI will be back!

I've only been here for lunch, but it was fantastic! It was the perfect combo for a hot day - kalbi and mul nang myun. Only thing was that rice didn't come with the lunch combo, Parking was easy on the residential street around the corner. Lovely little gem of a place. Super clean, reasonably priced, and friendly waitstaff. Pros: Didn't automatically give my white friend a fork. Easy parking. Great value. Really clean. Friendly. Cons: rice not included with the lunch special we got.

Soowon Galbi is a great introduction to Korea Town. After searching extensively online for the one place to try on my visit to LA for KBBQ, I settled on Soowon because the general consensus was that it was the best around. Since I haven't tried other places in LA, I can't compare, but I can say it hands down knocks the socks off of any place in San Francisco. Unlike LA, Korean BBQ in San Francisco is obscure and sad. Every place I've tried in San Francisco is expensive, tastes stale, and is incredibly busy. Oh, and the service is slow, indifferent, and generally hostile to boot. Soowon Galbi is the mirrior image. We stopped here for lunch, and were immediately seated at an immaculately clean table by a friendly host. The menu was extensive, but we both ordered the chicken, which came out quickly and in the most delicious, tangy ginger marinade. To make things even better, the staff volunteered to cook the food for us. Soowon's attention to details was also evident in the side dishes, which were amazing appetizers while the chicken cooked in front of us. Their kim chi is to die for. The staff even cut the chicken into small pieces before serving it, making it easier to eat. Everything at this place is first rate. The next time I'm back in LA, I will definitely stop here!

If you're in the mood for some filling Korean BBQ, I suggest another near by place called Tahoe Galbi. After reading awesome positive yelp reviews, I decided to visit this place tucked behind a taco place - with barely any parking, I reserved a table, and enjoyed their $100.00 plate with some friends. It was truly a variety of selections accompanied by tons of Korean sides-however, the reason why I truly enjoy Korean BBQ is not only because of the delicious meat, but because I get to cook my meat the way i like it. This place didn't quite let my friends and I truly enjoy our dinner. I don't know whether it was because we weren't Korean enough lol but we couldn't get over the staff trying to push us along and finish our meals. In the end, it totaled to more than what we could have paid at an all you can eat k-bbq restaurant, and we still weren't very full. The utensils we trendy and hip along with the restaurant itself, but seriously, too pricey for what it truly is, too much into aesthetics with their metal chopsticks, and not too friendly.

Somewhere in all 300+ reviews of Soonwon Galbi, I read in a fellow's review that this place posses the 'sexy bbq if not the SEXIEST'. It made me wandered two things: 1) what prompts a guy to find sliced beef sexy? 2) or Is he talking about the hostess that works there because she is indeed one hot sexy m-f. This is a place where you would go and abuse the 'get-your-ass-over-here' waitress button because of the quality of service that you'd receive upon summoning the hotest number in town, k-town. When I mean quality, I mean flawless facial structure, pristine skin tone with sparkling dark piano black eyes and authentic asian features. And yet I've only talked about the neck up...regarding the rest, well, you just have to go and see... Edit: Ok, I just reviewd that post by that guy again and I found this "I love food and I love alcohol, but there's nothing like having them both at once in perfect harmony, it's kinda like sex but only better." People. There's no bbq, or korean-bbq for that matter that is better than sex. This guy is obviously in love with the hostess.

I really like the marinades that they use here. ÊI ordered the season short rib, the sliced rib eye, pork neck, and chicken. ÊThey were all outstanding. ÊMy girlfriend also wanted a kimchi pancake, something that we couldn't find on the menu and the waiter told us that they'd make it for us. ÊIt was pretty good for an item that isn't on the menu. ÊThey give a good amount of side dishes. There's a little bit of a language barrier with some of the waiters and waitresses. ÊAlso, as the dinner went through, attentiveness began to taper off.

Korean BBQ is hands down one of my favorite foods. With that said, I've tried many and this place was a hit. We came here on a Saturday night and of course expected to wait. 45 mins. The aroma of the sizzling beef through-out the restaurant was hard to take since we were all starving but was worth the wait. Ê We ordered the $79 combo meat special. It says it feeds 4 but I would say it's enough to feed 3 adults to their hearts content. All the side dishes were very fresh and tasty. The radish soup was really good. They do have steam egg by request but ran out. Bummer. They also had the thin rice noodle to wrap your beef but when we asked for more, they ran out. Big bummer. Other than that, the meat was excellent. Very good marinade on the kalbi. The service was awesome. The guy that waited on us was very attentive and nice. We asked for plenty refills of a variety of the panchan and he brought it quickly with a smile. This place is also very kid friendly. They brought my 4 year old her very own kids plate and utensils. It was a very nice touch. The atmosphere was nice and clean. If you plan to eat here on the weekends, they do take reservations but call at least 3-4 days ahead. I'm def a fan of this place. A must try!!

I have eaten at probably dozens of korean bbq places in my life, but this place is highly recommended. The best thing about this place is probably the service you get (service also means free dishes too). They tend to help you cook the meat without you asking, which is that first time I have ever seen that. Also, the staff is very accommodating to customers who do not know the menu or how customs are. The meat was pretty good. I never really ate sirloin at a gogeecheeb before, but I enjoyed it. It gets pretty pricey if you keep ordering, like my buzzed friends did. A party of 8 spent about $200, and 1 didn't really eat and another didn't end at all. So that is about $25 plus per person. Like most places in Koreatown, the soju here is about $12 each bottle. It takes a lot of them to get wasted, but a lot little bit is good with meat, especially samgyeopsal (Korean bacon). The staff are so friendly that it makes you want to come back.

Finally it was the time for Soowon Galbi, Andrew H. brought my attention to this restaurant and Ben F. and his non stop Korean BBQ reviews kinda forced me to try KBBQ and last but not least my review No. 200 had to be a special one. Ocha's (my favorite Thai restaurant) is across the street, so I am familiar with this area. Parking can be a challenge and according to my 5 year old daughter it is a 'creepy neighbourhood'. Regardless these negative characteristics, we made our way to Soowon Galbi. It was the first time ever going to a KBBQ place and we did not know what to expect. The people in front of us could not help us either, it was for them also the first time, they read about Soowon on the Internet (wonder if it was yelp?). We had to wait in line for about 30 minutes before we got seated, but the building smelt soooo good so it was worth waiting, we reckoned. We ordered the BBQ Shrimp, Beef Brisket and BBQ Pork, our table was quickly filled with little plates with all kind of unknown items. We felt like a fish in a sandbox, and had the idea that everybody was looking at our table, realizing that we did not know what to do with all the food (well that is not really true, we do know how to BBQ). Well our first experience with Korean BBQ was good and different, I guess we need to hire the service of a KBBQ tour guide, to show us the ropes of eating Korean food the real way. Thanks to Andrew H. and Ben F. for making us aware of a new way of enjoying food.

What a way to pop my ktown korean bbq cherry! I've heard the korean food was better in LA compared to any part of the USA (and even Korea) but I wasn't expecting to have my taste buds knocked off their proverbial socks!! The super marbled unmarinated ribeye was one of the most tender tasty cuts of beef I've ever had. Put some rice on it, pickled cucumber, dip in that salt soy sauce, and wrap in rice paper and you have the equivalent to Jessica Alba in your mouth. Rinse and repeat with the marinated Soowon Galbi until one of your pant buttons fly off from your bloated stomach.

Soowon is NOT all you can eat, which is a little surprising with KBBQ. ÊI went with some friends so we ordered a few different meats and split it. ÊIn order to get a decent portion the total came to $30/person. I was hoping the lack of all you can eat would lead to higher quality food, but the quality was about the same as that of Tahoe, which is all you can eat and only $22/person. I would recommend you skip Soowon and head to Tahoe for your KBBQ. They do take credit card and there is valet parking outside of Soowon for $3.

I wanted to find a place close to the Convention Center where we would be visiting this year's L.A. Art Show, and my choice of Soowon turned out to be somewhat prescient due to the number of talented Korean artists whose works were displayed at the show (on second thought, we should have gone home and watched Joon-Ho Bong's Mother to complete the Korean-themed trifecta...oh well, maybe next time). Parking was a bit limited in the mini-mart lot, but we managed to snag a space normally reserved for the check cashing company. We ordered the house specialty Soowon marinated galbi along with the bulgogi. The galbi was probably the most flavorful and tender I have had. In addition, the banchan were fresh & tasty, and their presentation was a little artsier than the typical KBBQ. Paired with a bottle of Chamisul soju, this was close to the perfect meal. We had to ask the wait staff several times for water and rice, and while this normally would earn a demerit, we never had to wait for more than a few minutes until someone was at our table to either tend to the cooking meat or check on our needs. At one point, my wife asked for more of the fish cakes, and when the waitress returned with more bean sprouts it naturally begged the question: Do the two dish have an inverse relationship? If we ask for more bean sprouts, do we get fish cakes? Further test trials are required before we present our findings at the annual Ordering In A Foreign Language Conference.

A little pricey, but the meat and all the various kim chi on the side is well worth it. The sides goes hand and hand with the meat they serve. This place is a sit down, bbq place, so be prepared to smell like korean bbq when you decide to come here. ÊThe server do most of the cooking for you, so don't worry about the multitask of eating and cooking. My 2 cents, get their SOOWON Galibi special marinade meat ($35). It is the cut where it is one bone and they basically roll the meat out on the grill.. So tender, and sweet. If it ain't for that, I wouldn't have korean bbq craving. (Very Very tasty order)

ÊValet parking $2. **Update 8/16/10: ÊAlyssa from Soowon Galbi emailed to let me know that garlic is served upon request. Ê I'll definitely be back for more of the delicious food and STELLAR service!!

Found this restaurant off of the many reviews from yelp and to no surprise yelpers hit the nail on the head once again! Have been craving Korean BBQ for a while now and this was the perfect place. The food was absolutely delicious. Got the marinated beef ribs, sooo mouth watering! And of course, they give you all the sides to pair with your meats. If your craving KBBQ and in the area I highly recommend you check this place out. Ê***Side Note: Its in a little shopping center and their isn't a whole lot of parking but be patient, the food is worth it!**

The location is a little questionable (shady little stripmall, unimpressive exterior), and parking on a Sat. night is awful but the food makes up for it. The banchan is fresh and plentiful, with more than basic kimchi, beansprouts and cold fare some places give, their daenjang chigae is pretty good, and their bulgogi and kalbi is delish!

LOCATION: -The funny thing is that the plaza it is in looks terrible, but their restaurant looks great hahaa inside and outside. FOOD: - ÊI had the combo with my friend, and verry filing, that is three meats. NOT MARINATED. It tastes great !! there are more than the usual side dishes. PRICES: ÊIt's marinated well. expect to pay$$, the cheapest combo is about 43 dollars. the most is about 100. and its not all you can eat...... but will fill you up! SERVICE: Wondering always comes back. cooks for you, makes sure all your needs are assisted. VENUE: - It's really clean and nice inside. I like the setting. Constant AC so you can breathe more. Some BBQ places vents aren't strong enough PARKING: - You REALLY must valet, they work off commission i believe, but its terrible finding parking spaces..

The food there besides BBQ are just so-so, which includes the side dishes and Êothers such as the seafood pancake and cold noddle. With the high price there, people expect more and better quality; yet, the small portion of meat comes and taste just OK. Yes, $2 parking in K-town is cool, the restaurant is clean, but if you ask me what is the different to others Korean BBQ, i really can't tell.

What there's not to like about Korean food? ÊKoreans love eating Êlots of meat, specifically bbq. ÊThey love hot and spicy soups. ÊThey know how to properly prepare seafood. ÊKorean bbq is on my Êrotation of ethnic food that I try to eat at least once a week. ÊI am very fond of korean bbq and this restaurant definitely serves the best galbi I've ever tasted. ÊI took my brother to this restaurant and we both agree the galbi is the best we've ever had. ÊWe also ordered the tongue and unlike most of the Korean bbq dishes, the tongue was not seasoned at all. ÊRegardless, the tongue was thinly sliced and was perfect when eaten at a medium rare. ÊWe finished our meal with the egg roe soup. ÊThe broth was beautiful and it satisfied our need for something hot and spicy. Ê We came here on a Saturday afternoon and expected the restaurant to be crowded. ÊSurprisingly, there were only 5 other tables filled with customers. ÊThe area is crowded and it was hard for us to find the restaurant. And we missed the turn and it took quite a bit of effort to turn around and find parking. ÊWhen we walked to the restaurant, we saw they had valet parking and we would have gladly paid for valet, as opposed to trying to find a parking spot in the area. The food is not cheap but it is well worth paying the price for the higher quality meat. ÊMany people complain about the lack of service but on this particular day, we had two people serving and cooking our food for us.

This place rocks~ ÊThe set menu A is delicious. ÊWe got all the yummy beef we could ever possibly eat. ÊThe set menu A also comes with soju and beer. ÊOh yes, Êwe also got steam egg and dwenjjang jigae as "service". ÊThe staff is really attentive and very nice as well. ÊAnd for a Korean restaurant (and I've been to too many to count), it has a clean, nice interior. Ê ÊThe banchan (side dishes) are also the yummy. If you want to go for good Korean BBQ, I highly recco this place. Food = A- Service = A- Decor = C Overall = B+

We (4 girls) ordered Combo B and we had more than enough...even a little left over. ÊTea and Alcohol were included with our meal. ÊAll of the meat was delicious...the sides were varied and plentiful, quickly being replenished as our meal went on. ÊI don't know what any of them are called but I tried it ALL and it was amazing. Ê The service was absolutely GREAT! We were so busy chatting and catching up, and they quickly caught on, cooked everything for us, replenished our dishes, and refilled our drinks without us ever having to stop our conversations to ask for anything...they were amazing! All of my friends loved the food and service and the convenient valet parking ($2-3 can't remember) was quick and efficient. ÊThe only thing I would recommend is to make reservations if you will be there for dinner. ÊWe were there on a Wednesday and it was completely full! Make reservations to save you some time but even if you have to wait, it is worth it. Ê With Combo B, each of the four paid $27 and that included food, drinks, tax, tip, and valet :D

Don't let the sketchy neighborhood fool you. This place is a treasure trove of delicious bbq. The interior design completely catches you off guard, based solely on what you see on the outside(especially at night) it's completely surpising. Going against the suggestion of the menu me and my boy decided on getting COMBO A which is suggest for 4 or more people. (ironically enough me and my boy were supposedly the first ones to get COMBO A and eat everything.) The appetizer dishes of tofu, kimchi, and pickled vegetables are completely refillable. The meat itself is GRADE A meat high quality and fresh. Service is quick, friendly, and though despite the heavy accents willing to help you out and describe what each thing is. Staff is willing to help you cook your meat, but if the assistance is not required (like if your some grill king, Do-it-yourself type of person) by all means just let them know and they'll be happy to let you be. Tip: I would highly suggest getting reservations on high traffic days such as Friday & Saturday which can have reservations filled, and standing wait time averaging on 30 minutes to an hour. Overall: High quality meat, good customer service, friendly staff, and many delicious sides.

Really good Korean BBQ, patient waitress with our large group and some childrens. I love the fact that they do most of the cooking, which in SF is unheard of.

I asked specifically for water and not barley tea, because I have gluten sensitivity and I was given barley water. This week's going to be fun, let me tell you. A star off for that. This place is not well ventilated, as most Korean bbq places are, so expect meat/bbq smell to cling to your clothing and hair. We were promptly seated at a table (we didn't have to wait because we went there before the rush hour... but during our meal, we looked up to see lines of people waiting to be seated. Yes, this place packs crowds, especially on weekends. Beware.) Since I can't eat anything marinated in soy sauce, I asked if just my meat can come out cooked from the kitchen and it was full-out refused. So then, we asked if we could have the marinated meat come out cooked from the kitchen and the waitress told us that it is going to take a long time and just told us to cook our Êmeat side by side. (FML. I know.) We tried to put space between our meat as we grilled them and since I already have barley water in my system, whether I am feeling ill from cross-contamination, we will never know. I hear the meat's pretty good though. Service isn't too great and it all feels very rushed, especially during rush hour, but I guess that is what you get at a meat joint in Ktown.

Wow, I'm in love. (Food = 4.5 stars, Service = 5 stars... more later!) My 7 friends and I went to Soowon Galbi for dinner tonight (@ 7:30); fortunately we beat the rush and got seated right away. We ordered the Combo Set B, which had marinated galbi, pork neck, brisket, marinated steak and... one more thing (forgot). Since the set only feeds 4, we also ordered pork belly, the house specialty galbi and seafood pancake. Everything was really delicious (the pork neck and pork belly a little less delicious), and we were all stuffed by the end of the bbq-ing. As if the good food wasn't enough, service was amazing. The combo set also came with beer/soju/soda, salad, rice, soup (we had the Korean-style miso soup) and light desert drink... and our server gave these to everybody at the table even though the combo set was just for 4! Their great service--from helping us grill the meats to being attentive about our waters and other requests--alone deserves 5 stars! (Did I mention that it was our first time there, and none of us are Korean?) Soowon Galbi is a really nice place to go with a group of friends if you're looking for good quality Korean BBQ and awesome service in a nice and clean restaurant. We all had a good time and the nice smiles and attention from the staff really helped us enjoy our delicious meal... which totaled just $24 per person! :)

Have only had Korean BBQ once in SF. Tried my first LA experience thanks to my Android Yelp app -- you guys didn't let me down. Soowon Galbi is an oasis in a god-awful crowded and rundown area of LA. Like the last reviewer said, the mini mall looks suspect, and I even suggested we bail, but I am so glad we tried it. The restaurant is modern and clean. The staff is superb. Even though we were novices they made us feel comfortable and made suggestions and helped us figure things out. Best of all, the food is amazing! They cook your food for you on your table, or you can do it yourself. We had the bulgogi beef and pork. Both were great. Wonderful side dishes. This had to be one of the best meals I've ever had! I thoroughly enjoyed it and can't wait to go back and try more.

Makes smelling like smoked meat and getting smoke in your eyes totally worth it. The BF and I went on a weekday we called in 30 minutes prior to make a reservation. When we arrived we were seated promptly. We ordered the house specialty Galbi and the bugolgi. I was afraid that it would be too much food for just us two, but it turned out to be just perfect. We polished off all the meat and the side dishes. It was THAT delicious! The marinated meat was savory and sweet just like Korean BBQ should be. There was an enormous variety of side dishes that were refilled upon request. The staff was friendly and attentive, the service was impeccable. I was a server once upon a time and I appreciate how much skill it takes to not only wait 5-6 tables but to prepare their food for them also....that takes prowess.

Korean food is one dining department in which I don't tend to rely on Yelp, but I couldn't ignore a place with 4.5 stars and almost 700 reviews. ÊI hit up Soowon with Matt B. and a few friends for a casual birthday dinner, and the place was great. The inside looks pretty standard for a Korean barbecue joint, clean and comfortable without much ambiance. ÊI thought the service, though, was notable. ÊOur waitress was a very nice middle-aged lady (ajumma, is the word I'm looking for), and she checked in on us all the time. ÊFood came fast, and water, alcohol, and banchan were all replaced without delay. ÊIf Soowon even had a Korean service button, we never had to use it. The banchan was better than average, and there was plenty of it. ÊThere were some great sweet potato tempura and fishcake, as well as seaweed and root vegetable namuls that were quite delicious. ÊI was impressed by one banchan that featured a sort of seaweed that I'd never seen before, chewy with a cartilage-like crunch. ÊThe kimchi wasn't the best I've had, but it was certainly passable, especially with some time on the grill. Our group of five got one Combo B and one order of the house special Soowon Wang Galbi. ÊWe also shared a bowl of bibim naengmyun. ÊCombo B is supposed to be enough meat for four people, and we had plenty of food on the table. ÊThe combo came with beef brisket (chadol gui), marinated beef short rib (galbi), sliced rib eye (kkot sal), seasoned beef rib eye (joomuluk), and pork neck (hang jung sal). ÊI didn't love the brisket, which was a little limp and very fatty, and the rubbery pork neck was not my favorite either. ÊThe rest of the meat was delicious. ÊThe beef was well-seasoned and tender, and the marinated Wang Galbi was worth getting on top. ÊI ate everything with some daenjang and grilled kimchi, with occasional dips into the sesame oil and salt. ÊI also liked the bibim naengmyun, which if not quite spicy enough, had a nice bouncy texture. ÊWhen we were done with our food, we were given cups of shikhyae. ÊI thought it was strange that there was no rice in my cup, but it was sweet and refreshing just the same. While I wouldn't say Soowon is on the same level as Park's across the street, it's definitely great, and much less expensive. ÊOur total with tip came out to around $170 for five people, including a couple bottles of soju. ÊWe were all quite full and content when we left. ÊSoowon is a good compromise between budget AYCE Korean barbecue and the gourmet Park's or Chosun experience. ÊThe quality is there at a fair price, giving the place some serious repeat value.

yes, the sides were fantastic, some of the best i have ever had. meat was tender, juicy flavorful. service was excellent. BUT a lil pricey for my tastes, 27.99 for two strips of soo won galbi and you had to order two types of meat in order to get the a la carte stuff which i thought was strange. For two ppl it cost upwards of 55 dollars... my suggestion, get the combos and defintely go with more than two people.

This is my absolute favorite Korean BBQ place!! ÊWe don't have any Korean restaurants like this in the Bay Area. I mean, sure we have Korean BBQ and yes, it's just marinated meat... but this place really stands out! It stands out because: 1) They have the white rice paper that you wrap your BBQ in. You can make yourself a white rice paper egg roll with the meat and salad! Mmmmm... this is what keeps me coming back for more! I haven't been able to find a place in the Bay Area that serves this... 2) The meat marination is sooooo good! 3) It's super clean 4) They have the best side dishes! 5) They give you free tofu soup... Yummm... 6) They grill the tendon... soooo good! Nice and chewy! 7) They give you this sweet rice cold drink as a palette cleanser Ê 8) They cook everything in front of you for you! (No it's NOT Benihanas..) They have the family menu which is great priced but it's written in Korean. Should just order that for a nice suprise! :) Each time I visit LA, I always try to make time to visit K-town for some yummy galbi! Be prepared to leave stuffed but still wanting more. Drool.... I'd move here just to eat this everyday! P.S. Parking sucks... drive your ghetto car and wear some old clothes because your clothes will be super smokey from the Korean BBQ!

Still a newbie in LA looking for extremely good Korean bbq. ÊWent to South Bay and found something decent... but I think this place is a real gem. Sure.. the parking kind of sucks.. $2 now (not $1). ÊYou can park on the side streets.. but maybe not since there are some shady characters around. The food was good and plentiful. ÊI totally agree.. Combo I is a great deal. ÊThree types of meat and beer.. with salad and all the sides for $39.99. ÊFantastic.. and didn't even mind smelling like BBQ on the way out. ÊWe also tried the jigae which was a bit spicier than I think my mom could handle... (not awesome.. tasted more like they just used water instead of broth) and the dolsot bimbimbap (not awesome either.. the heat of the stone bowl didn't make crunchy rice.)

All I really remember was really fresh and tender meats. I want to say that we ordered 5-6 plates of meats (pork + beef bulbogi, a dish of lightly marinated rib eye, and some of plates of meats which I honestly cannot recall...) Since this is not an AYCE, the service is quite good - our waitress kept checking up on us and we all got everything refilled quickly. The banchans were very good, but I think I've had others at other places I liked better...like...the little fishes! I think we ordered about 6 plates of meats split amongst 6 people. The total price per person is practically the same as to paying for an AYCE place. Their vents rock like no other because no one smelled like KBBQ afterward, which is such a relief sometimes! Parking was a little tricky ... we ended up valeting because we couldn't find any street parking for a block (plus we were running late) - but valet is $2...so not too bad. In the end, I wasn't totally full...which is probably good because maybe I tend to just eat too much at AYCE bbqs. =P My fiance and I both agreed that we could each finish off another plate of meat. I can eat as much as he does, if not more sometimes! =)

Mmmmm. This is a more upscale version of the other Korean BBQ joints nearby. While it looks like it could be from the outside (as many of my yelper friends have already noted), you will be surprised by the inside. Nice granite-looking countertops, nice big BBQ racks. The side dishes are especially good. I like to think of it as a Korean BBQ place which caters to a non-Korean crowd. I can't say I've been to a lot of KBBQ restaurants, but I haven't seen any with such explanation of the menu items and cooking instruction in detail in english. Very handy. I ordered the Bulgogi (very tasty) and my girlfriend ordered the house marinated galbi, also delicious but not as meat-y as my Bulgogi. I left feeling very full, but maybe not as overstuffed if I was at an all-you-can-eat place. While I love Soowon Galbi, I wish I could have tried a larger variety of items. It is, however, delicious, and I highly recommend it. Great for a date, since it is an upscale version of the same, classic, always delicious Korean BBQ. Also, I would suggest eating before 7 unless you want to wait a while.

Soowon is my favorite Korean BBQ place. ÊThough I'm not a native Angeleno, I've visited this clean and brightly lit restaurant numerous times with friends, many of them Korean, who all agree that Soowon's galbi rivals that of Soot Bull Jeep's. ÊThe ban chan/side dishes are varied and good, kimchi wasn't all that great but it really depends on the day. (Will write more later.)

I took my K-town virgin brother to have some KBBQ and we were duly impressed. First, even though this is the first time i've had all men wait staff (except the hostess), they were exceptionally polite, helpful, and attentive. They both cooked our kalbi to perfection as well as instructed us on the finer points of using the rice/daikon wraps and which meat went best with which sauce. The food was also awesome. We had the unseasoned marbled rib eye, which was melt in your mouth good. We also had the marinated kalbi, which was also awesome in its own way. The pan chan (appetizers) were also great. We liked the honey potatoes, the mini pancakes, the curried meats, and the fish cakes. All in all, another great kbbq place. I like this and Park's BBQ food about the same, but I'd give Soowon the service edge.

When you first enter this korean bbq location, you notice the fresh aroma smell of cooked meats. While the presence of the smell is strikingly phenomenal, it is not smoky like most locations. As for the meats, the selections varies like any other non-AYCE locations. The galbi is juicy and succulent and really tender with a lot of flavor. The brisket has a bit of fatty on it; however, it has just the right blend of lean and fatty and thinness to accentuate the taste of the meat. Overall the meat qualities were phenomenal and worth going again. I definitely can put it a tad above Park's bbq or Road to Seoul. As for the sides, they were very plentiful with various types. I definitely loved the salad which consisted of blend of lettuce, chopped lettuce, and light dressing, just perfect to compliment a freshly cut "dok" with meat. Wrapping your salad and meat with "dok," is truly heaven in your mouth.

About as good of a Korean BBQ as I've been to. ÊFound it via Yelp. ÊThe place far outshines the area it's located in. ÊFirst class inside. ÊThe ban chan was good. ÊThey also served a complimentary green salad with the meal that was a nice suprise. Ê We ordered the two apps and an entree. ÊFirst was the japchae noodles and the seafood pancake (haemul pajeon). ÊMy wife really liked the pajeon and I loved the japchae. ÊThen to follow we got an order of bulgoki, but not cooked on our table bbq, but already cooked (too many little hands at our table). ÊThe bulgoki was from a ribeye with just enough fat on it to really be succulant, but not so much that you feel totally bad about yourself. ÊYum!! One cool thing was my two kids took to there first korean meal just fine. ÊThey liked as much of the banchan as most people, Êand pretty much topped of on everything else. btw, the service was very good and very accomodating for my two kids. ÊThe waitress brought out two kiddie plates and cups without any request from us. ÊThanks!

Soowon Galbi...great place to hang your hat and dine. In the tradition of Korean BBQ restaurants, Soowon Galbi does not disappoint. We ordered the house marinaded spare rib with ribeye steak. I figured it was too much for the two of us, but better safe than sorry :) It was a long day volunteering for RAM (Remote Air Medical). The ribeye was tender and O so savory. The marinaded spare rib was adequate, but not bad relative to other K BBQ's. What won me over however, was their banchan. Light flavors, excellent variety, and plenty of helpings, what more could you ask for...Well maybe a better location for the restaurant. 4 out of 5 stars. One less star due to the terrible location, and smokey grill. I did smell of Korean BBQ when I left, but that was a small price to pay for the experience. Date of visit: 04/30/3010 Party size: 2 Bill: ~ $62.00 before tip

I am no stranger to Korean food but this place still manage to impress me. Their signature barbecue is really tasty and really fresh. Side dishes are plenty and of good quality. If you haven't had Korean BBQ before. No worries. The server will help you. Valet parking is $2 and spots are relatively easy to find. Will definitely go back again.

The only place I go to for Korean BBQ. The restaurant is immaculately clean, and the service is great. ÊIt can get busy on the weekends, so make a reservation if you can. You must order at least 2 dishes to use the grill on the table. Totally worth it. It's the only way to eat Korean BBQ. I am a big fan of the Beef Bulgolgi / mixed veggies / shrimp. I would like to try the Pork Belly, but haven't yet. Ê The sides, the sides, the sides! So many good things! ÊQuality kimchi, all kinds of veggies... they will keep refilling your side dishes too, if you ask. I've been to a few other places in K-town, and even live there, and this is the only place I've returned for a 2nd visit (and 3rd, and 4th, and 5th...)

I have eaten at a lot of Korean Restaurants, and I love Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ Restaurant the best. The banchan (side dishes) are excellent in both taste and variety. The quality of the meat is excellent - I recommend the $100 menu for 5 people. Also the waitresses are very nice - just tell them what you want and you'll get it. But the place is small and gets very crowded because people know that Soowon Galbi is one of the best - so be realistic about the wait - but once you are seated you'll be pleased if you are not in a rush. Enjoy - I give all the kudos to Soowon Galbi!

We ordered Combo A and an extra order of Short Ribs for 5 guys, emptied the entire tray & all the sides. Nice & clean, this is one of the few places I would say the service, establishment, and food are all great. Would I go back? I might move in if they let me.

I really enjoyed this place. The meat was of good quality and the service was very good. The amount of food we received was enormous and I left very full. The side dishes were a wonderful addition to the meats that we ordered. I just wish I could have gotten more of certain side dishes and less of others. I'm sure if I had asked, I could have gotten more. I especially liked the sauce that they gave us to dip the meat in. It was so good! The restaurant is also very clean and they give you a sweet tea at the end of your meal that is very yummy!

Soowon Galbi has finally turned me into a Korean barbeque lover. ÊIt's like everywhere in K-town, only better. ÊService is top notch. ÊThe place is clean and modern. ÊThey use real charcoal, but also gas. ÊThey have vents above the tables, though although you may get a bit smokey, you don't leave stinking like a campfire. Best notes: The banchan are DELICIOUS, plentiful, and varied. ÊThe kimchee is great, and they even sometimes will bring you some of their regional, pickled but not fermented kimchee! ÊThe potatoes are good. ÊEverything is good! The meat: SUPER well marbled, plentiful, and very flavorful. ÊTHey tell you which to eat in what order (eat the marinated stuff last, so you can appreciate the flavors more). The prices: There were 6 of us and we roder the combination for 5 plus two bi bim bops, and there was PLENTY of food. ÊThe fact that they throw in beer or soju is really nice, plus the prices are consistent with other Korean bbq places...expect between $20-25 pp before tax/tip.

Seafood pancake (don't know the name, sorry!) is delicious when hot. LOADED with seafood. Pork belly is MMMMMMMMMM. Not fatty fat that melts down to, well, more fat... it actually is proper quality pork belly. Beef tongue is quality. And the galbi, very well done. I've perhaps had better a few places, but this was up there. Of course, you pay for quality. We had four dishes for two people, which probably really is enough for 3 people if you're unreasonable eaters (or 4 people, if you eat like normal human beings), and it was over $100 without alcohol. But man, it was definitely good!

I heart Korean BBQ. And I've been having plenty of it lately. Soowon Galbi has gotten some pretty raving reviews, and deservedly so, because the meat is incredibly delicious and the restaurant itself is among the cleanest K-bbq restaurants I've been to in LA. It is more expensive than a few other nearby kbbq restaurants, and they don't offer all-you-can-eat bbq. So expect to pay at least $20 per person for a good dining experience. Side dishes also good. Parking in the lot is a valet in the evening (I avoid valet at all costs, even if it's free) - but it's possible to find a nearby street space. OR swoop in at 7pm and grab one of the spaces on Vermont that open up then.

If you don't want to go to one of the many AYCE KBBQ places in K-town, I would say this would be one of my go-to places. We had about 10 people total and got two of the set menu courses but they did let us switch out a few things which was cool. Service was extremely friendly and tentative and thankfully, they had good ventilation so you didn't totally smell like KBBQ after wards (not that that's a bad thing mind you).

My boyfriend and I recently came here the second time...why? It was because the first time we came here, it was HELLA packed! The wait was like 2 hours long so I was sad we didn't go the first time. Besides the point: This place was awesome!! This is definitely a great Korean BBQ place!! Their side dishes were yummy!! The meats were fresh and the price wasn't that bad compared to Cholsun Galbee =) The meat gave me that "melt in your mouth" experience =) The staff were attentive and friendly. They even cook the meat for you! The only thing that I was concerned about was what ladies need to watch out for: their grill. LADIES: If you have long hair, make sure your hair don't get burned by the grill because the restaurant uses charcoal and sparks can rise up. Other than that, I would definitely come back here!!

I've been a huge fan of Soot Bull Jeep Êfor a long long time, but I think I'm switching my allegiance. ÊWhy? Read on. First off, all of the peeps at Soowon are SOOO friendly and don't mind that you can't speak Korean. ÊThey greet you with a smile, bring you tons of the side dishes/kim chis/ banchans/panchans, promptly refilling them when they go empty, and are happy to do substitutes, no problem. ÊWe got a huge combo plate of meat that promised to serve three (sooo true - more than enough) and had them substitute out the chicken on the plate w/ the marinated pork. ÊThey were too happy to do it. The decor is nice - the place is simple, but clean. ÊIt is still smoky, but the ventilation system is pretty good and there is a big suction fan over every single table, so the smoke is minimized. ÊThe grill rocks - there is charcoal in there and not just a boring gas flame like at so many places. This makes for smoke, but tastiness, so decide what's more important to you. The dining experience is VERY VERY pleasant, plus, they come around and cook your meat for you, turning it on the grill, so you don't have to burn yourself and have more time to scarf down all of the deliciousness. ÊI liked the hot soup that came better than the cold that comes in other places and they have very very good kim chi and better banchans than other places (like little potato pancakes- yum). Parking is not an issue - only 2.00 for the valet. SO worth it. The combo plate was 59.00 which serves three and comes with a large beer or soda (your choice). ÊThe whole bill plus tip and an extra beer came to 26 p/p. ÊGreat deal. Great dining experience. ÊOh, and stick with the marinated meats. we had the pork belly, ribeye and marinated pork and the marinated one was definitely better tasting (but I'm a fan of marinade).

All the meat is of high quality and delicious! The banchan is all really good too. The price seems fair for the quality and amount of food you get in the combo deal (at the end of the menu). The service was also exceptional. The place was full with a line and they were hustling with whatever we asked for. Everyone seemed to speak English if that's an issue. I guess it could have been better with a charcoal/wood fire like in Korea. Good execution of Korean BBQ in America and still being quite legit. You won't be disappointed. Plus they had the Lakers game on - nice C: Noticed some folks fumbling over which soju to get: "Cham-ee-seul". Don't hesitate!

I used to dine at Soowon Galbi often but was kept from coming back because of the long wait times. ÊI had an opportunity to dine here on a Sunday night, but there was still a 20 minute wait. ÊOnce I was ready to order the waiter gave me the bad news that they were out of the marinated kalbi. ÊBummer! ÊHe then recommended the plain non-marinated kalbi, but promised to give us a generous serving. ÊBoy what a surprise! ÊAfter years and pounds of devouring Korean bbq, I never expected the plain stuff to be so delicious. ÊBecause it doesn't have the typical sweet marinade, you don't really get sick of the taste. ÊI actually found myself eating more healthy side dishes and veggies. The parking here can be horrific, but like all of K-town, it is valet.

Wow, and not in a good way. I was so psyched to go to this place on Sunday because my usual Korean BBQ standby, Gil Mok (aka Corner Place) is closed on sundays. After reading some Yelp reviews and craving BBQ for a few days, I went with my family with some high hopes. I have to say, I have not had this bad of service in a Korean restaurant in a long time, and sorry to say Korean places aren't exactly known for great service. What does that tell you about this place. We had to ask for water 4 times before getting it, they forgot our salad until after we had finished up the pork belly, and every thing was just slow, slow, slow. The food was decent but the bad service just spoiled the meal. The meat wasn't anything I would rave about. The hamul pachun was ok, I've had better. The spicy cold noodle was nothing spectacular and not even worth ordering...I had to find something to replace the cold noodle I usually get at Gil Mok with my meal. Bottom line, if you are willing to have bad slow service and somewhat overpriced food, then this is your place. Otherwise, stick with what you know and go to your usual Korean BBQ place of choice instead. P.S. I had an upset stomach the following day after eating here.....

For living in California for so long, this is my first time trying Korean BBQ in Koreatown. I went on a Yelp to find the top rated place for Korean BBQ and Soowan Galbi came up. Thank Yelpers! I really enjoyed the food here. We had the short ribs, skirt steak, and pork belly. It was all delicious. My only small complaint was the thickness of the pork belly. I think it would've tasted better if it was cut thinner. I get afraid when I see buttons for service, but I did not have to use it once. Our waiter was great. He brought us more appetizers and water as needed. I will be back. :)

Admittedly I haven't eaten at a ton of other Korean BBQ restaurants in the city, but I went here the other night and it was fantastic. Super clean restaurant (kind of important) , friendly staff even if they couldn't tell me and my other white friend what we were eating. ÊAll of the side dishes were great (they can kind of be an afterthought at some places), all of which were refilled every time we got more than halfway through one.

Came here on a week night. Yes, it is in a strip mall, but so is every other place in Koreatown. We were seated at a table in a private section off to the right with just two tables. A few of us were new at Korean BBQ and the server just put our meat on and left. We had to call him over a few times because we did not know what to do. We then got the hostess to explain everything to us and this made the experience more enjoyable. The restaurant is very clean and new and the ambiance is modern. The smoke was minimal and the tables were spread out far enough. Would recommend!

Ok let me preface this review with the awesomeness of the tiny call button on the wall to alert the wait staff to come to your table. Ê I saw little yelp stars floating around in my mind. Onward with the review: Meat on a large platter that's cooked for you at your table? Hells. Yeah. My friend and I stopped in last night with our appetites. Ê***Word to the wise: If you come before 6pm, you don't have to pay for Valet Parking in the lot.*** Also at about 5pm it was completely empty! We ordered Combination D ($39.99) which included: Pork Belly, Chicken Bulgogi, and Beef Brisket. ÊThe combo came with rice, stew and salad with your choice of beer, soju or soda. ÊWhen my friend went to order a Heiny, our waitress suggested getting the "Hite" beer since it was a bigger bottle for sharing. Our waitress and waiter would come by periodically to cook our meat for us. ÊThe salad is amazing, and I normally do not engage in eating of veggies of any sort. ÊThe food: Bomb. Everything was cooked and flavored to perfection. Ê The wait was a little slow for the check (we actually had to end up pressing the call button since we'd been sitting at the table for quite some time waiting for someone), but other than that an overall enjoyable experience. PS: On a side note...those were the cleansest bathrooms I've ever seen at a resturant. Seriously.

I really enjoyed this place. ÊIt feels a Êlittle more upscale than your typical Korean BBQ place in LA. ÊI could see myself holding a power business meeting here. ÊThe prices here are slightly higher than other BBQ places (not by much) and it's not all you can eat. We had a group of 8 and ordered the Combo A, an additional galbi order, and some soon tofu soups. ÊComba A comes with a wide variety of meat selections and includes some drinks which I thought was nice. ÊIt would comfortably feed a group of five hungry people. In my opinion, the meat here was good quality. ÊI never felt that I was eating some second rate meat as I have felt at other establishments. ÊThe soon tofu soups were delicious -- they were very flavorful with the right amount of spice. The banchan (side dishes) here was the best that I have experienced in LA.

I am not sold on this place. The food was tasty and the side dishes were very well prepared but I just didn't taste a DRASTIC difference in the quality of the meat. Maybe my taste is not very well honed for Korean BBQ, but I've eaten at other places and it seemed on par with this place and a substantially lower price as long as you can stand a little smoke and a little more self service. Pros: Clean, not all too crowded, service is good, salad is good, servers help you cook Cons: Kind of expensive for me to go out of my way to eat again, for four guys you are looking to spend over 100$ for a good experience, had to ask quite a few times for refills on things (they seemed a little frugal) Bottom line: If you don't feel like stuffing yourself and are okay with spending about 10$ more than you would at a typical all you can eat KBBQ buffet to get better quality meat and service, then this is your place.

Went to the restaurant hoping for some good fresh Korean BBQ after reading the other reviews and once again, I am so thankful for YELP. ÊWe were lucky enough to beat the second round of the crowd and got a seat as soon as we arrived but their service lacked as I had to yell "juh-gee-yoh" every time wee needed something. Other than trying to get their attention, the meat was SUPER FRESH and for the most part delicious. MENU: Combo A - rib, sirloin, ribeye, marinated sirloin, brisket, substituted pork bell for the pork neck + bean paste stew + 1 bottle of liquor + unlimited korean side dishes PRICE: ~$25/person fresh's 2 CENTS: Definitely the place to go if you want a traditional, clean, and filling dinner. I'd say it's worth the $25 - good meat, good variety, good atmosphere, but not so good service. As always, with Korean BBQ places, be prepared to come out smelling like delicious meat goodness!

They give you unlimited amount of refills for the banchans, service was good and place was clean. ÊThe only thing that bothered me a bit is that if you don't speak Korean its a bit hard to get something you need right away. Ê Nothing really stood out for me at this restaurant because everything was good and definitely will come back if i am ever craving Korean BBQ. 'til the next beefoodie adventure!

Soo won is a city where my parents live in Korea. ÊThey're known for their kalbi. This place has a bit of everything but it's focus is primarily on BBQ. ÊSpecifically kalbi. Try the soo won kalbi. It's perfectly marinaded and they bring the meat on the bone. Do not fret, they cut in up for u. The service was great. U can always tell when word of mouth hits the fan when there are a number of non Koreans in this place. The only thing I have to mention is that the location isn't the most superb so parking is def lacking. ÊBut if u don't mind the location be prepared to walk in to a wonderful designed restaurant. Even the restroom was nice.

I love korean food, and my bf's family took me here not too long ago. It was me, my bf, his parents, his brother, and his aunt. ÊThough it was packed, the wait wasn't too bad, I guess we came at a time when ppl were almost done with their food. There was a lot of meat, we ordered the the Combo A for everyone, and the food just kept on coming out. ÊThere were galbi, bulgogi, they have lots and lots of meat, and I dont know half of what its called. ÊAnywho, the orders came with many side dishes, and one in particular that I liked was their kimchi pancake. Êtheir sesame soysauce dipping sauce was really good. It had fresh chopped green onions in it. ÊTheir kimchi was a lil too fermented for me though. Believe it or not, the service was pretty decent. ÊThey brought out more dishes just when we were finishing up our plates. ÊOur grill was replaced in a timely manner, so we don't eat the dirty charcoal-ie stuff off the grill. Hot tea and sodas were refilled too. ÊThis is a pretty clean restaurant. ÊIts one of the better places that we've been to.

I don't get it. ÊThe galbi was ok, nothing phenomenal. ÊThe bulgogi was ok, but overly sweet; I felt like I was having dinner-dessert. Service was pretty good, and the staff was very amenable to putting on the basketball game we wanted to watch. With so many choices in LA, I'm not inclined to come back.

Great little korean bbq place! Ê Went here a couple weeks back - it was pretty busy, so it could be a good idea to call ahead, especially if you want to go around dinnertime during the weekend. ÊThe bulgogi was definitely fantastic, and the side dishes were pretty great, too. ÊOn top of that, the place was clean and service was great. ÊYou even get a little bell thing for it you want something for your table - it displays the tables that have pressed the bell on a little electronic scoreboard-type thing they have on their wall, and a waiter will come right up once it's there. Do keep in mind, however, that their parking lot is valet only. ÊIt costs $2.

Update 5/20/08: They've remodeled the place. ÊStill just as good! This is one of the few places in ktown where the service is outstanding. ÊTypically, you get those really mean old ajoomas who just ignore you, but the people here are just great. ÊGood sized portions of meat - I like their galbi and their jummulluk (beef seasoned with oil, salt n pepper). ÊDecent enough banchan. ÊAnd they're so reasonably priced. Ê SuWon has charcoal grills so it can get pretty smoky but it's definitely better than those gas grills :) The only thing that sucks is that it's in a tiny plaza and parking can get pretty packed.

I've gone here on many occasions and every time with great friends. The food is outstanding, although I've never had to ever order any food because my korean speaking friends have always taken care of it :). ÊNo need to argue with those who are handling your food order, right. ÊFor the most part, we've had the beef galbi and lots of soju (which may or may not have impaired judgment slightly). ÊThe orders came with an assortment of your typical pickled side dishes, rice and kimchi. The service is alway prompt with the flick of a very handy button at your table. ÊWithin seconds there will be someone there refilling your water glass or checking on you. Heed my warning...the place can become very smokey at times with all the cooking going on. ÊThe ventilation here isn't the greatest, which really is my only negative. The parking is valet for a couple bucks and the cars are kept very close, so the service is prompt.

I went here with a group for a birthday party and it was great. The service had a couple small hiccups (it took us a long time to get beverages once we sat down), but the quality of the food was good and of course, we were the cooks so it was done how we all liked it. The grill at the table next to us caught on fire for a moment (note to diners: don't put the sauces or sides on the grill), but they had it contained Êquickly.

Checked this place out a few nights ago when the Korean BBQ I usually go to was closed (hopefully not forever). ÊI used to live in K Town for about ten years and have dined on a lot of Korean BBQ in my time... Had the Beef Bulgogi, the shrimp, the ribs, and the veggie platter with a couple of friends. ÊAll of the food was very tasty, though my friends thought they had had better ribs at other Korean BBQ places. Ê The side dishes were EXCEPTIONAL - perhaps the best I've had. ÊI also personally thought the bulgogi was really terrific - not overly seasoned it had just the light touch an old Korean friend of mine demanded in her bolgogi - just the way she made it. That said, the parking was a nightmare and the service was less than pleasant. ÊWhen we got there the place was empty and we were largely ignored, then once it got busy they started rushing us. ÊMy friends love cooking stuff themselves at Korean BBQ, not being rushed through it. ÊPersonally, I don't care if I do the beef flipping or not, but the service was kind of harsh on my friends in that respect. ÊHad we not felt ignored then rushed, I would've gladly give this experience four stars. Oh - the SALAD and KIM CHEE WERE AMAZING!!!!

I finally got around to creating a yelp account because of this place, cause it is that good. :-D I was deciding on a place to have a birthday dinner, and I saw the other reviews here. ÊSo I went here with a couple of female friends a week earlier to check out the location. ÊYup, it is in a pretty ghetto area, but the service and food quality was excellent. ÊWe ordered Combo D, because one of my friends needed a white meat (chicken) option. ÊThe meat that they brought out to cook was arranged very cleanly and appetizingly on the tray. ÊThere was plenty of food, and after tip and tax, we spent less than $20 per person. ÊMy friends told me they didn't see the hot waiters that were mentioned in the other reviews, but we all agreed that it would definitely be a good place to bring back the rest of our friends. We came back a week later on Saturday with a group of 15 people, and ordered two Combo A's and two Combo D's. ÊThe wait staff were even more attentive, and we were even more stuffed. ÊMy friends from out-of-town were saying how much they enjoyed the food. ÊMy friends didn't let me pay, so covering me, they paid $25 each. Soowon maintains great standards of service, quality, and flavor. ÊI'll definitely go back again, although I suppose I should eventually order something other than their meats. :-D

ok. Ê700+ reviews. Ê4 1/2 stars. ÊIn Ktown. ÊThat's gotta be a guarantee, but this time, yelp kinda failed me. ÊI took 13 students from yearbook Êand we started with two of the $100 combos, which is supposed to serve 4-5. ÊWe had only 2-3 heavy eaters and the rest were tiny little girls who ate like birds. ÊAnd yet, we went through $200 worth of meat in like couple of minutes. ÊI swear that the amount of meat they gave us was enough for only 2-3 not 4-5 people. So we ordered another 6 portions. ÊSo in total we ordered what was supposed to serve 16 people and it was like we just finished the appetizers. Ê I was so regretting it bc I couldn't keep on ordering at their prices and we were still hungry. Ê I took them there bc I wanted the kids to get a different experience from the AYCE. ÊI heard so much about the banchan, but that was also just average. Ê The service was great, but what good was service when we were still famished and broke after spending $400+ on meat? I thought that we were trading quantity for quality, and while the meat quality was good, it wasn't amazing or anything. ÊSo I felt that we got neither in the end. Ê Don't get me wrong. ÊIt's not bad food, but I think in K-town, there are AYCE places for $18 that have meat quality that rivals this place. Beul Dae Po is one of them. ÊSo we are going there next week.

Before SooWon Galbi, I was a Korean BBQ virgin. ÊAnd I'm glad I gave it up for SooWon... it's great place to lose it. ÊThe food is good, the service is excellent and the restaurant is clean and contemporary. ÊThe prices are higher here than at other KBBQ joints, but the quality is great. ÊMy wish is that it was all-you-can-eat... As far as the meat options, the bulgogi was the best of the bunch. ÊIt had a delicious marinade that was not overly sweet. The pork was also good, but pales in comparison to my beloved bulgogi. The sides were plentiful and the kimchi pancake and salad are some of the better ones I've had. Although I'm more experienced now, I'd say that although it's not my favorite place for Korean BBQ, it's still a great choice. ÊNo regrets.

So I went here based on the excellent reviews on yelp and I see why it has such good ratings. I forgot the name of the meat we got but it was amazing it was about 30 bucks but it was plenty of meat for 2 and they quality made it well worth it. Service was fast and good, the place is nice and clean. They had a side here I hadn't come across yet, white seaweed, and it was mixed with mayo I think. It was sooo good. The texture was so different. I went to a Korean super market looking for it and they said they didn't have it :( . I'm gonna keep looking for it.

5 stars for the food...2 stars for the service = 3.5 stars Great tasting Kbbq. ÊThe galbi and bulgogi were the best marinated kbbq I've had. ÊThe mesquite gas grills are better than Soot Bull Jeep and the fans seem to work better (I didn't stink that bad). ÊThe sides were good and they brought out extra when we asked albeit slowly. ÊThe bulgogi was a little different that usual as it was not cut as thin as others. ÊIt was cut almost as thick as the galbi but no complaints here. The bibimbap was excellent. ÊWe ordered the one on the sizzling plate (dolsut, I think). Anyway, the food here is excellent and it was nice that they had a tv on for us guys so we can talk sports and pig out. ÊMaybe I caught them on a bad night so I'm giving them a pass and will return with the wife. As for the service, our waiter was a space cadet. ÊWe asked for more salad along with some lettuce to wrap the galbi and he just brought the lettuce. ÊWe asked for OB and he forgot so we had to ask again.

Basically, this place is the bomb. I love all Korean food, be it BBQ or not. Most people complain that the cost of Korean BBQ is prohibitive but with this place, I think I'll be getting it a hell of a lot more often. They have these nifty combinations that end up being excellent deals and so you don't spend nearly as much as you would picking individual selections. We went with the combo for 3-4 people which runs for $59.99 and comes out to be around $25 per person with tax and tip. This is extremely reasonable not only for the amount of food received but for the quality. Our combo came with beef brisket, pork belly, rib eye, and chicken bulgogi plus a zillion side dishes, rice, soup, AND a giant Hite beer to share. This is a lot of food. There is no way in hell you will feel hungry after this. You can get Êfree refills on all the banchan as well (more kimchi please!). It was all delicious. I've never had pork belly before and I was a little nervous about the amount of fat on it but that fat is melt-in-your mouth buttery deliciousness. A must have! Everything was so good and it was almost sad once we got to the poor chicken as we could barely finish it! I suppose the only thing lacking is that I wish there was a smaller combo that included the ribs but hey, I'll just bring more people next time. The more people you have, the better things get. No complaints about service. Everyone was very nice and friendly and we always had someone around to turn our meat for us and give the one member of our group a fork (I will say that the chopsticks they give you are metal and slippery so sometimes I almost wished for a fork as I am no chopstick master). The place is clean and well-ventilated (only minor smoky hair when we left) and the valet service is $2. I want to give it 5 stars but I must try out a few more places just to compare. This place certainly lives up to all its hype and its high rating.

This was the place that introduced me to dduk bossam. I think I was either in jr. high or early high school when my parents I started coming here almost on a monthly bases. They had a $29.99 combo that came with 3 servings of meat and a bottle of soju. And it was plenty. And they had dduk. My parent and I had never heard of wrapping our meats in rice paper, so when they gave it to us to try, we were skeptical... But after that first bite, we (k, I), were sold. IT WAS FRIGGIN AWESOME. Now it's been about 7~8 years since that fateful night, and I crave dduk bossam almost on a weekly basis... I hadn't gone back to this place for a few years until recently, when I had dinner with my Godparents... I have to say, meat quality's still pretty good. I guess you can attribute this to the fact that this place is not an AYCE place. They have combos and such, but the price runs pretty deep. Maybe I'll come back for more special occasions. But yes, this restaurant will always have a place in my heart as my first dduk place.

4.5 stars. Sometimes I feel like I am eating my way through Koreatown. This place is one of my favorites. While the meat is very good, I've been to a few other better places, but it's still really good (repeat myself, much?). The banchan is typical fare, but very tasty. Portions are just right. It is a little pricey, but the place is clean and they do tend to the grill quite a bit. Service was good aside. If I had to rate the table across the way the first time I went, with the overachieving loudmouthed idiot with his parents, it'd be a 1. Poor parents. Couldn't even get a word in to tell him to shut up. I'm kicking myself for not telling him. Another bottle of soju and I would have shoved a dish of kimchi in his mouth. Other than that, a little pricey, but a nice place to go. See you there!

if there is a paradise for meat lovers this would probably be it. ÊAMAZING FANTASTIC FABULOUS cuts of meat that was fresh and oh so delicious!!! Ê [i've always had this snarky feeling that LA k-town would be a little bit more awesome than norcal el camino k-town...] anyhoo, we went to this place on a thursday night, and the place was packed (a good sign!), the interior was clean and well decorated (mad props to the granite tabletops), but the host could use a little bit more training in being nice to folks who are told to wait till their tables are ready... but in retrospect all that is moot when we ordered the food. ordered combination d, which had pork belly and bulgogi made out of chicken amongst other things, and it was the right serving for two people. Êthe price was worth it, and if there's something else to be raved about it would have to be the salad. Êomfg it was the most delicious endless salad anyone could ask for- the veggies were fresh and the dressing wasn't overpowering. Êif i could live a life of vegetarianism, i would probably live off of that salad and be totally content.

By far some of the best Korean BBQ in the Los Angeles Area. Went there based on yelp ratings and everything was spot on. The meat was the best quality I have consumed at any Korean BBQ place in L.A.

ÊWe could have been fine with a short rib plate and a chicken plate, but we thought we'd have smaller portions per plate like other restaurants would do and ended up over spending and over eating :) Definitely would make a return if in the area, and would stick with 2 plates versus 3.

Sweet Jesus! 400th review. My life is now complete. Anyways... This place is da bomb. I don't like to use that phrase at all, but this place is da bomb. Ya heard? *Explosion...in your mouth!* Very good banchans. Very good service. Great quality meats. Fair price. Expect to pay $25/person if you come in a group of 4 and order 3 meat selections. Can't go wrong with the usual bulgogi, brisket, etc. etc. Also, great booths, very spacious because of the good layout of the seating, you get that "in-your-own-world-enjoying-a-genuine-good-time" feeling, if you can imagine.

I went here for the first time last Monday and it was good! ÊThe portions were large (not cheap) but I enjoyed the food. ÊThe only problem is that it was SUPER hard to find (bc I'm a dumdum) and after a while of grilling, it gets so smokey that it's hard to breathe. ÊEventually they cleared away the old grill in place of a new one. They also have a rule where I guess each person has to order a dish? ÊI went with a friend and we wanted to order one large galbi plate but he said we had to order two minimum dishes. ÊSO I don't know if he meant one per person or if every party has to order minimum two dishes. ÊJust keep that in mind.

Came here with a few good friends. We had the usual beef briskets and all, but we also had the pork neck and the beef tongue. You can definitely taste the quality in the meat. Customer service was excellent too. On a busy night, the lady did not stop coming by to give us anything we need and even cook the meat for us. That hardly happens for me. When I go to korean BBQ, I expect to cook my own meat, so the fact that she's constantly stopping by our table and cook the meat, change the grill, and basically actually wait for us, that's just amazingly great customer service. Price is a bit in the higher end. I may have to think twice before coming here again just because of the price, but you can see the price tag comes with the quality. Highly recommend it!

Top notch Korean BBQ. So far, my favorite place in K-Town (I've only been to like 4 others, but still). Meat is top quality -- we had tongue, the Soowon Galbi and the Korean BBQ chicken. All were very good, and the tongue and chicken were especially tender. All the little side dishes were very tasty, as was the salad. We had a spicy soup and cold noodles, both of which could have used a little more flavor IMHO (thus 4 stars not 5). Service is excellent and super-friendly as people have mentioned. They seem to pride themselves on this. Also as everyone has noted, it is a nice clean place. Price is also very reasonable -- no reason to go to an all-you-can-eat place when you can stuff yourself with tasty high quality food here for $25 a head anyway (our family of 4 cost $95 including one bottle of beer). Why bother eating the all-you-can-eat junk? P.S. the reviewer below who mentioned this place and Manna in the same sentence needs a slap on the wrist -- that's just unacceptable :) *** Update *** Went again about a week ago with the family and some friends. This time we got the $90'ish combo and one order of tongue, and it was plenty of food for our gang (5 adults, one 11 year old and one 2 year old). Food was again fantastic and service was very good -- they were helpful with putting together soup and rice for the little tyke, along with the regular food for us big folks. Still at four stars because I'm just stingy that way, but will bump it up to five if it is still our reigning champion of KTown BBQ at the end of a year of searching. There can only be one champion, and so far it is Soowon Galbi...

Thank you YELP-land and all you motherYelpers.....This place was chosen solely based on the reviews in YELP! ÊAnd this place left no doubt how awesome it was and how stuffed you will stumble (Roll yourself) out of here. ÊI thought the prices were average for all the Korean BBQ I have had in NYC, so that might throw off my price meter a bit. Ê The GF and I strolled down here for some K-town BBQ and were excited with the real charcoal used and the immediate seating available. ÊWe had the house special galbi and the bulgogi (RIB EYE, looked like brisket). ÊBoth were marinated and grilled up deliciously. ÊWe also ordered the ha mol pajin (Seafood pancake with lots of scallions) that was completely unnecessary. Ê Way to go Soowon. You won our hearts and our belly. ÊGo here for some great K-town BBQ.

My partner and I stumbled upon Soowon Galbi when our regular spot further up Vermont Ave, Kobawoo (see below in my reviews, still a good place to go), was completely packed for what appeared to be a special event. It has since largely displaced Kobawoo as our favorite place to go in Koreatown. The ambience is great, and the ventilation system is efficient, unobtrusive, and stylishly incorporated into the general decor--that is to say, one of a handful of Korean barbecues where you don't come out delicately perfumed with scents of smoked beef, pork, and garlic (not that the fragrance isn't totally worth it, but if you have the option...) Service is friendly and efficient, and they are quite willing to help novices to Korean barbecue. The beef marinated in sesame oil has become our favorite, probably closely followed by the boneless, spicy pork galbi. The chicken galbi is a bit underwhelming--not bad at all, but just not as exciting as the meat dishes. They've recently added a grilled vegetable option as well, which is a nice complement to the large quantities of marinated meat. A standard meal comes with a large cabbage and lettuce salad to share, a bowl of miso soup, and an assortment of panchan side dishes that will be refilled indefinitely. The fish cake and candied potatoes are favorites. Meals also come with a stack of rice-paper wrappers for the meat, which need to be pulled apart with some delicacy to avoid ripping them but are delightfully chewy. The two basic dipping sauces are a lightly spiced vinegar with jalapeno in it, and a mixture of coarse salt and seame oil--unbelievably good on the sesame beef. Rice may be ordered a la carte. Their liquor menu has also recently expanded. They have a couple kinds of soju, a couple of Korean beers, and several new liquors that I haven't seen before. The sake flavored with hawthorn berries is refreshingly light but sweet and has become a favorite. A few suggestions: there is valet parking, but after 7 pm there is nearly always street parking at the meters within a block or two. They normally have a minimum of 2 barbecue orders per table; i.e., you have to order at least two before you can order such non-grilled options such as the bibimbap, chigae, or noodle dishes. As the barbecue items could easily feed one and a half normal, non-starving persons each, bring an extra friend or two or else expect to have a very meat-laden and umami-filled dinner.

I rarely give a place 5 stars, but this place deserves it. A, I'm from Chicago and grew up in a place called Korea Town, B, I have been to Korea and have spent time getting to know the food and people. With that said, Soowan is a place that creates an environment worth paying for. The staff is great, the food is amazing, the booze is good and the memories make it worth your while. I have been there on dates, birthdays and for quick meet ups. It's not cheap, but worth every penny. It's also not expensive. One thing to keep in mind, you will always eat more than you need AND faster. If there is one thing i don't like, is the way the staff cooks for you and almost rushes you out. It's also understandable because the place has tons of foot traffic and needs people to come in and out. RESERVE! No matter what you do, if you are planning the night, make sure you reserve a spot. If not, your wait is about 45 minutes (which by the way, ask a server for a beer and they will bring it to you while you wait). Go to Soowon and share the experience with people you love! Enjoy!

holy smokes, um literally haha. I was surprised by the clean, modern look and feel of the place and the superb ventilation. this place is a meat lover's heaven. Their salad is delectable and the best part is its an endless bowl. The meat is fabulously tasty, at first I was concerned because I'm a lean meat eater, but once I tasted the beef Êthere was absolutely no turning back. the service is good because they have these buttons (like door bells) at each table which you can ring to call your waiter. its pretty much comedy. I will be going back pretty much every day.

Damn Damn this is the joint to be if your feeling "beefy"... No, seriously. ÊThis place is so damn good, I am still dreaming about it..all that delicious food.. in one place. Went on a Wednesday, took Cheri G.'s advice and came before six, to avoid the valet, found primo parking, in the front. Order Combo B for a group of four hungry,animal, beastly eaters. ÊCombo comes with five different meat, endless salad, two set of bachans and a choice of beverages, we opt for the OB so that we can share. ÊWe ended up ordering two more OB. ÊThe bill came out to be 99.99, not including tips. Since this was our first time here we opt for the Combo, since it allows us to taste a variety of what Soowon offers. ÊNone of us spoke Korean, but we took the time to read the menu and all agreed we will order what was familiar to us. The service is good, not kiss ass, but good. ÊThe servers were always near by and available to assist you, with cooking, refilling the bachans, Êor if you needed more beer or water refill. ÊAfterward enjoying the feast they left us alone to digest and afterward we rang the little bell to tell them we were ready for the check. The bathrooms were clean, the restaurant was clean especially being a bbq house you would think there would be grease all over this joint. Ê**** be forewarned leave your nice jackets inside the car, or else you'll smell the like bbq house, unless you like to smell like a Korean BBQ kalbi.

My friend suggest that I try this restaurant after her Korean friend graduated graduate school and their entire Korean family went to this restaurant to celebrate. I knew instantly that this restaurant had some clout because of that. I went on a Saturday after 9pm and my boyfriend and I still had to wait a good 30 mins. That was not surprising considering the establishment is pretty small. When we finally got seated, we were instantly greeted with some pretty awesome customer service. All the waiters were super nice and helpful with the ordering. We stuck with the kalbi and the pork belly which doesn't sound like that much, but we were seriously stuffed, like I should have wore my yoga pants stuffed. This was partly bc they had some really high quality side dishes compared to other korea bbqs I've been to. And I actually enjoyed eating the sides along with the tasty meat. Although next time I think I will try the rib eye steak, in the picture it look like a nice thick cut (fred flinstone style). I highly suggest this place if you are looking for some quality korean bbq!

There are many great Korean restaurants in town, but what separates Soowon Galbi is their service. We did arrive early (4:30) but we were warmly welcomed and seated promptly. Being as hungry as we were, we ended up over ordering and the waiter kindly told us that it was probably a bit much. And thank goodness for that. We ordered the Galbi and a rice dish (with octopus). The side orders were delicious (bean sprouts, egg pancake, tofu, kim chi, salad) and plentiful. The meat was awesome - the marinade on the meat was delicious and flavorful. As for the rice dish, the waiter asked how spicy we wanted our rice dish and we responded with medium spicy. He overdid the spices (and he admitted it himself) and my mouth was on fire the entire night. He asked if he could have the steam rice we ordered to try and make the rice less spicy - mission not accomplished. My stomach is still on fire now, but it was worth it. The rice dish was very good. The only reason this restaurant did not get 5 stars is because they were extremely understaffed and a bit slow. The restaurant was packed and the staff was working extremely hard to attend to all the tables. However it took 20 minutes for us to get the bill after we asked for it. Friendly staff, good food, but a bit slow - deserving of a second chance.

I wanted to try Korean BBQ once I visited L.A. and while yelping, I decided to give this place a try. ÊIt's located in K-Town. ÊMy wife and I ordered the Soowon Galbi and that was delicious. ÊThe meat were thick and it was a really good portion, but most important the Galbi was so tasty and juicy. Ê ÊThey used a wood chip grill instead of just a traditional grill. ÊIt gives a really smoky flavor to the food. The server were doing the cooking and they did an awesome job. ÊTheir salad and side dishes were great, they have a lot of varieties of which i have not tried before. ÊWe ordered the Dolsot Bibimbap. ÊIt was good and crunchy but i would prefer it a little bit more spicy. ÊWe also ordered the fish roe tofu soup, which i wouldnt order again. ÊI didnt really like the texture of the the fish roe and the fish intestine. ÊI had better soup. Ê This place is definitely must go again if im back in L.A.

I ended my 14 year semi-vegitarian phase for soowon galbi. Their meat is delicious. It may not have the best ambiance as other korean bbq places, but the food tastes better. Their chadugogi (beef brisket) is my favorite. It's thin and crispy...like bacon! The bulgogi is marinated deliciously as well and the sesame oil and salt dipping sauce with rice paper makes my meal. They also have a pickled jalepeno soy sauce dip that's sweet, if the salty sesame oil dip is not for you. The waiters are hit or miss. Sometimes they are very attentive and other times I wait 15 minutes to order. Also, your waiters are not consistent so sometimes 3 different people come to your table to flip the meat when it had just been flipped. However, they are always nice and accommodating. It's not all you can eat, but minimum order for bbq is two per table and it seems to be enough meat to feed two people with very large appetites. Prices are not too cheap, but average as far as bbq goes. I think they're between $19-$40, depending on the meat. Parking can be a pain, but they have valet for $2. yummmm. BBQ.

I went here with a group of friends after reading the reviews here on Yelp. ÊAlthough I've had Korean BBQ before, it was always with my parents and they did all the cooking, so I really didn't have any idea what to do besides make sure that the meat was still not red and bleeding. ÊThankfully, I think the staff picked up on the fact that all of us were confused and helped us out a lot. ÊI feel a bit embarrassed because I'm sure I violated a few customs, but oh well. Ê The restaurant space is absolutely spotless. ÊWe were all a little worried when we got there because the area surrounding it seemed a bit seedy, but walking inside was like walking into an entirely different world. ÊThe staff were all well dressed and very polite, and the wait time was only 15 minutes without a reservation. Ê The food itself was delicious. I'm not usually a huge fan of copious amounts of meat, but this was good stuff. ÊThe best ones were the thin beef slices that were cooked first, and then the marinated beef wrapped around the bone that was cooked last. ÊThere were 5 of us and we ordered the 70 or 80 dollar combo platter, I believe. ÊTotal for all of us came out to around $87.00, so we rounded it to $100 and left a $13 tip. ÊAnd yes, they'll tell you the platter is for 4 people, but it really is enough to feed 5. The only thing that was confusing was that when I was using the tongs to move the meat around and distribute it, the waiters didn't say anything and ignored us pretty much. But the instant my white friend grabs the tongs, they totally stopped him and took them away and did it for us. ÊI have no idea why; I don't want to believe that they were being racist, but maybe it was because it didn't seem like he was too confident about what he was doing. ÊWere we not supposed to do anything at all and let them cook it all for us? Anyway, if anyone can shed some light on this, please do. ÊOther than that incident, this restaurant was great. UPDATE: The owner contacted me soon after I posted this review (although it took me way too long to get around to reading and replying), and explained what had happened. ÊI'm happy to know that the incident above was entirely a misunderstanding. So overall, everything was excellent.

after the long drive from monterey we were starving and we arrived sometime in the evening in LA and there were two places that we thought of having dinner. the last few times we went the only preventing me giving them 5 stars because the first two reviews i did was the service. it had nothing to do with their attitude but how busy they were. my solution was for mgmt was to delegate some of the jobs so the waiters-ses weren't doing everything from taking orders, cooking meats, refilling side plates to filling drinks................... i'm sad (facetious) to say they didn't follow my suggestion but this time around they were more attentive in asking if we needed anything else. they also as we sat at our table brought up the button which they've never done before or maybe it was just during the times we went. we've seen this button before and many if not all korean restaurants have them which i refer to as the steward-ess button. the food was never ever the issue because its still the best korean bbq i've ever had. its just there are certain things you need while you eat that's a must. meaning, can you have a burger just on its own or do you have to have it with fries and an ice cold coke. can you have a pastrami on rye without a side of coleslaw and half sour pickles and a dr. browns black cherry soda. not having the pajeons or the daikon or the cucumber gimchi won't make the bbq taste that much better but its what makes the whole foodie experience that much more amazing when you do have it.

In Hollywood wanting korean food, my trusty yelp checker, Cami Parker got it down to Soowon. I called my bitch Ron HEDGEHOF Jeremy and arrived at 8. We had a 5 minute wait but ran into a Playboy Playmate friend, her and Cami, Hustler cover & centerfold talked model speak while Ron Drooled on them. What can I say that almost 800 others have said and a 4.5 stars except well deserved. We ordered two items, the beef Galbi Short ribs and pork, it was plenty for the three of us, actually 5 because Ron eats like 3 and Êhe is going to the electric Chair.

Holy moly, I just found Korean BBQ heaven. I went with 7 people and got the combination A platter, an order of bulgolgi, the seafood pancake, and 4 bottles of beer and our stomachs were about to explode at the end of the meal. I always get annoyed after I finish Korean BBQ because the smell always stays with you and stinks up your car but I did not mind after walking out of Soowon. I would like to be reminded of that dinner every time I take a breath and step into my car. Their side dishes were also delicious, especially the chop chae (the clear noodles). I must have asked the waiter to refill our plate of chop chae at least 5 times. I would definitely come back again, only after I work out so I don't feel so guilty stuffing 3 pounds of meat into my face. Also, the service was GREAT. It was $190 including tip for 7 people, which is totally reasonable. You also can't beat $2 valet.

Ok, so it's not 100% authentic Korean BBQ - but still a classy establishment with great meat, calm atmosphere and friendly staff. Good for a rainy day escape from the traffic of Vermont Ave. The side dishes are plentiful and seasoned perfectly. ÊTheir pork belly is spot-on. ÊThe downside is, it's kind of on the expensive side, but if you know how to order, you can keep it relatively reasonable. Definitely worth a try.

While I was in LA, I did a lot of eating. My sister and I decided to try Soowon Galbi Restaurant while we were in Koreatown. It received 4 stars overall on Yelp and there were lots of great reviews. Being Korean... I was going to see if this restaurant was going to impress me. AND IT DID!! :)! We ordered galbi (since that was their specialty) and pork belly. First of all, the service is excellent! The waitress and the waiters refill your water right away, they cook your meat and cut it into pieces! And the side dishes! There was at least ten different side dishes including one with a cherry tomato wrapped with eggplant! It was delicious! There was 3 different dipping sauce for your meats! And the galbi and pork belly was ono-licious! It was soft and savory! The galbi literally melts in your mouth. I would recommend to all my friends to go here and if I'm in Cali again... I will definitely travel the distance to go here again!

I'm gonna start off with the service which was a-mazing. ÊGranted we got there at 5pm where no one but maybe another couple was sitting there eating...nevertheless, the waitor was completely patient and helpful to the many questions fired at him. Ê We settled on just the beef (it wasn't bulgogi - the other thing) but it was super tasty and good. ÊI'm actually not one who likes fat on her meats but it did enhance the flavor and juiciness of the meat. ÊWell marinated and thinly sliced, the meat like, melted in my mouth. Side dishes -eh, they were okay. ÊI've definitely had better...and I don't really go to many Korean joints. Ê The wine was the most interesting part of the meal. ÊMy friend and I ordered the pomergranate wine which had the funkiest taste ever. ÊThere was a distinct taste between the pomergranate and the alcohol was you almost tasted the sweetness first, followed by the alcohol. ÊReally weird. ÊI'm probably not describing it very well, but really, it was weird. The bill was reasonable and comparable to most other Korean places. ÊAs we left, the parking lot which was empty when we first arrived, was full of people and cars waiting to park. ÊIt is a terribly small lot and doesn't look like much fun if you have to find parking.

This place is absolutely wonderful! The food is really fresh, and the place has a certain air of elegance, which is different from most Korean BBQ restaurants. The best thing about this restaurant is the service. Often when you go to many Korean BBQ places, it's a challenge to get the attention of the wait staffs. Usually they are super busy and running around like crazy. At Soowon Galbi it's totally different. Not only are there plenty of people who take care of the customers, but the way they treat their customer is awesome. You feel like you are the respected guest in someone's house, and that they really care enough to make sure you have a wonderful experience. We were there for over 3 hours, and they kept bringing us tea and water. They cooked the food for us. They helped us figure out what to order and how much we need to order. They checked up on us and made sure that everything was fine. It was outstanding! I guess this is such a wonderful place because there is so much attention to detail. The food looks and tastes fresh. The bathroom smells good. The owner takes the time to greet all the customers and check up on them, like a famous chef in a fine French restaurant. Everything is well planned, peaceful and works great. There is enough staffs to take care of all the customers. Definitely one of the best Korean BBQ places ever!

As (pretty much) a complete KBBQ novice, I wanted to go to a place where I wouldn't embarrass myself TOO much, would get a good deal, and could feel comfortable. This was perfect! I was so relieved to not have to cook the meat Ê(and therefore burn everything or humiliate myself with a dozen BBQ fouls) that everything else could have sucked and I would still have been happy. But it didn't suck! Not even a little! Even though there was a bit of a language barrier, when our server realized how clueless we were, he kindly (not condescendingly or even briskly) told us what all the side dishes were, how to use the noodle wrappers, which sauce went with what, etc. I really appreciated his patience, it helped me learn (which was what I wanted). As others have said, the combo is a great deal. I was with one person and we had the $40 version. Soup, rice, soju, fixin's (really good fixin's), beef, pork belly, and chicken! Awesome!

Another successful trip to Soowon. ÊTook a client here tonight and we were seated right away. ÊFood was brought out fast and so was our order. ÊWe were able to park in the complex, and just told the guy we'd pay him a couple bucks when we left (he was gone when we were done, but we honestly intended to tip him). ÊOrdered Combo B again. ÊThey accidentally brought out pork (we again requested to have chicken) but quickly changed it. ÊBanchan was refilled upon request and immediate consumption of the extra yummy ones they had today (the flower looking potato thing, I never know what that's called but So Hyang serves it too sometimes, the 'dilis' with cashews I hid on my corner of the table and the pancakes my mom inhaled instead of rice). ÊWe didn't get our vinegar or extra empty bowl (two people wanted to half a rice) but well, everything else was still great. ÊWe weren't seated at the walled-off part this time, so it was a little bit noisier (table behind us had two howling children), but we were still able to talk through our dinner. ÊNow, we're stuffed and in need of a nap, but thanks again SG for another great meal! Oh, and they served sikhye this time which I don't think they served last time. ÊSo extra smiles, if they would just serve it in a taller glass. ÊBut no worries, I drank dahdie's, so we're all good.

The side dishes and quality of the meat of this place are great. Everything is very clean and the ventilation is good. During dinner the service can get a bit sketchy, but expect that at most KBBQ restaurants. Only downsides to this place are parking and those metal chopsticks. At first these metal chopsticks seem pretty cool but then they start rolling around when you put them on the edge of your plates. I can't stand them, but that's just my problem and has nothing to do with the food, which is yummy, so eat here.

I will start this by saying that I have no comparison or real understanding of what authentic Korean BBQ truly is and that this restaurant is my only experience with KBBQ. However, I greatly enjoyed Soowon Galbi to the point of it making me indefinitely sold on the product that they provide. So much so, that I do not even have a desire to explore other KBBQ places in the fear that I may be let down from what I now look at as one of the greatest cuisines. How can you go wrong with firing up the meat in front of you, all of the delicious side dishes, and impeccable service in a very clean and comfortable setting? Now it's time to cure my pork belly and newly made kimchi fix.

This wasn't a meal, it was an EVENT!!! ÊFabulous experience. ÊWe weren't sure whether to come here or go to Genwa, but Yelpers on Talk made suggestions and indicated this was the more authentic. ÊSo over we drove to K-Town for an incredible meal at Soowon Galbi. ÊWe arrived early on a Sunday when they opened at noon, the three of us sat down in a booth with the BBQ grill in front of us, and then we made an attempt to order the best Korea meal we could find. ÊWe selected the unmarinated prime rib-eye, the house marinated beef Galbi, and the chicken bulgogi. ÊIn addition, we decided to try the vegetable bibimbab as well as the seafood and green onion pancake. ÊWe admitted to ignorance and asked the waiter what he thought of our choices and he simply said that we had ordered all the most popular dishes and ought to have a great experience. ÊSo then the meal began! ÊWow. ÊSalad and a dozen or so "sides" arrives for dipping or accompaniment to the meal and as we decimated each, the wait staff brought more every time there was an empty dish. ÊThe staff was incredible, and we had great attention as they kept an eye on our food and turned it at just the right moment to ensure a perfectly cooked meal. ÊIt was enormous fun, and none of us felt other than that we'd just enjoyed the best Korean food to be found in K-Town. ÊGoing back? ÊYou bet!!!

Supposed to be the best in LA, but I prefer my Brothers Korean BBQ in SF. SOOWON VS BROTHERS: -Brothers brings each table fresh wood charcoal. Soowon flips a switch. -In general, the meats were good, but not as enjoyable as Brothers. Brothers marinates their meat, so you just cook & eat, whereas Soowon's meat is unseasoned, & you dip in dipping sauces to get flavor. Dipping sauces aren't as soaked into the meat like a marinade, so I found the flavors less intense..a major difference in every meat that we ate. -Brothers' wood charcoal imparts a nicer, smokier flavor & seems to provide a higher cooking temperature. -For the same price, you'd get 3 large dishes at Brothers, but 4 smaller ones at Soowon, so the variety is nice, although Brothers offers a greater quantity of each dish. Variety vs quality. -Soowon gives you a free mug, but Brothers gives you free tofu soup with oysters & dessert! -I like Brothers' banchan better: acorn jelly, nori, better seaweed. Next time, I'll try all-you-can-eat & hope that LA can bring it. $60 COMBO: Best deal for 2 people! Includes rice, "stew" (simple broth), banchan, & choice of soju, beer, or soda..& a free gift! BRISKET: great! tender, soft. PORK BELLY: this needed marinating the most. my least satisfying pork belly experience, although it is usually one of my favorite meats. CHICKEN: good. RIBEYE: least favorite meat. BANCHAN: everything was just ok. i liked the marshmallow with carrots thingy. the white (!) seaweed wasn't as good as other seaweeds. i didn't get any aloe vera. i read about spicy raw crab on yelp, which they didn't bring us initially, i had to ask for it, & they obliged. SERVICE: very nice, although i felt like we were bothering her when we asked for more banchan. i like the thoroughness of the customer survey at the end. the free gift of a soowon coffee mug at the end was a very nice surprise.

Great meats. Great banchans. Great service. We ordered combo C and kimchi soup. Both were tasty. Banchans were all delicious. Definitely enjoyed their kimchi. Actually, I'd say that was the best tasting kimchi out of all the other Korn joints I've been to. Service was certainly above par compared to other Korn restaurants. (Thank God). In addition, the waiters were friendly and surprisingly somewhat cute--and this is coming from an Asian that doesn't find other ching chongs attractive. At the end, they served us that ginger tasting tea. Mmm Êdelish! I'd say the drive down here was worth it.

I had a craving for delicious Korean BBQ-ness that only LA Korean town could satisfy. Our group of discriminating meat eaters usually frequents Cho Sun Galbi but we were willing to try Soowon based on the high yelp reviews. And we were not disappointed. FOOD: We ordered the Family dinner set B (serves 4 it states but was plenty for our group of 5), which included 4 or 5 kinds of meat from galbi, pork belly, neck, and thin slices of beef. All was tasty though I don't think I would order the neck again. It's kind of crunchy. But the meats were high quality, well seasoned, and if unseasoned, then we had the tasty salt dip or light soy dip to complement. The panchan was good. Included about 7 or 8 varieties - cabbage kim chee, mayo noodles (not our favorite), shredded daikon, steamed broccoli, radish rounds, seaweed mix, thin rice noodle wraps, pancake, egg omelet... There was also the customary salad. We eagerly asked for multiple refills. The meal also comes with rice and soup. And of course we toasted with soju and Hite beer. Our total with tax + tip was $26. What a great deal! SERVICE: Good. They refilled our water, replenished our panchan, cooked and cut our meat. And gave us a new grill in between to avoid charred burnt pieces. DECOR: Surprisingly modern and new. SMELL: You do walk out of the restaurant smelling of the meat you consumed. Luckily all your friends do too. I'm a fan. Area for improvement: melon gum at the end of the meal.

Soowon has some of the best spread of side dishes of the Korean restaurants I've been to,but Êthere are better places for barbecue. The meat is of good quality and freshness but for some reason it doesn't absorb enough of that charcoal flavor that we sacrifice our clothes for. The servers are very nice but service itself was painfully slow last night. This place is worth a try, since most places normally use gas grills instead of charcoal, which results in cleaner but sort of banal flavors of the meat. The cleanliness and modernity of the space is also worthy of mention. I was impressed with the quality of the cuts that are served here, but if you're looking for a good traditional Korean bbq (i.e., marinated shortribs), try Soot Bull Jeep.

I went here with three friends on my birthday and it was excellent. It was to be my first Korean BBQ experience in LA, and while I had been to a Korean BBQ place back in Indy a couple of times, it was only that one. I wasn't sure what to expect, but I had a really great time here enjoying the atmosphere and eating the wonderful food. The appetizers were delicious, and being poor in Koreatown has given me a new appreciation for kimchi, a dish I didn't enjoy until I decided to give being broke in LA a shot. Being a special occasion, we threw down for the one hundred dollar meal which I'm fairly certain is the entire cow, chopped up, and brought to your table. It was literally more meat than our party of four knew what to do with, but we bravely soldiered on, aided by our new, but dear, friend, soju. Soju graciously helped everything slide down easier, which was very nice of him. I was a bit put off by the staff coming over to take the tongs out of our hands when we were flipping the meat. We had handle on it. Granted we did appreciate the thought and concern, what we really needed was advice and pointers on what to do with all the wonderful sauces that came with the meal. Undeterred, we just started dipping everything into everything else, and were pleased with the results, I made the joke that we might be doing the KBBQ equivalent of eating the mashed potatoes and gravy separately. We stumbled home and laid out in the living room strewn over couches and face down on the floor as we all slipped into the loving embrace of a meat coma. I had a great time, and wholeheartedly recommend this Soowon to first timers as the staff is friendly, the food delicious, and the restaurant clean and well lit. Just be sure to make friends with Soju.

No offense to all the non-Asians or better yet non-Koreans who read this but I was a bit hesitant upon entering the restaurant as there wasn't an Asian person in site except for the people who worked here. I'm a big believer in eating sushi where the Japanese eat or in this case Korean BBQ where the Koreans eat. I was mentally preparing myself at this point for disappointment thinking it would be the PF Chang's of Korean food - aka Westernized for American taste buds. We started with the galbi soup, moved onto the seafood pancake then the BBQ (galbi, beef brisket, beef tongue, pork bulgogi and pork belly). Everything came with it's own sauce if not pre-marinated and tasted to my surprise as authentic as Park and Chosun but without the wait! Even better was the fact that they pretty much cooked everything for us and made sure to change the racks for the different meats so we weren't cooking on burnt racks. They were also good about refilling the kimchi and other veggies served with the meat. My favorite thing of the night was surprisingly the salad. I don't even like salad but after eating so many lbs of meat I figured I'd have some veggies and boy was the dressing tasty. Our bill for 6 people with a couple beers came out to about $30 per person with gratuity which I feel is totally reasonable for good food and great service!

Once again, GBY. God bless Yelp. ÊI never, ever, ever would have found this place but for my brother and sister yelpistas.This was our first experience with Korean barbecue and it was a really, really good one. ÊI ordered the beef tongue -- yeah, I'm weird -- and it was thinly sliced and flavorful. Wife had the barbecued chicken, and it was fantastic. ÊWait staff cooked it for us on the barbecue right in the middle of the table, and we were constantly being checked in with by the ultra-cute, perfect-English daughter of the owner, and a batallion of helpers and waiters. There were eight or ten Korean appetizers placed on the table, and the cellophane noodles and pickled bean sprouts were the biggest hits, though I developed a real taste for the kimchi. ÊQuite crowded, not terribly noisy, there's a parking lot there with a two dollar valet. Only reason I'm not giving five stars is that I have no basis of comparison yet to other Korean barbecue places. ÊBut I'll come back and revise when I do. ÊKudos again to Yelp for steering us here. Oh yea. ÊWith tip, for two, less than fifty dollars. Can't beat it with a truncheon.

Soowon Galbi is a great restaurant - different bulgogi style - no lettuce! Not too sure where that comes from after living in Daegu for a summer. ÊHad to strangle the waiter, until he finally gasped and brought out Romaine. They put coals ontop of a gas burner - it's not 100% coal. ÊGood side dishes. Ê The $99 price fixe deal for 4 is ample. ÊThe plain short ribs are amazing. ÊThe best choice from that selection. They have a strange valet system in the front, just park and laugh, cheap attempt to milk more $ from you.

Went on a Saturday night around 7pm, the wait was 30 - 45 min. Typical Ktown valet parking in a small lot. Mixed crowd. Ordered the brisket (really good) and the ribeye (surprisingly average after the high expectation that came with the brisket). Side dishes were average, with the exception of sweet potato which was amazing. They didn't refill our side dishes at all. Overall it was just an average experience. I've had much better Korean BBQ in terms of quality and value.

Soowon is your typical nice Korean BBQ venue. I got here early so the service was great, promptly bringing us our food, cooking our meat and refilling our drinks. We ordered some galbi (26.99), pork belly (17.99), and beef brisket (17.99). They bring you the meat and proceed to cook it for you (you can ask them to leave you alone but I was tired and hungry). Meats great, the side dishes are ok and the salads one of the better ones I've tried at kbbqs. Great place but a bit pricey.

I've eaten at Soowon maybe 15 to 20 times and it's always great. The service is amazing. They are prompt, nice and pleasant. Last night, we had the chadol, galbi, kimchi jigae and daen jang jigae. Each item was perfect. I prefer Soowon bbq over Park's bbq because I think Park's has started using MSG in their food and Soowon is a bit more affordable than Parks. I can't wait to go back.

There is nothing gracious than dining at a restaurant next to a coin laundry and coughing up $60 for dinner for two. After reading the reviews we decided to eat here. We went before valet cut off. The restaurant was surprisingly clean. We ordered their kalbi and joomulluk. They brought out measly sides. The Kong na mul seemed dirty. They brought out about 5 oz. Of chopped kalbi $22 Êand two 3 oz slabs of marinated galbi.$25. Not satisfied I asked for two rice bowls. After 15 min of burning meat the rice comes out. We were about to order more but stopped ourselves. They brought out some chigae and if they hadn't we'd be starving. they didn't cook the big rib bones so I put that on the grill. Maybe they were gonna use it. Overall was tasty but too little. I'd rather buy 50 bucks worth of galbi and make my own. Total bill 60 after tip. Not worth it.

The galbi was marinated to perfection but the brisket was really fatty (ugh) They had a large variety of side dishes and all tasted really good. The only thing I did not like about this place was that it was crowded. Maybe it's an east coast thing, but I'm not used to grilling the meats myself. I felt the servers were swamped and did not have enough time for their tables. It took a while to get anything after we asked. There is plenty of parallel parking nearby if the lot is full and I felt this place was a little overpriced.

With more than 500 reviews and an average of 4.5/5 stars, I expected a wonderful time at this restaurant. Needless to say, you fellow Yelpers greatly disappointed me. I'm not talking about the food (which is well-made at this restaurant though overpriced), I'm talking about the service. I don't know whether it was because my party was full of females who aren't Korean or maybe the servers only knew a lick of English, but the service at this restaurant was unforgivable. My party was treated like we were invisible. We had to ask 4 separate waiters for water 4-5 different times. We weren't served water (the most basic thing to serve) until near the end of the meal. Any time we wanted anything, like hot tea, we didn't get it until after tirelessly asking multiple people. I swear, talking to a waiter was like witnessing your words pass from one ear, out to another. I've never felt so powerless and invisible in any service establishment. It boggles my mind why a server wouldn't be happy to take more orders or even receive your payment. And not once did any waiter ask if we were okay. It's as if the most basic rules of service don't exist in this restaurant or the service is unevenly given to members who don't belong to a particular ethnicity and gender. Sorry, Yelpers you got it incredibly wrong this time.

2.5 stars. Êi'm rounding up just to show my good side. I am certainly no food critic nor am I a writer, by any means. ÊWhat I am, is a Korean gal brought up in Los Angeles. ÊThis kinda makes me an expert on KBBQ. ÊIn this city you have KBBQ joints on almost every corner. ÊI'm partial to my favorites. ÊWhether it's because it reminds me of my youth when my father and I would sneak out for a couple of hours so that he could grab a few beers without Mama K breathing down his neck or on a lazy Sunday afternoon with the whole family in tow. I never would've picked Soowon and I still won't. ÊFirst of all. ÊI am (was) a Downtowner. ÊBums, hookers, drunks and crackheads are all my neighbors but this location actually had me looking over my shoulder holding on to my bag similar to the way Mama K holds on to her Chanel clutch. "Holly shit... What a crap hole." Ê The food is subpar. ÊThe banchan is ridiculously sweet. ÊI can't say the food is bad, just not... good. Ê The service was decent. ÊBetter than your hole in the wall KBBQ but that's to be expected since most of the customers are *eh...hem* Êwhite. ÊDon't get me wrong folks. ÊI love you people but you guys aren't quite the crowd I'm looking for in an authentic Korean restaurant. ÊOkay... That might be interpreted incorrectly but it's like finding a bunch of Koreans at a deli. I'm also not a cheap gal. ÊI don't mind paying more for something I can get for half the price somewhere else, as long as it's worth it. ÊThis ain't worth it.

My Korean BBQ experience is very limited, so I'm by no means an authority. ÊI came here after first going to the KBBQ festival which was a total clusterfuck. ÊAfter 5 minutes of that I had to have some KBBQ because the shit smelled so good at the festival but I was not waiting in line for it so I just hopped in the car and came here. I opted for the short rib and it was very good, nice and tender and flavorful. ÊMy head was spinning with all the sides and I wasn't quite sure what everything was (one of my Asian friends could have come in handy at that point), but I figured out my favorites.

Overall, the pricing is decent for the amount of food you are served. ÊMy only con is that they didn't have steamed egg because, according to our server, "salmonella." ÊI thought that ish was over? The banchan is delicious, the beer is ice cold, the meat is the perfect mix of fat and muscle, and the restaurant itself is super clean. Ê Valet parking is lame, but I guess in LA it is a must. Êboo.

My favorite Korean BBQ place in LA. Whenever someone from out of town wants to go somewhere, this is the first place that I recommend. It is surprisingly clean (the cleanest Korean BBQ place I've been to by far) and the menu is not too intimidating for people who haven't tried Korean BBQ before. The part I love the most about this place is that they use real charcoal on top of their gas grills. You really can't beat that smoky flavor. The meat quality is also pretty good and is a vast improvement over the "all you can eat" places. Soowon is one of my favorite places in LA. The service staff is friendly (they even cook it for you if you want) and I can't think of a better place to go, especially if you are in a group.

Had the best Korean style steamed egg ever ! *_* Pork belly was so fatty...yumm... ^_~ Beef rib ( non marinated ) was a bit too lean & chewy so we still prefer Park's ! Side dishes were fresh & tasty. Kimchi was very garlicky that we like. Service is attentive and the grill problem was immediately fixed... Overall, it's a decent KBBQ place in K town with a young vibe!

Of all the Korean BBQ places that I've been, I would say this place is the best in ktown! The service was awesome, meat quality was great, and the side dishes were tasty! Ê I went with a group of 6 people ordered two combos and ate like kings. We started with the meat and ended with the bean casserole with rice. Everybody was completely satisfied with the meal! Parking was easy ... I pulled up, gave my keys to the two dollar valet, and went into the restaurant. ÊI didn't have any problems. Even the valet guys were courteous!! I would definitely recommend this place to my friends and family!

I am a huge korean BBQ fan!! This is definitely one of the best korean BBQ places i've been too. The service was fantastic! We had a total of 6 people in our group and they greeted us and immediately found us a table. Not too long after we were given a bunch of deliciously looking side dishes. Im not a huge fan of fermented food but I loved their cold mash potatoes! After enjoying some of the side dishes, a server came and asked us what we wanted to order. Typically in a KBBQ resturant, the service are quite slow since it is usually crowded.. But this place great. I definitely will come back soon.

Being a new customer and not really knowing what's going on and not being explained/ steered into a direction that would have made the dining experience better, made it a bit frustrating.

Holy cow! Never been a fan of Korean BBQ generally 'cause the sides are confusing (like it simple). But this place definitely hit the spot, wondering around the streets in starvation we waited for half an hour to get in. Trust me it was well worth, maybe my mouth was already salivating from the aroma of meat. The meats they offer are to die, plus they cook it for you! Not like other joints where you have grill your own meat which I'm all for it. But if you are like me that has no cooking skills and typically burns their food, come here. The staff is very attentive and they give you the option of calling you on your cell while the wait. Large portion of meats, great potato pancakes and noodles can't beat that. This has to be my pick of the week.

Delicious, fresh Êmeat! Great marinade! Excellent appetizer dishes! Only downfall: service can be slow. I've brought many people here and no one has ever been disappointed.

I always feel like I am missing out on the full Korean BBQ experience because I don't speak Korean. Dishes always look so good from across the room... "I'll have what she's having." We ordered the Bulgogi and Galbi and it was excellent. 3 Hites, numerous orders of rice, rice paper, kimchi, garlic, hot sauce, salad and kimchi cucumbers entailed our opulent meal. The place accommodates people with kids. They have highchairs and don't make an outward fuss about the little ones. The service was friendly and after some gentle nudging; thorough. I should invest in a bib and learn some choice dishes to ensure I am always achieving maximum ÊKorean BBQ. I like this place. Its a little expensive, okay, a lot expensive. But its very good and nice for a special occasion. The parking however, can go F itself. The little corner is shared with a taco shack and a laundry mat. AND for some reason its VALET PARKING. Totally bullshit, 2 bucks to have some dude stack park your car OR park it in the street!?!

Went here with my boyfriend last Saturday since he lives around the area and I was craving Korean BBQ. The neighborhood it's located in made me doubt the place, but once we were inside, it was a whole different story. The place was clean and something about the decor made me like the place even more. The service was a little slow, I think it was because we were seated in the corner, so they weren't able to see us whenever we needed assistance. The workers are really nice though. They helped us cook our meat since we were a little busy watching the Lakers game that was going on. The meat was pretty good. We (well, more like I) ordered the Korean BBQ Beef and SooWoon Seasoned Beef Rib. The meet quality was good I would say, and the size was the size of the portions was above average I would say. I would say the salad had a different flavor compared to other Korean BBQ restuarants I had been to, not saying it's a bad thing though! The side dishes were pretty good, they served what you would usually get at any Korean BBQ restaurant, except they also served a 'house special' side dish, I really liked that side dish.

Yeah, the service, the quality of meat & marinades are top-notch. ÊI also thought I got a good value for the money. ÊThey are not stingy at all on the quantity of meat and they refill the sides as soon as the run out. ÊCharcoal grill is great - makes a big difference versus gas. ÊAnd, they do all the cooking for you. I tried to rack my brain for suggestions cause it really is great and I know the owners' daughter reads Yelp. ÊHere is what I came up with: more veggies. ÊMaybe a couple more side dishes with veggies or add an item on the BBQ menu for cooked veggies on the grill.

One day later, and my mouth is still salivating at the thought of the tender, hot off the grill beef brisket and the juicy chicken bulgogi. This place was definitely one of the highlights of our short day trip to LA. I mean, you can't visit LA and not indulge in some Korean BBQ. The bf and I ordered Combo D which came with beef brisket, pork belly, chicken bulgogi, a large salad, banchan, rice, and a beer for us to share. It may not look like a lot of food (sure does sound it like though!), but I can definitely report that we both needed to be rolled out of the restaurant by the end of our meal. My favorite of all the meats would be the beef brisket with the chicken coming in a close second. Although the beef brisket didn't come with any seasoning, it was delicious dipped in one of the many sauces that they brought to the table. The banchan was great, although I wish they gave us a little more kimchi to go along with our meal. After your food arrives, there is a lady that comes around the tables, cooking the food for you. At first, I was a bit hesitant about this, but I can definitely say that I enjoyed not having to tend to the food be able to focus my energy on eating. I only wish they had Korean BBQ places like this in San Diego.

Êwould love to try lunch there one day.

ÊThe thin beef brisket was also nice to start. ÊBanchan Êwas fresh and you can ask for more. ÊWe got three "refills" of their fresh kim chee - it's the non fermented one soaked in brine. ÊLoved the menu - easy to understand. Definitely higher in price but the meet seemed to be of better quality. ÊI left full but not sick full like when I go to the all you can eat places. ÊI also didn't smell as bad as I usually do either. ÊGood ventilation. ÊYou can get all you can get for 20-25 bucks in the area. ÊIf you are really hungry, it's better to go to other places like the honey pig. ÊIf you want good quality meat but smaller portions, try here. The galbi bone was the best part - they grill the small amount of tendon/meat off the bone and cut it up. It's chewy and flavorful and just wonderful. ÊThe drinks are a bit expensive but it's by the bottle. Ê ÊValet parking is very convenient. ÊIt's now $2.

I'm a sucker for AYCE Korean BBQ, so I was very reluctant to try this place. I'd probably leave less full with less money in my wallet, I thought. ÊIt's true that we spent more ($35pp vs $20pp at AYCE) but the quality of meat is SOO much better here! ÊI highly recommend chadol (thinly cut brisket, $18/serving) and marinated kalbi (ribs, $28/serving). ÊThe difference is pretty remarkable. We ordered flavored soju for $15 (yogurt flavor only, delicious! highly recommended) and also dolsot bibimbap (aroung $12) which were really good. ÊThey're very generous with banchan refills, the place is not as smokey as other places, and servers are very attentive. ÊWe left incredibly satisfied (but not uncomfortably full). ÊOh, there's valet parking for $2.

This remodeled new restaurant is located on the busy Vermont Avenue between James M. Wood & 8th Street. ÊTucked away in a seedy plaza, the hidden yellow signage is easy to miss. ÊDon't let the outside deter you from entering. ÊOnce inside, the modern decor will cease your impression of the exterior. The presentation of the food left an impression.

JESUS CHRISTO! That's a lot of meat! Thank you yelp, I found it. That meat hole, the delicious meats for the belly; it has been done. Sooooooooo, after yelping, I met my sister and her family here for our first try at Korean BBQ. Thank you, yelp. I knew what to do. Combo A= A TON OF SHIZ, Awesomeness, $99 This is two grown men, two grown ass women and a eight year old child, and we were totally full and happy. Combos are the way to go, unless you know what you're doing here. You get endless salad, a shit ton of little side items, five different dipping sauces, beer, delicious meats for your body, soup and rice. I substituted pork belly for pork neck like the reviews said to do, but I didn't care about this. The pork belly was the fattest and one of the last things cooked, so I was over it by then. The beefs had been so much better than the porks, and I'd reached a plateau you see. Not full, nor hungry, I would eat all meats I could see. Eat, until I saw no more. Seriously, they bring out and cook 3 or 4 kinds of beef and then 2 or three kinds of pork-look I can't remember exactly, I'd had a few HITE! beers. Just try everything and don't think about it too much. Dip it in the sauce, wrap it in the rice paper, eat the veggie thingy. NOTE: Please, please don't go here if you don't like meat or if you aren't in a meat eating mood. You will ruin everyone else's dinner. Don't be that person. I'm not saying I love loads of meat, but you must put on your big girl, meat eating boots for this. Like my eight year old niece turned and said to me , "Aunt Katie, I think this is enough meat to last me 'til Sat Patrick's Day." I couldn't agree with her more.

ÊThey didn't understand what we wanted, but fortunately a waiter showed up and he spoke fluent English...hooray! ÊHe chatted a little bit to us and answered our questions while he help us cook. ÊGreat service! The bill came out to $26/head. ÊIt thought it was a very good value, but my friend later told me that he was still hungry. ÊSo, I guess we didn't order enough.

The food is GREAT! but the parking was not so easy. There's only 10 parking spots for the whole complex. The only thing that gets me frustrated is when the waitress or waiter stops serving attentively as soon as some locals came in. We drove all the way from Bakersfield to visit this place. It took are waitress really long time to get our rice and steamed egg. I know it takes awhile to get the steamed egg that's why I always order it in the very beginning, but It didn't show up till the last 15min we were there. Service is very important but since they just opened, I will over look that. I had 7 people with me and we stuffed our faces. We have visited several Korean BBQ in this area and this has the best presentation and atmosphere. Aside from the parking I definitely we come back!

Came here a few times with friends and coworkers. The service is fast and friendly (wow, so different than most Asian restaurants...) and the food is amazing. The beef is well marinated. Their side dishes are unlimited and plentiful and GOOD. I think the last time I went, we ordered 3 refills on the side dishes. The only thing is this place is a bit expensive.

This is definitely one of my favorite korean bbq places I have found thus far, but it's not necessarily a good place for all-you-can-eat bbq. ÊIt's a little more on the pricey side but perfect for a date or a smaller group of people. ÊThe ban chan (the little side dishes they give you) are my FAVORITE out of all the other Korean places I have been too. ÊThere's yummy sweet potatoes and bomb-ass cucumber, and they even give you little pancakes, and the soup is amazinggg. ÊPlus, they give you a humungous bowl of mixed salad. The special marinated beef they have is a MUST! ÊThe brisket was really good, too (but then again, when is brisket NOT good?). But the main reason that this place sticks out to me so much is the service. ÊThe service is the best service I have ever encountered, and not just in any Asian restaurant, but EVER. yes, I know, it's a big deal. ÊAnyone who has ever been to any Korean bbq place knows very well the semi-hectic struggle between wanting to consume everything that's on your plate but at the same time making sure that there is much more meat being cooked, and more importantly not burned. Well, have no fear! Here, they were on top of everything. There were maybe 3 different servers and they were soo nice, even to come around every 3 minutes and so to help you cook the meat and make sure nothing is getting burned. I was in awe. And, if you're a first-timer they will also definitely help you out a lot with the menu. ÊI seriously wanted to leave a thank-you card or something. Well, maybe the big tip was enough, lol.

The Food was Awesome. i have had the same dishes in other Korean places from Chicago to California an none compare to SooWan Galbi. the resturant its self is not where you think it would be. but once inside you forget about everything else. the Price is about normal..so don't get fooled by the $$.. it should be closer to $$$ but its worth it.

Visited on Monday night for my 1st Korean BBQ experience (besides the Kogi truck). It was a party of 7 girls for a birthday celebration. I read the reviews on Yelp to prepare myself on what to order and expect. Everyone was correct that Combination #1 is HUGE and plenty of food for a group. 6 of us actually ate the full dinner, and it was PLENTY of food for us. We are all pretty healthy eaters and tried everything. I was shocked it was enough. I really enjoyed the salad and rib-eye meat. They kept bringing so many types of side dishes and meats that it was hard to tell what was what. Of the side dishes, I remember enjoying the sweet potatoes and spicy cucumbers. Oh and also the potato cakes? The rice wine (soju?) was OK. The neighborhood isn't the best, but don't let that deter you. Inside it is very clean, and I liked how clean and nice the menus were. The only complaint is how hot it becomes around the grill, and the fact that we all smelled like smoky meat the rest of the night. I wonder if they could somehow have a better ventilation situation? Maybe it's just part of the experience. Just don't wear your best threads or plan to go out if you care to stink all night. :)

I came here on a weekday afternoon around 2pm and it wasn't too crowded. Decor was rather nice and the place seemed clean. They have a deep menu but we were there for the BBQ. Seating was prompt and service for the most part was timely and friendly for my party of 2. We ordered 3 plates, 1 of the house galbi and 2 of the chadol. The banchan seemed to come out a tad later than the usual Korean BBQ joint but it did come out. Here's a mini breakdown of the timing: Seated, water came right away w/ the menus. I'd say 5 minutes passed before someone came back to take our order which was fine. Few minutes later they set down the drinks we ordered and a tub of salad along with added charcoal and a cover for the grill. 5-7 minutes after that the banchan came, and 3-5 minutes after that the meat came and they started us off by placing some of our chadol on the grill. After the slow start everything was great service wise. The young man who was our waiter came back every 5 -10 minutes to check up on us and refill our rice paper/change our grill/asked if we needed anything. Quality of meat was really good. I'll say meat quality was a step above Honey Pig (which is my go to place usually) and 2 steps above somewhere like Tahoe. Price for 3 meat dishes, bottle of OB, can of 7-U, came out to roughly $80 total. Soowon Galbi is a bit on the pricier side but the service, quality of meat, and atmosphere will keep me coming back every now and then. They have a small shared parking lot in front with limited spaces but there is usually meter parking along the streets if you get lucky enough. Overall great experience here and left satisfied but not too overly stuffed. (Sometimes going to AYCE places, you tend to want to get your money's worth and leave the place barely able to breathe bc you've over eaten) So if you want something a little nicer than the avg. Korean BBQ joint I'd recommend coming here once in a while as a change of pace. Food/Quality of Meat: 4.5/5 Service: 4/5 Atmosphere (Weekday Afternoon): 4/5 Parking: 3/5

Hey all! Long-time browser, first-time reviewer. Thought I'd finally write a review because my friend and I found this place through Yelp! We were cruising around K-town at night looking to try a new KBBQ place. We saw a sign for one (that shall remain nameless here) and entered the strip mall accordingly. WOW CREEPY! Dark shadowy un-lit areas with shady parking and overall... not a place I'd enjoy even if the food was good. So I pull up Yelp on my iPhone and try to scramble for a solution before we can give up and go to our old haunt. Up first on the list was Soowon Galbi. And hey! It was only a couple blocks away! Off we go... Parking lot was alright. Interesting location with the laundromat and all, but s'all good. There was valet for $2 I think, but they just waved us through? Stepping inside the restaurant was a new experience. Greeted happily at the front counter! Promptly seated. Everything looked clean as a whistle! (Rare!) And it just seemed... nice for a change. Decided to go with the combo D -- Pork Belly, Brisket, and Chicken.. + Soju ^___^. Unfortunately, we were told they were out of chicken. FORTUNATELY (and to my glee!) it was happily replaced with more beeef!! Yay! =D I'd have to say, service was impeccable that night! Panchan was neatly arranged -- attention to detail a big plus! When the meats came out, I was in awe. I guess I'm not used to seeing it come out that FRESH. Servers/waiters came by and helped with turning meats and asked politely if we would want them cut into more manageable pieces. Sure! The meats themselves tasted great. After having lackluster AYCE meats the past few times, I think I'm leaning towards quality now over quantity. Very happy with the pork belly as other places I have been to have had close to uneatable cuts. After dinner, we were treated to a Korean drink that my friend absolutely loved. He asked what it was called, and was actually given a note with the name of it, how to pronounce it, and directions on how he can get a hold of his own! Again, I have to re-emphasize the service at this place. Top-notch! Alyssa, thanks for the experience. Was that you at the counter btw? =p

I liked their banchan, and how they had pa jeon. The meat was very fresh and tasted pretty good. A bit pricey though $22 per serving for joomoolluk (minimum of 2 servings), but I guess a lot of Krn BBQ places are around that price range. I don't eat a lot so 2 servings was definitely enough for me and my gf. Good service overall, and nice clean place. not too crowded. I'll just remember to bring more people next time so we can get different kinds of meat.

ate here tonight and being korean this is so far the best korean bbq in los angeles county. (i am still in the hunt to see if there is a place better than this place) the parking lot is very small however, they have a valet that will take care of you. we walked into the place and it looked very clean and the place did not stink with kbbq smoke. we signed our name on the list around 7:00pm. we waited outside for about 20-25 minutes. the hostess came out and called out who was next on the list. she would come out constantly and then she asked where we were on the list and she said oh okay and then she came back a bit later and said that our table would be ready in 5 minutes. we came in and they seated us down. the waiter brought us menus. we looked through the menu and decided to get their soowon king beef galbi ($28) and cha dol, which is thinly beef slices (around $15 i think). a waitress came with our water and got our order. later a korean salad came out and then later 10-12 different side dishes (known as ban chan) came out. there was potato salad type (i thought it had a unique taste, it was good), dried seaweed mixture, marinated fish with green beans, mayo with some rehydrated noodle thingy, korean style pickled radish, kimchi, korean style strips of seaweed, broccoli mixture, and it comes out with thin slices of rice cake sheet, which you wrap the meat around with and i think that was about it. i tried the side dishes and they were all good. right after our meats came out. looking at the meats they really put care into the way they slice the meat and you can tell their is meats are quality. the waitress put the meat on the grill for us. we then cooked our own meat and we tried the cha dol and man this is like truly delicious!!! because they use a special type of korean wood (soot) that the flavor really comes out through the meat. you don't even need to dip the meat with sauces because the meat flavor is that good! after we finished the beef slices we grilled the short rib galbi and the meat looked wonderfully marbled and it is marinated. the galbi was sooo tender and it was very succulent! also, i love grilling the kimchi because it has this grilled flavor and truly brings out the flavor of the kimchi. so delicious!!! (try it sometime! eat it with the meat) the service here was awesome!! they came and checked our meat for us and helped cook it as well. also, they came around if we needed anything, brought water, i asked for more side dishes and they gladly brought it out quickly. After my bf and i finished everything, they gave us dangjanggeegae (korean soybean paste soup) and noolongji (rice porridge) and we got to finish our meal with that and at the end they give us shik gae, which is a korean sweet rice drink. this place is a bit pricey, however, the quality and the service is superb! compared to other korean bbqs.... overall, i had a great experience here and i would definitely come here again and make reservations because i now know why people come here.... its that awesome!

Very clean and modern look. ÊI had never been to Korean BBQ before, but the waiter was very helpful in explaining what everything was and how it worked. Ê A little on the pricey side, but the food was delicious. ÊSo many choices for sides, too! ÊThe seaweed salad, potatoes in honey, and vegetable pancakes were absolutely the best.

Clean environmnent. Good quality meats. Excellent service. Ate here for a friend's bday and ordered combo A. All the meats were of very good quality. They ran out of rice paper due to a large party that was there that evening and the hostess gave us complimentary egg custard. Although it wasn't necessary, it was a courteous gesture. Some places have several sauces to dip the meat in. Additionally, some of the red meats could have been cooked on a slightly higher heat so they were not all well done. However, that is more of a personal preference. I think those are the only improvements I would suggest. Otherwise, this is a great establishment.

For me, Korean BBQ is all about the quality and overall flavor of the meat. So in that respect, this place dissappoints in my opinion. I ordered the kalbi (marinated short ribs). They were not bad per se, but also not the best I have had. The meat was a little chewy for short rib and the flavor of the marinade was not intense enough IMHO. Perhaps, the meat was not marinated long enough. Perhaps if it was marinated longer, the meat would have been more tenderized and flavorful. The accompanying dipping sauces were good (salt with sesame oil, red chili sauce, fermented bean paste) but should have been superfulous if the meat were flavorful enough already. The panchan were excellent, and probably my favorite part. The service was great overall, and I tipped accordingly. The server made certain that the meat was tended to on the grill even while juggling several tables simultaneously. The server also accomodated me by allowing a single order of kalbi (generally two person minimum is required). Also on a positive note, at the end of the meal there was a cold, sweet pine nut tea? which was subtle, refined, and a nice finish.

Korean food is in my bones, in my blood, is part of my roots. But somehow I forget how much I love it until weeks, months go by and all of a sudden I have an irrepressible craving for it! Some friends tried this place a few weeks back and have been raving ever since, so we made a date to go there last night. I traveled through 1.5 hours of rush hour eastbound traffic and by the time I got there I was ravenously hungry and expecting a LOT. And Soowon did not disappoint! First of all, the service was stellar. As much as I hate to say it, friendly service is not something I've come to expect from the best Korean places. For one thing, the servers at really authentic Korean places rarely even understand much English, so unless you're a Korean speaker you're pretty much up a creek. Not here - the hostess, our waitress and our other server were all really nice and although I tried my pathetic Korean on them, I probably could have spoken English the whole time and it would have been fine. We had a last minute change in our order and the waitress was fine with it, and then the young gentleman who helped us with the grill was sooo attentive! He didn't just slap the meat on there and disappear - he came back to flip, change the kinds of meat, replenish our banchan... it was really incredible! These people have such a labor intensive job it's not even funny. And we were saying the dishwasher in the place must have the hardest job of all, as each order comes with a plethora of banchan! Now to the good part - the meat was incredible. Being with some non-Koreans, we went of course with the bulgogi, which seems to please the most palates. It was perfectly tender and beautifully marinated. We also had the chicken bulgogi which was also super tender and had a great gingery taste to the marinade. I suggested the kalbi, as I was under the impression that it's another non-Korean crowd pleaser, but the table was least impressed with that cut because the meat was a bit chewy. We admired the brisket that the other tables ordered and will definitely be getting that next time. Finally, be warned that this is another place that has eschewed bowls of rice for those little rice wraps, which I have to say I've warmed to lately. They also provide daikon wraps, which I assume are much healthier but also easier to pick up with your chopsticks than those sticky little rice wraps! When the check came and we split between two credit cards, for a moment we thought there was a mistake because the total was so low. Talk about a steal! I really hope that Korean food doesn't keep getting more trendy because I would hate for the prices to rise ... you really can't beat the quality and quantity of food Êyou get for the price! I'm no K-town expert but next time someone asks where they can get some good Korean bbq, I'm pointing them right to Soowon!

Many months ago the owner emailed me informing that 1) the valet service has been changed due to a fender bender 2) the rice cake sheet order has been increased to meet the demand and 3) she spoke to her staff regarding the food tampering/grilling issues. A few months ago I went to LA. I went to Soowon... simply because I've been going there since I was a little kid, and it was one of the first places where I got drunk, and the food is reliably good. I must say the promise made to me by the owner regarding the improvements were definitely upheld, and then some. I don't know if it was because I didn't have much to complain about because the experience improved so much, but the food, I swear to god, tasted better. I can't get over the succulent, thick, juicy pork belly seared crispy on the outside and melting in my mouth on the inside, the almost crumbly texture of such tender, marinated bulgogi and some of the best KBBQ ribs I've ever had. The sides are excellent and the refills are frequent and plentiful. Of course, it doesn't hurt that I feel like things are properly sanitized here, which I can't say about every Korean restaurant in this part of LA. (a bit of a germophobe, neatfreak) The service was courteous, quick, not fussy, and the staff was very helpful, pleasant, and professional despite a ridiculous Friday night rush and line out the door (again, but that's a good sign!) Good work, Soowon. I'll be back again, real soon.

I gotta admit it, I came here because I was curious. Has this ever happened to you - all of a sudden friends, acquaintances, newspaper, TV, Goodyear Blimp and even strangers all bring up the same topic? Ok it wasn't all of them but there were a number of fellow Yelpers that had things to say about Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ, then one of my relatives called and said she heard about Soowan and how great it was and suggested we give Soowon a try. Finally, and this is the most random, about an hour after speaking with my relative some dude on Chinese radio was raving about how good the food at Soowon was - Chinese radio can you believe it? How random! I think there was a slight tear in the karma fabric of the universe and the self healing powers were trying self-mend this tear before the disruption becomes cataclysmic and threatened to bring down the human civilization as we know it. Hey you know what, I am definitely NOT someone who would intentionally tempt fate, I figure somebody or something somewhere is trying to tell me go to Soowon and sh*t I ain't gonna take a chance of getting hit by lightning or whatever the F that may happen to me by ignoring it - you don't need to upside my head with a 2x4 to get my attention - Mama didn't raise no fool! It was a weekend evening - I could feel the warm balmy summer breeze ... ok, ok this is K-town in the middle of Êsummer, in the middle of LA, there wasn't no breeze other than the hot wind coming from the direction of the mayor's office downtown. Where was I? Oh yeah, weekend evening and the parking lot was almost full so I decided to park no the street - not a problem. I've been to Soowon before but this time I felt that my center, my Chi, was in alignment with the cosmic universe - it felt right walking in to Soowan's dining room. The stylish dining room was the same as before yet different; it was more welcoming. I felt like a soldier coming home from war. Ok, I 've never been a soldier and never seen war but don't hold that against me, the rest of that sentence is the absolute truth. I looked up and saw an angel, the hostess was standing there smiling and bowing her head in that distinct Korean way and motioning for us to follow. Once seated, she welcomed us back - she remembered us! The rest of the evening we enjoyed the same friendly service by the other members of the staff. Everyone was so friendly, the waitress told us about her Chinese son-in-law. The waiters were quick and efficient; filling up drinks, retrieving and replacing fallen chopsticks. I once visited Korea and ate at a restaurant that cooked their beef using real charcoals. Ever since then, I've tried many a Korean BBQ places and was never able to find that same great smoky flavor, that is, not until I tried Soowon. The beef at Soowon is super fresh and super high quality. I like my beef on the virgin side of rare, so any hint or trace that the beef is less than fresh is not only unacceptable but would immediately bring down the wrath of my Korean side of the family who would and does not hesitate to raise hell if the food or service is not just perfect. Luckily (probably due more to Soowon's professionalism than luck) this has not come close to happening at Soowon. The dinner was great, the presentation superb, and the service personable and courteous. We could not have asked for more. Next time? I think I'll bring my son and his crew and let them try their hand at flirting with the hostess, she's cute! Anyway, if they all strike out they would at least end up with a great meal.

After reading numerous yelp praises, i decided to check Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ out. ÊOn a crazy wednesday rainy night, after attending a taping of the tonight show with jay leno, we trek across from burbank to koreatown for korean bbq meat. ÊWe ordered the $39.99 combo for two, which had plenty of meat, but way too much fat on them. ÊDon't get me wrong the meat was good, just don't watch the cholesterol meter spiking obscene reading. ÊFor the more mature folks, don't forget the Lipitor. ÊThe sides weren't very special, with the usual suspects of bean sprouts, potato, seaweed, etc etc. ÊThe service was excellent, never once did we need to ring for service, multiple attendants came to serve us. ÊOverall, I like Soowon Galbi, but it's not special enough for me to trek from San Diego to Los Angeles to visit here for my korean meat fest on a regular basis.

I found myself in K town during lunchtime and found this place on the yelp app. ÊIt was a little pricey at $38 for two people for lunch, but in the end was really worth it. ÊYou will not leave hungry. ÊI would agree with Angela O. on pretty much everything. ÊThe salad is not too exciting, but the banchan (now I know what all those little dishes are called) was great. ÊThere were several types of kimchi and countless other items that I am sure I would not be able to type or pronounce. ÊPork belly was a great start and the chicken thighs were delicious as well. ÊService was nice and attentive with my constantly emptying glass of water. ÊTruly the best KBBQ that I have had.

KBBQ in K-town is A-OK at Soowon Galbi! ÊI was informed of this place by, and dined with, fellow Yelper Daniel L. ÊThere was a surprise when we arrived, as we thought this place was an AYCE KBBQ restaurant but, we were pleasantly informed that we can basically order all we can eat and purchase from the menu. ÊWell, so much for wishful thinking. ÊAnyway, this restaurant appears to be newly remodeled and was quite inviting. We were seated within minutes and approached by one of the most patient, attentive, and experienced young waiters I've ever encountered! ÊThis young man made us feel appreciated as diners, as he thoroughly explained the menu and expressed his opinions on our food choices. ÊThe banchan was delivered very quickly, and served in small portions, but was refilled upon request. ÊOur meat selection, Marinated Galbi and Marinated Bulgogi, was plentiful and cooked by the staff. ÊAs we watched the meat sizzle and create a cloud of aromatic smoke, we talked, watched the flat screen television, and were entertained by the staff as they repeatedly returned to check on the meat. ÊSome of the meat was a bit fatty, particularly the Bulgogi, but it was quite tasty. ÊI didn't indulge myself with the banchan, as I'm not too fond of cold food items, but picking my favorites and having them refilled was certainly appealing. Overall, we were pleased with Soowon Galbi, especially the service. ÊThe number of people waiting to dine at this place says plenty about Soowon Galbi's popularity. ÊI'm not too fond of smelling like my meal long after I eat it, so I'll be sure to make no plans after dining here in the future, as we smelled like KBBQ afterwards, probably making everyone around us rather hungry. ÊAgain, Soowon Galbi is A-OK*. *An extra star was given due to the exceptional service.

The best of the best Korean not just in Southern California, but in my mind the US. You can't go wrong with the Galbi or the Bulgogi as they seem to marinate it just right. ÊThe Banchi is plentiful (Kim chee, potatoes, seaweed, etc.) and very tasty. Ê As long as you can handle the wait (if they ever expand to a bigger size restaurant, this problem will be minimized), the service is definitely top of the line, as they are always there to take care of you and help you grill if need be. If there is anything I could add also, is if you eat here, eat it hot off the grill. ÊIf you have leftovers, they don't taste quite as good as when you cook off the grill. ÊAlso, this place is a little more expensive than other Korean places in the area, but I believe the value is there, because the food and staff has always been consistently good...

[M]ona: 5 Stars [W]ayne: 4.5 Stars Average: 4.75 Stars + Excellent Service + Valet Parking + Good Kalbi + Lots of Banchans + Clean + Accepts Credit Cards [W] Mona wanted to check this place out when we were down in LA. This place was conveniently located in no other place than.......KOREAN TOWN!! Who would've thunk it? Heh. Anyways, driving here kind of seemed like we were kind of going into the ghetto from what I can see but when you get to the restaurant, it wasn't like that at all. The private parking lot in front of this restaurant was lively and full of people waiting to get in. The parking was also a valet but don't worry, you don't have to pay for parking other than tipping the driver so that wasn't too bad. There was already people waiting in line to get in, but for some reason, when we walked in, they seated us immediately....SCORE!! [M] The restaurant was fully packed but it was surprisingly bright and clean inside. They even had a flat screen TV mounted on the wall so you can enjoy some nice K-Drams. For dinner, we ordered the Spicy Seafood Bibimbop, Kalbi and the Pork Bulgogi [http://www.yelp.com/biz_É The food came very promptly and it was a hefty amount of meat for the both of us to share. One thing I like about Korean restaurants is that they give you about 8-12 little appetizer plates (banchan) for you to sample. It ranges from kimchee, rice cakes, pickles, bean sprouts, tofu cakes, beans, potatoes, etc. Along with the banchan, we were also served a green salad that was very refreshing [http://www.yelp.com/biz_É. [W] There's something special about this place and that is... the people who work here pretty much cooks everything for you! They first started off our meal with cooking the Kalbi over the grill. I guess there were 2 people that were overlooking our area, one guy and one lady. Basically the guy laid out the meat on the grill to start cooking [http://www.yelp.com/biz_É. After a couple of minutes the lady would walk by and cut up the meat flip it to cook the other side. This was the same when we had to cook our Pork Bulgogi. All me and Mona pretty much had to do was just......EAT! Haha. They even mixed the Bibimbop [http://www.yelp.com/biz_É for us and served it in a bowl to us. I mean, I'm really not used to getting pampered like that and it was actually really nice for a change to not do anything! Pretty much all they had to do left was feed us, that how little work we had to do for our dinner! [M] Out of the two meat dishes we ordered, I preferred the Kalbi. It was marinated PERFECTLY. The meat was so flavorful and most importantly juicy and tender! The Pork Bulgogi was good too! Overall the service was very quick and pleasant. We didn't have any issues here tonight and our dinner was very delicious. [W] Kudos to this place and I think it's a definite possibility we would stop by here on our next trip to LA.

note: this is not an AYCE place ...came here for a friends bday.. 24 of us.. Êthey split us up into 3 tables and gave us separate checks per table..so that was nice of them.. makes everything so much more convenient for the bill. The Goods: - this place have good quality meats, but i still think Chosun Galbee's better. - it is clean - service is great - a lot of banchan The NOT so good: - it's quite expensive...so don't go w/ a big group of ppl who will eat a lot because you'll end up emptying your wallet. - the banchan is really not all that impressive - i've had better. my table of 8 ordered two combos: A ($100) and B ($80)..each combo comes w/ a choice of drink for the group.. but we asked for no drinks and asked for more meats for one of the combo; the other we got a bottle of soju. The combos are suppose to feed 4-5 ppl.. thinking ordering 2 would be enough... wrong. we were still hungry afterwards..so we ended up going to the taco shop (el jalapeno) in front of Soowon. As my friend puts it... for the amount we've spent at Soowon, we could have bought out the taco shop for the night.

I have been there once and i was not impressed at all. The service is like any other Korean restaurant. If your not Korean it is pretty hard to get good service in K-Town. The only place i know that gives you THE BEST SERVICE is GENWA!!! At Soowon Galbi They make you order 2 orders of meat which turns out to be expensive. there side dishes are not good and they dont offer to refill them.. If you are looking for great Korean BBQ I recommend going to Genwa! The Service is great and the Food is Delicious!!!!

As seasoned ayce Korean bbq eaters, my bf and I have gotten used to cooking our own food and ordering whatever we wanted off a set price. We got the combo D, which is suggested for "2 people." ÊIt only comes with the brisket, chicken, and the pork (the one that looks like thick bacon). Ê The food was ok. ÊThe brisket was nearly all fat. From what the lady told us, their goal is to make at least half of the meat be fat. I'm not a big fan of that idea. ÊShe was nice enough to get us 'leaner' brisket which was 'only' about 33% fat instead. ÊStill not a fan. The chicken was the best, probably because that was the only piece of meat that we were actually able to eat. It tasted slightly sweet and by then we were just hungry. Their bacon thing--I guess makes sense, has little to no meat. ÊLesson learned. I also didn't like them cooking my food, I like cooking a certain way (basically unfolding the meat to cook it evenly). ÊThe servers hang Êover you to cook your food, we tried to ask them to stop. ÊThere was just too many of them. Service: they didn't refill our waters until we flagged them down a couple times nor did they take away empty plates -which made the space very uncomfortable. Ê Recommendation: If you just want decent Korean bbq and don't fell like cooking your own food--then this place is an option for you. For all others, I think there are ayce places with more meat varieties, similar meat quality (or better), and more affordable.

ÊThe only things stopping soowon from getting 5 stars are: 1) the combos - they have no all beef combos and they aren't very nice about letting you substitute 2) no AYCE 3) no more of the egg soup (our waitress said they stopped serving it three months ago... who knows if that's true) and 4) the service (I know, you dont go to K town for the service.) ÊBesides the aforementioned items - Soowon definitely won me over. ÊThe meat was good quality and tasty (not frozed and dried out), the salad dressing was awesome; they have RADISHES and Cucumber Kimchi (That right there wins it for me) and the two of us got outta there with a $50 bill. ÊNot bad if you ask me. ÊI will be back!

in the words of flava flav.."Don't, don't, don't... don't Êbelieve the hype!!" After reading some of the reviews and viewing some of pictures posted on yelp , I was expecting great things. I was excited, ecstatic even. When I arrived, they said there would be a 45 min to an hour wait. I said HOOOOT DAMN! But I was determined to eat at this place, so nothing would deter me. This is as determined as I have been in quite some time. But the hostess lady was nice, she said if I wanted to leave my name and number she would call me once it was my turn to be seated. So I did and I walked around the area and I finally got a call from the hostess lady and went back to soowon to take my seat. I just went with one other person so I only ordered two plates of meat- cow tongue and "marbled" ribeye. Let me start of by saying Marbled my A**. The meat was not melt in you mouth or tender, Êbut more on the rough and chewy side. It definitely didn't taste like Grade A beef. ÊThere weren't that many banchan dishes compared to some of some other KBBQ places I have eaten at. And when they gave us a refill on some of the banchan dishes they gave us some broccoli Êthe 2nd time around. I didn't know they offered that as a side dish since they didn't include it in our first serving of banchan. Why you holding out on me soowon?! All i have been is patient with you! That left me wondering what else I might have missed out on while i was there. Granted they were busy, thats still not excuse, tsk tsk tsk. ÊSince this was not a AYCE kbbq place i was expecting the quality of meat to be a notch above AYCE and it was not. ÊLets just say I rather have gone to ÊTahoe, at least there the meats better, there's more banchan , its cheaper and to top it off its AYCE. Hate to sound like a KBBQ nazi, so I'll give this place 2.5 stars.

They cook the meat for you which I didn't love since some Êof it was burning and I had to grab the tongs when the waitress wasn't around to save the meat. Then when the waitress saw me with the tongs she asked for them back... Kind of awkward. The meat was fatty and the kimchi was not the best I've had I don't think I'll be back.

Wow... melt-in-your-mouth galbi ... nice & efficient service, quality meats and amazingly tasty banchan. Also shared seafood pancake and jap chae. I completely forgot to eat any rice! Not pricey for what you get -- came out to approx. $30 per person including soju. The only drawback was this was the smokiest BBQ restaurant I've been to.

4-5 stars across the board for this place? Really? Seriously? POSITIVES: Cute hostess and quick valet. That's it! NEGATIVES: Everything else - here's my laundry list... 1) The food ** Terrible pork belly cuts: We ordered combo D and it came with 3 "way too thick" slices of pork belly. My grandmother - who has been eating Korean food her entire life - said she's never seen pork belly cut that thick. And when you bite into it, you get a big heaping of burnt fat. Yuck. ** I know my beef meat cuts and although my knowledge of pork cuts is limited, I know that pork belly shouldn't be sliced so thick or else the fat on the edge gets burnt and acts like a shield so that the inner fat doesn't get cooked properly. ** The galbi is tenderized - practically cube steak a la marinade. Excellent beef doesn't need to be tenderized; Soowon's galbi is tenderized; therefore, Soowon serves bad beef? I think so. ** The banchan (side dishes) were okay - nothing to write mama about. I could then I'd probably be disowned! ** Neng-myun (buckwheat noodles) was absolutely, scientifically, outrageously ATROCIOUSLY TERRIBLE. The broth was so bad that I didn't even finish it. It was way too sweet as if someone accidentally dropped a cup of sugar in it. Store-bought neng-myun is far superior than this junk they dare call neng-myun. This is an insult to Korean food. I think a bowl of cold water, MSG, and noodles would have tasted better than this. ** The rice drink (at the end of the meal) was lacking a sweet taste. They must have used all the sugar for the neng-myun. The rice drink (sheek-hae) had maybe a milligram of sugar, the neng-myun probably had 10 grams of sugar. 2) The Quality (or lack thereof): ** $39.99 for Combo D was highway robbery. Dark meat chicken, 3 slices of pork belly and brisket for $40? Definitely not worth it. Might as well shell out a few more bucks and go to a quality Korean BBQ restaurant. ** They throw in a bottle of soju, beer, or soda and while Yelpers may think that's generous, the restaurant is making a killing. Yet when people hear or see the word, "Free," they get all excited, lose their brain, and get their panties (or boxers) in a knot. ** They must make a killing selling those combos. The quality is lacking dramatically. If you come to dine at Soowon, 80% of your money is probably going to pay for overhead - the expensive rent and valet service. 3) The "Other" Factors ** The doors were open the entire time we were there which rendered the ventilation system practically useless since the draft blew smoke everywhere. ** Some governmental agency needs to put up a health alert: If you have an infant, older guests, or guests with respiratory problems (including yourself), this might not be a suitable place to dine. ** The mesquite wood is heated at the table rather than in the kitchen. The result is choking smoke all across the table. Carbon monoxide anyone? ** All the dishes and chopsticks are plastic - cheap, cheap plastic. Is it really that financially hard to have ceramic dinnerware? Really, I'm not even asking for poreclein. ** Service was decent although we were rushed. ** We got a guilt trip from the waitress because we cooked the chicken before we finished the brisket. They had to change the grill rack because it blackened from the burnt sugar. So what, we really wanted the chicken midway through; is that a problem? SUMMARY: ** I'm not some hard-core Korean BBQ fanatic. I really like Korean BBQ but I really hate it when so many people rave about a restaurant that isn't even good. ** If you are going to pay $27.99 for an order of kalbi, you might as well pay a few dollars more and go to Chosun Galbi or Soot Bull Jeep. ** At 9 out of 10 Korean BBQ places, coming out of the restaurant smelling like BBQ is a given. After dining at Soowon, you get the added smell of smoke. Although the food was very mediocre (again, that neng-myun was just atrocious), at least our bellies were full =) I apologized to my grandma and my sister for the bad food and vowed never to take them here again! 4-5 stars across the board? Yelpers, please sober yourselves. This is a GREAT example of how rookies who think they know food, pretend they know food.

Whoa!!! Super clean grills I've never seen before in a Korean BBQ restaurant. Great service too. We ordered the Combo C (bulgogi, chicken, pork belly,...) at $59.99, which was plenty for a family of four (2 adults and 2 children ). Combo comes with a choice of soju (rice wine), beer (I recommend the Hite), or soda. The banchan were delicious. They even give you rice paper to wrap your meat in. The quality of the meat here was very good. The marinade was just right unlike the ones from other places that are marinated too sweet.

once in a while, my inner lioness bares its teeth and i find myself craving red meat...and lots of it. this usually happens during the menses or when i want to flirt with constipation. tmi? ha. korean bbq is probably my most favorite way of satiating this hungry lioness. where else can you find piles and piles of savory meat grilling in front of you? and the smell...good god. it only makes your belly churn in hungry anticipation. lucky for me, soowon fitted the bill and delivered a most delicious meal to my inner lioness...grrrrr...... i went there with another meatatarian for dinner and we decided to order their soowon specialty galbi and bulgolgi. their short rib is pretty unique because there's this one big bone with a long strip of meat attached to it. it's presented to you in a rolled up state, but once unfurled, you will see that it's length rivals gene simmon's notorious tongue. but unlike gene simmon's tongue, i felt this strong urge to stuff it in my mouth. the galbi is marinated in a sweet marinade and the meat is tender and ohhh so delicioso. i suggest that you wrap the spanking hot galbi in the rice wrapper (very similar to vietnamese ban cuon wrap) that is provided with the banchan and quickly stuff it in your mouth. that night, all i did was stuff face in this fashion. the service was quick and attentive. the atmosphere bright and lively. one galbi and one bulgogi order with a large ob beer came out to be $55...tip included. hells yeah! my inner lioness was satiated that night and my wallet was pleasantly suprised.

I had to admit it to the LA contingent, this place is a formidable step up from the bay area places (which comes as no surprise). First off: Ênice real charcoal grills for the bbqs, kinda fancy compared to what I'm accustomed to (Brothers in SF). ÊAlso, nice ventilating screens and hood which meant a not-so-stinky odor that follows you around all night like what happens after a typical KBBQ. Secondly: Êthe service is exceptional... Êfrom the charcoal service, to the very friendly and attentive lady and young guy serving us drinks and food and even doing the cooking for us while we blabbered away, enjoying the evening. ÊEven the owner came by to check up on us and was genuinely nice and appreciative. Thirdly: ÊThe food is excellent. ÊGreat little side dishes (sorry I ate more than my share dudes) but most importantly very nice high-quality cuts (and presentation) of kalbi, bulgogi and pork belly (ultra thick). If you are hungry, go for the combos (we split combo C for 3 people) and you will be very satisfied (trust me, we all can eat). ÊYou also get a nice soju glow which comes in handy so (if you're a cyclist) you can start showing your weird tan lines and calves off later on in the evening. ÊBasically, Frank had a great time so I think it worked? Also, intestines are good, don't be a scaredy-cat JW!!!

Soowon Galbi is delicious, and I can tell they use good quality meat. ÊAn added plus is that they use charcoal, and not very many Korean BBQ restaurants do this. ÊI love watching the fat drip from the meat as it sizzles onto the charcoal! Ê I LOVE korean BBQ, but I don't like that sticky feeling from the seating/tables that often accompanies korean BBQ restaurants that is somewhat inevitable. ÊHowever, Soowon is able to upkeep a cleanliness about it, and I have never felt that "sticky" feeling there. The servers are all very friendly, and you can be assured you'll have a positive experience at Soowon!

If your sick of eating mediocre meat from a typical AYCE place in Koreantown, try eating premium BBQ! Yes, I know its not all you can yet, but trust me, It's more succulent, savory, and top-notch quality. I recommend to order the house special kalbi which almost melts in your mouth. It's awesome! But remember, you get what you paid for, meaning its expensive, Êbut you get superior meat!

Food is 5 stars, hands down. Service is also 5 stars. These guys are incredibly nice. I guess they really liked our table or something because they gave us a plate of meat on the house. :o) Painful as it may be, I had to take off a star just because I personally cannot, cannot deal with the smell of kbbq (and I don't know how well this place fares next to other kbbq places). Maybe they're relatively good at ventilating next to their competitors, but no food, no matter HOW GOOD, is worth the health hazard of sitting in smoke-laden rooms. Literally, there is probably particulate matter flying all over the place and I would think the government would be doing them a personal favor if they required more efficient and/or aggressive ways of ventilating the place. I know, I sound like such a downer but the smell won't go away - it's persisting in my scarf, my bag, my jacket, my shirt, my hair (even after I washed it and tried to scrub it clean). Gag. Terrible that these guys work in this type of environment day in and day out. Don't go in your best dress or anything because you MUST be prepared to walk home with it smelling like a smoke bomb.... forever. Ê We ordered probably way toooooooo much food (Combo A for 5 people), 2 guys 3 girls. The girls ate probably half the amount of meat, so I wouldn't say that this was exactly worth it for us. We probably could have done a smaller combo - the table next to us did with 6 people and they were A-okay. So maybe save yourself some money... after splitting the bill, I realized I had spent $25 on lots and lots and lotss of side orders. But they're SO good. And they happily refill it. Service is fast and there is pretty much little to no wait because you're your own chef when it comes to the star of the show. Also, this is probably the only place you'll actually mind being full!

Went to this place with my clan the other day for dinner. One of the best kalbi I've had. One thing that struck me is how they cross cut the kalbi strips before marinating and frying. I thought this was a brilliant idea and will try this technique on other things. The banchan was super yummy too .

OK I realize my "Korean" family must eat a heck of alot more than the average Joe, so this review is based on the fact, that there is underlying discontent with the overall quantity of food, esp the meat. We ordered the $99.00 pre-fix menu which is advertised to serve 4-5 people (with normal appetites, aka people who don't eat like a horse!). It actually only fed my parents & my older brother really well, I on the otherhand was left with some less than doggy-baggable chunks of meat. ÊIt's ok to diet every now and then...I guess. Here is what happened: - 5 stars: ÊMeat quality - 3 stars: ÊMeat quantity - 4 stars: ÊLarge selection of banchan (korean side dishes); the pickled daikon radish was great, everything else was decent. ÊWatch out for the cucumber kimchi (it was bland, needed salt & more fermentation; yes I SPECIALIZE IN PICKLES! OK????), and the stir fried anchovies (they weren't crispy enough). - 4 stars: Êthe mixed cabbage/green salad was great; they ended up giving us about 5 rounds of that - 3 stars: Êyou either get 1 large bottle of beer, 1 bottle of soju or 4 sodas; My bro took the beer (all to himself), and my dad wanted a coke, so I had to splurge and separate myself from another $1.50 outta my wallet - 2 stars: the steamed egg was a little undercooked on the center top layer, I let my bro eat most of it (hee hee hee hee!) - Ê2 stars: You have to choose whether you want rice or burnt rice porridge (it was like half the qty I am used to, and the depth of flavor wasn't there; Yes I am a burnt rice connoisseur!), they don't give you both (like most NORMAL Korean restaurants); c'mon people, rice prices haven't skyrocketed yet!!! It's still cheaper than gas or milk! - 3 stars: ÊAsk for sliced garlic and put it on the grill, makes for a nice tastee grilled side in case you get bored with your grilling meat duties - 1 star: Êyou have to ask for sesame oil (they only give out vinegar soy, salt/pepper and miso paste); mix it with your salt and dip your meat in it - 1 star: ÊThey didn't give out ANY lettuce wraps, but instead the mochi dough round wraps (the previous owner had a beautiful array of various lettuces...I MISS THAT!) - 1 star: the cold barley tea (you have to ask for it) was too light, I like mine a little darker. Well I can say, the service wasn't great to start b/c I had to ask 3x before the 2nd round of salad came out but it got better during the meal. They brought out alot of extra rounds of banchan for us. To avoid ecoli / other bacteria, order some wooden chopsticks to cook with that is SEPARATE from your eating chopsticks. YOU CAN THANK ME LATER! One cool thing [5 stars], I messed up on the bill and added the TOTAL wrong, they were honorable and added it up correctly for Amex. I coulda wasted alot of time chasing my missing $10. I would definitely go back, but only with 3 PEOPLE so I can have my fair share of meat!

Through the sea of abundant Korea Town BBQ mediocrity this is by far my favorite Korean Barbecue restaurant. First - make a reservation - this place gets crowded (I've read a couple of reviews here that mentioned they do not take reservations - I've been here three times and each time had a reservation - so I am not sure what they are talking about - or maybe like with Bottega Louie they just take them if they know you... Êbut here I doubt it as I'm far from a Korea Town baller...). Starting with real coal fire grills and solid ventilation (stop right there if you think anyplace that grills with only gas is coming close to the level of flavor provided by grilling over fresh coals - you are wrong). ÊAlso the proper ventilation will ensure you won't come out smelling like the grizzle you left behind in the flames. Next - the quality of the meats are better than what is served at most other Korean BBQ joints in the area. Beef ribs, pork belly, sirloin, spicy pork and Tongue (although shaved a tad too thin for my liking) - are all quality over quantity. The assortment of banchans (side dishes) are equally good and diverse (although what is up with Koreans and potato salad???) I especially liked the dried tofu concoction (I know - a lot of help with that description - but I am an Italian boy from New York and this is how I see this dish...). They also provide both daikon radish and rice noodle wrappers (huge plus in my book). The restaurant is clean and orderly (although some of the booths are a bit tight fitting). The service was attentive and they have valet parking. The neighborhood is a bit sketch - but it is busy in the area where the valet is located and is a short walk from your car to the front door of the restaurant. If Êbetter Korean BBQ is to be had in Korea Town - please direct me to it - but until then this is my favorite.

Okay so I called and made a reservation here and got seated right away. I've been to a few BBQ places and have to say I really loved it here. It should be listed at $$$$ not $$ though.

I didn't eat red meat......until I came here. Environment: The area can be scary/ghetto because it is off the main drag (like Wilshire Blvd, for instance) and the parking lot is small. However, they offer valet (when I went, they forgot to charge me so the parking was free but I hear this was a mistake). The restaurant is tucked away in a strip mall so it is easy to miss, but the bright yellow sign helps you out dearly. The inside is an amazing change of scenery compared to the surrounding neighborhood. I walk in and am greeted by a beautiful, smiling woman named Alyssa Min L. (hi Min!). Wow, what a hottie! Mama L. is a looker too, and she is usually at the register as well. The interior is very contemporary with marble tabletops and dark wood among the black leather bench seats. It's amazing how nice this restaurant is. Also, this is the CLEANEST kbbq restaurant I've ever been to. It cannot get any better than this! Food: - The side dishes are so good! Bean sprouts, broccoli, mini pancakes, kim chi, pickled radishes, egg salad, that fluffy egg thing, and seasoned salad (I may be forgetting a dish). Usually all side dishes taste about the same, but the egg salad was amazingly fresh and tasty. The bean sprouts were crisp and not oily or wilted. The salad was made with fresh green leaf lettuce, not cheapo iceberg, and had a wonderfully flavorful dressing that was light and refreshing. - They use REAL charcoal! This is the REAL DEAL! As the saying goes, IF YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE HEAT, THEN GET OUT OF THE KITCHEN! - Great selection of meat. My favorite is the chadolbaegi, thinly sliced beef. The meat is very fresh, tender, and not too fatty. Also, the sauce they give you to dip it in is perfectly salted with a garlic kick! Yum, I wanted to drink it (the bf frowned upon the idea). The chicken is awesome. They offer dark meat chicken (probably thigh meat) that is marinated in sweet soy sauce like marinade that is to die for. I wanted to drink the marinade (again, the bf stopped me). The marinated beef is killer. The sauce is similar to the chicken marinade (I don't know if it's the same because it looks darker?) and the flavor is sweet and savory at the same time. Plus, the quality of the meat is very good: fresh, not too fatty, and tender. My mouth is watering as I type. Why five stars? The quality of the meat is great, the side dishes are excellent, and the service and cleanliness is outstanding. I feel like their outstanding meat quality is a result of not being an AYCE place: quality over quantity is their objective. That said, the portions are NOT small and the prices are similar to what you'd pay at an AYCE anyway. They even flip your meat for you (unless you don't want them to, just ask). I wish I didn't drink beer so I could have more room for the meat! I only wished they offered ice cream or had a fro yo machine like some kbbq places do. Oh well! Either way, I can't wait to go back for more! And I guess I'm a carnivore now.

Our go to KBBQ restaurants are Hae Jang Chon and Chosun Galbee. ÊSoowon is in the same ballpark as these to restaurants. ÊThe sides are diverse and the meat is high quality. ÊThe decor is nicer than Hae Jang Chon. ÊTheir service is also very good; not as good as Chosun Galbee but better than Hae Jang Chon.

4.5 stars (-0.5 for location) Ok this is an amazing restaurant in such a shady area! What is going on here? There's no parking whatsoever! We had to drive a few blocks away since we were too early to for valet parking. Then we walked through this shady neighborhood where everything was for rent, people were selling their clothes and candies on the streets, chickens were crossing the road (yes, they left the community garden to eat the pringles across the street!), trash on the sidewalk...you name it. GHETTO!!! Anyhow, everything was amazing once we walked in. We ordered 2 plates (spare ribs and bugogi) ALL BEEF and we wouldn't do it any other way. My goodness, the marinated meat just explodes in my mouth! It's expensive (around $60 for 2)...not an AYCE restaurant but you know....I notice we get treated better in the order-as-you-go sort of places. We had AWESOME attention, not the annoying-stop-staring-at-me kind of attention, but the let-me-come-and-cook-and-cut-your-meat-for-you sort of attention. There was 2 of them and they were very good at pleasing the customers. They came with alot of korean side dishes too. My beau thinks that the side dishes aren't as good because they didn't have that seaweed one that he loves. They had this sweetened potatoes....so amazing. They even brought us another refill of that. We could have easily gotten refills on anything we wanted. My beau asked about the seaweed one and he came out with some white dish, not the one he was looking for but I thought it was so great that they tried. A weird side dish we got was one filled with bean assortments..didn't seem very korean at all! The waiter saw us taking pictures of each other and offered to take on of us. I'm a huge fan of capturing my life and I really like the fact that I don't have to ask for that to happen. Would definitely come back. Worth the 45 min commute. Of course, we found this on yelp. Good ole yelp :) So glad that we were able to come here before we hit up the Wi Spa nearby.

Writing this review leaves me with a bit of mixed emotions. I love soowon galbi. The place probably has the best galbi in town. I have had it twice and even without going to the other places, I know it is probably the best. First off, its not AYCE. So for you Americans that are looking for cheap unlimited Korean BBQ, this is NOT the place. I person's worth of galbi will run you 28-30 bucks if you get the unmarinated or the marinated (my preference) galbi. Itll fill the average person up if you eat enough of the banchan (side dishes). Their side dish quality is really good btw. You cant go by youself because you need to order 2 person's worth for them to light the grill. After filling youself on the galbi that melts in your mouth (plz undercook slightly to obtain this texture) make sure you leave a little room for the rice and soy bean paste soup. Oh btw, they have valet parking unless you go during odd hours. Oh I almost forgot.. why does this review leave me with mixed emtions? Well, because now I have to go eat all the other lesser Korean BBQ places just so I can write unbiased firsthand reviews about them. Maybe it wasn't a good idea to eat the best first....

So I took my cousin and his boyfriend for the first time to try Korean food. ÊSince there were so many good reviews on YELP, we checked this place out and couldn't be happier.

This is the best Korean BBQ restaurant in all of K town i believe. ÊPeople have dragged me to other places and have told me about the other places but Soowon is the most amazing place. ÊI have been here many times and the meat they serve is consistently fresh and amazing. ÊThe marinate and the juices are godly, and they are not conservative with the side dishes. ÊThe staff is amazing and attentive. ÊI highly recommend their thinly sliced Bulgogi meat. ÊThat is my favorite and it tastes like god, in your mouth. ÊFor anyone wanting Korean BBQ, this place is the one to try, you will not be disappointed, and why not grab some Soju while your at it, and sport that mellow buzz! ÊBTW valet is in the parking lot and its 2 dollars, considering the neighborhood and location of the restaurant i think its worth the 2 dollars.

OMG. SO, my friend and I were in LA this weekend and decided that it would be pretty cool to chill in Ktown the night before the Korean Music Festival. Kinda like pre-game status. hehe... BUT since Ktown is SOOO FREAKIN HUGE!! ...we walked around forever and a day, finally met up with friends and landed here at Soowoon Galbi. I think I was already impressed just walking in. The ambiance was nice. Really clean and modern looking. And none of that smokey, burns your eyes kind of bbq smell. Just really clean. When we got seated, I noticed that there was a button to my left that you could "push for service". OMG! SCORE! hehe... i seriously had every intention to summon our hot waiter for "service" ...but since they were so fast and attentive, I never even got the chance!! lol.... ahhh.... the food. divine. so good. and SO much banchan! all sooo good and soo fresh. Major plus that our waiter kept asking us if we needed refills of anything. !! At our hot kbbq spot here in the city, you seriously have to stick your leg out and stop them in their tracks in order to get another serving of kimchi. psshh.. But yeah. we had such a good time here. good company, great ambiance, excellent service, and superb food. i honestly could've just spent the night in our booth... and pushed for service when needed. LOL... kidding. Ê If you're in LA craving kbbq, stop by here. good times....

ÊEndless best tasting side dishes. ÊGreat for both small and large groups. ÊUnlike other Korean restaurants, courteous servers are family friendly. ÊThis is the only Korean BBQ I take my family.

Last time we were here was about 5 years ago. ÊI think it was a different owner back then. ÊAnyway, my wife did not want to come here because she remembered this place being located in a ghetto part of K-town and very smoky, but after reading all the great reviews, we had to give it another try. ÊThe place looked clean, and some interior changes were made, but like before, the restaurant was very smoky. ÊAs for the quality of the meats, it was similar to what you get in most places in K-town within the price level. ÊThe stews, nengmyun, and the sides were just average, and the service and atmosphere was also very average. ÊNothing really stood out for us.

holy crap this place is good! Êi'm giving it a 5, because they go above and beyond with the banchan. Ê normally when you go to a korean restaurant there's a limited panchan that they bring out. Êhowever, being versed in the Korean language, i blinked my big, green, american eyes at our ajumah and asked her in my most honorific tones if she would be so kind as to help us cut our meat because we were just lost.... little..... Americans..... she teared up a bit and was so charmed we got EXTRA banchan. raw crab and the special 6 months fermented kimchee!!!! this kimchee is different than the one they bring out normally. Êthe standard one is fresh and crispy, this one has been fermenting a long ass time and it's better for cooking on the grill along with your meat because it carmelizes as it roasts. Êtasty stuff.....(you have to ask for it by name). our demur little ajumah brought out the wrong meat dish, we ordered the sam gyup sal (unsalted pork) and the dwegi bulgogi (spicy pork). Êshe brought out chicken instead, but we really didn't give a shit because it was so spankalicious good. Ê ok, back to the banchan (side dishes). Ê this is what you really want to pay attention to when you order korean.... this stuff was not the cheap-o stuff you get in a lot of joints. Êthe o-daeng (fish cake) was seasoned so nice, not overly sweet. Êthe oi (cucumber) kimchee not too crispy, but still a little bite to it. Êand the crab? Êoh my god, heavenly. Êi rarely eat raw crab anymore, but this was ambrosia. Êthe claws hurt your mouth a little when you bite into them and suck but the more aggressive you are the less it hurts.

I went back last night and had one of the combos. The pork belly was excellent! I had the chicken bulgogi and the chadol as well, and they were both REALLY good. The person I went with said it was the best they've eaten in a LONG time (to be fair, they did live in Palo Alto, so I suppose anything in ktown would have been the best). And the service, man, that service is incredible. I think I have like two new homeys. Unless they were just being nice because they had to be. But I refuse to believe such things.

I went back again this past week and I'm sad to say that the quality of their meats have suffered. ÊThe galbi wasn't as tasty and was much smaller in portion. ÊTheir beef brisket - which is usually consistently good - was very chewy and dissatisfying. Nevertheless, I will continue to go back since service is usually good... and well, they stole my heart a year ago when I first visited. Like many restaurants in this bad economy, they've made cutbacks. ÊJust be prepared if you've been coming for a while that it's not going to be exactly the same. ************************************** In response to this review, the owner contacted me to assure me that they have not made cutbacks on the quality of their meat. ÊThey contacted their distributor to complain and stated that they would be getting a new batch of beef. Ê It is great to know they take their customers' reviews so seriously. ÊSurely, their attentiveness to excellence will take them far in the restaurant business.

Yes. I'm a fan. From making a reservation to paying the bill, I was very satisfied with their service. ÊI had never been to a Korean restaurant where I felt welcomed. ÊThis place is the first one that really stands out! ÊThe restaurant is very clean, it's not crazily smoky inside. ÊSeats are comfortable, and I don't have to yell to take part in a conversation (rare for Korean BBQ place in my opinion). ÊI was actually very happy to see that there were real charcoal underneath the grill surface. ÊThat alone wins my heart. ÊThe Soowon marinated beef (the first one on the menu) was deliciiiious. ÊThe shrimp was great too. ÊPrice range is reasonable, it's a very good alternative to Chosun (I find that place overrated). ÊThe waiter scraped the meat off the bones for us so it's nice that we didn't have to make a mess. ÊI need to go back to this place with more friends, so that I can try everything on the menu!

heads up: this place is pricier than the rest, and it's not AYCE (all you can eat). Ê however, right from the start you get what you pay for - all those little side dishes are very fresh -- particularly the seaweed with onions in vinagrette (or is it rice wine?). that shit's tasty. Êalso, they'll swing by frequently, to attend to the meats, etc on the grill - so you simply eat and not cook. my lady friend - or she my girlfriend - in facebook speak, "it's complicated" (however, of note: she is the bomb) - wouldn't go for the pork stomach. Êwe got the Soowon beef ($$$) - it was stellar. Ê heads up Ê#2: the "bbq pork" was spicy, like tabasco spicy.

This place is pretty good. The only complaint I have is that there were three of us here for dinner. We ordered two plates of meat: the SooWon Galbi and Joobalak or whatever. We asked the waiter if it was enough food for us, and he said Not enough! So we also ordered the pork bulgogi. It was WAAAY too much food!!! We would have been fine with just 2 orders. Our grill was not hot enough so it took a long time for our meat to cook. By the time we got our grill plate nice and blackened up for added flavor, the waiter comes by and changed our grill plate. Other than that, the food was good and I was super FULL I couldn't move after.

For me, Korean BBQ is not only about the BBQ meats, it is also about the banchan that comes with the meal. I love banchan. That said, I have had better banchan at other Korean BBQ restaurants, but the beef here at Soonwon was beyond amazing. Each piece was so well marbled and just melt-in-your-mouth delicious. I was dining with friends who have two toddlers, and the staff could not be more accommodating. Not only does Soonwoon have delicious food, the service is also excellent. I would come often if I lived in LA.

ABSOLUTE 5 Stars from me!!! ÊEarly dinner (4:30ish) on a Sat. night helps beat a little bit of the parking blues. On SOUTH Vermont, Êbetween 8th and 9th, you will see an outdoor taco bbq/stand, a laundromat and Soowon tucked behind the taco stand...random... but soooo worth the drive!! ummm... note to self, I would NOT drive my SUV here as the parking spaces are a bit small!!! Ê I would agree to a certain degree with a previous review the neighborhood is lacking in visual appeal, but the restaurant itself and its interior are very sleek, modern, and A-grade presence. I haven't had such great Korean bbq in a LONG while, better than OC, and by far, the best style of japchae/chapchae (glass noodles) (only no beef or egg :( but it didn't detract from the flavor), with a HUGE portion that could easily serve 5 people when accompanying some bbq bulgogi. I admit, the side dishes were not impressive, except for the kimchi, I thoroughly enjoyed the marinades/sauces, the bulgogi, shrimp, and the soup. I appreciated the service, although the restaurant was still pretty empty when we arrived, and got to enjoy eating and not having to cook my own food. Servers changed our grill between shrimp and bulgogi without being asked. I felt it was very attentive, maybe a little lacking in conversation, but again, it wasn't busy when I was there. ÊI will definitely be back, and stick to an early meal time :) to avoid the crowds I'd read about, let alone the traffic that progressively got worse outside. Ê For 2, our dinner with 2 sodas, bulgogi, shrimp, chapchae with 6 or so banchan/sides (disappointed I didn't get any bean sprouts) and a salad AND soup, 1 steamed rice, was only under $65 w/tip! Could easily have done without both bbq items, but I had to try it! For anyone who is timid about Korean, these are my three staples that I always introduce to my friends who are new to the cuisine and often a hit! Can't wait to go back for an early dinner/lunch!

***3.5 Stars, Bein' a sport and rounding up to 4*** Broke away from my usual KBBQ haunt(s) and fired up the charcoal at spittin' clean Soowon. Or should i say, was fired up to eat lotsa Soowon Galbi and other meaty treats. Or should i say, I was all fired and smoked up sideways by a greasefire at my table that the server had overheated the grill and thus caused a charcoal melt-down... thanks to the continually cratering economy and a certain easter holy-day, the place was uncharacteristically quiet and sparse, luckily for Soowon's sake--as there were few around to witness my singed mane of hair combusting in plain view.... ok, so i DO exaggerate (actually, i only exaggerated on the HAIR, just to see if you were still paying attention) :O-{} so, digressions aside, Soowon is a welcome addition to my KBBQ K-town arsenal 1. Clean and modern 2. Attentive and friendly service (i was NOT exaggerating when i said they called in the reinforcements with lightning speed for our malfunctioning grill) 3. Prices are about average in comparison to other KBBQ joints in the area 4. FOOD-- Ê ÊThe CHADOL GUI beef brisket came in a HUGE effin' HUGE slab, and was pretty juicily marinated and quite delicious, tho a bit too fatty for even my fatty inclinations. Ê ÊThe Soowon House Galbi was also a generous offering, though not as tasty and surprisingly too fatty as well. Ê Ê Ê Don't get the bibim naengmyun cold noodles here. clearly not their specialty (helllloooo, it's a KBBQ joint!), but sometimes i've had a good spicy noodles at KBBQ but this is obviously not the place for that... Ê Ê The banchan were plentiful and a mixed bag of deliciousness. the seaweed banchan is absofreekin' delicioose, perfect dense crunch and chew and bursting with seasoning. the potato banchan and the cukes were quite tasty as well, while some of the remaining 6 were just so-so. as i wagon wheeled myself out to the parking lot, i contemplated another visit in the near future....once i get back from cranio-facial reconstructive surgery rehab... OK. I'M KIDDING. JEEZ! DONE.

Better than average service, surprising for a Korean BBQ restaurant. Servers weren't too pushy with you finishing the meet but I was a little miffed that I was waiting at the entrance to be seated and some guy comes, walks right to the server and she seats him before me! The rest of the meal made up for it so I'll just assume that was a minor hiccup.

I'm impressed, hands down. Ê We went to lunch at Soowon while visiting LA. ÊI have been craving great ÊKorean food for a long time because I'm going to school in Chicago, where it's hard to find. ÊThe food was at Soowon was delicious and the service was excellent. ÊOur waiter was very friendly, and he kept bringing out the side dishes we liked as soon as we finished the first batch. ÊThe meat was top quality and cooked over charcoal right in front of us which is just what I like, which is the way I like it. ÊOur waiter took care of cooking the meat for us, frequently flipping it, pulling it off when it is properly cooked (rather than allow it to overcook), which hasn't always happened when I've had Korean BBQ in the past at other places. Situated right in the middle of K-Town, the outside is fairly nondescript and easy to miss, but don't let that fool you - it's worth the visit!

Our party of 4 sat a table for 6, but there still wasn't enough room to place all the side dishes and the meat together! ÊSo they brought out a folding stand and essentially cooked the meat for us!

I frequent Korean BBQ joints in K-Town and SF Valley, but never managed to try Soowon. I was thoroughly impressed from the quality of the meats, service, price, and banchans. Pretty much this is probably one of the better Korean BBQ places in Los Angeles county. The place is clean and parking is okay given valet is available. Nothing went wrong with our experience. We ordered one of the combos, which included brisket, rib, chicken, and pork belly. I believe the combo was about $60, which is very reasonable given the portions. I can go on and on, but this place is a definite keeper as long as nothing changes in terms of quality of food, price, and service.

Mmmmmm!!!! I get really excited about Korean BBQ!! and I get even MORE excited when I find a great Korean BBQ restaurant. I was pleasantly surprised when I stumbled upon Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ over the weekend! ÊOur group of 4 arrived at around 9:30 pm and were seated immediately...YES! ÊWe were starving!! ÊThe first things you will notice when you enter the restaurant are the friendly staff/hostess. ÊThe booths are nice and spacey- a plus in my book! ÊAnd the interior is very clean. ÊThis Korean BBQ restaurant is unique in that it uses charcoal to cook the meat instead of gas- the meat seemed to cook more evenly and the juices stayed more intact with the charcoal. ÊThe staff were all very attentive and would come by often to help grill/cut our meat, re-fill our water glasses and side dishes...Mmmm how I love rice paper! Did I also mention that they bring out enough side dishes to fill up the ENTIRE table? ÊExcellent service aside, the meat was DELICIOUS! ÊWe ordered Combo A, which serves 4-5 people and comes with a variety of meat with your choice of beverage (we got Soju). ÊBiting into the meat, you can immediately taste the quality and flavors! ÊYum! A party in my mouth. ÊAll 4 of us left fully satisfied and FULL!! ÊIf I ever get that craving for Korean BBQ again, I am definitely heading back here to get my fix!

The folks who own this place are really nice - they let us eat right at closing time, and gave us just as much attention as if it were earlier in the evening. The food was solid. I prefer to grill my own meat (they had someone come back regularly to flip our meat and put on new items as we ate), but whatever. Sides were all good. I've had better kimchee, but it's kimchee. Still was all tasty. Again, I'll repeat the word "solid". I've had outstanding KBBQ at only one place (IN NYC), and Soowon follows close behind. Their spicy bean paste may just catapult them to the top...........

Soowon has awesome side dishes, really good quality meat, attentive service (the servers don't discriminate if you aren't Korean), and you'll walk out of there extremely content and with a food coma on the way. Worth every penny.

Very tasty and "reasonably priced" (for Korean BBQ). I really loved the ribeye. It was so juicy and delicious that I could have eaten until I burst. But even that is nothing compared to the pork belly!!! I have this weakness for pork, you see, and especially for fatty pork...this pork belly reminded me of my favorite pork negima (salted not teriyakied) that I got in Japan. So delicious! So fatty! So heart attack waiting to happen!!! So you need sides to combat the heart attack waiting to happen. I liked the sides, some more than others. The kimchi was good in my opinion, but one of the more experienced kimchi experts in our party felt that it needed to "mature" for a couple of days before it would reach full potential. I loved the daikon, the "aloe vera" goo, some crazy squash and the glass noodles. Not such a fan of the potato or the bean sprouts. The only thing that is annoying is that we were prevented from cooking the food ourselves, which seems to run counter to the whole point of korean BBQ. There was no way of convincing the staff that we were capable. I suppose some douchebags burned too much food at some point and now they have ruined it for the rest of us? Ugh. Delicious nonetheless!!!

Went for lunch and arrived at 2:15 so the place was pretty empty. ÊOrdered off the lunch special menu - around 10 bucks a person and they just kept bringing dish after dish! ÊSalad, 8 kinds of veggies, rice, two kinds of soup -- ALL INCLUDED! ÊCheck was 23 bucks for the most food I've ever gotten for lunch. ÊOh, it was good too.

Without question the cleanest restaurant I have ever been to in my life! The Kimichi, Best i've ever had. The sides, everything you could ever ask for or need. The service is friendly and nice, servers are always on top of what's happening on the grill. ÊCleanest grills I've ever encountered at a Korean BBQ place, absolutely pristine, I was blinded by the shininess. I had the bibimbap and pork bulgogi, absolutely delicious, kinda wish my food would've just regenerated itself after every bite.They give you a delicious ginger iced tea with pinenuts in it after your meal. A little on the expensive side but I will definitely be back when in L.A., so worth it! ÊSoowon Galbi = Una Baina Bien(Good Shit!)

Wow is this place over-rated on the Yelp scale. ÊI really wonder if the majority of reviewers who are mostly non-Korean can tell me that this place really constitutes THE best Korean bbq in Koreatown? ÊI really have been disappointed by Yelpers, and now I take every review with a grain of salt. Ê The service here was not very good, and it was near closing time when we were there. ÊIn addition, the banchan quality is mediocre at best and not all that is hyped it to be. ÊMost of the banchan was not that generous either, and the flavors are not as authentic as I thought it would be. ÊSome of it tasted like some kind of banchan that would suit a white person's palate, which I assume fits most of the palates on Yelp. ÊThus, the five stars that people have been giving this place. The meats in quantity were not as generous, and I still was hungry. ÊGranted that I was with a party of three guys, but I still was really hungry after. ÊQuantity and value is the name of the game, and this--this Soowon does not have. ÊThe interior is nice, but that doesn't excuse the fact that the meat quality is not as high as Park's BBQ down the street or Chosun. ÊThere are plenty of other Ktown bbq restaurants that I would go to before being misled by all the five star reviews that others have given here. Disappointing experience, and I won't listen to Yelpers again. ÊSoowon is not all that it claims to be.

this place had the best korean service I have had in ktown~ It may have been cause I was with Koreans but they gave us such good service and were more than friendly to attend to anything we asked. ÊThe galbi tang is so delicious!! it falls right off the bone and the waitress asks you if u want her to cut it into bite size pieces just like momma used to do when you were 3~ I am not a huge eater, so it was good for me that its not all you can eat, and that makes the meat better quality and so much more delicious.

I think this place is one of my new favorites in town. ÊApart from some communication errors, me being a non-Korean and all, everything was great. I highly recommend paying the 2$ for valet parking. ÊThe surrounding area is not so great and you probably have a 50/50 chance of getting your car broken into. ÊIt's also a lot safer for women if you're not with a guy so you don't get approached by the local weirdos. The quality of meat was very good. ÊI was a little annoyed because our waiter doesn't know how to grill meat. ÊI actually insisted on doing it myself but he kept coming over and turning up the flame when I didn't want him to. ÊOne time, I was grilling some garlic and he just came by and turned the grill off all together! ÊWTF??? ÊYou have to be careful because THEY WILL BURN YOUR MEAT if you leave it up to them. ÊI don't like my meat well done. ÊYou might as well crack into a Slim Jim! They give you a lot of sides, some of which are good while others are blah. ÊThat's really just a matter of personal taste though. ÊI wasn't aware that you could order unlimited sides. ÊThat would have been good to know but they never mentioned that to us. I heard this place is a little more expensive than some others but I have to say it's worth it. ÊI am a meat freak and know what's good and what is not. ÊFor the amount of sides they give you as well as the amount of meat in each order, it's pretty reasonable. ÊBut take it from me, grill the meat yourself!!

Most ridiculous, most succulent galbi I have ever experienced. Wait was around 1hr during dinner time. Leave heavy clothes in the car cause you will get smoked out. All banchan had the proper crunch to them. But the meat is where it's at. Just order one soowon galbi per person and leave the rest. Only negative thing I can say is you come out smelling like you've been marinating in a giant galbi hotbox. But a meal like you wouldn't mind smelling like that for the next few days

Maybe I was there on an off-night but the consensus among the group was that it was all pretty mediocre and borderline bad. Ê I ended up sharing Combo B with 3 of my friends and all of us were unimpressed by the flavor of the meat. ÊNone of it was particularly flavorful and one of them had an off-taste that pretty much left it sitting on the grill for a while. ÊAll in all I think each of us has had much better and definitely for less money. Ê Although I didn't try everyone's dishes, everyone else seemed equally as disappointed. ÊThe Kimchee jigae was way too salty as was the mackerel. Ê On the plus side the banchan were all very good and the restaurant is very nice. ÊService is also solid and having valet is always nice. ÊHowever none of these were close to salvaging the disappointing experience we had there and next time I'm back in LA I'll be sure to try another place out.

I've been going here for years and although it's had it's ups and downs through the various owners, it has settled back into being the BEST Korean BBQ place in K-town. Yes, it's pricey. No, it's not AYCE. But I didn't say it's the cheapest or the best bang for your buck now, did I? Valet parking (it's a sketchy neighborhood, just do it) Perfectly marinaded Kalbi, lots of great banchan, paper dduk wraps, super-thin pickled radish slices, crisp delicious salad, perfect ssamjang (it's the tan-colored soybean sauce; try it!) or hot sauce if you like spicy things. Great service too! ÊIf you like garlic, ask for garlic in oil in foil. They put it on the grill and the oil fries/boils the galic into sweet, soft bombs of goodness. Your breath afterwards will be atomic and your clothes might need some airing out (gum & Febreeze^^) but you've had Korean food before so you should know what to expect right? Put down a rice wrap, radish slice, some salad, a piece of Kalbi swished in the sweet sauce they give you, a piece of garlic, a slice of jalepeno(if you can hang) & some ssamjang sauce. Wrap it up, stick the whole thing in your mouth and enjoy. You have a choice of rice or nooroongji (toasted rice soup), I always have nooroongji; it helps with digestion of all the meat you just inhaled. They give you dwenjang-jigae (hot soybean soup in a lil pot) and gehranjjim (hot egg casserole) Pretty standard fare but still nice after all that meat. Or you can get a small size nengmyun (cold noodles in broth) which many Koreans must have after eating meat.

So soon after an AOC disaster and a sad day at Parks, I was on the prowl for some great food - I KNEW LA had some to offer... After reading many reviews I decided to try Soowon... What the hell took me so long? ÊI ended up here on a Monday night and the place was packed... Had to park a few blocks away but it was so worth it. FIrst off the service was the BEST I had in any korean bbq place in LA - everyone on the staff was SO accomidating and friendly. I was shocked given my past experiences at other places like Parks, Hodori, Chosun Galbee, The Corner Place, etc... We were seated very quickly, decided on combo D (which was almost too much for two) and were immediately brought a salad, the soju, some rice paper, dipping sauces, etc... Then came the mounds of ban chan (all very tasty, and then oogles of meat. Everything was great although the beef was my fav. - the chicken was a bit too plain for me. Overall the experience was great and so next week we decided to try this place again to see if that was a fluke. ÊTo our pleasant surprise it was not... We came late (9:30p) and the place was closing but they still seated us and treated us like royalty. Again the service was excellent - the ban chan was a little different than the first time but still very tasty, and the meat was again in mounds... I cant recommend this place enough - its just amazing (and yes, white-people friendly... )

Wow all I can say is this is the place to go for great Galbi in LA. ÊIt was a bit hard to find as it is actually inside a small plaza next to a Mexican burrito joint but it was worth the hunt. ÊA few things to note about this place the parking is 100% valet it's $4 for them to park the car and tipping is optional, as well the parking closes at 10:30 so they'll just come in and hand you the keys and ask for the money. ÊThe meat was wonderfully marinated and we got there when they weren't that busy so the waitress even helped us cook the meats. ÊPrice point is around $25-$35 per dish with the King Galbi at $30-$35 a small plate but definitely worth the money. ÊIf you're a Korean fan and wish they can make a special order for Soon-Tofu which we found out by asking them. ÊMy only regret for this place however is that fact that the ventilation in the waiting area wasn't topnotch and got a bit stuffy but the food was definitely worth the drive.

Êthe order of beef brisket that was cooking was prompty replaced with another and we continued to enjoy our meal without a care in the world. even though our lives were momentarily endangered by flames, i would come back to this place any time for more bbq- the food is good with generous portions and truly a great value, the service is accomodating and nice, and if youre lucky they may still have rice paper left which is really delicious with the salad and meat.

I love it! It's refreshing to go to a K-Town restaurant and have Korean waiters that also speak english. Combo B easily fed four of us, actually over fed:) I would go with the Soju as your free drink; its the best to share with multiple friends who are also looking to get a little buzz going. Be prepared though; the waiters are the ones who handle the cooking of the meat, but in true Korean manner, they give you and your friends plenty of space and don't crowd you at all, I personally like handling the meat, but whatever, Also, don't forget the $2 bucks for the valet.

This place is def nicer than other Kbbq spots, the meat is high quality and the banchan dishes are Dlish! Since you are enjoying high quality food then of course the prices are a bit steeper than the competitors in the area. You pay for what you get, but still enjoying authentic Korean BBQ.

We were in LA for 2 nights and could only spare one meal on a Korean BBQ. ÊWe did our search on Yelp and tried out Soowon. ÊThis place rocks! ÊFirst of all, the meat is delicious. ÊWe had the Whang Galbi - 2 orders for 2 of us. ÊMy husband said this was the best Korean BBQ he's had in a long, long time (and we're not novices). ÊSoooo good. ÊThe meat is tender and perfectly marinated. Ê The next best thing is the service. ÊThe wait staff was happy, eager to help, and always looking out for your needs. ÊThey cooked all the meat for us -- even though we could have managed perfectly fine on our own, it was great to have them handle it while we chomped away. ÊThey were very attentive and did not burn the meat. ÊThis is also the first BBQ place I've been where they actually take the meat off the boney part for you. ÊThey take them off skillfully and cut them into bite sizes. ÊThere was so much food that we couldn't finish everything (even though my husband skipped his rice entirely), but our dog, who's traveling with us, had a yummy 2d meal that night. ÊEveryone at the restaurant was super friendly and warm. Ê The place is super clean and well maintained. ÊThe banchans were very tasty and fresh. ÊThey also served a complimentary miso soup, which I was craving and relished. ÊI wish we were staying in LA longer so that we could go back!

Since I'm stingy with the 5 stars, this definitely has to be a 4+ stars. ÊIt may change after I eat at more like places to compare. ÊSoowon is the reason I can't go vegetarian! ÊMaybe I can after I've tried their combo A. ÊI've always really enjoyed Korean BBQ, even though you end up having to do the "cooking" yourself, which I don't enjoy (I just wanna grub!)...here they really help you out and do most of the work for you. ÊThis place ranks up there among very tasty k-BBQ places!

Goodness, 300+ reviews. ÊWell, if you can't beat them, join them. ÊWe yelped and yelp yelped back Soowon. ÊIn the heart of Ktown, we let the GPS lead the way. ÊParked on the street, walked in, immediately seated, most other tables occupied with people enjoying their bbq. ÊWe thought about getting entrees for 1 sec, then decided on bbq (laundry a must afterwards). ÊGot tons of food, started with salad, soup, seafood pancake, side dishes, then on to the bbq. ÊStaff was very helpful, made sure the food was cooking, turned it over for us, cut it, turn down the stove so nothing burned.

so after seeing the countless 5 star reviews, i decided to try this place out. It's definitely nice, but not amazing. The meat quality is high, and the service is prompt.. but not exactly friendly. Two waiters kept switching off to cook for us and it was nice, however, one of the didn't know how to smile, and instead, had a frown on the WHOLE NIGHT while he was cooking for us making me feel like a jackass because it seemed like he hated his life or something. Also, the bill, after tip, was over $30 each for my gf and i... that $60 for two. For that price, you could usually feed 3-4 at other korean bbq places. That, or feed 2 at some nice steakhouse. Btw after eating all the meat and sides, i wasn't full.. for $60 Parking sucks, the plaza that it's in is valet only, so i just parked around the back. This place is definitely worth a try if you want korean bbq, just not a 5 star place

With all of the great reviews, the hubby and I had to try this place. ÊOverall, it was a great experience. ÊIt's a nice, clean, modern restaurant. ÊI noticed other yelpers complained about the bbq smoke and Êlack of ventilation - I didnt feel that this was an issue, and I have no complaints over this, afterall its a bbq place! We ordered the Combo D which included 3 types of meat (thin brisket, pork belly, and chicken), lots of side dishes, rice, soup, beer or soft drink, and a drinkable dessert. ÊThe brisket was EXCELLENT - we loved it. ÊThe chicken - I thought it was good, but hubby REALLY loved this. ÊThe pork belly - it was good considering I've never had it before. Ê The service is excellent. ÊWe've been to other korean places that just left us there to grill our own meat, and couldnt care less about us. ÊSoowon's servers are very friendly and they actually help with the meat. ÊThis is good for newbies to Korean cuisine. We both felt that the price (38.99) was very reasonable for what you get. ÊIt was alot of meat, and I'm embarrassed to say, we ate it all. ÊThey even give you this cute little tea-like dessert (the name escapes me) that you drink. ÊIt was very sweet, tasted like ginger and honey, and very refreshing. Ê We will definately come back to Soowon - definately a good place to check out!

KOREAN BBQ PERFECTION. Hubby and I are Korean BBQ aficionados and we've eaten in a LOT of Korean BBQ places in LA, NY, SF and even Las Vegas. While Park's BBQ used to be on the top of our list ... it's been knocked over by Soowon Galbi: a newly renovated/opened, family-run (good mix of English speaking and limited English speaking wait staff), VERY clean, wonderfully staffed (very helpful, attentive, and responsive) restaurant which serves top-notch meat cuts and wonderful panchan. The menu is not extensive so don't expect to be able to get as much of a variety of Korean food dishes which may be offered at other Korean BBQ spots but whatever is on their menu is done well ... VERY WELL. We tried their galbi (namesake) and beef brisket ... and they were FANTASTIC. The galbi was perfectly marinated -- not too salty, not too sweet -- and meaty. You get 2 "ribs" in 1 order. ÊThe beef brisket was a large serving in 1 order -- perfectly cut and high quality so there's not much shrinkage upon cooking. Ê Also tried the spicy/sweet naeng-myun for the first time -- the cold buckwheat noodles swimming in a spicy/sweet red "soup" with slices of Asian pear, cool julienned cucumber, beef slice and hard boiled egg. ÊIt was the perfect complement to the meats sizzling over charcoals. Will DEFINITELY be back with a group and try the "combination meals" (which are such great deals for larger groups because they provide multiple types of meat, soju and other dishes for a set price -- the most expensive one being $99!). They are also flexible so you can substitute certain meats in the combination of your choice for others which you might prefer. ÊFor the value and quality, this joint is at the top of its class. I'm fairly wary of glowing reviews on Yelp (after being disappointed a few times in the past with some highly reviewed places) but this new highly reviewed spot exceeded our expectations. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Ê5++ stars. ÊThis is our new #1 Korean BBQ spot in LA.

Soowan was clean and the food was decent enough but it was nothing spectacular.

Holy crap this place is great. Even before we were served, I could tell this is an authentic joint. For example, our waiter didn't speak no English. That's ALWAYS a good sign for an ethnic restaurant. We ordered the 2 person combo, which included 3 types of meat; marinated chicken, thin slices of unmarinated beef and pure unadulterated pork belly. AND a bottle of soju. All that, plus the usual Korean side dishes for about $40 was a pretty good deal. Good deal aside, let's talk about the food. I live in SF, bay area and the korean bbq up here is quite different. The best place in SF is Brothers and their meats are all deliciously marinated. At Soowon Galbi, most of the meats weren't marinated, instead relying on dipping sauces for flavor. I don't have time to write an exhaustive review right now, but let's just say the bbq'd pork belly dipped in the sesame oil/rock salt dip was one of the most magical things I've ever eaten in my life. 100% amazing. The pork belly's skin was crispy and bubbly like a fine pork rind, but without any of the greasiness. Then you pick up one of the bite sized morsels and dip it in the sesame oil/rock salt combo and BAM! It's a party in your mouth. It's been over a week since I've been there and I've been dreaming about it daily ever since.

So I was craving KBBQ and we yelped, and found this place. So, we head over, arrive, parking lot is small, but they do valet for you. Once arrived, you are seated by host, it gets super crowded around 7-8. The restaurant is really clean and simple. We ordered the beef bulgogi, and chicken bulgogi, kimchi and tofu soup in a stone bowl. First, they bring you out a bowl of their house salad, and it's bottemless, so you can get more if you want, and then they bring you out these little dishes of different vegetables... kimchee, bean sprouts, potatoes (my fav!) potatoe cakes?, clear noodles, brocoli, and im sure there's more im missing. THENNN the meat comes out, and they put it on the grill for you and they keep checking on it for you. The meat was delicioussss!!! The soup was hot and spicy and tasted great. My boyfriend got Soju and he loved it. I think it comes complimentary if you order the combo or something? Definitely will be back here.

I love their pork belly! Like everyone else, I agree that their service is amazing and their food is good. I actually didn't like the beef brisket as much as I wanted to but everything was great. They cooked everything for us. Parking is definitely not fun. I came during lunch so there was a space right in front of the restaurant. They even had a flat screen for us to watch TMZ on. I brought a friend from New Jersey that has never had authentic Korean BBQ before and he loved it. I told the waiter there this and he kept coming back and suggesting him to try different sauces and eating the BBQ with some of the wraps in the banchan to change it up. My friend loved it and really appreciated them. Good food and service. I'll definitely come back. Check our my blog for a more detailed account: http://ate-ate-ate.blogsÉ

I've been to many korean bbqs in ktown and around socal. ÊI definitely must say that Soowon stands among them all as not only affordable but also delicious.

ÊThe meat was great and surpassed my expectations. ÊI don't say this about many korean restaurants...

ÊAlthough there was a button for waiters/waitresses to come, they would still come without being beeped to check up on you. ÊI usually find that as a teenager I do not get the best service, but at Soowon Galbi, they still treated me with a lot of respect. ÊDefinitely worth the money.

Not an AYCE place, but if you have a hard time making AYCE places worthwhile, have a hankering for kbbq and not feeling like you want to stuff yourself silly with a lot of low grade meat, this is a much better alternative. Three of us went (two guys and one girl) and we all left satisfied (defintiely not unbutton your pants full but happy full).

Good flavor to the meat, and prices were as expected. The service was good for the first half of the meal, but then our server changed, and then the smiles and frequent check-ins disappeared. My main complaint is that there are a lot of other Korean restaurants that give more panchan and better ones too. But, all in all, this is probably some of the best Korean food I've had in awhile! The decor inside totally surprised me too - I was expecting something similar to its surroundings... janky and dirty! But inside was very nice! Will probably return the next time I'm in LA :)

The simplistic atmosphere was welcoming and relaxing but atmosphere is nothing when it comes to food, of which was delicious! The Jap Che is delicious and enough for 3 or even 4 people. The Soonwon Galbi, a house special (not in terms of price!), is delicious - the marinade and overall quality of the meat was superb. The marinated pork, a favorite of mine, was the best I've tried to date. Soonwon Galbi has a two $$ rateing although I'd place it in the three $$$ rating instead. Check this place out!

I've been going to this restaurant for many many years with my family and I highly recommend this place for a good galbi experience, not out of loyalty to the restaurant (well maybe just a little), but because the service is excellent because it's not so big that the workers will forget to attend to you (pretty common at bigger name korean bbq places *cough* josun *cough*) and the galbi is really yummy. My dad calls me "galbi-killer" for a reason. I have been to alot of different korean bbq places, so I can tell you that the galbi here is high quality and you can cook it yourself however your heart desires (I personally prefer my meat a little burned :D). If you ever decide to go there be sure to ask them to cook the bones ("bbyuh") for you. As gross as it sounds, the meat off the bones is the best part because it's interspersed with globules of fat and it's chewy because of the cartilage (wow I never realized how disgusting that sounds). But even if you don't feel courageous enough to try my favorite part of the meal, the rest of the aspects of the restaurant should be enough to guarantee you a good dinner experience.

I went to this restaurant after reading the Yelp reviews, and I was totally satisfied. ÊThe quality of meat Êwas high, the price was affordable (check out the BBQ combos), the side dishes were fresh and everything tasted so darn good.

This is probably our favorite Korean BBQ restaurant. ÊWe have been going there for years. ÊI think we first learned about it from an LA Times review several years back. Ê We were just there last night and it is as good as ever. Ê The service is attentive and friendly. The ingredients and preparation are top-notch. ÊThe cuts of meat are all nice and lean. ÊThe marinate they use is also nice, they seem to go easy on the salt. ÊWhereas at many Korean BBQ places the marinate is so salty that after eating I am thirsty for another 12 hours, here there is no problem. ÊAnd of course the side dishes are all tasty. ÊThe seafood pancake here is pretty good, nice and light, not nearly as heavy and oily as at some places. Last night we had two meat BBQ, the grilled shrimp BBQ, the seafood pancake, and the octupus with rice. ÊThe server was very thoughtful, after she brought out the octupus with rice, she warned the Korean speaker in our party that it might be too spicy for me and offered to dilute it with more rice, but of course we didn't need that. Ê The decor is very nice and the restaurant is really well ventilated. ÊLast night the air inside the restaurant was probably better than the air outside, because of the wildfires!

The atmosphere is definitely nicer than most Korean BBQ restaurants. It is very clean, new-looking and well maintained. ÊWe ordered Galbi, Bulgogi and Chicken. ÊThey gave you lots of sides and the meat was very tender and good. They give you tea, soup and sides galore! Lots of food. They do all the cooking for you, which is different than most places. The kim-chi isn't very spicy and isn't fermented all the way, which I wish it were. ÊI would come again, but if I am looking for a meal just based on the BBQ then I would opt for Soot Bull Jeep, but if I am looking for a whole atmosphere - wait staff, ambiance and food then I would come here.

This place has good meat. The jamuluk or whatever that dish was, it was the best meat I've ever tasted. It was flavored just right and tender! The galbi short ribs were good as well, but they fell short of the high expectations we had after eating the jamuluk. This place is pretty stingy with the side dishes though. That docked 1 star. They didn't want to bring us more side dishes after we vacuumed it up. They made excuses like...not right now, we're busy. Later, when I bring the meat. What kind of customer service is that? Don't make excuses..if there's a limit on the side dishes, let us know. Don't BS us with some excuse...later later...but later never came. We had to ask repeatedly for side dish refills, but even still, they didn't bring them. Service is pretty slow... but the meat made up for it. The highlights of the side dishes were the sweet potato-fresh and warm out of the oven; the white thing..dunno what it was called, but it had a mayonnaise type of dressing to it; fish cake not bad either; cucumbers, radish, all good =) Will most likely come back again soon

I dined with 3 others at Soowon about a month ago on a Saturday night. ÊExcellent presentation and great food for a really reasonable price. ÊDecent service. ÊThey ran out of rice paper wraps so we didn't get any. ÊA very generous salad came with the meal. ÊWe had to ask for more water and more sauces when we ran out. ÊThe servers were too busy with a full house to see when we were running low.

The most important thing about korean bbq is the quality of the meat and soowoon galbi has this in spades. ÊI (along with my 4 other friends from my high school asian posse) ordered the $99 Combo A which included whole beef ribs, beef sirlion, beef rib eye, pork neck meat, marinated beef sirlion, beef brisket, panchan, soba noodle soup, and one bottle of beer or soju. ÊAll the meat was so good but the rib eye was frankly the best I have had at korean bbq ever. ÊTender and deliciously marbled with fat. ÊThe panchan could have been a little more inventive, but my staples (the thinly sliced daikon and pickled daikon) were provided. ÊGiven the quality of the meat (and the affordability), this is one of my new favorites in koreatown.

The food here was very good and the restaurant was very clean. ÊThe quality of meat was good and is definitely better than those all you can eat Korean BBQs. ÊThe service however, was just ok.

As a Korean who's eaten Korean BBQ more than enough times, I know when I taste good Korean BBQ. Soowon Galbi didn't live up to my expectations after reading Yelp reviews. I would give it 3 stars for the taste and quality of the food, but I'll be generous and up the rating to 4 stars for the amount of food you get for the price. I went with a friend and ordered Combo D ($39.99), which came with the meat, salad, rice, a bowl of stew (denjang jigae), side dishes, rice paper wraps, and a choice of soda or a bottle of soju. The amount of food was more than enough for the price (but still, there are better deals in LA for Korean BBQ) The beef brisket was best, the chicken bulgogi was okay, but the pork belly was disappointing. I've had much better. Soowon Galbi Korean BBQ is a good place to go to for dinner for an alright price when you have a big appetite or craving for Korean BBQ, but don't expect amazing food if you're looking for real quality.

Went here for lunch today. I was with a party of three. We ordered a combination meal, it came out to $80 and was MORE than enough food for 3 people. I thought the food was really good.

Do you want someone to hold your hand during your Korean BBQ experience? Then this is the place for you! This place doesn't offer what most Korean BBQ places do... $16.99 all you can eat deal. They offer group deals like most places do but they even have some for 2-4 people the only thing is they select the meat for you. When I went with a friend we got the one which fed 3-4 people is was about $39.99. As for the side dishes, they were the usual but less then usual too. They end the dinner with a little drink that I was told helps with your digestive system. Overall it was good and service was excellent. Parking is $2 for valet but if you wait until after 9 the Valet ends so you could just park in the parking lot without paying.

Had a fantastically delicious and very reasonably pruced Korean barbeque dinner. Had the combination dinner for twice which featured three different types of meat to barbeque (chicken, pork and beef), soup, small plates, rice, sauces and drinks. Service was excellent from the free valet parking to the waiters and waitresses. Had to wait a little on a Saturday night. next time I will call in advance before I come to make a reservation.

This is my new favorite Korean BBQ place in Los Angeles. ÊI used to go to Shik Do Ruk because I love the rice paper combination. Ê I still love it, but the meat quality is not as good as Soowon Galbi. ÊThe meat at Soowon Galbi is fresh and the quality is great. ÊHad the short ribs and rib eye, and both were incredibly tasty and juicy. ÊThe also have the rice paper, which is a huge plus for me. ÊTheir salt and oil mixture is a bit different, but still good. ÊOnly reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because they ran out of the rice paper and that was a huge bummer for me. ÊThey only give a small amount for the table, as I don't think it's their specialty like Shik Do Ruk, but will have to go again to find out.

Solid Korean BBQ. ÊIt's pretty much the go-to place when we want a great, delicious filling meal. We always know exactly what we want, so we order everything up front. And the Soju, ban chan, and meats come out very quickly. We usually opt for the Soowan Galbi ribs and Chadol. The specialy ribs are so deliciously marinated. We almost never end up with doggy bags. ÊThe ban chan is also very yummy. They change their spread every night. ÊSo depending on the night, you never know what you're gonna get. And they cook the meat for you. So if your'e really lazy, this place will cater for you :) ÊI'm usually ravenous when i come here, so I end up stirring th meat and serving it up as soon as it's ready. And don't forget to ask for the after meal drink. ÊIt's like a sweet, honey and ginger drink. They will sometimes serve it automoatically, but at times we have to ask for it. It's just a nice palate cleanser and as one of the waitresses said, "it helps with digestion." ÊI just think it's yummy :)

This place is overrated. It's good, but not great, and it certainly it does not and will not pull me away from my regular KBBQ spots in LA. Is it really deserving of it's incredible 4.5/5.0 rating? The answer is a resounding 'No'. I will elaborate below: We all enjoyed the $59.99 combo we ordered, which includes a panoply of all the meats, a soup, and a bottle of soju. The sides are really good and I really like the assortment they give you (i.e. Korean pepper glazed with sauce; Kimchi is excellent) and the quality of the meat I didn't have a problem with either, except that the kalbi is cut into really small pieces, therefore they get chared easily. The service was prompt. However, was the food THAT much BETTER than my regular k. BBQ spot? Absolutely not. Moreover, I'm not crazy about the interior and seating arrangement. It's clean and modern, about medium sized, but is kind of in an "L" shape. It just makes it seem really busy and high traffic. At the end of the day, who really cares, but it's just my own personal preference. Let me also say, the parking situation is NOT GOOD. It is cramped and I had to valet my car and pay $2 bucks. Why can't Soowon comp their customers for this? Finally, the prices here are reasonable, but it isn't cheap. I compare this place to comparably priced Chosun Kalbi, and they give you more sides and more food for the money, and the decor of Chosun matches the price of the food, which is expensive and fancy. I also feel that Soowon is somewhat stingy when it comes to the sides, as you always have to ask for seconds. Even the grill, which was completely chared, they did not replace, unless asked for. One more thing, my friend at our table wanted to introduce themselves to the owner of Soowon. My friend just wanted to say hello and be friendly towards the owner, since it was their first visit to Soowon. A few minutes later, a young woman - claiming to be the owner - approached our table with an inquisitive but very cautious look on her face. My friend smiled and immediately introduced themselves to the owner, while the owner continued to glower back at us with confused question marks glaring from her face. After my friend was done with the introduction, she said something to the effect of, "Is that all you wanted?" She said it in somewhat of a confused, unhappy and rude tone, giving us the impression we were wasting her time. And then there were a few moments of awkward silence. Then, realizing that we didn't call her over to our table to complain or ask for something explicit, she engaged herself with 1-2 minutes of phony chit-chat with my friend that seemed pretty painful for her. ... Has it come to the point this day in age in this world that being genuine and friendly is unexpected and not welcome? The way the owner acted towards my friend and us (her customers) was rude, unfriendly, anti-social, and unprofessional.

came here for dinner and we ordered the Combination B for 4 people - $79.95 which also came with choice of soju, beeer or sodas. clean spot and good ventilation system in the restaurant. the banchans (korean small plate appetizers) were good and service was excellent as the replenshied pretty quickly now for the meats.... cha dohl (thin rib eye..think of the meat in a cheesesteak) - good but i've never been to a kbbq joint that dind't have good cha dohl mohk sahl (basically bacon) - this was my least favorite as i typically like it when it's a thicker cut and it was not marinated like how they do at road to seoul rib eye - non-flavored meat that you dip with the salt and pepper oil sauce. good cuts but i've never been a huge fan of this cut galbi - this was prolly the best galbi i've had in some time. well marninated and very juicy and tender meat. quality is similar to Parks BBQ and Chosun galbi. star of the meal they end you with some tofu soup and the four of us were quite content. quality is definetly above an AYCE kbbq but if don't want to over indulge than this is a good spot to consider from the usual $16.999 AYCE.

They constantly have people walking around flipping your meat for you, which works out for me.. I don't have to hurt my wrist doing it. It's not all you can eat, but the amount they give is more than enough. If you do the combo meals, it averages out to about $20 a person anyways, and it comes with free sake.

soowon bbq is by far one of the best korean bbq restaurants in ktown i have been to! when i walked in, i immediately noticed the neat, clean, and modern interior. when my friends and i were seated, the tables and booths were very spacious and comfortable. there were 4 of us and we had plenty of room to spare. we ordered combo B i think it was, which comes with kalbi, pork belly, pork neck, and brisket. and of course, the unlimited side dishes, salad, and steamed egg in the hot pot. the meat was incredibly delicious. the marinated kalbi was not too salty or sweet and you could tell all of the other meats were good quality. the side dishes were very delicious as well. everything was just perfect when eaten together. the dwenjang jjigae they give you towards the end was also pretty good. the service is very attentive and prompt, we never had to flag down a server as we usually would do at other bbq places. it might seem a bit pricey, but i dont think theres much difference if you compare to ayce places. you are paying for really good quality meat and service, and the portions are generous, so you will leave with a very full stomach.

Believe the hype!!! I finally got my friends to go, and it was every bit as good as everyone says it is. This is my new spot for KBBQ. I don't think I will want to go anywhere alse after having been here. We ordered a Combo B. It came with a bottle of soju, brisket, galbi (their specialty marinated beef ribs), tri tip, and we substituted the pork neck meat for BBQ pork. ÊI'm so glad we did because that was my second favorite meat next to the galbi.There was more than enough meat for the four of us, but we ate it all up. I wished there were more galbi and less brisket-it was yummy but that was my least favorite. All the sides were delish, and they brought seconds when we were done with them. I loved the thinly sliced radishes. I put the meat inside and wrapped it up with spicy sauce Êyummmmm...We were really stinky when we left, but that's to be expected. Everything was cooked over real charcoal. I can't wait to go again!!!!!

i would give this place 4 stars..but my bf super loves this place and says its a 5..so... fine. 4 1/2! haha had reservations here at 8:30 on friday but we couldnt find the freaken place!!! that dumb jalepeno taco sign stands out so much more that you miss the soowon galbi sign. haha. anyways, we finally get there and get down to business. COMBINATION B! our server suggested that since it was only for the two of us...maybe combination C would've been better. but we were so huNGRY we could've eaten a COW! hahaha. and plus combo B had better stuff. OMG SOOOOO GOOOD. my favorite meats were the MARINATED BEEF RIB, MARINATED BEEF SIRLOIN, ANDDDDDD BEEF RIB EYE. okay i listed almost all of the meats. HAHAH. the others were reallly goood too but these were my top picks. the best part of this combo is that it comes with a bottle of sojU!!!!!!! :D the sides were allll very good. i especially loved their salad. the dressing was tHE BEST. and to top it off, after our meal, they bring out soup from a clay pot (kinda like tofu soup) and rice. clean. good service. and good food! damn. i've gotta go back.

The good thing about Suwon Galbi, is that their meat quality is top notch. There is a reason why this place is always busy. I recently got some cuts from the meat market. It was American Wagyu/Kobe beef and their cuts remind me of that. After coming here and then going to AYCE places, we realized that what you pay at AYCE and what you pay here is about the same. If you're going to be paying the same price anyway, you might as well get quality stuff. That is unless, you plan to eat the whole cow yourself. Then going to an AYCE is probably a better idea.

This is only the second Korean BBQ place I've been to in Korea Town. ÊSomething seemed missing without the chaos that I've come to expect from my several visits to Manna. ÊWe had lunch here so maybe that would explain the mellowness, we pretty much had the place to ourselves. ÊThe meat was decent although I realize now that I don't like the marinated pork and I couldn't remember the name of my favorite beef dish (it wasn't the galbi). I missed the boiled egg side dish that I love so much but one thing they did have that Manna doesn't is spicy broccoli, which was a nice surprise. ÊThe charcoal grill was a change, although unfortunately the fan was blowing all of the smoke directly into my poor coworker's face. ÊSort of gave the feeling that you were sitting in front of a campfire. ÊBut atleast there is a separate smoking room surrounded by glass, so your lungs will only have to breathe in the smoke from the charcoal grill.

I admit it. ÊI'm a sucker for appreciative people, patients included. ÊIn any case, I haven't gone back yet, though I hope to at some point soon. ÊI'm updating the review because yesterday, I got a message from, I'm assuming, the owner of the place, thanking me for my kind words. ÊAwww. ÊThat's nice that people actually care like that. ÊIn any case, I forgot to mention how CLEAN this place was. ÊThe place was spotless and didn't have that sticky grimy feeling on the tables that you get at lots of Asian joints. ÊAnyways, there were also a few large plasma TV's playing some NBA games. ÊI mean honestly, I could have died and gone to heaven...huge trays of meat for you to grill, nice Korean ladies cutting up your meat and cleaning the grill so you don't get cancer from those tasty but carcinogenic burnt bits, ice cold Hite Korean beer, and those aforementioned giant TV's. ÊUnfortunately, I never used the bathroom, so I can't vouch for my friends' claims that it, too, was clean. ÊBut anyways, a half a star bump for gratitude and appreciative owners. ÊI'll be back!

Êthe smokey smell was also much less than your average charcoal bbq place.

small location & you have to valet your car or park on the street. not the best location because its hard to see the sign & can miss it if you don't know where you're going. but so worth the trouble! side dishes are yummy & they refill them promptly. the meat quality is the best i've had (& i'm korean & have had my fair share of restaurant kbbq). there is someone who understands english too! a rare find in ktown. would definitely go back but a little pricey for everyday.

My wife and I were looking forward to experiencing all the tasty Korean food in LA. Thank God I yelped Soowon Galbi! Thank you fellow yelpers! We arrived at 8:30 PM Monday night when Japan and Korea were fighting it out in the world baseball championship game. I wasn't expecting good service due to the game, but boy did we feel like family...it helps being Korean. :) Since I don't have a chance to eat Korean food often in Boston, we (meaning I) started with three orders of their Soowon marinated Galbi, Marbled Galbi, Pork gogi, a bottle of soju, and mul nangmyun. In the meantime, we were munching our way through their numerous very fresh banchan while they were grilling the meat. (They thought we were expecting more guests, but my wife replied, "He's very hungry.") All of the meat was so well seasoned, juicy, tender, and delicious! The mul nangmyun was made with high quality thin noodles in a very refreshing broth. So I did what any sane person would do...order more from the menu. I decided on (a large beer and) Al Jigae which was very good and again well seasoned. The prices were VERY reasonable for the quality and portions. All the dishes that we tasted were so pleasing to our palates that we went there 4 days later on Friday night with my wife's friend and her husband. :) Yum! We had 6-7 orders of Soowon Galbi (3), marbled galbi (3), pork gogi (1), bibim nangmyun, in addition to the banchan. But before we ordered, the owner and worker remembered me from Monday night and said they never saw anyone eat that much in one sitting. I said their food was so delicious that I wanted to introduce our friends to the restaurant and more importantly to eat MORE! They provided us with even better service than on Monday if that was even possible...a little quicker with water refills, banchan replacement, etc. One funny encounter happened with a worker who had not seen my wife and I on Monday. I asked for sahm (leaf lettuce) and she kindly replied they just have the seasoned lettuce salad to eat with the beef. The owner came by to see what was going on and said "please give him the sahm, as he is a very good customer." We all had a nice laugh. We cannot wait to come back!!!

Decided to go to K-town this weekend to attend the 1st annual Korean BBQ festival. ÊHave to say that they need to block off a couple of blocks instead of trying to cram it on a parking lot rooftop. ÊAfter finally finding parking, I get there and noticed how long the line was. ÊI was not about to wait in line for 30+ minutes under the baking sun and pay $10-$15 for a plate. Ê So I decided to head on down to Soowon. ÊI really liked their food the first time around. ÊGot there mid day, no problem finding a table. ÊOrdered combo B for the 4 of us. ÊJust like the last time we came, the service was pretty slow. ÊI really can't blame them since other people had the same idea as me. ÊThey tried their best to service us. Ê I decided to help them out by grilling the meat myself. ÊIf I had waited for them to do it, it would have taken forever and the meat might have burned in the process. ÊTheir banchan is one of the best. ÊIt wets your appetites while you wait for the MEAT!!! Ê All in all, I would definitely come back here. ÊOne thing I suggested to the hostess was that they should have pictures of the banchan by the table so that we can point to it when we need a refill. ÊThe employees there don't speak very good english and it's very difficult sometimes to communicate with them. Ê The hostess was very nice, she kept on asking us if there was anything she can do for us. ÊI kind of felt bad for her. ÊShe was caught running around and fanning herself the whole time I was there.

Êi was surprised at how clean it was inside - not that i expected it to be dirty, but i did expect it to be a little more gritty. Ê will definitely go again. Êwe don't normally spend this much on food and we chose this place over soot bull jeep because many of the reviewers mentioned that the staff do everything for you. Êsince we were new to this type of meal, we appreciated the help.

I went here after I read the reviews on Yelp and I was very disappointed. ÊFirst off, the service was bad!!! I understand if the place was busy but there were only two tables with customers. ÊThe food was only so-so. ÊI asked for more egg side dish and the waitress told me they didn't have anymore. ÊReally??? Hmmmmm...

First time I'd ever eaten Korean BBQ with the grill at the table. Ê It was super tasty and I'm hooked! Ê What a good idea, pieces of juicy marinated steak straight from grill to mouth. ÊJust try not to burn yourself!! ÊMe and two friends went here for lunch around 2pm on a thursday. ÊThe place was a little less than half full, not too busy so our waitress had plenty of time for us and was attentive. Ê She even grilled some of the cuts of meat for us until we took over in our enthusiasm. Ê Waters were kept full and we got a refill of a couple dipping sauces/side dishes with a smile. Ê They also replaced the grill top with a clean one for us halfway through the meal, which was cool. ÊWe ordered a combination platter and it was all awesome, came with chicken bulgogi, pork belly, beef rib eye and brisket. Ê Also an assortment of 15 or so sides, all tasty, and some dipping sauces. Ê All the meat cuts were super tasty and high quality, and all the side dishes were good as well. Ê Hell yes for Korean BBQ and Soowon Galbi!! ÊYUM!!

Alright... I was really excited after reading the 5 star review on yelp so I called up my relatives to come join me to try this place out. They have all read the reviews and maybe we were too hyped up about it because of the great reviews that I didn't find it 5 star worthy. 1st off, the service was definitely not 5 star worthy, they were so rushed and understaff that it took them 15 mins to get our water refilled, along with both the waiter and waitress were so... how do you say it.. "stonefaced" that we felt even if we were to drop $100 bill for tip, they wouldn't know how to smile or say thank you. We were all trying to be really polite, including my little brother who raised his hand quietly for attention from the server to refill our waters, instead he got scared because the server looked pissed. Because they were in such a hurry, it totally ruined our mood because we felt rushed to finish our dinner, they would try to cook our food but because they were in such a hurry, they would knock our food off the skillet and onto the table, woudln't apologize and put it back onto the skillet after it had already touched the table. Another thing I don't understand is why you can't order the pork neck meat outside of the combo. After reading all the reviews on the pork belly, I must admit that I have definitely had better. The shrimp and the beef were amazing though, so I would definitely give 5 stars on that. But due to the service, the clogged bathroom, and the luke warm soup, I am going to give it a 4 star. p.s. the kimchee and the radish were excellent though, along with the salad. I would go there for the food, but definitely not for the service.

Honestly, I really have no complaints about this place. ÊFirst off, the place is super clean and we were immediately greeted by the sweetest host (Min). ÊNot only did she help recommend dishes to try but her and our server continously helped us cook the meat throughout the night. ÊOur water/beers and side dishes were never left empty or alone and not once did we feel neglected. ÊAside from the bomb service, our food was really good. ÊThe meat was very fresh and the sauces were really good as well (i love garlic). ÊValet parking is only $2 outside and for four people with 4 bottles of beer, 3 orders of meat dishes, 2 egg dishes and 2 soup dishes, total only came out to about $27 a person. ÊI'm sure the all you can eat style is cheaper elsewhere but for the service and quality, you really can't beat that. ÊIf you're looking for a good solid place to eat bbq in K-town, look no further food lovers.

My prejudice for LA Korean restaurants has always been that while they offer delicious authentic food, they lack in quality department. The only Korean BBQ restaurant in LA that really impressed me in quality to this day, is Chosun Galbi. After seeing all these positive feedbacks, I decided to give this place a try for lunch on last friday since my gf has been craving korean BBQ for the longest time. When I stepped into the place, I immediately noticed the place was a lot cleaner than average korean restaurants, with interior design that didn't appear too flashy but worked just fine. We both ordered Soowon Wang Galbi(marinated korean BBQ) that cost me about 26 dollars/person. I was impressed with the quality of the meat as well as generous serving size. We had 3 very friendly waitress ladies giving us full attention and prompt service(since no one was there around that time). The only thing that I didn't like was, as others already mentioned, we couldn't really take our sweet time enjoying the food because those waitresses were standing by the table the whole time and cooked for us(constantly dumping meats on our plate so they don't get burned). I guess we could've told them we wanted to cook. PRO: Best quality, reasonable price, great service CON: Don't let them cook for you if you want to enjoy your meal

I've only been once, but it was perfect. The banchan were great (though not particularly creative), the bulgogi and spicy pork were excellent, there's real charcoal, and it was $25 a piece (with tax and tip) including beers.

ÊWe are still new to eating at BBQ places but we felt welcomed and the service was wonderful. ÊThe inside of the restaurant was clean and what other place has a service bell? ÊWe ordered Combination D with a bottle of Sojo and the food was more than enough. ÊIt even came with a salad, rice, soup, and even a sweet tea like drink at the end.

We went there on a Saturday night based on Yelp reviews. We got the combination dish, which had beef, chicken and 3 slices of pork belly. The beef was sliced thinly, but it had a lot of fat (50%). It was frozen sliced so it had a pretty presentation, but once cooked it shrank a lot. It was $39.99. We ended ordering a bulgogi because it was not enough meat. There more side dishes than other places we have been, but I rate based on the main item, meat. Service was good very attentive. I will continue my search for a good korean BBQ that is not AYCE in LA, it is not do not beat our favorite in San Diego : Noodletown.

LOOOVE my radishes had three types of them. A plus in my book already. The prices where good for a group. If you're a meat eater this is the place to be. I am really not but for the sake of my friends I gave in and ate red meat. Not really red meat eater but we ordered this awesome combo for 4-5 people. Combo A! To do Korean BBQ the more ppl the better the deal. ÊIt was a variety of meats. My fave part was still the banchan which they refilled, and the salad. They make a great green salad! ÊThe menu has other things too but most importantly the menu is detailed enough that you know what you are getting when you order. ÊI will come back again in the future when I feel like eating meat or just craving good Korean BBQ. And you know it's a great joint when its mostly Koreans in there having a BBQ! hehe. Oh let me not forget to mention service was good and the staff was friendly. They rock!

i have been to at least 1/2 of the numerous korean bbq joints here in koreatown area and this is one of my favorite. you can tell that a korean bbq joint with no AYCE option is going to be a bit more expensive; however, most of the time you WILL notice the difference in meat quality and/or service. in the specific case of soowon galbi, their service is spot-on with full service cooking/cutting the meats (and it was a friday night) and the meal was excellent. i always get the unmarinated galbi because being the cynical person i am, i assume the meat is fresher as they cannot use the overwhelming marination to mask anything. it's strange because in MOST restaurants, the UNmarinated meats cost more than their marinated (and thus a bit more labor-intensive) counterparts . . . . anyway, my friend and i had the meat above, some sahm-gyup-sal and some dwen-jang-gook with a bottle of hite. the bill was somewhere in the mid 60's including tax/tip.

I really like this place. i think Soowon Galbi will be my go to place for Korean BBQ. I've been there twice (two days in a row) and just from my experience it was pretty consistent. ÊThe folks are very nice and accommodating. We got there kinda late (10 mins before closing) and they welcomed us graciously and didn't rush us during dinner. They even seated two other tables who came in after us. The cuts of Êmeat is very tasty. We usually go to Chosun Galbee for Korean BBQ.. and this was a great change from that. I wanted to find a place that was as tasty as Chosun but a little more low key and Soowon was a perfect for that. They have pretty good banchan and I really love the rice paper and the paper thin Turnip/Radish(?) that came with it. They also give you a large salad and soup. The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because the vents aren't that good and I kept getting smoke in my eye every time someone came and out of the restaurant. Also, the grill is very close to the edge of the table and I kept getting hot oil splatters from the meat onto my hands. Overall.. It's tasty, so go.

my opinion about this restaurant may be a bit biased but i have to say, the quality of meat here is awesome. i came after a long day of studying/school with friends and was pleasantly surprised to find that the interior looked so much better than the outside surroundings of the restaurant. everything about this restaurant is top notch. the service is excellent, the ban-chan is brought out in wide variety pretty quickly and of course the most important, the meat is delish. you won't get a better deal for what you're paying here. it's totally worth it! i'm not picky about food but i am picky about saying what's good and what's average. out of the many korean bbq restaurants i've been to, this is probably one of the top restaurants i would recommend going to. i also have to note that it's super duper squeaky clean; i was impressed. great service, excellent food, clean environment; what more can you ask for?

I have constantly raved about this place to people and brought many first-timers here because of the quality and taste, but my recent visit to Soowon Galbi left me totally disappointed. ÊMy sister was visiting from Seattle with her baby and I wanted to take her to the best Korean bbq restaurant so we came here at 3pm on a weekday when it would not be too busy. ÊWe were the only customers in the restaurant and were served immediately and given a lot of attention. ÊHowever, my issue with the restaurant is that they've raised the prices on their bulgolgi and the portion size was also soooo small, like half of what it used to be!!! I even asked the lady if this was a small or large order, to which she replied "regular size." ÊThe meat didn't even cover the plate it was served on. ÊI've been there many times before and to my recollection what we were served was NOT regular size. ÊI don't know if she thought she could pull a fast one on us, or if she thought that two girls wouldn't eat that much meat....but we definitely received less than normal. ÊI would've given my updated review 2 stars, but the taste and quality of meat is still so good, therefore 3 stars. ÊI'm so sad after that visit and I don't think I will return again.

this is not cheap but it is fantastic. they give you refills of all the banchan (just ask!) and the marinated meat is awesome. mmmm. sooo tasty. get korean beer. eat til you're full and then keep eating 'cause there's more meat there! just plain tasty goodness. (p.s. not korean, but kind of a food snob so i feel like i have a good sense of things...)

by far, our favorite kbbq place in koreatown! Êlove the service and the cleanliness of the restaurant, and the food is amazing. Êdon't be surprised if you have to wait for a table even on a week night. Êbut the food is definitely worth it.

Such a tantalizing array of flavors and visual stimuli! When I am given the opportunity to grill my own meat I feel as though I am in kitchen stadium! The ingredients are fresh and the condiments are abundant! The meat must be marinated in Snuggle over night! This is the only valid answer I can come up with to the question "how is your meat so soft"? Often times I feel as though I am Kim Jung il with the way I am treated at this establishment! If I was a contestant in a buzz in game show I would lose! I only had to push the magic button twice, and both time were to satisfy the groups alcoholic tendencies for the night. One of the short ribs were so long and full of white marbling that it reminded me of the flying white dog from the never ending story! Speaking of never ending story the meat seemed to never end their mission of jumping on the grill! It is not very hard to be a pessimist at this establishment either Êas our shot glasses were always full! ÊLast but not least the two young ladies working the front booth make the women in the maxim magazines look like women in the national geographic magazine. Like Arnold said... I'll be back!

surprisingly, this place is spot-on CLEAN. Ênot at all what I expected, since this is in a strip mall where it is dirty outside! Êthe staff is very courteous and on a friday evening, it was not crowded. Êwe ordered the 2 most popular meats - the ones you always get at a kbbq. Êsorry, i'm just not good (yet) at remembering these asian names... Êbut i will get there. Êthe cool, somewhat silly thing about this place is their menu. Êjohn noticed that it's very "user friendly"- Êthe menu includes descriptions of the items - in english! Ê=) Êbottom line, the meat was delicious. Êfresh, perfetto! Êmmm mmm goooood! Êas well as were the sides, salad - and rice! Êrice has to be good cuz it could make or break a meal. Êi ate so much that john was impressed, since i usually eat like a bird. ÊYUUUUUMMMM!! Êoh and the dipping sauces - i esp. liked the sesame oil dip with rock salt - it seemed especially sweet when accompanied with the meat. Êsomehow the meat brings out the sweetness. ÊDeee-Lish!!
