I had the pleasure of coming here for a food tasting and got to meet Chef Charlie, and since then I've come back almost once a week! My absolute recommendation would be the Super Salad; if you're a healthy eater, you'll want to eat this all day! ?Kale, dried cranberries, walnuts, quinoa...you'll feel really good after eating it, I promise! ?Even my boyfriend, who cringes at the word "vegetables", has repeatedly requested we go to Calafia just for this salad. ?My other favorites are the Calafia burger, the dumplings, and the buckwheat pancakes with blueberries for the breakfast menu! ?I only wish they were closer to work or home; I'd order one every day! Their menu can be ordered through the wonderful friendly staff, or the cool gadgets at each table. ?They aren't mounted to the tables either, which is great if kids want to play games, and it also allows you to pay in a hurry with a swipe of a credit card! The most enjoyable part of eating at Calafia was knowing the philosophy behind it. ?Having an opportunity to chat with the chef really gave me an appreciation for the food and the amount of thought and training that goes into building each dish. ?It's mindful, healthy eating, meant to satisfy what your taste buds crave but also feed your body the nutrients it needs.

Calafia has always been one of my favorite places to eat. I love that I can eat freely off the plant-eaters side of the menu, and my companions can eat from the meat-eaters. Today, however, on their Facebook page, they posted a photo of a foie gras dish, with the caption "Special dinner for some guests that paid huge money for a chefs dinner paired with wine. The Amuse course was totally illegal in California." I'm very sad to see that Calafia has joined the ranks of restaurants that are now flagrantly defying the law by "giving away" foie gras. Clearly, this is not a restaurant with a conscience. Foie gras is illegal for a reason. ?I'll be boycotting them from now on, and encourage you to do the same, if it bothers you, too.

Based on the mixed reviews below, I wasn't super confident choosing this place as a dinner spot for a night out with my parents, but after our meal we all came away saying it was one of the best ones we've had in a long, long time! It seems like some of the complaints in the other reviews have to do with seating and wait times, but we made a reservation the night before so we had no problems at all. I used to work at Google and Charlie was always well known for his delicious food selections, and it seems that he's brought his philosophy to this restaurant - the market area looks so much like some of the Google cafeterias, I laughed when I saw it! As for the restaurant, the hostess and waiter the night we were there were impressively friendly and helpful when it came to choosing our dinner selections. Maybe the others who didn't have such great experiences should ask their servers, because whatever he did, he steered us in the right direction! The menu seems to change quite often depending on what fresh ingredients they have that day, which is a good thing in my book. That particular night, I had the spicy pork BBQ bowl, which included brown rice and a sunny-side up quail egg - so comforting and flavorful! My ?mom had a fresh salad with butternut squash that was also delicious, and much lighter, and my husband had a fish dish that was also delish. My dad ordered the short rib which was wonderfully tender, but we all agreed was a bit too salty. I was really impressed with the variety of the menu - this place doesn't encompass just one genre, but instead seems to embrace fresh ingredients and interesting spins on classic flavors. Highly recommended!

I was excited to try Charlie Calafia's restaurant in Town & Country in Palo Alto but unfortunately it just didn't meet my high expectations. We came for a late breakfast and luckily we sat at the bar and didn't have to wait. They have tons of seating inside and a fair amount of outdoor seating outside. I love the concept of this place and enjoy their tablet menus and ordering. They have a fairly small menu and I ended up getting the scramble of the day since it was vegetarian and I thought it was just average, nothing to write home about (particularly my burnt english muffin). I was less than impressed with their service as I had to track down someone for water refills, ketchup, etc. Bottom line, I think I'd opt for Crepevine in downtown Palo Alto for breakfast/brunch over Calafia Cafe.

Cool concept. ?I like the set up from the larger tables to the sink sharing in the restroom. ?The device on each table is a very appreciated. ?It kept the kid busy throughout the meal. Foodwise, I'd say it's pretty good. ?Turkey meatloaf was great, if you are the meatloaf kind of person. ?Probably one of the best mac & cheese I'd ever had. ?Everyone at the table was raving about the short ribs. I'd definitely recommend Calafia Cafe & would come back if I'm in the area.

What happened to the Calafia that I once raved about? It's gone...all gone. ?In fact, every time I give it another chance, the food just tastes worse (the sad part is that I've even tried the same dishes over again). The decline is pronounced and I really just have to wonder why they changed a good thing. I went there for what was probably my last time last night, and the saving grace to dinner (yellow curry chicken and the beef chow mein) was dessert. ?Something is really wrong when a vegan apple pie makes your meal forgivable. I gave Calafia two stars for one reason: service here has always been top notch.

This caf¨¦ is worth visiting just for the sake of its exquisitely labeled menu! Do you eat vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, or dairy-free? All of these are clearly marked, which makes my inner data geek so happy. Perhaps more relevant: the food is quite nice, too. The Crimson Quinoa Salad was especially interesting and flavorful.

For dinner, go with the shaking beef salad and a glass of red wine -- they usually have great selections. ?For lunch, the Market a Go Go has an amazing salad bar with excellent ingredients, and it is very reasonably priced. ?The staff are friendly and helpful both in the market and the restaurant. ?It is true that there are busy times -- you can avoid by going to lunch right before 12.

You know what, Calafia, normally I love you except the hostess lady at the front was incredibly rude to me last night. Okay, so you had a private party and the restaurant was closed. How was I to know, especially since the nice folks opened the door for me and I didn't see the little sign that was hard to read that said you were closed for a private event?! No need to snap at me and talk to me like I'm a five year old child just because I didn't see the sign. Sheesh. Your food's way overpriced anyway.

Great ambient, selection of foods too. Fresh ingredients and pleasing taste. This is a good choice for large groups, as they can accommodate with seating. Also, there are choices for vegan eaters.

Great breakfast spot! Wifi password is "cookmefood" Ordered the Blue Max with Ham. It was delicious! The hash browns were done very nicely. I enjoyed the taste of the saut¨¦ed mushrooms, spinach. The poached eggs were cooked nicely. I'm not a big cheese person. If I ever get it again I might request to have it without cheese. The black forest ham was great. I had the C-Boost to drink. It was very sour and did not taste good at all. My partner ordered the Croque Madame which tasted delicious. Service was very quick and friendly and our orders came out pretty quickly.

So sad, I was so excited to bring my friend here who's a chef for over a year, as she's really into sustainable and fun foods, so we came last night and our experience was bleh. We started off with the papas con ajo, the awesome fries here, and a side of brussel sprouts. The papas con ajo were SO extremeley salty, they put way too much seasoning, and as much as I love mushy fries, these fries were ALL mushy (not a single crispy one in the batch) and soggy. The brussel sprouts were diced, which was different, but again, overly seasoned and saltttttttttty. Ordered my usual steak tacos and we also got a guanciale burrata pizza. The pizza was good, fresh burrata (fresh mozzeralla cheese), the cured pork cheek was tasty, and loved the tomato sauce. Thin crust and yum in the tums. The steak tacos. WOW. So I thought the fries and brussel sprouts were salty? These...were unbelievably over-marinated and just thinking about it, my mouth waters...in a bad way. I thought I was eating meat doused in salt, and even the large lettuce wrap and cabbage could not get the salt taste out of my mouth. My friend agreed on all of these things, and I could barely finish one of the 3 wraps. Wow, either tonight's chef really likes salt, or we came on an off day. Considering it was still $60 for this meal, I would have hoped for better food. But sadly, I'm not the type to turn back food (unless there's hair!) or be honest, which I should have. But we were so hungry!!! Don't think I'll be back here again as this experience of their food was just awful!

I've been here three times and have become a big fan. ?OK, the menu is a bit over-the-top in terms of trendiness, but the food is delicious and beautifully plated, the service is friendly and efficient, and the atmosphere is fun and family friendly while also being dressed-up enough for a (silicon valley) business lunch. ?The pork buns (Peking-duck style pork belly) are magnificent, but I recommend getting the habanero relish/chutney on the side, as otherwise the dish packs more heat than most folks can handle. ?I've had a couple of the entree salad options and they were both lovely, if not a bit smaller than expected for a main course. ?My wife has had the short ribs and a pasta special - both quite good. ?The sliders on the kids menu were really good, but beware that the house-made catsup did not fly with my Heinz-loving eight-year-old.

Terrible. Food was tasteless to the point of being inedible. The chicken burrito, quiche, tofu and rice had no spices or salt. Also, we waited for sandwiches over 15 minutes. We went to return the tasteless burrito and the cook was very defensive. He told us we could add salt using the salt shakers. His supervisor made him comp us some muffins which was appreciated, but then told me unhappily that it was coming out of his paycheck. The muffins and salad bar were good. The experience and the rest of the food was poor.

Loud, crowded, and distressing with only slightly upscale "stanford" prices. ?Perfect for the trust fund set. Little electronic gadgets at the table or counter let you play inane games, place limited orders, or pay your check just like on Virgin Airlines airplanes, complete with flashing annoying constant commercials and no "off" switch. My food was very good as was my service which is impressive given how busy they are at 1pm on a Sunday. My advice is to avoid them on a weekend.

I have been to Calafia several times and I wanted to like it. ?I really did. ? Several friends raved about it so perhaps I had high expectations. ? At first I found the food pretty bland and I tried a bunch of different dishes to find out what everyone was raving about. ? Yellow Curry Chicken, Duck Dumplings. Burger, Shaking Beef salad were all so so. ?Finally I tried the Beef Chow Mein and was happy with that. ?Again not great but at least something I would order again. ? Problem was after I had it for lunch, I got really sick with a massive stomach ache and spent much of that afternoon in the bathroom. ?I didn't think it was the food since I had eaten there before so just dismissed it as a bug. ?But then I went back again, had the Beef Chow Mein again and again got sick immediately with the same stomach ache symptoms. ? So that will be my last visit at Calafia and earns them a 1-star rating. ? On the positive side, I have not had some of the service issues that others have noted. ?Service has always been fairly timely and attentive.

Pros and cons of Calafia: Calafia is: vegetarian, child friendly (they have this cute tablets with games, etc), has friendly service, is in a good location(T&C). BUT Calafia is also: rather expensible, rather noisy, their smoothies are... forgettable at least, there is not much variation on the menu. Decide for yourself...

Don't be fooled by Calafia's appearance or reputation as one of those "fresh and healthy" type places that have vegan options. While the restaurant does have vegan and gluten-free options, the food here is the real deal, and this is coming from a decidedly non-vegan carnivore. My disclaimer is that my review is only for their breakfast, but their breakfast was extraordinary. If their lunch/dinner items are as good, I could easily give them a 5th star. I came here with a friend, and Calafia did not disappoint. First of all, they do a good job of using technology. Each table has a device you can use to place orders, play games, and pay your bill. The biggest benefit is that the device has PICTURES of all menu items. Invaluable for making those hard decisions on what to eat. The menu has plenty of egg dishes, usually with a bit of a twist. I ordered the eggs/chicken sausage/biscuits and gravy combination. The biscuits and gravy were excellently made -- not overly doughy and dry like most biscuits, and the gravy was savory without being overly salted. The eggs were soft and fluffy -- clearly made fresh. My friend ordered the breakfast pizza, which contains an egg on top and smoked salmon. The salmon was good and the dough was a nice, crispy thin crust. My friend and I also shared a coffee cake, which I would favorably stack next to any coffee cake I've had in the Bay Area. Crumbly and moist, but not too sweet, just like it should be. Calafia also has a selection of juices and smoothies, of which my friend and I each ordered one. They were good, but I wish they were served chilled. Calafia is simply worth the drive for breakfast -- I live in the South Bay, and I would willingly trot up here for breakfast every weekend.

Calafia has all the ingredient for a great place, you can tell a lot of thought went into this place, the menu is interesting and tasty. Its such a shame it lets itself down on the basics which would be so easy to fix. My first visit, one of the dishes was cold - clearly it had been left waiting on the counter. Its really no fun having two of us finish our meals before the other gets theirs. I liked the menu enough to go back - this time our waiter visited us about every 30 minutes - we ordered everything off the computer including the drinks and check after getting tired of waiting for each service. Still I went back - same again - service was poor, my soda was flat, rice was a reheated patty and the sea bass tacos were raw in the middle. Such a shame, but i doubt ill try again.

I have never fallen in love with the food at Calafia. However, as a vegan [going on two years] I appreciate that chef and owner Charlie Ayers pays attention to the needs of vegans and gluten-free eaters. This was not my first time at Calafia but I went ?last night after a long hiatus. I was pleased to see that the menu options for vegans has been refreshed with some additional and creative choices. I went with the raw deal salad as a starter [shredded raw carrots, shredded raw beets, shredded dinosaur kale, sliced radishes, sunflower sprouts, grated cauliflower, chopped raw California walnuts, California Eureka lemon olive oil vinaigrette]. ?For all its ingredients the salad was a little bland, but overall it was a decent, healthy and light appetizer. For my entree I had the Carrot-Mushroom Osso Bucco [roasted rainbow carrots, oyster mushrooms, braised Swiss chard, soft-miso polenta, roasted chestnut-shallot jus]. ?This was tasty although a little rich. ? The portions of both dishes were just the right size to leave a little room for dessert. I am not a big dessert man (got to watch the cholesterol!) but I had a taste of everyone else's and they were delicious. All in all, I generally find the food at Calafia ok (not amazing), with an interesting selection of starters and entrees for vegans. ?I like the overall atmosphere and the venue usually makes for a very enjoyable evening out.

5 stars for food , I LOVE the napa duck salad and the pork belly buns. I could eat those things almost everyday. I live in Palo Alto and have eaten at Calafia many many times so i've tried almost everything on the meat eater side of the menu. On days that ?they don't have duck salad I would recommend their hanger steak. I also highly recommend the google gulp smoothie! light, refreshing and TASTY! Everything is very fresh, tasty and best of all healthy! yay. 4 stars for service. It's hit or miss here, the service is generally good. sometimes you get a bad server. Overall great and sometimes you don't even have to use a server they have these mini screens you can just order on your own.

I litteraly LOVE this place. When I was vegan I could hardly find a place that would offer vegan food but in a non vegan atmosphere, Calafia was it. I fell in love with the place. People inside the open kitchen remind me of an orchestra. And they produce some of the greatest food I have ever eatten in USA. And like it says on the inside of the pizza to go box, it does not cost you your entire paycheck. Service in excellent and people are very friendly. I finally found a place that feels like home. I love going there and I have NEVER tried a dish that I did not like. It is a safe place, the crowd is great too but can get noise during friday nights. Their Chef, Hostesses, Waitresses, people behind the bar, people who clean tables are just amazingly friendly and really make you feel like you are at home. They talk to you, ask you how your day is going, treat you like a human being not like a dollar bill, you know? Calafia Cafe makes America a better place. It is not a super fancy place, it is more like home. Lots of good people making and eating good food and treating everyone with respect. Cheers Calafia thank you!

Teetering between a 3 and a 4. ?I didn't love the burrata and potato pizza or the prices. ?I think it's pricey for this level of dining and I usually don't whine about cost. ?

The place is vegan, vegetarian and gluten-free friendly. ?The food is tasty but probably not at the price point. ?If you want an affordable and tasty meal, I recommend ordering some of the sides, including the gingered yams and citrus beets. ?Because they don't take reservations, you may find yourself waiting at the door 45 minutes for a table on a busy Friday night. ?Calling ahead to get your name in the queue does not really help much. ?

Calafia is one of my favorite place in the Bay Area. Love Charlie (great guy), love his vision (local ingredients, local wines...), love the food. I am not vegetarian, but sometime I am not craving for meat. I really appreciate the fact that they have a very large choice of vegetarian dishes. also like the fact that is completely part of the Silicon Valley and its companies: you can order via Presto/ElaCarte, the restaurant is "Nest equipped"... I also like the association with Capay Valley (you can pick up your box of vegetables) and the roasted chicken :) Concerning the restaurant, my favorites are: the Crispy Pork Belly Buns ($16) and the Lacquered Beef Short Rib ($24) to die for!! Of course the staff is nice and it seems (that's very rare) they don't suffer turn-over (which is a good sign!). And it is a good deal: not expensive for the quality if the food. To conclude: Go for it! :D

Preface: No one is perfect but after 30+ visits a 99.9999% satisfaction ratio is as good as it gets. Five stars. Tip: Ask for Jeremiah. There are several good servers but he is the best. He has been a part of Calafia since the day it opened over four years ago. If it is your first time eating at Calafia, I highly recommend having Jeremiah share the origin of Calafia. His recommendations are thoughtful and honest. Of course he is an advocate of appetite, but true to the customer he'll never respond with "All of our dishes are amazing, they're all my favorite." The way he depicts each dish allows patrons to visualize their meal unlike any server I've met before. Personally I like to highlight two plates, each of which sounds appealing, and then ask for Jeremiah's perspective. Not only does he ask pointed questions before advising he rebuttals which empirical flavor profiles for each dish which make the decision a no brainer. Environment: Cozy enough to be a nice 1:1 setting, but dynamic enough to have a fun dinner party. If you are in the area and want to try it but can't stay to sit, swing by the market next door for a grab'n'go. Menu: Perhaps the most well executed balance of vegan, vegetarian and carnivore selections including breakfast, lunch and dinner specific highlights. The menu is fresh and changes with the seasons, local farmer's markets and ingredients available to ultimately support sustainable and local farmers. Bonus: My wife is allergic to Gluten AND Dairy, which for the most part eliminates most restaurants. If you're sick of 'Gluten Free' menus that blatantly disregard cross-contamination this will make your day. Again, in my case the idea of paying dine-out entree prices for a naked salad or grilled chicken breast and steamed vegetables (easily made at home for less than $10) is less than ideal, far from practical. Service: From Molly at the front podium to Jeremiah to Charlie the owner and executive chef, you can expect warm personal attention to you and detail to your needs/wants/desires. Specific dishes I highly recommend: The steak tacos are my "go to" and find that balance between enough to eat, not to heavy healthy and hearty. The kale and sweet corn starter could never end and I'd still be eating. For dessert, without dietary restrictions you have to try the Galette featuring a variety of fruits depending on fresh local ingredients. Thinking outside the box? Try one of their smoothies and especially the Chocolate Soy Bomb or Facebook Freeze. Atmosphere/Crowd: The atmosphere was notated above but the crowd is what you'd expect in dynamic foodie spot located in the heart of Palo Alto, walking distance from Stanford, founded by the original executive chef and employee #53 of Google. Feeling friendly? Ask for a seat at one of the communal tables and strike up a conversation with a fellow technologist, foodie, and thinker. If not, keep to yourself and play one of many games located on the handheld mini-machine set atop each table. Cons: The only con I can really point out with certainty is that despite all of their allergy and otherwise awareness, there are no desserts on the menu, which are gluten and dairy free. Most hear my wife's double allergy and think it's atypical but in reality many celiac individuals also have, minimally, intolerance to dairy. I wouldn't be surprised if by the time you've read this and visited this gem of a restaurant they've changed the menus though so give it a shot regardless! Pricing: Dinner for two including shared appetizer, two entrees, shared dessert, two glasses of wine, non-alcoholic pino noir grape beverage, tax and tip comes to approximately $120. If cost-effective is important a dinner for two out the door for approximately $50-60 is more than feasible. Reservations: They don't take reservations but you can call or drop in to add name to a short wait list if necessary and then stroll around the shopping center while you wait. Have never had to wait more than 5 minutes. Will not be seated until entire party has arrived though, good to know. Disclaimer (positive): I don't review many restaurants because many fail to lure me and my wife back time and time again. Calafia had us at hello.

Not sure why Calafia has poor reviews. I really enjoyed it here! We came during lunch on a weekday and there was still a wait even though we called in ahead of time. I heard during the school year the high school kids from Palo Alto High come here during school. We had the Chicken Drumettes with Google-style hot sauce as an appetizer. Our server warned us that the hot sauce was extremely spicy, but when we got it, it was...not that spicy. And I'm actually pretty sensitive to spicy foods. He explained that because they use fresh chili, the spiciness of it could vary. I was fine with that because I didn't really want my taste buds to burn off. I had the shaking beef salad, which was very tasty. The portion was smaller than I thought it would be, but I was still full. The ingredients were fresh and well made, and I love steak and arugula in general, so I don't think I could have not liked it. In all, I'll definitely come back to try some other things! They have wide selection of vegetarian and carnivorous options. I also want to try their home-made soda, which I hear is exceptionally tasty.

Calafia wants to be a good restaurant-they really want to great. ?But they aren't. ?They're a disappointment and I give up. Being new to town, I wanted to try out the cafe with the Google chef. ?Thinking about that now, why do I care if he worked at the search engine place? ?That's hardly a vote of confidence for a chef, but it explains how he affords the primo location and big ideas. The food is mediocre on the best day and garbage on a bad day. ?Not to be dramatic, but I was once served steamed bok choy that was rotting. ?Brown leaves and split stems. ?I sent it back, obviously, and the waiter informed me that "the chef agrees" with my appraisal. ?Like it was hard to see? ?I didn't really need his confirmation. ?They brought out a new side of bok choy and didn't charge me. ?So that was a good way to handle that. ? The next time we went, I was served steamed greens with a twist tie. ?You know those ties that hold bunches of produce together? ?Yeah, it was right in my $7 side dish. ?Literally served garbage. ?For the second time. ? I've been to Calafia 5 times, but only remember the two times I was served trash. ?It's absolutely forgettable. ?It's missing seasoning and finishing touches. ?You can tell thought went into these dishes, but the execution isn't there. ?They just can't quite make a great meal. ? The last-and I mean LAST-time I went there, I ordered the spicy dragon bowl. ?Tofu and noodles with some spinach. ?They forgot the tofu and brought it ten minutes later when we were done with our meal. ?Then charged us full price. ?The joke is on me, I know. ?Why did I keep going back? ?Never again. Don't waste your time, really. ?Two stars is for the juices, which are ok.

Calafia vs Whole Foods (salad bar) 1 Calafia. 0 Whole Foods. Done. Need I say more? Okay... -Review based solely on the market which I frequent (almost weekly). I ate at the cafe a while back and I recall it being good, but not amazing- -Top notch organic salad bar w/chicken, Hodo Soy tofu, prepared salads (barley & corn, carrot & currant, classiest egg salad I ever tasted)- http://www.yelp.com/biz_¡­ -2 or 3 soups, always a veggie or vegan option -Rotisserie chicken and other grab-n-go items, tofu/noodle/green salads -Made-to-order sandwiches -Loads of pastries catered toward every dietary restriction, gluten-free, vegan, uber indulgent. You get it. -Locally made chocolates, snacks and Verve coffee (coffee bar & beans to go) -Plenty of indoor and outdoor seating, never crowded Whenever you don't know what to do for lunch near Stanford/Palo Alto, in-out-done-happy.

okay okay, i have to give five extra stars. i just had lunch here for my birthday and my server, kate, was amazing! not only that but the owner Charlie Ayers came to our table and wished me a happy birthday himself! I love it when people treat everyone as important. everything i had was phenomenal! i had the yummy vegan lover pizza and added their brussel sprouts to it. perfecto! the smoothies are super yum and the dessert, darn, there goes the name again, either way it is their only vegan dessert, was scrumptious sauce! happy birthday to me!!!

This review is for the cafe/smoothie bar place. I had to come in here to work for a few hours, set up at a two-top in the corner and was completely undisturbed the entire time. No sidewise glares, no staring, no making me feel uncomfortable. The selection in the cold case and the salad bar both looked okay, but to be honest I wasn't really paying any attention to it at all. Just before I left, I saw the Glamour smoothie (avocado and I can't remember what else - that was the unusual part) and just had to try it. Five bucks isn't exactly cheap for a smoothie, but on the other hand it was super fresh and pretty darn good for something that has no added sugar in it. I'm not usually in the area, but if I am and have a hankering for fresh, healthy food and drinks, at least I know of one place to get them!

Not quite sure I get the Calafia craze. The atmosphere is cool. The owner was previously a Google chef. The service is decent. But the food is awful. I ordered chicken curry and it had zero resemblance to any chicken curry I have ever had. I've also had several other appetizers from Calafia and was less than impressed.

I wish Yelp had separated this into 2 businesses, because the cafe and the market are two entirely different animals, quality-wise! I'd give the market 2 stars (even though its name is TOO cute), and the cafe gets 4. For this review, I think I'll just talk about how great the cafe is and skip the boring bit about the market, but suffice it to say: Don't "A Go Go!" (Yes, I went there.) Calafia Cafe does accept reservations for parties of 8-12, so for my friend's birthday we lucked out and didn't have to endure the long wait. Another perk to coming to Calafia with such a big party was being able to try so many dishes! For the table to share, we started off with one of the specials (the gnocchi salad) and the garlic fries. Both were solid. Calafia makes their own ketchup, so it tastes... different. I am going to guess that they use an apple vinegar or something, because I seriously felt like I was eating latkes with applesauce rather than fries with ketchup -- not at all a negative! Yum! It was a hard decision because that menu is extensive, but for my main course I got the Shaking Beef Salad. Amazing. It is definitely priced right, with a very generous serving of steak abed an endless sea of arugula and shaved fennel (my fav kind of salad lately!), drizzled in a sweet sesame soy glaze. I highly recommend! Luckily two of my friends ordered the other dishes I was eyeing. The Wolfgangs Pizza was phenomenal, but has a very strong flavor palette. I can imagine sharing it with a group as an appetizer, but it seemed overwhelming as a main for me at least. The New Boho Pork Salad (I think it was previously called New Bohemian) was also tasty, but for some reason it tasted bizarrely like candy (??)... and my friend who ordered it agreed. Strange. Another friend got the vegetarian black bean tostada dish and she was the first to clean her plate -- she absolutely raved about it, but did warn that it is super spicy. Truly, this place stands out most in the DESSERT arena. YES! I wish that I had just ordered the entire dessert menu for my main course. Honestly. Would that have been gauche? I'm past the point of caring. The ginger chocolate cake was diviiiiiiine, the lemon tartlet was ridiculously good, and the strawberry rhubarb tart thing was also excellent. Splitting 3 desserts amongst 12 ravenous folks was not a good plan. I want them ALL to myself next time. A word on their alcohol: I do NOT recommend the cocktails. I have actually never had an Agave cocktail I've liked, so this doesn't surprise me, but really both the Cosmo & the Mojito were lackluster, probably also in part due to the substitution of sabe for the usual vodka and rum. Stick with the fantastic local wine list and don't look back!

I have been here for both lunch and dinner, 5 or 6 times total and had a great experience every time. The menu has a lot of variety and has clear labels for gluten free, vegan and vegetarian options. (Hooray!) 2 dishes I can't get enough of: Papas con Ajo (spicy slender french fries with a great dipping sauce) and the Fiery Bottom BBQ pork bowl (gluten free BBQ pork with sweet potatoes and kale over brown rice)

The pictures of the food on yelp lured me in but it was just alright. My mom got the breakfast pizza and although it was PILED with lox it lacked flavor. ?It was huge though. ?We both could have shared it and been full. I ordered the croque monsieur which was good. ?REALLY good bread. Came with a side salad. They have illy coffee which is my FAVE. A small market and smoothie bar is connected. A little pricey. We had a bunch of different servers, the same person never came back twice.

These guys know what they're doing, especially for Brunch. I can't stop ordering the Blue Max: poached eggs and cheese on top of spinach, mushrooms and fresh roasted potatoes. I've also been here for dinner and can vouch for the pork salad (the salty flavor is complemented by the spinach and avocado) and the mahogany salmon (tastes wonderful with the sides of wakame seaweed and quinoa). I drop one star only because the Asian-themed dishes I've tried from them were not impressive -- stick to your strengths, Calafia!

We tried 3 dishes for a late lunch and I thought 2 of them very very well prepared but could have been tweaked to be amazing. One dish, the chicken drumettes should be changed completely. The lovely waiter recommended the curry chicken as his favorite. He didn't steer us wrong but the addition of some chutney sauce would have made it fantastic. The grilled shrimp Ceaser salad was very well prepared (3 shrimp) but a bit of seasoning would have really elevated it. We were there late so it was almost empty. The atmosphere was light and lovely. There is one issue that really bothered me. The sinks to wash hands, in the European fashion, are outside the ladies and men's room. I think this is fine. The disturbing part is the curtain of chains that you have to walk through. After washing up, you'll need to use your clean hands to separate the chain curtain. I just couldn't do it. Used my elbow so as not to contaminate my clean hands. All of the employees watched this and I felt pretty awkward. I would love to go back as the menu had some very interesting dishes. I was impressed with the selection of vegan and special diet dishes. Agreed, it is a bit pricey, but as has been noted, in this area, to be expected.

Been wanting to try this place for a long time. ? I came for late Brunch. ?Medium busy. Food is on the expensive side. Waitress brought one french press for 5 people. ?tiny cups. ?(3 oz maybe?) ?You get to sit there and wait for your coffee to steep for 5 minutes, and then you get to taste it-- it tastes like crap. ?Bitter, low quality-- with a hint of 80's Dennys flavor-- you know, back before coffee was good. Your average gas station coffee is significantly better. ?No refills. ?Best idea is drink your coffee before you show-- or bring in Peets-- they are close by. I had a Croque Madame-- ?I had high hopes. ?The sandwich is underwhelming when it is set in front of you-- ?small, unartfully made, cheap bread, egg slightly too done. ?It got worse eating it-- they put cinnamon and sugar on the bread, which makes it taste awful. ?whose idea was that? ?Theres no need-- or way to -- "improve" something like a croque madame, just do it right and pay attention to the fundamentals. ? We ended up talking to the manager about "Jeremiah" who twice treated us like we were putting him out severely when we (1) asked for salt and pepper ?(2) asked for a seperate plate. ? I wont be back to this place, and neither will the others in my group.

Tried Calafia out for the first today......doing the brunch thing. I really enjoyed the environment....we sat at the counter near the kitchen. ?So all the activity of getting meals out to patrons was right in front of us, including the chef who was directing the orchestra. ?He was our supplemental waiter....as our Waitress seemed a bit spread thin.....but things still moved along at a reasonable pace. Tried their chicken / blue cheese salad.....was very nice. ?I enjoyed it thoroughly. ?We shared it....and next time I'd love an entire one. Also tried their brunch special which was salmon in cakes, with potatoes and other stuff.....topped by a poached egg and sauce. ?I was really looking forward to it, as it looked super as we saw them moving out of the kitchen to others. ?My first taste put me off.....was quite fishy, which surprised me. ?Maybe it was the contrast to the earlier salad, or the coffee I was drinking??? ?I did enjoy the dish....but that first taste was quite fishy, which isn't my cup of tea. ?Yes I knew it was salmon....but typically I don't have a fishy taste issue with salmon dishes. Place is noisy..I noticed while we were there, that the nice classic rock track I heard when we came in...was drowned out by the time we left. ?Things had heated up and the noise had climbed with it. Enjoyed the meal.....I'll come back and try them again at some point.

Wish I could give it zero stars. We had a party of 4, and 3 of us were there. ?We said we were ready to sit and were taken outside to a table. ?When the hostess noticed we were missing our 4th (who was about 5 min away on a motorcycle) she made a point of telling us how lucky we were she hadn't noticed because they don't seat until the whole party is there. ?I was parched from a day of walking, happy to get off my feet and have some water. ?It's not like we're taking up less space if the 4th never shows (the seating options are 2 and 4 seats so even if we were just 3 people, we'd be taking up a 4 person table), and that comment from her was an amazingly rude and unnecessary way to start off our meal. We got to ordering right away - I requested a beer and some fries for an appetizer. ?We got the fries probably ten minutes later. ?My beer took, for some reason, another ten minutes to get there, as did the refill on the water I requested. ?During this process, a waitress came and introduced herself randomly saying she was going to be taking care of us from then on. ? We ordered food. ?I requested some sort of sauce to go with my chicken burger and was informed that all they had was ketchup and some spicy habanero sauce. ?I asked for like a creamy dressing or something and was told they had nothing that would go with my burger. ?I asked to let me try the habanero sauce and was given more of their crappy ketchup (later they gave a jalapeno cesar dressing to my friend at the table and it went with my sandwich just fine - but instead of listing what they had and letting me make a choice on my own, they just basically told me to get over it and eat the burger as it was presented.) ? My other friend wanted the special (halibut - poorly cooked) but didn't want the included wasabi potatoes and requested regular instead. ?He was told the chef's rule was that he could have specials the way they were made or he wasn't going to get them at all, which shocked all of us rather a lot. ?I've never experienced such egotism from any chef (even at really fine restaurants). ?Perhaps he's under some delusion that he works for the French Laundry, idek. ...so we placed our order and waited... and waited... and waited... ? After almost 30 minutes had passed since we ordered, the waitress came out and looked worried, went back in, and our food suddenly appeared all at once, so who knows how long it sat under the warmers. I had the chicken burger, as i mentioned, and it was perfectly dull. ?I think Google must have leveled up because their free cafeteria food is way better than this was. ?I'm really glad I didn't buy anything more expensive. ?I also had some of the seasoned fries, but seriously, I've had better fries out of the frozen foods section at Safeway. ? We had this meal before the 'Quakes game and I almost missed kickoff because I got suddenly rather violently sick. ?My stomach cramped up horribly and I was in pain for about 15 minutes solid. ?This could have been due to something OTHER than the food I had just eaten, but it seems rather unlikely. Between the completely boring food, the snotty/rude/unpleasant staff, and my sudden illness, I can safely say I will not be going back there again in this lifetime.

I revisited this place. ?The highlight was that my burger was actually cooked medium rare, and it tasted good. ?Also, I liked the server. ?He was a cool guy and I hope he never gets replaced by a stupid computer. ? And now the lowlight: $40 for a chewy duck confit salad and a burger with some mediocre ass fries. ?I don't mind paying these prices if the food that I am getting is OMFG tasty, but I left with the impression that the high end cafeteria food at Google, is only worthy of being served in the best flavor, and that is free.

This place is neat. I came here for a team lunch through work, and it was delicious. I didn't get a chance to investigate too thoroughly, but the menu was diverse and the waiter was knowledgeable (and maybe a bit *too* enthusiastic, but that's not something to complain about). I would definitely recommend that those nearby take a look for lunch or dinner, because Calafia Cafe has a unique vibe of its own.

Went back last Friday the second time with three girl friends for dinner. I had to downgrade to three stars as the wait time was just way too long. They took no reservation but you can call 30 minutes ahead of time to have your name put on the list. I called at 6:30 pm for a 7 pm dinner for four. I got there at 6:50 pm and the place was packed and there were people waiting at the lounge area where there are sofas and coffee tables. Around 7 pm three of us were there and they told us they didn't have a table so we waited till about 7:30 pm before we finally got seated. Even after we were seated and ordered foods it was more time waiting for our orders to arrive. We probably finally got our food at 8 pm; at least that was how late it felt. Oh and also during the time we were waiting for our table, I informed the front ladies a couple times all four of us were there. I got a snobby response from one lady: "Just because your name is on the list does not mean that you have priority over these people waiting here". I was a little taken back by that as we had been there since before 7 pm so were definitely before "these people" that she was pointing to. I knew who came after us, duh! I read many times how other fellow Yelpers described the downtown Palo Alto restaurants as "snobby" or "pretentious". This restaurant is right by Stanford University and I so NOT wanted to judge them by their location but could not help but feel that way about both the restaurant crews and the patrons dining there. I got the same thing, the Mahogany Salmon salad ($16) for a lighter fair. It was as good as I had expected. The salmon was tender, juicy and tasty. The arugula salad with golden beets was perfect too. One girl ordered the Dreamy Mushroom Pizza which is vegetarian and has a thin crust with good mushroom flavor. Another girl ordered the low carb steak tacos which was very very light and suitable for her strict diet that week. Even though everyone was happy with their dishes, I think I probably would only go there for lunch not dinner as I'm not into waiting for a LONG time to eat dinner; unless it's a really high end restaurant like the French Laundry or something that's worth waiting for such a long time.

Only been here for brunch: their burger is great, their eggs are great (although I guess they're no longer sourced from Neil Young's egg farm) and their coffee is good. ?Wait staff is excellent although occasionally a bit too chatty especially early in the morning when I'm only half awake. AVOID the hot food items and salads from the take-out shop next door though...I don't know why (since presumably they come from the same kitchen) but they're horrible! ?A take-away chicken pot pie was probably the worst I've ever had! ?In fact, gotta take a star off, since Yelp! doesn't separate out the take-away place from the restaurant.

Second time around, this time in the main restaurant part. ?Once again, entered without much greeting, nearly got run over by the girl refilling waters. ?Granted, maybe she didn't see me, particularly as she didn't apologize or flinch, but I think as part of the service staff, you should be more aware of your surroundings. Conceptually, I love the menu, with lots of more creative options, good plays on traditional things (a modernized shrimp and grits, the David Chang burger with kimchee and a fried egg, etc), and I appreciate the full page of vegetarian options (try the tofu lentil load with miso gravy!). ?They do vegetables and sides well, especially the spiced garlic fries. ?They do have daily specials, but one of my pet peeves is when the price of the items is not revealed when they're presented to you, as it's not always the most appropriate situation to inquire in front of everyone. Drinks are interesting, with lots of juice and fruit options on top of a limited cocktail list, wine, and beer. ?I'm not quite sure on how I feel about the lack of diet coke, as I know they pride themselves in their house made agave sodas, but sometimes I still like my diet soda. The inside is bustling, but the outdoor patio seating is nice. ?Food isn't cheap, but you're in a premium location. It's unfortunate that well executed food can be canceled out by the rest of the service. ?Maybe they should shift the focus more to the front of the house.

Why it's taken me so long to review Calafia boggles my mind. My friends and I were here the first night they were open, and I've had a few meals and market shopping visits since then. Chef Ayers is a super nice guy and always takes time to say hi to you when he's there. I like that he also offers things like quinoa pasta for my friends who have glutten allergies. Chicken sausage and eggs, duck dumplings, drumettes, shirt ribs and steak are some of our goto's. It's been a while, I think it's time for a revisit!

Calafia is a pretty trendy restaurant. ?I especially like the hand washing station and bathroom layout. ?I judge a lot of places by their bathrooms and this one is high on the list. ?As for food, I got the Wolfgang Pizza which was tasty. ?Kinda fancy and $$ for a pizza but ended up making for good leftovers. ?Service was friendly and fast.

I could be wrong but I think the story behind this place is that the former executive chef at Google opened this place. It's a very modern restaurant where you can actually order from the menu through a gadget. I never have done that because I enjoy interacting with the waiters and asking questions. They have a very unique menu that is very healthy and also something that vegetarians can order from. The staff is downright friendly and very easy to talk to. As a beer drinker they have just an average selection of beers. However, their wine selection is one of the best that I've seen outside of a winery and a wine bar. You have to try their sangria! It's a must. As my friend put it, "It's one of the best sangria's I had".

"Soup Nazi" is in Palo Alto! We had a group dinner in Calafia on a weekday, we made a reservation for 7:30pm but had to wait for more than 50 minutes before being seated. This was really bad since some of the attendants had other plans for the rest of the night so they had to miss most of the dinner. We were offered two appetizers for this inconvenient, which was rather disappointing given that they weren't even enough for the group... (and when I checked the menu, they were the cheapest ones as well!) When we asked politely for a different compensation, we were treated with a surprising rage attack from the owner of the place, telling us to go f*** ourselves out of his place! And yes, he did repeat the F word multiple times... I was shocked and embarrassed, I have never experienced any such offensive, disgraceful "service". Clearly the owner has some issues, but as a paying customer I shouldn't be his target. If being humiliated in front of a full restaurant is not your thing, I'd advice to consider other places...

I imagine that this place is so crowded because the people here are so enamored with the chic decor and weird furniture that they don't really care how the food tastes or how much it costs. For me, it's all about the food, and the food gets 1 star. The $11 duck dumplings (all 4 of them) were completely devoid of taste. Even the dipping sauce had no taste. Very disappointing. The $10 Chicken Drumettes were bland and inauthentic. The $16 lamb burger was shockingly bad. I ordered the lamb medium, and they absolutely killed it. Not only was it completely overcooked to the point of being well-done, they kept on cooking it until it burned, and it had a charred burnt taste that was border-line inedible. The lamb was so dry that it was hard to eat. It had absolutely no flavor or seasoning. Not even salt or pepper. I had to put ketchup on it to make it palatable, and I never put ketchup on hamburgers. For $16, this lamb was inexcusably bad. The chef must have no respect for his customers to serve this kind of crap. Their food sucks.

This review is for brunch... I came in with high expectations. That may have been my first problem. We were sat at the counter, where we could see the back of the house/kitchen. That is definitely my second problem. Tiny issues: 1. I saw toast dropped on the floor, picked up, and put back on a plate to be served. 2. I saw a girl go from texting to dipping her hand into the fruit salad bucket to grab some fruit salad and put into a bowl. She then wiped her hand on her (not so clean) towel. Ewww. We ordered the duck confit pizza and blue cheese/chicken salad. The pizza was great, though a bit cold, as it waited about 15 minutes on the pass to come to us. The salad was bland, and did not come with blue cheese (a little surprised, given the name)? We then, on their recommendation, got the sticky toffee pudding for dessert. If I wanted cold sticky toffee pudding, I would have went to Whole Foods. Theirs was better (cheaper too!) and at least I could heat it up in the microwave. It wouldn't have been so dry either. It was very hard to get a waitress to come to our seats, though at the beginning we had two ask for our drink orders....and never saw either after that. I would recommend the pizza. That's about it. ?I don't think I'll be back.

The Market A Go Go has some of the best coffee I've ever had. They use the famous Clover machine (now owned by Starbucks), but the beans they use take it to another level. I've had both Starbucks Clover and Calafia Clover and there is absolutely no comparison (Starbucks tends to over-roast their beans). I wish I could remember the name of the beans they use, but all I remember is that it's a local type from Santa Cruz.

We visited Calafia for a surprise "Yay, you're engaged and we love you, you cool couple" dinner for friends. Our largish group was accommodated pretty well and the service was good. My boy and I split a mushroom pizza (heavenly) and steak tacos (tasty, but hard to eat because of the lettuce "tortilla"). I also had a bloody mary, which was quite strong, but otherwise a bit unimpressive. Overall, a fun experience!

I was treated to a wonderful birthday dinner here and the food was terrific! Such a bay area gem! I got to share and enjoy the veggie tempura and the duck dumplings. I had the lamb burger for my entree with a glass of red wine. After all that we ordered dessert to share as well. The banana split is to die for. Everything was fantastic. Amazing experience.

Met with my high-school friend here at Palo Alto and we found this place at the Town & Country Shopping Center. We had already had dinner so we were looking for a place to chat even more and came across Calafia Cafe which presented a nice, warm, chic atmosphere. We went in, the ambiance was great, the menu was ok but fancy. Their cocktails and drinks were somewhat arranged in their own special way, but still good. Their menu catered to both "meat eaters" and "plant eaters" and had vegan and gluten free menus as well. I thought that was generous. Something for everyone.

I am told by a friend that this is the place where our late Apple CEO, Steve Jobs dined at. ?Given that, I was at awed and looked forward to dining here, given the foodie and Apple products lover that I am. It is literally in the heart of the Town and Country plaza off of Embarcadero in Palo Alto. ?I went by here several occasions when I went for a check up with my doctor here awhile back. ?Lets just say, it is always chaos coming in and out of the plaza. ?Cars are just inconsiderate with pedestrians and pedestrians don't really know what the meaning of yielding when a car is backing up or parking. ? Fortunately with my luck, I was able to find a parking space right away. ?It was packed and once again, we were able to be seated immediately at the counter. ?I actually like the counter, because there is a coat rack as well as a rack for your purse underneath the table. ?Plus there is a lot of leg rooms and you are right front and center where it all begins... I looked at the menu, and saw chicken and waffles. ?This must be a must-have dish. ?I noticed they cranked out this dish every few minutes. ?And my eating companion had the combo which comprised of scrambled egg with spinach, a side of hash brown and your choice of bread. ?Mine came out looking delectable with the waffles looking on the crispier side like I want yet very disappointed that the chicken weren't what I am used to. ?They were lightly battered but not golden crispy and apparently no taste. ?It was quite moist but yet again, after two bites, no chicken...ugh!!! Overall, a happening place to be if you are into the whole organic, natural and healthy eating, ?It is not my cup of tea but I will definitely give this place another try. ?Just no chicken and waffles for me.

Gluten Free Friendly! Calafia has some truly wonderful dishes. ?The Super Salad (kale, quinoa, feta, cranberries, lemon juice) is probably one of my favorite restaurant salads ever. ?The BBQ Pork bowl and spinach dragon noodle bowl were also delicious, though to my taste they needed a bit of salting. ?Overall, the food is wonderful. ?I love the fresh high quality ingredients and the dishes showcase these features. ? The environment is warm and inviting. ?There are quite a few communal tables and bars, which may not be everyone's preference when dining, but there are a number of individual tables as well. ?There is one server I have had repeatedly there who seems to just exude warmth. ?He is very attentive and manages to always make the specials sound like must try items. ? For vegetarians, vegans, and those with dairy or gluten intolerance, this place is great. ?The menu is well marked for all of these different dietary needs. ?Don't worry, if you are a meat eater, there are plenty of options for you too. So why not five stars? ?I find the place to be a bit overpriced. ?I have started making my own version of the super salad at home since I find theirs to be a bit expensive at $14 for a smallish salad. ?I'm always kind of surprised at how expensive the total bill seems to get when you add in a drink or a side. ?I think that because of the communal tables and casual atmosphere it feels like it should be a less expensive spot, but it really is more of a nice meal out kind of place.

My husband is a tech geek and we have tried to love Calafia but it has not been working out. We have visited Calafia twice for dinner. Both times we were extremely disappointed. The food is simply not good for the price and the service is too slow and impersonal to make up for it. We went for dinner tonight and were told it would be a twenty minute wait. It was over an hour until we were seated, each time we asked for an update we were treated rudely and we never received an apology for the delay. I had the halibut special, which was too bland to eat more than half. My husband had the hanger steak, which was about 4 oz or a small, palm size portion. His plate was 2/3 fries. My husband eats fairly healthy and was disappointed to see the chefs expected him to fill up on fatty fries instead of giving him a reasonable sized steak. To give you a comparison, the food at Hobbes is better. However, I have heard lunch is decent, but dinner is a no go. Goodbye Calafia, you won't be missed.

I recently had a wonderful experience with Calafia, from start to finish. ?I had a large group (12 ladies) for a brunch engagement celebration. ?Making the reservation was a breeze (unlike my horrific experience at Mayfield, which I will detail in a separate review). ?The guy on the phone was polite and professional. ? I arrived early for the reservation and was greeted warmly by the receptionist. ?I sat in the waiting area. ?After a few minutes, a server brought me a glass of iced water! ?Very considerate and classy. ?The restaurant allowed us to place vases of fresh flowers on the tables. During our brunch, our server was extremely attentive and polite. ?Every request was fulfilled immediately. ?The food was solid, I would say maybe a 7.5 or 8 out of 10. ?But what gets this place its 5 stars is definitely the stellar service. ?Our server even waived corkage, which we really appreciated (we had a few bottles of champagne :) I did read the other reviews and don't quite know what to think . . . I can only tell you about my experience, which was so exemplary . . . many of the other guests at my brunch remarked that they will definitely be return customers because they were so impressed.

I've been here twice and each time was with a vegetarian friend of mine, once for dinner and once for brunch. Both times we each loved our food. Brunch was by far my favorite. I would stick to beer, mimosas, or sangria as their cocktails are not made with liquor, but some kind of agave or sake type alcohol, which I personally didn't care for, but to each his own. Loved it.

I had a great first time experience at Calafia. We called ahead to get on the wait list (since it was a week night and they don't take reservations on week nights) and were seated immediately when we arrived. I hear it can be pretty busy on the weekends. ?It would definitely be a nice place to go on a date. ? The service was a little slow, but our server was very helpful and friendly. ?I ordered the "Vegan Love Plate" and it was really delicious. ?My husband enjoyed his food too. ? I didn't find the servers or hostesses rude or particularly unfriendly like some of the other commenters have noted. ?However, I wasn't at the restaurant during a very busy time so that might make a difference.

Came here on a whim while running errands with the wifey in Palo Alto. First off, the decor and layout of the restaurant is great. ?The steel, wood and cement gives the place a really clean but warm atmosphere. ?The open kitchen is what your eyes will instantly gravitate towards when you walk in, as will the small market place the restaurant feeds into. ?The dress attire is casual. I had the Crimson Quinoa Salad which is described as "beet infused golden quinoa with red currants, lemon ?zest, parsley, shaved roasted beets, wild arugula, ?basil citrus vinaigrette." ? ***peep the photo link above*** The dish is served cold which was a bit of a surprise, especially when considering how long it took to get out to me (I'm guessing it's premade and just pulled out of the cooler). ?It was fresh and actually very filling. ?I didn't even finish the dish. I also got a side of the bacon studded waffle. ?It wasn't as tasty as it sounded on the menu, but fresh and nonetheless pretty good. Let's jump into The GOOD STUFF: - I'm impressed with their menu as there seems to be a lot of variety and fresh takes on traditional items. ?That alone makes me want to come back and explore the menu. - Your coffee is served fresh in a press pot individually.... - They offer Sugar/Stevia in the Raw... - Friendly wait-staff... - They have a communal type restroom sink which sort of shames people into washing their hands (which is a good thing)... The NOT SO GOOD: - The service, while friendly, seemed unecessarily slow. ?We waited a long time to get our initial drinks (coffee & ice tea), as well as for our bill.... - The hostess welcomed you with a 1000-yard stare... OVERALL: ?Definitely a place worth peeping. ?Looks like a fun joint to go with a large party. Try it. ?Eat with confidence.

Not worth the money. Went here for brunch hoping to test out their new tablet ordering system. First disappointment, they don't use it during brunch. We thought the menu was interesting, especially the lamb sausages. Second disappointment, they were out of lamb sausage. At a new restaurant I like to see how well they do soft-boiled eggs, as it isn't easy. Third disappointment, they don't do soft-boiled. I had a $16 eggs benedict variation which was 'ok' at best. My gf had the biscuits and gravy and I will say the biscuits were really good, fluffy with crisp edges. That was really the only part of the meal worth note. We were given a discount on our meal due to the disappointments mentioned above, but even then it was almost a $40 brunch for two. I do appreciate the thought and will say this, if you're a vegetarian or vegan, or don't like dairy, or can't tolerate gluten, and want a creative menu, you might just like this place.

Had a nice brunch here one Saturday morning. It didn't take too long to get a table, which is always nice. I had a leek and goat cheese scramble with an English muffin, and my dining partner the fennel panini. Generally well done, although I didn't love the spicing of the housemade ketchup. Recommended.

I am always welcomed with a smile at Calafia and that is the best way to start a beautiful meal. They have seasonal menues that always blow me (a very picky vegetarian) and my fiance (a man who loves a good meat shank) away. I've never left feeling less than elated which is probably why I am always popping by. Calafia is such a treasure and just like Chef Charlie and every single member of his terrific team!

A place I would go to only if my friends suggested it. ?It has a nice vibe to it. ?Very Californian in a green-trendy sort of what if you get what I mean. ?Good place to go in groups, especially if you like to give the appearance of eating healthily ;) The food itself is not that great though. ?I had the chicken and waffles, and it was okay. ?Prices are higher than the food quality would deserve, and the Cafe falls right in my dreaded category of the "$15-20 that definitely does not taste half as good as a nice $50 meal and definitely does not taste twice as good as ?cheap $7 meal" ?(I really hate spending $15-20 for mediocre food. ?Go cheap or go expensive or go home!)

I really love this restaurant. It really is fresh and unique. A casual dining cafe specializing in organic, high flavor cuisines from around the world. Calafia Caf¨¦ is one of my go to places, especially sine they offer a wide variety of gluten-free items.

There are Some good dishes here but recently I learned that their grass fed beef claim is a lie. This disappoints me greatly. Next time you are in there ask them where the Never Ever ranch is. And I agree with Bonnie H about the unsanitary metal curtains! What are those doing there! Also, is it just me or do some of these very detailed overly complimentary reviews sound like a PR department wrote them or possibly someone was paid to write them? ?Especially the ones written by people who just signed up recently and only have one review. ?Just seems odd to me... Went back recently, asked about the "grass fed" was enthusiastically told by the waiter that everything there is 100% grass fed, yet the facts seem to contradict this claim... Which is it Calafia? ?We just want to be able to trust your food!

I read about this place in a story about Steve Jobs. Since I was in the area, I wanted to come by and sample the ambiance. Well, the food turned out to be pretty good. I came for a light lunch so I orders the soup and a salad. I ordered the soup of the day, a split pea and ham soup. It is not like a traditional split pea soup. It's more like a veggie soup in a pea pur¨¦e with real bit of ham. A wonderful medley of taste and texture. For the salad, I ordered the Spicy Duck salad. It's a chopped cabbage salad with warm pulled tender duck pieces, carrot slivers, crispy noodles, spring onions, roasted sesame, all tossed in a light spicy dressing. Very fresh ingredients and excellent service. Creative paring of ingredients with sauces that does not overwhelm the natural tastes. The menu has one side for vegetarians and one side for the meat eaters. I will need to come back for dinner to give it a more thorough review.

This is for the cafe. The restaurant may be much better. Burrito: completely average. Not inedible, but not at all great. Price and quantity: Good deal for the area. Ambience: Below average. The smell of grease hangs annoyingly heavy in the air (broken exhaust?). The physical layout is a little confusing. The menu hanging on the wall is in small print - good for high-school students, maybe ... In some midwestern airport, I might be delighted to find a place like Calafia, but in the Town & Country Village ... there are just too many other attractive choices.

My boss just took me here for lunch (for my first but not last) time. OMG. I was amazed!! First of all, they have an ENTIRE vegetarian menu, which has lots of vegan options. If you're vegetarian/vegan, you know it's not always easy to find a place with lots of options. Most of the vegan places around here are Asian-food themed. Calafia has a wide variety of food options that I would call "California-fare" - everything from grain bowls, to pizzas and sandwiches and salads. Anyway, I was super stoked to see such an awesome menu. I ordered the Dreamy Mushroom Pizza and my boss got the Lexi's French Lentil Bowl. Both were...uh-mazing!! We sat at the bar and really enjoyed watching all the food being prepared. Everything was super fresh and the service was crazy fast for a very busy lunch hour. My boss also got a fresh juice...I think it was called "Beet Generation" - which was pretty awesome. Not a lot of places offer fresh vegetable juices and they have a lot that sound really good too! Rarely do I go somewhere once and give it 5 stars, but I was really impressed with the food, presentation, ambiance and service at Calafia. I'm already planning to go back tomorrow night with my boyfriend. Hopefully everything is just as good tomorrow!!

This place seems ok after one visit. Yes that's right, just "ok". The ambiance is nice, cozy, warm, not too noisy. While it's low key, it's still very inviting and has some character. The place is in an outdoor mall, which also is very inviting. The food was slightly disappointing. I had a salmon salad, my wife had yellow chicken curry. I tasted her's as well. Both were ok tasty, but the three stars are primarily due to the food. We also shared duck dumplings for appetizer, and those were the best part of the meal. If the food was better, I'd give four stars. Give the reasonable prices and nice ambiance & the surrounding, we'll go again, for breakfast, or to grab a burger or something. For a truly great dinner, we will look for something else.

Okay, this is REALLY kind of messed up on my part. You want to know honestly how I found out about this place?? Well so one night I was bored, watching the news online, *click here, chick there* ::yawn:: What's this?? "Steve Jobs video coming out of restaurant showing weak strength" (This was after Steve had passed away) Saddened by watching the video, I then wondered where they had just come from. Oh yeah I'm going there, you guessed it. I'm such a douche sometimes, I actually zoomed in, looked very closely at the door and saw that it was Calafia. Intrigued now I googled it, found the website, location, yelp reviews....you name it. So as screwy as this sounds, on my initial trip to Palo Alto I had made it a pact to check this place out while I was here. I figured hey, if it's good enough for Steve Jobs it's sure as hell good enough for me. Boy was the Apple genus at it again, the flavors here were amazing, fresh and the vibe was VERY pleasant (granted I only had a club sandwich due to the line) but, it just goes to show you some people REALLY know their stuff in life, call me a follower but when in Rome... Definitely a place I will add to my regulars.

We came as a large group of 10 for Sunday brunch. The deco was nice. You could see the kitchen area, there was a bar and tv and like an updated modern industrial feel. I really liked the restroom layout. Separate toilets for men and women and same sink area. Saves space and looks great! Now on to the food. I ordered the Croque Madame and I was not too impressed with the sandwich. It tasted sweet like dessert sweet. I had to ask for mustard which was strong horseradish mustard, and piled it on like there was no tomorrow. However, I did like the salad on the side. The dressing was light and refreshing. I did see some other items on the menu to try for next time. I also thought this place was a couple of dollars on the expensive side. I am not sure the reason for that..

This is a great place. We had a wonderful meal and have been several times. I really appreciate that all the meals manage to be innovative, yet wholesome, tasty but not loaded with calories AND NO bad stuff. I had the Ahi special, it was the best Ahi I have ever eaten, tender, seared nicely the sauce was citrusy, spicy with cilantro, and matched the fish perfectly. The banana spilt with Rick's rather rich ice cream was sinful, and the banana was carmelized like Bananas Foster, caramel, fudge .... I didn't want to eat it all but I did. The servers were great helping us decide between 5 "must-have" meals... I'll go back for the Pork. I have enjoyed the Chicken Curry w Quinoa and Pizzas. I feel happy to eat here, I know that Chef Charlie Ayers is making CERTAIN that the food is great, tasty, well-prepare, local, organic and quite simply THE BEST. Anything on the ?menu will be a good choice.

Valentine's Day is over rated, so I bought myself a mini cake from heaven. My friend was talking about a "hostess" type cake that was so moist and delicious that I had to buy one immediately after our walk at the Stanford Dish Trail. Walking in, there was a salad bar and cold/hot food area where you can buy food for take-out. We walked straight to the coffee and pastry section. The Calafia cake looked like a double stacked Hostess cake and was amazing! Why 4 stars? The guy helping us didn't seem so happy to be there, but charging $5 for a mini cake, shouldn't he have at least a smile?

While generally tasty, I disagree with the claim that it will appeal to students and parents looking for affordable fare (ok, maybe if you have household incomes to afford a house in Palo Alto...). The prices here are more like SF prices; for $15, I recently had a decent vegan pizza for lunch that was much smaller than an equivalently priced pizza from Delfina Pizzeria in SF, possibly my favorite pizza joint (to be fair, the lunch pizza had more elaborate toppings but Delfina just tastes better in general). It's kind of funny watching the streams of students walk on by this place during their lunch hour. Still, it's nice to see that Chef Charlie appears to be running a successful shop.

We were excited to try this place after the first attempted visit met it was unexpectedly closed. The menu, for vegans, is exciting--variety, healthy options, color! Ultimately it was very "Palo Alto"--really well put together, nice to look at and well cooked, but not a lot of flavor. Service was also good--food came out quickly even though the place was packed pre-Stanford game, and they actually pre-split our entrees when we said we planned to share them --but it was a little confusing to have both table service and the little touchscreen where you could send your order directly to the kitchen. Rundown of dishes tried: * Calafia Sprouted Salad had great texture and super-fresh ingredients, but was woefully underseasoned and lacking acid. I think to veganize it they only used olive oil, no vinegar or lemon? Despite what the menu said. * Tofu Lentil Loaf had a really nice consistency, with a creamy cauliflower puree and mushroom gravy. Unfortunately, the gravy was the most flavorful thing, and it just felt like it needed a tiny bit more salt. * Pizza with their almond "ricotta," red onions, cremini mushrooms, yams, and crispy kale. Another salt casualty with awesome texture. The creminis had great flavor but you only got it in small doses. The 'cheese' is similar to one I make at home for my own pizza, but usually I throw in some basil or sun-dried tomatoes or lemon juice and nutritional yeast because it can be a little bland. This was a little bland. * Vegan Chocolate Tofu Mousse Cake (I couldn't find the dessert menu on the site, but it's the only vegan dessert) -- I honestly didn't want to order dessert, but my boyfriend, who's usually not a sweets person, really wanted to try it. Who am I to say no to chocolate? This was the clear winner of the night. Chocolate desserts can suffer from being too sweet or too rich, and this was neither. In fact, it might be one of the better chocolate desserts I've had in a restaurant--it really celebrated the bitterness of good chocolate, not aggressively so, but just so you weren't feeling like all you got was sugar and cocoa. The caramel garnish was pointless (I love a raspberry coulis with stuff like this; the tartness would've been awesome), but otherwise, we were close to licking the plate. Also, the iced tea was good. Had a pleasant herbaceous edge to it. It's a little thing, but I like good iced tea. Our total pre-tip was $66. We were full, but that's not really a cheap date for us. I'd go back (and maybe try some of the less healthy options, since other reviews indicate they're winners), though price-wise I could probably go to Millennium in SF for a better fancy-ish vegan dinner (if ordering judiciously, anyway).

Things I tried during my 2 brunch trips: Scrambled eggs: nom nom nom just the right texture, and nice and moist. One time they were on the salty side, but just right the second time. Lamb sausage: uhhh, I'm not sure why I got this since I don't like lamb. Maybe I thought it would convert me. Well, it didn't. Just can't deal with the gaminess. Bacon waffle: NEEDS MORE BACON. The bites I had with bacon were so delicious, offset with the lovely sweetness of maple syrup. The problem is that the plain waffle (the parts with no bacon) has kind of a lackluster texture (very light and crispy, not hearty like a good wholesome waffle) and bland flavor. English muffins: housemade! Good texture and not too hard or dry. Hash browns: pretty good. Not mind blowing, but I can't complain! Crispy on the outside, mushy and potatoey on the inside. Throw some salt and pepper on there for extra oomph. Vegan chocolate cheesecake: aahhhhh a rich way to tend a meal. Soy-based chocolate "cheesecake" had good texture and flavor, and the caramel drizzle was excellent. Okay, go eat! Bon app¨¦tit.

I have been there twice for dinner. The food is delicious and the servers arefriendly, kind and attentive, but not leg humpers like other places. The veggie burger is a winner, as are the fish dishes and the panninis. The reason for four stars is that things are a bit pricey for what you are getting.

A couple of years ago, my friend brought me here for lunch & it was wonderful. So much so, that on my way to work one day...I wanted breakfast (they were doing that back then). Lovely food, special. It has been awhile & I'd wanted to go back & did: for breakfast & learned at that time, they don't do breakfast anymore. Heartbroken, I went over to Peets. Flashforward: yesterday while running errands, I had the hankering for something special & thought of: Calafia! Yay! I will say that the service is wonderful, kudos to these folks. The seating needs attention as I needed several flat pillows to be able to somewhat comfortably eat at the window bar I was given (so I am not trying to eat shoulder's up & I'm 5'4"). Yum I thought to myself, this will be top shelf: Oh, so disappointingly NOT. I chose the lamb burger & deconstructed it to try & determine what about it wasn't right. It was good, just not wonderful. I think it was the lamb. So, it was as I told the waiter, "good". (In my book this means nothing to rave about.) ?The fries, so sad: lackluster & soggy. I also told this to the waiter & hopefully the message was forwarded. Did they make it right by offering to correct the sad, soggy fries? Nah & this was so not good for the $$. So here's the deal: I had free water & a lamb burger with fries = $17.32 not including tip. For this experience, I have no plans on ever returning since there are so many other options in this food haven area that include great service, food & organic too.

I want so badly to love this place. You walk in, the hostess seats you wherever she damn well pleases. ?She hands you a menu-- and if you're a vegetarian, you have the extremely rare excitement of an entire page of choices. ?If you're a meatatarian, guess what: you have the same joy. You choose your order from a touch screen pad that has mouth-watering food photography of all of the menu options. ?It also allows for game-playing while you wait. ?A real, live server also comes by to double-check your order. ?You order the super salad, while your mom gets the lamb burger. ?You check for a diet coke in the beverage category on the touch pad... You are disappointed. Nevertheless, you wait for your food to be ready. ?You watch as your super salad is prepared, then placed on a table two feet from you ready to be delivered. You watch your mother's lamb burger get burnt and tossed, and started over. ?You wait, and wait, and no one comes to apologize for the delay. ?The games on the touch pad start to repeat themselves. Eventually the food is delivered, and it's pretty good! ?The dinosaur kale on the super salad was a little bitter at first, and took some getting used to... And having olive oil as the only dressing didn't help with that. ?Once you got to the good stuff, the feta and walnuts, it was very good, though. My mom's lamb burger was good, but the real hit were the housemade pickles and homemade ketchup. ?The ketchup was sweet, which I guess isn't for everyone, but it was 100% for me! The other thing to note is that while the restaurant is pretty expensive (about $15 an entree), the market next door has sandwiches for $3 and other affordable to-go things. ?I'm moving there in two weeks. ?I really hope my next experience will justify becoming a regular, because the concept is so incredible!! The execution needs a little work, though.

Have been here twice recently. The first time was for brunch. I got the eggs chiapas without bacon and with poached eggs instead of fried. The tostada and eggs were super delishh. I wish the rojo sauce had a little more spice to it, but I asked for some hot sauce and it did the trick. Sad to say, the bloody mary was kind of sub-par. It was grainy and didn't have good fixings in it which I think its a great way to judge a good bloody mary. Next time I want to get the Blue Max but sub the ham for avocado or mushrooms. The second time I came was for dinner. The papas con ajo were amazing. They reminded me of a slender cut version of the garlic fries and giants games except they had a great spice rub on them. And, I got them with a side of ranch which was just excellent. The rock cod tostada was tasty. It was the same rojo sauce as the chiapas, but the cod was cooked perfectly. I also had a great mojito with my food. Will definitely be back.

The best food in Palo Alto! ?As a new resident of the area, I am so glad that I stumbled upon Calfia. ?I take everyone here when they visit from out of town. ?The chicken curry is amazing, the pizza is to die for and I am in love with the super salad. ? They make all their own sauces, dressings and sparkling water there in the restaurant, so every thing is fresh and has a unique flavor. Plus most of it is organic. ?They have great options for meat eaters and vegetarians. ? My husband is a big fan of the cheeseburger. ?Even brunch was a fabulous! ?

Excellent veggie options. ?Very convenient to walk from work and options to sit outside on a nice day. ?Three coworkers and I came here recently on a Monday for a lunch celebration and sat outside at a communal table. Seats aree not so comfortable but the food was delicious. ?We started with cold soba noodles and tofu lettuce cups. ?I had the spinach salad with grapefruit sections and beets. ?Others had fish tacos, super salad (with kale, looked mighty poopalicious but too inedible for me) and the pork salad. Everyone declared their contentment with the meal. ?Expensive for a lunch. Good service; prompt and pleasant.

Calafia is an organic restaurant/cafe started by the former head chef at Google. As such, the menu here has an earthy and healthy touch to it, with a dash of sophistication. It also has a full vegetarian menu (of which about 50% is vegan and labeled as such). I came with a mixed group of colleagues and, while the restaurant pleased most people, the vegetarians and vegans were largely unimpressed. For an appetizer I had the tofu lettuce cup ($10) which was dry and bland. The tofu needed to be cooked more, and diced up with a better variety of vegetables. For my main course I had a yellow curry noodle with tofu ($12) that promised to be spicy, but wasn't at all. It, too, was dry and just didn't hit the right savory notes. Had this dish been sauteed with onions it might have been slicker and more satisfying; even the addition of fresh diced tomatoes would have enhanced this dish significantly. Normally I would give a place with this food quality two stars, but I'm upping it to three only because Palo Alto (especially the Town and Country Mall, where Calafia is located) doesn't have enough vegan options, and Calafia does provide a fair amount. It also has nice ambiance and service, as well as one vegan baked good. I'm willing to give Calafia another shot, maybe for brunch next time, but the food here left me wanting more.

I've been to Calafia for a salad from the market, dinner, and brunch, all within the last week. ?The dinner was standout- 5 stars! The market was 4, and brunch was 3. For dinner, I had the pork rice bowl. ?The spinach was perfectly cooked, not overdone. The pork was very tender. Overall delicious!! We had the garlic fries to start, also amazing with the homemade ketchup. At the market, I took a trip through their salad bar. Pretty good as far as salad bars go, I like the options for things like carrot salad or cous cous salad. ? The brunch was somewhat disappointing. First of all, the coffee was mediocre, sort of acidic/sour tasting. ?I did like that you french press at your table. The brunch options are fun, I had the tofu scramble. It was pretty dry, I think a yogurt sauce or something would go well with it. ?The dish came with sides of potatoes and toast- they were super plain and it was kindof carb overload. ?I had to ask for ketchup twice, I don't know why that wouldn't come with plain hashbrowns automatically. Overall a nice ambiance, and very convenient location. I'm sure I'll be back for dinner/ a quick lunch at the market!

We stopped by for brunch and was sadly disappointed. The whole meal was bland, poorly presented, and edible at best (i.e., the apple-smoked bacon that came with one of the dishes was hard, greasy, and almost cold by the time it got to our table--same goes with most of the meal). The service was horrible and slow. Items were forgotten and mis-ordered (i.e., we got charged for an item that wasn't even ordered). One of the waiters was incredibly condescending and rude.

3.5 stars * The food Tofu lettuce cups - good not great. Don't really recommend these Duck dumplings - did not have that soft dim sum dumpling texture and the duck quality was good not great Fish tacos special - fantastic. Excellent quality fish, good portion size. But expensive, $16 for 3 tacos. Tart tartin (apple with ice cream) dessert - excellent ice cream but not made in house. A bit on the small side * Service Solid. Waiter knew his stuff and was pretty attentive. * Prices A bit on the egregious side for lunch to be honest. You will not walk out of here full without spending less than $25 which quite frankly is steep for a lunch in Palo Alto (Tamarine has the $18 power lunch, Evvia has the chicken souvlaki for $17 for example for what I would argue is better food). The menu is vast with tons of choices for vegetarians and vegans, and the ingredients themselves are nice and fresh. But for the prices and the overall missing oomph or wow factor of the food, this nets out a bit in the middle of the road for me. Extra half star since the fish tacos were just that good.

I went with my girlfriends. I've lived in the area for a long time, but it was my first time. The ambiance was actually quiet pleasant. It's very "Californian," very "Palo Alto" with the hip, chic, modern feel. I must admit, I thank you my friend who came in early because the wait was just ridiculous for just a so so not so interesting menu offering in the restaurant. I ordered the low carb hanger steak tacos. Basically, instead of using tortilla, you get fresh lettuce as the taco shell, so it's like eating asian wraps at a chinese restaurant.. not very inventive but it was ok. The plate came with 3 tacos. The "sauce" was a mixture of olive oil, chopped ginger and cilantro. There wasn't really a flavor (no salt) in the sauce but I think because the hanger steak was already marinated and was flavorful. It was actually pretty good BUT my only complain was that the server seemed to be lacking in knowledge about the dish (or unless she just lied to me to try to sell the food!). I was in a very strict diet that day and I was not supposed to eat sugary stuff. I asked her what the hanger steak was marinated in before I placed my order and I asked her if there was "sugar" in it or if the sauce that they used had sugar in it. The waitress said "no sugar" BUT as I was eating my taco it was so so so so obvious that they marinated the meat in a soy sauce based (some kind of teriyaki sauce) and sugar because the steak was sweet and I can tell it was sugary sweet and not meaty sweet! It wasn't too much of a big deal BUT I think with the niche (healthy, fresh, organic, natural) that they are in, their servers have to be more educated. People around here (and I bet those who come to this restaurant) have their own "special" dietary restrictions and the servers should be more sensitive about that! Also, I asked my meat to be medium rare, the steak came out more like medium well. The meat was still tender so I didn't complain, but don't promise anything unless you could fulfill it! I would like to come back to try more of their food. The prices are quiet high, to be honest, BUT the food was fresh and has higher quality for sure. Although, not sure if it was their food or something else.. I had to rush to the bathroom as soon as I got home....weird?! (sorry hope not too much info)

I have been here about four times. I really like the shaking beef salad (nice meat, excellent combination of arugula + mint as the base of the salad). I like sitting right next to the kitchen, and the staff are friendly and helpful - including the chef Charlie Ayers who is standing right there and happily talks to you. I also quite liked the Brick Chicken salad. Less impressed by the Papas Con Ajo (garlic fries) which smell amazingly good but only taste ok. On the expensive side for a lunch place, but worth a try.

Went to Calafia for the first time tonight and came away from dinner with mixed feelings about the place. I was irritated by the fact that the restaurant doesn't take reservations. I called 30 minutes ahead of time to put my party of 3 on the "waiting list," but we still weren't able to be seated until 15 minutes after the time requested. I was also annoyed because I was absolutely CRAVING a diet coke (like never before in my life), but upon being seated I was unpleasantly surprised with the news that Calafia is above such artificial pleasures! Instead of being able to immediately order my favorite ubiquitous beverage, I stared in horror at a drink menu full of weird items such as "Bing Cherry All Natural Spritzer" and "Organic Gingerbeer." I tried the Bing Cherry drink and it wasn't good at all. ? To eat, I ordered the shaking beef salad and the soup of the day (chicken noodle). The shaking beef salad was extremely good and the meat was very delicious. The price was right too - just $17. After a delicious salad, I was excited to dive into my soup, which was beautifully presented in a ceramic cooking pot on a wooden tray. Unfortunately, the presentation of the soup far exceeded its taste. There were about 5 noodles in the soup and maybe 4 small chicken droppings. I essentially paid $5 for a small bowl of broth (but I'm sure it was organic!). My overall assessment of Calafia is that the place serves very good food at reasonable prices. However, the quality of the food simply cannot justify the restaurant's poor reservation system (or lack thereof). I'll never come back to Calafia for the simple reason that I'm just not willing to wait around indefinitely for a table. Additionally, our server was extremely friendly but largely inattentive. I had to ask for my water glass to be refilled... and even after I asked I had to wait about 8 minutes for someone to come and do it. Calafia also doesn't serve bread, but they lay small plates at each setting as though they do... And I'm still mad about not being able to enjoy a diet coke! i know this place is trying to be organic and healthy, but I'm pretty sure the bottle of Stella Artois at the table adjacent to ours contained a lot more toxins than the aspartame-laden beverage that I craved.

So my friends and I were sitting outside on their patio for lunch. My one friend had a paper cup of hot tea from Pete's Coffee. The waitress came up to us and told us that the owner didn't like to advertise "competitors" and took the paper cup away from her. The waitress said "Yeah, the owner is kinda weird like that". ?WTF??!! Aside from that awkward incident, the food is okay, but a bit pricey for the portion and quality. If you're looking for good, healthy eats in a casual ambiance with friendly service, I recommend LYFE Kitchen. I bet they won't take away your Pete's paper cup...

So I went to Calafia because I heard they have the new Presto tablets where you can order, play games, and check out from your seat. Cool stuff. We had a blast playing couples trivia, the sever was really attentive and sweet, and the food was quite good. ?Using the tablet to check out was super convenient and speedy too - love that! They use quality ingredients and they have interesting combinations you don't see everywhere else. I eat out so much that most menus are boring nowadays, but not Calafia. Their Sangria was really tasty with lots of fresh berries in it; also love that they carry bottled ginger beer - so good! We got the BoHo Pork Salad and Mahogany Salmon Salad. Both were excellent, fresh, and protein cooked spot-on. I got the BoHo and loved the textural combination of the pumpkin seeds and squash in the dish; I'm addicted. I'll definitely be back for more games & grub!

This listing is really for two related but distinct businesses. ?The "Market" (entrance to the right of the restaurant, which is much larger) deals in specialty packaged food products (some of them hard to find elsewhere) and ready-to-eat take-out food. ? Calafia incidentally is another acronym restaurant name (like CasCal and the late VivaCa Grill), ask chef for details. The restaurant, my main subject here, opened with fanfare when Charlie Ayers, publicly known as chef of Google's famous company cafeteria system, retired to open his own place. ?I've seen Ayers and chatted (we have mutual friends), and he was present in the restaurant often during my several visits so far, all lunches. ?The restaurant format answered a modern customer interest toward not just open kitchens but also, extensive intentional counter seating near them. ?(Compare Scratch in downtown Mountain View for another random example recently built.) Lunch dishes? ?Always breezy, creative, and with modern twists. ?Menu has varied week to week. ?Unusual hamburgers and creative salads. ?Wonderful individual-sized lunch entree pizzas with offbeat ingredients -- these in my experience were the best-made and most interesting pizzas in this corner of the county ?UNTIL "Howie" Bulka opened Howie's a short walk away, in the same retail complex, see comments I posted about that. The complex itself is all but unrecognizeable in its rebirth from the quiet Town-and-Country flat shopping plaza it had been for 50 years. ? The region was full of T&C's, most have been stripped out to make way for new things like Santana Row in SJ. My only complaint concerns the location, not Calafia. ?With replacement of sleepy modest retail businesses by slick upscale restaurants, luxury, and chain stores, traffic became heavier and more self-absorbed. ? Be wary of seeking parking spaces at crowded times, you may waste long minutes stuck behind nearsighted drivers of huge mini-vans and SUVs cruising for the perfect (i.e., far too small) "compact" space. ?This has been especially bad while sites in the complex were under construction, which reduced available parking.

I can think of few restaurants I visit where I look forward to ordering from the vegetarian menu. That is not a slight towards Calafia's meat menu. Charlie's pork buns, a recent addition to the menu, are inspired. His buns are so soft they'd make David Chang jealous and the pork, I can't tell whether its sous vide or braised, despite not providing a textural contrast, make me woozy with pleasure. He cuts the fat of the pork belly by serving it alongside a miso mayonnaise and habanero sauce. Don't be scared by the habaneros. They are spicy yes but in that hurts so good kinda way. Scrimshaw is served on tap (the pork buns and Scrimshaw are hand tailored for ?Saturday afternoon interludes) and Michael, the bartender, is perfect. He doesn't talk crap. If he likes a dish he says so. If he doesn't particularly care for a dish he says so. If he hasn't had a chance to taste a dish he says so. He is honest and being a former musician his palate seems to understand composition as much as flavor. The menu is organized by vegetarian dishes on the left and meat dishes on the right. Lexi's French Lentil Bowl and the Gluten Free Noodles are excellent. The Lentil bowl travels well but the Noodles should be eaten in house. The texture suffers when re-heated. However, most importantly they satisfy. Not just after eating them but in the way that animal protein satisfies. We've all been to sushi or vegetarian meals where thirty minutes post espresso we are hungry again. This doesn't occur with Charlie's veggie dishes. I recently went on a short rib binge across Palo Alto restaurants and tried them on every menu that carried it as a regular entree. The worst I had were served at Gravity, what happened to this place -- it used to be sooo good -- and the best I had were at Mayfield but only because of the accoutrements. The pickled mini onions, polenta and fresh horseradish I enjoyed with Mayfield's short ribs is a successful elevation of a classical preparation. The short rib itself is beautifully trimmed and correctly portioned. I don't even think what they serve at Gravity is a short rib. I say so because it has none of the intramuscular fat which gives short ribs its defining flavor and texture. I think they are either trying to cut cost or are straight up lying about the cut. Nonetheless Calafia's short rib foregoes classic sides for shorts ribs glazed with a demi-glace and served atop mashed potatoes. Simple satisfying elegance. While the short rib is an occasional indulgence the salmon is my go to. It's Loch Duart so its lean but Charlie is no fool. Those customers who order it well-done are for they lose the delicacy of the fish by ordering it medium-well to well-done. But Charlie knows Loch Duart salmon is lean and flavorful and benefits from being prepared medium. Personally I like mine medium rare. If you eat sushi this temperature shouldn't be a problem. The seaweed and quinoa are PERFECT sides. The addition of seaweed is inspired. The roasted chicken is also wonderful. For those in the know call ahead and have Michael set one aside from you. People drive from as far as 45 minutes away for them and I've heard that customers have almost come to blows over getting the last one. I have, in fact, been quite upset (upset enough to complain/whine to a manager :) upon arriving and discovering none left. If you miss out here Mayfield also serves a roast chicken but I love whatever Charlie brines his chickens in. The breast are flavorful and juicy right down to the tenderloin. Anyway give this place a try. The bar is small so arrive early. Its a family eatery so I prefer the bar, but for those of you with kids in tow Charlie, being the former original Google chef, equips the tables with handheld gameboy like devices to keep the kids attention so the adults can breathe.

You want to love Calafia when you get there. It looks hip and trendy, and such a fun vibe. But, what a dissapointing meal. Frist time, I thought I just ordered the wrong dishes, but when I went back again it was no different. At the end of the day, it really is corporate cafeteria food made to look nice and with the high price to go with it. Nov 2012. Updated review. Been dragged back a few time with out of town friends who want to try the "Google" restaurant. Got to say that a couple of the dishes are growing on me like the pizzas, the shaved brussels sprout salad and the extremely spicy and fat pork belly sandwich. They also make a really decent cappuccino.

I cannot express how much I love this place. ?The food is phenomenal and the service is fantastic. ?The only negatives are the wait at times, crowded parking lot during peak times, and the hostess. ?I love the ambiance and decor, as well as the use of technology in the ordering process. ?I love that you can see the line as they cook your food, and the sometimes communal tables. ?This place just feels so organic and natural, much like the food. ?They use top-notch, fresh ingredients in simple, wholesome, tasty recipes. ?The menu ranges from burgers and pizza to Asian rice curries, tacos, and noodles. ?I highly recommend their pizzas, but I really don't think you can go wrong with anything on their menu. ?This is a very "green" oriented restaurant that is great for vegans and vegetarians. ?I wouldn't be surprised if it were great for kosher diners as well.

As you may or may not know, Calafia is the brainchild of Charlie Ayers, Google's original corporate chef. ?It's a relatively unassuming place, tucked into the Town and Country shopping center across from Stanford. ?The focus here is on seasonal, healthy fare that caters equally well to vegetarians as it does to carnivores. ?As a matter of fact, the menu has two sides, one for each crowd. Although the space itself is roomy and there is outside seating, by 6 this place does get pretty busy. ?They don't take reservations, so it's advised to come early. On my first visit, I tried the lacquered short ribs with horseradish mashed potatoes. ?The ribs were wonderfully tender, although I would say that the sauce may have been slightly over-reduced. ?The potatoes were decently creamy with a nice horseradish kick. They have a very nice wine and beer list (with many of my favorites, including Pliny the Elder!). ?Did not peruse the dessert menu on this trip, as I was pressed for time. ?But, considering there are 5-6 other dishes I'd like to try, it's safe to say I'll be returning. Service was outstanding; friendly and attentive.

wow ... Club sandwich from the deli side was really poor. Ok, so I chose wheat bread but basically the sandwich consisted of two un toasted slices of bread, "processed" meat , (they say not nitrates) , two pieces of bacon and limp slice of lettuce. Cost? think it was about $8.00 !! note to myself, could have made that at home for $1.50 and saved $$$ total rip-off

I get the same dish every time but it is incredible so why change? ?(chicken curry bowl) I've been here for lunch and for dinner (with the family and friends) and enjoy both times. ?Service is always good. ?Servers are always friendly. ? I recommend for a business lunch, lunch with a friend, or dinner with family.

If the Slow Food Movement hasn't hit your house yet, rest assured that it's coming to a venue near you. ? Calafia, how I LOVE what you stand for. Let's get some basics out of the way. Yes, the owner is a ?former executive chef for Google. The Market A Go Go looks very similar to one of the Google cafe's. The long family style table in the main dining room CAN be a little awkward, but get cozy with your neighbor, as they may be more likely to ?share. ?Also, don't forget your wallet and knick knacks in the secret compartment. I almost left my aviators and would have been really sad. I love the long table because It makes for more relaxed eating and less clutter on the table. The bathrooms are fun, and the hand dryer is like that at Nordstrom's. Organic foods are prevalent on the menu. ? Variety is the name of the game. You almost forget you are in Palo Alto, but the prices knock you back into reality. i don't mind supporting food conscious, responsible restaurants. Chipotle, you could be getting 4 stars, but you aren't as good as Calafia. My group of 4 ordered the following items. Chicken Zucchini Pizza-Decent, but not my favorite. White sauce, pulled chicken, grilled zucchini ribbons, grilled onions, garlic confit, fresh thyme, smoked gouda: $10.00 Grilled Steak Sandwich-5 FREAKING STARS. MY FAVORITE AND SO SO SO DELICIOUS! Grilled and sliced hanger steak, BBQ sauce, mozzarella, onion strings & your choice of shoestring fries, jalapeno jicama slaw or citrus salad: $14.00 Rojo Chicken Tacos-They reminded me of something I made at home. I like these tacos, and didn't miss the grease. Chipotle-take notice! Three shredded chicken tacos, cabbage, minced red onions, cilantro, queso fresco and pickled habanero chilies: $10.00 Fiery Bottom BBQ Pork Rice Bowl-It looked good, but I couldn't sample due to the pork. Shredded pork shoulder with spicy bbq sauce, brown rice, wilted baby spinach, roasted yams, sunnyside up quail egg & green onions: $12.00.....spicy The S'mores brownie was calling my name, but I figured I would be back for dinner. Flor approved, and PLEASE SUPPORT ?the restaurants that care about our health! ?It maybe more pricey, but you know it's good for you.

I ate a pigeon once. ? In China. I didn't know it was a pigeon of course. I just thought it was a mini extra greasy duck. I tried to stay at the breast (insert 12 year old comment here) to be safe but I cannot say the same for the other dudes I was with. Local dude #3, or as I like to call him, angry smoking gambler with long fingernails, grabbed two of the heads, beaks and all, and jammed them into his mouth. The most grueling part was seeing one of the beaks, kinda half in and half out of his mouth, open and close as he chomped the head. Let's just say that since then, all things that have anything to do with little birds, freak me out. Feeling empowered at Calafia, I got the brown rice and pulled pork bowl topped with a little mini quail egg. ? I gotta admit, the quail egg was delicious and at the same time made me feel like I was eating a meal set for a 3 foot tall pygmy albino. ? I think most of the complaints here are about the portion size relative to the cost. ? I for one like eating at a place where I can go back to work without needing a pepto-chaser followed by a food induced nap. Dwarf.

A Calamity of Mixed Food Reviews at Calafia Last year we had our Valentine's Day dinner at Google. (Free of course.) This year posed a dilemma - Valentine's Day was on a Saturday and Google's cafes are closed on the weekend. What to do? Thankfully I remembered that Charlie Ayers, the best known chef at Google, had just opened his own restaurant, Calafia. This seemed like the most appropriate place to go for V-Day. Plus they didn't have some marked-up prix fixe menu (in fact the place on this visit was ?full - perfect for future V-Days). I wanted to make it a surprise to my husband but I hate driving so I had him drive and didn't tell him where the hell we were going. Our server was uber friendly and offered to show us his recommendations on the menu. I've actually never had a server go so thoroughly through the menu saying what was the most popular, what were his favorites, and what had mixed reviews, but it was very welcome. I highly recommend it given the food we ordered in our second visit when we didn't have the server's input. The eclectic menu is really appealing with lots of vegetarian options and full of the healthy sorts of things you'd find at Google like quinoa. Calafia: White people love it. On our first visit we shared the Mahogany Salmon ($15) and the Tofu Lentil Loaf ($13). The bottom of our Mahogany Salmon was burnt so we sent it back (something we rarely do). Our server was very apologetic. Our non-burnt salmon was pretty good but not amazing. Granted, Tofu Lentil Loaf sounds like it's going to be awful but it was definitely the entr¨¦e winner. Both dishes were recommended by our server. He also touted the Gingered Mashed Yams ($3) as his favorite dish on the menu. It was with good reason - we even ordered it again on our second visit. We ended with the Death by Chocolate ($8) which we hoped would be a nice flourless chocolate cake but was more like a much too sweet giant chocolate truffle. On our second visit the place was packed. We agreed to take a counter seat so our wait only ended up being about 10 minutes (non-counter would have been 40 minutes). Unfortunately our counter seat was the one *right* next to the door. Also, the counter is at an odd height that's too high for the chairs. This time we tried the Five Spice Chicken Fideo ($9) which was a horrible mistake. The dish had an odd flavor with too much of an herbal flavor (I'm blaming the mint). Wolfgang's Pizza ($11) was a better option with an interesting pumpkin seed pesto, but a little too much shredded duck meat. (Note: I'm not usually a duck fan but this was good.) We were still hungry after the Fideo disaster (thankfully we had an order of the Gingered Mashed Yams) so we shared the Apple Galette ($8). It was okay, but really not worth $8. Service was mixed. Although our server was super friendly and professional our first visit he also disappeared for close to 10 minutes while we waited for him to return to tell him our salmon was burnt. Our server on the second visit was not very impressive at all. Chef Charlie Ayers could be seen in the big open kitchen. There are regular dining tables, a long communal table, and counter seating. This place has a lot of range: Mahogany Salmon - 4 stars Tofu Lentil Loaf - 4 ?1/2 stars Gingered Mashed Yams - 5 stars Death by Chocolate - 2 stars Five Spice Chicken Fideo - 1 ?1/2 stars Wolfgang's Pizza - 3 ?1/2 stars Warm Apple Galette - 3 stars

Time for an update... We've been back numerous times to dine in or to pick up take out and I've gotta say, things have really improved. ?The service can still be a little spotty but more often than not we've received attentive, prompt, and friendly service. ?Through trial and error, we've learned to come early to avoid the crowds and to just stick with ordering the items we know are good. ?Reliably tasty choices are the simple pizza (for the kids), angry pork bowl, crimson quinoa salad, lamb meatballs, beet carpaccio, and the short ribs. ?I like the mahogany salmon as well but it's been overcooked a few times so I order it when I'm feeling lucky. Nowadays, if I get takeout, I just order from the restaurant side. ?The two items I regularly get from the market are the rotisserie chicken and the boil-in-a-bag short ribs family dinner. ? If you go with a group, be sure to reserve the communal table (8-12 guests). ?We went last night with a group of 13 (including 6 kids) and they were really accommodating and the food was tasty and came out at a good pace. ?Chef Ayer was in the kitchen and he came by to chat with the kids and let them bang a gong on the table next to us. ?Don't worry -- it wasn't really loud and he was the one who started it. ?Can you tell I'm a little sister? I'm keeping my fingers crossed that they keep things humming along nicely. ?It's really nice to have a kid-friendly place in town that serves tasty, organic grub.

I came here on a Friday night to get dinner once. The lady told us it would take about 15 minutes to get a table so I took a look around while waiting to be seated. On one side of the restaurant, they have a deli and grocery area where people could order a variety of sandwiches with plenty of vegetarian options which I thought was cool. There were lots of prepackaged foods that you could take on the go too so I'll have to check this place out for lunch. Once we were seated, our server helped us immediately. She was very friendly and our food came out fast. I was pretty pleased with the selections on the menu. They label what dishes are gluten-free or dairy-free. The options on the menu seemed unique, healthy, and modern. For appetizers, we ordered the clams with udon. I wasn't really a fan of it. The sauce was a bit too overpowering in tartness and there was too much of it on the noodles. I wasn't very impressed with this dish. The main courses we ordered definitely redeemed the lackluster appetizers. We ordered the warm duck salad and the mahogany salmon. The warm duck salad was refreshing. The salad was fresh and crispy and balanced out the softness of the duck well. The mahogany salmon was sweet in taste but light and soft in texture. It was paired with wakame and red quinoa which was good since they contrasted the salmon by adding a heavier texture. I would definitely recommend both. As for the drinks, we ordered a "Wake Up" smoothie that had banana, carrot, orange juice, ginger, and bee pollen yogurt; nice and sweet but still tasted pretty healthy. We also ordered a "Beet Generation" smoothie which was a lot less sweet and tasted... interesting. It had beets, fennel, parsley, and carrots. The decor here is very trendy and everything looks very clean. ?The food came out quickly and our server was really friendly. I like how unique the dishes are and the healthy aspect of the place. It's a great place for vegetarians or those who are health conscious. I'll be coming back to try some new dishes to give it another shot.

For a restaurant being less than two months old and having the type of sleek, modern, contemporary design while offering sustainable and organic foods WITH great prices?!?!? C'mon, I would of expected a way higher yelp rating and review count than the current 3 stars @ 15 reviews. Other yelpers had issues with customer service but all restaurants work out their grand opening kinks. Personally, I found their customer service to be pleasant and proficient. Plus, if you have a seat at their sleek bar, you can look right into their cooking area, I love watching people cook and prepare food. Had the tofu scramble with spinach and turmeric spice for brunch which was interesting since I've never had tofu served that way before but it was tasty and it didn't bog me down for a the rest of the day. My fiance had the daily special omelet (spinach and bacon for Saturdays) and she liked it. The menu features a lot of California style cuisine which is perfect for the name of the restaurant. Califia is the name of a legendary black Amazon queen which thought by some is where California got it's name from. Like I said, they are working out the kinks and I had to subtract a star because now looking back at the menu I saw that we didn't get the toast and jam that was supposed to be included in our meal. ?Another thing was that we were asked if we wanted dessert after we received our check. I would've liked to trey their Meyer lemon tart. I guess a cupcake at Kara's round the corner will do. =) They also have a self checkout grab and go market for a quick bite to eat right next door. The owner said this market section has only been open for a bout 3 weeks. You can find hot vegetarian - and non vegetarian goodies such as eggplant paninnis, wraps, and breakfast burritos here for about $5-7. Solid burgeoning institution for the Stanford crowd as well as anyone else who likes to eat. Might not be a the exact place for you if you're more of the IHOP All you can eat pancakes type of person.

The Veggie Burger (patty made with beets/carrots/mushrooms) was delicious and topping it off with smashed avocado, grilled onions, and white cheddar cheese was just genius! Tried the Vegan Pizza, but it wasn't that great. Will definitely be back to try their Breakfast Pizza. Good service. Dine outside if it's nice out.

This place has grown on me in the last couple of years and is due for a star bump. ?I feel like things have gotten better seasoned, and they've got a nice breadth in menu selections. ?I particularly like the firey bottom pork bowl, the pearl cous cous with roasted veggies, the chow mein, and the steak lettuce wraps. ?Also very glad that they make it easy to eat my veggies -- lots of veggie sides. ? And, bonus for take out that's available all day, even at some odd time like 3 pm. ?When hubs is away on business, I've been known to pick up 3 days worth of food to not have to cook. ?Always very prompt with having the food ready. T&C is getting a little crazy for brunch/dinner, so there can be a wait on occasion. ?Reservations would be nice for this, but most of the time you're fine w/o.

We finally returned here this week. I'm upgrading the rating because the service seems to have caught up to the excellence of the food! Expect a wait -- we went around 7:30 on a Monday evening but still had to wait nearly a half hour for a table. (Granted, they could have seated us a little bit sooner outside or at the front window counter, but we wanted a regular table.) The menu is two-sided, with one side for meat-eaters and the other for plant-eaters. This is great for vegetarians, but omnivores have to continually flip the menu back and forth to peruse both sides. The food is still excellent. Tofu lettuce cups were super flavorful, but the tofu could be cut into smaller pieces to make it easier to get a little bit of everything in each bite. Tofu lentil loaf with mashed potatoes and gravy was as good as ever. And the shaking beef salad was perfect. At first it looked kind of small for an entree salad, but the greens are mostly (my favorite!) arugula, so it's pretty dense and filling. For dessert, the vegan chocolate cake with butterscotch filling and strawberry sauce was good, but it would have been better at room temp. It was chilled, which is not a good combination with the chocolate shell encasing the round piece of cake. We had to keep chipping away large shards of hardened chocolate as we ate. But the main reason I'm writing an update is because the service was excellent! We didn't have any of the missing items, incorrect items, overlong gaps, etc., that we experienced on previous visits. Everything went smoothly, and it was a wonderful dining experience!

I was looking forward to the opening of Calafia - accomplished chef, reasonably priced food & unpretentious location. However, the experience was not worth the hype. Lets start with the good ... The food was OK and reasonably priced. ?Nothing special, but fresh and with some interesting tastes. The flavors weren't especially developed. ?Actually, they were a little muddled, trying to do too much in one, simple dish. ?I would have appreciated something a little more focused. ?But I will give it a point for the fresh ingredients, flavors and price. Now for the not-so-good ... First, when we walked in, they were crowded and claimed there was a 20-30 minute wait. ?Looking around I noticed several seats open at the window and the communal table. ?I brought this to the hostess's attention, and she kinda sneered at me. "Would you like to sit at those seats" she said pointing to the two chairs at the window by the door. ?"Actually, no," i said. "That's a communal table, right?" ?"We'd like to sit at those two seats that are not taken". ?Subtract points for unhelpful hostess right there. Next, we took a look at the menu, and were intrigued by several different options. ?The person i was dining with found something she liked, but it had hot peppers in it. ?She excused herself to go to the restroom and asked me to order it for her without the peppers. When the waiter came by, i gave my order and asked for my friend's order without the hot peppers. ?the response i got was amazing, to say the least. "I'm sorry sir, the chef recommends you have it as its listed on the menu". ?Excuse me? ?Wait, isn't this a restaurant that is in business to "serve people"?!?! ?I'm sorry, this type of attitude may fly at some 4-star restaurants (even then its still un-welcomed), but not at a casual restaurant in a strip mall. I explained that my friend did not want the hot peppers, and the waiter should go back and check to see if that can be accommodated. ?5 minutes later, he's back, and said "yes, they'll not add the hot peppers. Now you may say, it may be difficult for chefs to remove ingredients that are mixed into a sauce or a pre-prepared component. ?Agreed. ?However, these peppers were just to be sprinkled on at the last minute! Finally, it wasn't a pleasant environment to eat. ?Waiters were milling about not doing much, the room was loud and the communal table was so wide you had to lean and shout over the din to be heard. Hopefully, they work out the kinks in the first few months and get better. ?But there are so many other good places its hard to see why you'd spend time here with the attitude you'd get over decent, but not noteworthy, food.

OK, first thing's first. Just because someone happened to have the good luck to be Google's first chef doesn't make them a great restaurateur. The owner's claim to fame, which is repeated endlessly, is that he was Google's first chef. Two words: Big. Deal. We went there for brunch, and the main point I want to make is about the coffee. I shall make this point with a little metaphorical story. Imagine a man has the winning ticket to the $30 million lottery jackpot. He has ten minutes left to get to the Lottery office to claim his prize before the deadline. Rain is pouring. Traffic is bad. And he is so severely delayed, that when he arrives at the office, 5 minutes late, the officials solemnly tell him that he will not be awarded the prize. Take that level of bitterness. Double it. Voila - - you have have equaled the taste of Calafia's coffee. As for the food, it isn't anything better than you would get at Hobee's (although you get to pay more for it.........oh, and the owner was Google's first chef). Suffice it to say, I won't be going back.

I had the eggplant tiger bowl and my friend had the Calafia pizza for lunch today. ?Even though we arrived just after 1pm, the place was pretty packed and we had to be seated at the bar. ? Service was quick and attentive. ?Water you can get flat or sparkling. ?The bowl portions are smaller than what you'd expect for the price, but the pizza for $9 was pretty good. ?The food was fresh and tasty (very California-cuisine-esque), so it's not too bad. ?The to-go-go side isn't open yet, but it's supposed to open "mid-February." It probably wouldn't be first choice for lunch, but it's definitely worth looking.

Worst Service I have ever received in my life! ? Today, I cannot believe the treatment my husband and I received - truly, I have gotten better service from In N Out. I want to say first that my husband and I have come here many times for dinner as one of my best friends is an ex-google employee and the food is excellent. Now Service for lunch that's a different story... -My husband and I went to Calafia during the Stanford Football Game. -The restaurant had less than 15-20 patrons -The server staff seemed a bit disorganized, but no big deal, our server took our order: Omelette + a Pizza for me. Two minutes later, the server asked 'Oops, I forgot to ask you, what Toast would like with that. My husband replied 'Wheat'. ? After about 15 minutes, our brunch was served and the food was excellent, BUT we were missing our toast. Now Toastaggedan 2009 began: - I couldn't see my server after taking our order, so after eating half of our omelette, I asked another server, we are still waiting on the toast - he said 'I'll get back to you'. -After 10 minutes, my husband just finished his meal and then a portly gentleman from the A Go Go part of the restaurant said 'Let me get these plates for you' - I asked him, we are still waiting on our toast. INSTEAD of apologizing, he had the nerve to ask us 'Do you still want your toast?' . Yes, I replied. -Somewhere between the 2nd and 3rd request for toast after our meal was finished, I asked somebody to fill our water - both glasses had been empty for 10 minutes. -Obviously, the portly gentleman didn't give a damn about our toast, cause 5 minutes later, our original server came by and I asked him again, where is our toast. -The original server actually went straight to the kitchen and put some toast in. -Finally, because it does take 5 whole minutes to make toast, the portly gentleman got us toast, WITHOUT KNIVES OR PLATES - our table was cleared!! When this server saw my husband reach for a knife, he handed us 2 knives -Oh and finally our original server came back and provided us a 2nd portion of toast. And when he saw we already had toast, he said, 'oh, looks like you already have some' -When giving us our bill, the original server apologized for missing on the toast. OUR FIRST APOLOGY OF THE EVENING!! ALMOST 1 HOUR INTO THE SERVICE AND 2 MINUTES BEFORE DEPARTING Here are the funny parts of the story: - The entire time there was 1 person behind the A Go Go Part of the Restaurant chit chatting with customers the whole time. - NOT ONCE during our meal did anyone (the hostess, our server, any server) ask if our meal was ok. -NOBODY ELSE seemed to be having bad service - Why was this?? I've got my own guesses. -The wait staff was incredibly disorganized, it seemed like 2 or 3 people were running the show, while everybody was just hanging out. My experience at Calafia ruined a wonderful date and I will never voluntarily go here again!!!! Go here at your own risk.

S.O. and I were craving for granola + yogurt... we both instantly thought of this place. Did someone say UNAGI? Lol. It was pretty early for a Sunday... we got there at around 11 and it wasn't as packed as we anticipated it to be. Plus the weather was gloomy so that was another factor. We both didn't want to seat at the bar since the notorious bartender was there and we didn't want our appetite to be ruined... fortunately, they had a table for us! We got seated... given the menu and since we were starving... we were ready within minutes. I ordered the same thing: Yogurt Granola & Fresh Fruit Bowl + Organic Buckwheat Pancakes + soy mocha. They changed the presentation of their yogurt / granola ... see picture. It actually works better now that it's all mixed in together rather than it being in separate compartments in the plate/bowl. S.O. and I both liked this version of granola. It was the right amount of fruits, yogurt and granola. My pancakes was good as well... light but I wished they made it fluffier... Soy mocha was delicious just like last time. I don't remember what the S.O. ordered but he liked it better than our first time. Overall... I know this is a hit or miss for other Yelpers... we have yet to try it for dinner... but from the reviews... I think we'll opt for this spot as our brunch spot on weekends. Oh before I forget... reason for my update: service was A+ in the main dining room ... she was friendly and prompt. It was nice to actually have a conversation with the S.O. and not hear someone complaining about their tips.

My new favorite Palo Alto eatery, Calafia is great for lunch, for dinner, for a nice dinner with friends or a date, and even business lunch. The food is fantastic, great seasonal ingredients, healthy yet flavorful, and variety of food styles while being distinctly Californian. Some of my favorites - Really Angry Pork Tacos - three delicious tacos with ALOT of heat - Crispy Lamb Hash - meaty, filling, and surprisingly light - Lamb Burger - yum - Brussel Sprouts - definitely with bacon, so good. - Burratta Pizza - I mean anything with burratta is awesome, but pizza is good - Tofu Lentil Loaf - clearly I'm not a vegetarian but this is really good - Fantastic smoothies with fresh veg and fruits. Yummy beer and wine, quite reasonable. Outdoor seating when it's nice. Inside there're your standard tables, communal big table, and a few bar seats along the window and facing the kitchen. Town and Country is quiet and doesn't have much of a scene besides this restaurant, but close drive to University Ave (and happens to be walking distance for me :) ?Parking can get tough during the day, as it's a busy high end shopping plaza and right next to Trader Joe's.

I stopped for a bite at Calafia on my way to Stanford University. ?I was seated fairly quickly at the bar and handed a menu. ?I asked the bar tender what he thought was good and he suggested that the Angry Pork Wrap was a typical favorite. ?I went with his suggestion, ordered the wrap, and was a little shocked to have it brought to me in under five minutes. ?Normally, I wouldn't turn down food appearing before me that quickly, but this appeared to have been a slightly-upper scale joint to dine in. ?Now, I don't know if they thought I was in a hurry because I came in alone or whether they just work that quickly but I was a little worried about receiving food that quickly in this kind of restaurant. I was also immediately turned off by the rancid iced tea I was served, which was my precursor to the super fast food service. ?The wrap itself was 'meh' at best. ?There was a lot of brown rice (albeit cooked nicely), tucked into a wheat tortilla wrap and what seemed like a dab of this angry pork (not really even spicy enough to make me want to drink some water) in the middle of the rice. ?For a nearly $10 wrap, I would have expected it to have a little more flavor to it but I really didn't get it. ? I will say that the overall service and ambiance was actually pretty good, but I was desperately disappointed by the quality of the food. ?However, I am also assuming they were charging so much because they were touting organic ingredients. ?That's all well and good but get some flavor into those organic goods! So, if you're in the area and looking for a bite, I would actually recommend skipping this place if you're looking for a flavorful bang for your buck. ?I kind of wished I'd waited and gone to one of the other restaurants down the way.

I had lunch at Calafia Cafe the other day and I would have to say I was pleasantly surprised by it. ?I wasn't expecting such an elegant little cafe in the Town & Country stripmall, but that was just what I got. ?Love the decor-- both the inside, which I only got a glimpse of and the outside which is set in long tables so if it gets packed you'll probably sit next to other parties.. kinda like the home-iness of that. ?I also loved the service. ?Definitely one of the best servers I ever had! ?Helpful, nice, attentive but not intrusive, good with making suggestions without being pushy (a delicate balance hard to achieve). As for the food, though it's slightly pricier than your average place, it is more upscale. ?The taste overall was pretty good. ?I got the angry pork wrap which was filling and a good combination of flavors, slightly spicy in case you don't like that. ?One of my friends got the pork bowl which was good, and the other got the veggie burger which is served with shoestring onions and bbq sauce, with fries and a slightly spicier ketchup. ?I wasn't blown away by the taste of the food, to be honest, but it was good enough to make a mental note of the place to come back at some point since I love everything else so much!

Went here for brunch with some friends. I like that they have tofu scramble on the menu, but I wish they had more vegan brunch options. It's so easy to find vegan food in this area, with the exception of brunch. It's either tofu scramble or oatmeal, and sometimes that gets a bit boring. Extra star for letting me sub salad for the hashbrowns that normally come with the scramble.

Came here for breakfast/brunch today. My egg dish was simply delicious but there was a couple of problems. First of all like many coffee drinkers when ordering breakfast I'd kind of like my coffee right away. I waited and waited and after asking two servers I finally got my simple black coffee. Turns out they make the coffee and tea drinks one cup at a time, I guess on an espresso machine. The server explained that there was a line up of ahead of my coffee for lattes and such. I'm really not interested in why I have to wait for coffee, if you're serving breakfast there should be a coffee pot full of hot coffee going all the time. By the way, the coffee and the tea my wife ordered each cost $3.00. For three bucks for a cup of coffee I at last expect it to be hot and not have to stare at an empty cup between refills.

Immediately the first thing you notice is how incredible the atmosphere is. If I had a loft in NYC or SF, THIS is exactly how I'd want it to look - giant metal lamps, comfy couches made of recycled materials, and unique lighting fixtures made from old glass milk containers. The attention paid to detail and design is better than most anything I've seen in Palo Alto. I could go on, but let's keep it short - the atmosphere is awesome. I'm not into organic or vegetarian, so the fact that the restaurant's menu is loaded with healthy choices doesn't blow me away - I just look for what I think I'll like to eat. My lunchmates, were, however vegetarian and VERY into what Calafia had to offer. It's nice, for a change, that this restaurant actually has a vegetarian alternative to practically every dish. You can substitute any of the meats for tofu. Now into the cons.... I'd say the only con was the service. Our server seemed high or totally out of it. To be fair, he did know the menu very well and made recommendations, etc. but he was REALLY slow in getting us what we ordered - it took him like 5-10 min to bring someone a soda. The restaurant wasn't even very busy. And we were celebrating a birthday but no little birthday treat for our girl??? Booooo. Overall it was an OK experience. It's not very expensive and I like the thought put behind this restaurant, but I probably won't be back.

I've come here on two occasions and both times were subtly disappointed. ?The first time I came, the food came out partially cold and relatively bland. ?The second time I came here, the food was for sure on a bland bent. ?However, this place does have variety and I love the ambience. ?I'm not sure if I'd venture out here for a 3rd time, but certainly it might be for some people!

Had the Spicy Napa Salad (Pulled roasted chicken, shredded napa cabbage, red cabbage, shredded carrots, orange segments, cilantro, tossed in a spice sesame dressing, crispy julienne wontons) The chicken was really tender and the salad quite tasty. But the whole time I was thinking that I could have made my own salad (w/ Ahi Tuna) at Sprout for the same price. I would go back to try some of their other items before making a final opinion, but so far, it's just A-Ok.

I love a lot of the concepts of the restaurant but it always come down to execution. ?For a green, local sourced, non-chain restaurant they should be a bit more inviting and informative. ?You don't feel welcomed when you enter but more like an interruption. ?They do have a nice area to wait for your "table". ? I really enjoyed the decor and found it fun and quite different for Palo Alto. ?The open seating plan and recycled/green materials made the interior something to think about while waiting. ?There are mainly shared tables and counters. A nice touch while eating at the counter was the bar hooks. ?So many places do not install these and it makes it hard to eat as your jacket purse has no natural place to go. ? The food was all pretty fairly priced and a good mix of entrees, starters, and beverages. ?We went for brunch and they had a nice selection of eggs, pancakes, french toast and beverages. ?Some minuses were being served burnt pancakes (it wasn't an accident, it was buried on the bottom of the stack and burnt on both sides). ?Pluses included the egg dishes that were fresh and all the sides were from scratch. ?You could order a baked plate of scones and muffins on the side which sounded really lovely. The waitstaff was a little eager to give our seats to other dinners when people got up. ?The plates were very quickly cleared but the bill was slow to arrive. ?The server was excellent, friendly and helpful. ? What needs to be worked out is the bus service and reception. ?You get a little bit of attitude at the front door and the bus staff needs to let people finish their meals without feeling rushed. ? I will review again after a couple of meals to see if this is ironed out. ? I tried to go for lunch but the wait time was over 35 minutes. I see a lot of potential for this restaurant if it works out the kinks. ?The food was good but not exceptional. ?The wait staff was excellent but the other service was off. (UPDATE) I have been back a few times since and can say many of the waitstaff kinks have been worked out. ?The front desk is more relaxed and pleasant. ?I have taken some picky eaters in the family and they have been pleasantly surprised. ?I would recommend any duck dish as they seem to be the strongest. ?It does help to be there when Charlie himself is there. ?He makes sure there aren't problems. ?Weekends are probably the weakest for service.

After hearing about former Google chef's popular Calafia Cafe for months, my mother and I finally decided to make a lunch of it; we left sorely disappointed. I ordered the "really angry pork tacos," which sounded like they should be bursting with flavor. Yet instead, I was served three bland tiny tacos, which appeared to be devoid of seasoning as basic as salt and pepper. Without the pickled habanero on the side, these would have been completely flavorless. My mother ordered a salad with a skimpy helping of apples, chicken, and goat cheese. It tasted fine, but was overall forgettable. I could be mistaken, but the lemonade did not appear to be fresh-squeezed from a restaurant boasting such a vast selection of smoothies and fruit concoctions. My main issue with Calafia was that while I enjoy healthy food, I don't want my food to TASTE like healthy food. One doesn't need to resort to sauces, MSG, and an excess of salt to get wonderful taste out of the food, yet Calafia seemed incapable of achieving any memorable flavor. In addition, the service was really lacking. We waited about fifteen minutes for someone to even come take our drink order (it wasn't excessively crowded). The sun was reflecting off a parked car and shining directly in my eyes from the window and I asked the host if I may be reseated; she said no and simply lowered the shades a bit. The sun continued to bear down on my eyes and I sat with sunglasses on indoors throughout the entire meal. Overall, Calafia Cafe has a number of glowing reviews and regular patrons, so perhaps they simply had an 'off day.' But overall my experience left me NOT wanting more.

The one star is for the nice decor in the place. The food selection was horrible because there was so few and random variety of food. Then when you do order something, it tasted like cardboard and the tastes were all wrong. They try really hard to be healthy but I wanted to run to the nearest fast food joint after the awful healthy food therapy. I am a food lover and I know that you can make healthy food taste good. This place was pricey and not tasty. I ordered the Chicken goat cheese panini. It came with NO SIDES for $12. I had to order an extra side of the barley corn salad. I could powder my face with the amount of flour that was stuck to the bread on the panini. The barley and corn made me felt like I was eating barn animal feed and it tasted like the fridge. My husband ordered the lamb burger that came with a side order of fries. He said that he ordered something that would be really hard to mess up. But alas they did. The oat buns were dry. The shoe string fries were oily and on the brown side. The ketchup was interesting. It seemed like they made their own ketchup which tasted like raspberry jam because it was really sweet. Last but definitely the worst were the drinks. My husband coffee was acidic and I ordered a Green eye lady. It was green and had zucchini and other veggies but it was over powered by too much garlic in the drink. I was nauseous afterward.

I thought in general that the food was bland. ?Everything had flavor, don't get me wrong, but all the food needed an extra zing. ? We ordered a pretty large selection of food---started with veggie tempura which was good. ?I loved that is was with a nice selection of veggies and no mushrooms which I hate. I had the shaking beef salad which was just ok. ?The meat was well cooked, but the salad needed something extra. ?My friend had the short rib special which was very good. ?We also got a beet, goat cheese and walnut pizza which was lacking on the goat cheese, but good overall. ?I think it had too much arugula on the top of it proportion-wise. For dessert, my friend had an acorn flour cake that was gluten free and vegan and remarkably good considering both those things. Service was excellent. ?We ate at the bar.

Alright I gave this place a second chance and was disappointed yet again. It was pretty hyped up from the start - ex Google chef, local organic ingredients, eco-friendly sustainable furniture, etc., but the food can use some flavor. Decor - This is where they earned most of their 3 stars. Warm, modern, sleek wooden furniture. Throw pillows made of reused rice bags from India. Open kitchen. So much promise, and then... Spinach Fennel Frisee Salad w/honey mustard dressing - Very small portion. The dressing was the best part of the small salad. ?Definitely not worth $8. Smoked Salmon - The description on the menu looked amazing and so did the food when it came out. But it turned out to be bland, which I thought was strange since smoked salmon is usually salty. House Baked Breads, Muffins & Scones - Blueberry and cranberry muffins. Blueberry and hazelnut coffee scones. Fresh butter. I usually can't resist warm baked goodies, but I didn't finish any one of these. Latte - The best thing I had at Calafia. ?Does this even count? ;) Next time I'm going to try Mayfield Bakery and Cafe next door.

I've been here several times and I've enjoyed the food every time. ?Every dish has a unique flair to it ... and I'm not sure what's with the other people complaining about the service, but I've never had a problem ... in fact, some of the waiters know me on sight now. The seating is spacious and the decor is very nice, with an open wooden feeling to it. ?You can also sit at the bar or watch the chefs as they do their work. For the quality of food, the prices are very reasonable. ?And I've never brought anyone here who wasn't pleased as well. ?In summary, great food with lots of variety, reasonable prices, modern snappy decor, and great service (for me). ?So thumbs up.

3.5 stars. I came here a couple weeks ago for a friend's birthday dinner. We had a fairly large group, but the server was very attentive and accommodating to our requests. For appetizers, we had the duck dumplings, calamari salad, and fries (I think). For my entree, I ordered the Fiery Bottom BBQ Pork Bowl, which turned out to be quite spicy! I liked the fact that even though it was with brown rice, the dish still managed to be tasty (can you tell I'm not a fan of brown rice?). For dessert, I shared the banana split with a friend. The bananas were especially yummy (br?l¨¦e style). Overall, a bit pricey for what you get, but still worth trying. -L.

Maybe it's because I'm spoiled living in the Bay Area...yes, the food is good here, but I wasn't SUPER wow'd by it. The food is fresh and well made, but still somewhat ordinary so I'm not sure I'd go out of my way to come back. I'm all for letting the ingredients speak for themselves, but I'm still looking for some innovative flavor combinations. If you haven't been here though, it's definitely worth checking out.

Food was decent, but nothing to write about. I have mostly complaints, and probably some of it is because they are still ironing out service as they just opened. The 3 stars is mostly because the food was decent. The worst part was there was virtually no lunch food, only brunch! (and out of the burger) at 1:30pm on a Saturday. Service was also quite bad. Pros: - The bread/muffins/scone thing was very yummy - Food was decent, I like the fact that it's fresh/local Cons: - We went in Saturday 1:30pm expecting a lunch menu, instead we are only allowed to order from the brunch menu, AND they were out of the burger. Seriously? Who only serves eggs/pancakes till 3pm on Sat/Sun. I was told that the lunch menu was only available after 3pm (on Sat/Sun). This is so retarded. - Portions were quite small for the price. - The five spice chicken noodle bowl, had way too much five spice. - Service was bad, the waitress took forever to take our order (and they tables weren't even all full). She walked by our table MANY times too before asking us if we were ready. Also walked by our table without picking up the check when my credit card was sticking out - the bill waiting to be paid.

Chic little cafe in Palo Alto with decent interesting food and drinks. The service was definitely off, the day I was there. They mixed up my smoothie order and the waiter seemed very stressed. ?They have indoor and outdoor seating and a steady stream of well dressed people walking by. I like to people watch OK, it fascinates me. My chocolate soy smoothie was decent. The chicken drummettes were average. The bill was above average. ;-) One thing to note is that this is a very veggie friendly restaurant and they had as many veggie options as non-veg options on the menu.

Meh, don't order the chicken burger with the regular bun. It looks all nice and tasty with the oats on top, but it's solid as a rock. Ask them to switch it out for a softer roll. Even ciabatta would be easier to bite through and chew. And what's up with NOT providing any lettuce and tomato? The best part of this burger was the melty melty cheese. The shoestring fries accompanying the burger were fried to a crisp, and not really in a good way. One extra star for the dessert. The redeeming factor of this visit was the apple crisp with vanilla ice cream. It tasted exactly like apple pie a la mode. I think I ordered the wrong thing. If I return, I may try the hanger steak, but with mashed potatoes instead of the fries.

I may Yelp with some frequency about restaurants but I'm actually not a fan of many restaurants - greasy food with a heavy dose of carbs just isn't my thing. Calafia let's me eat healthy food with lots of flavor while my boyfriend gets to indulge in a little heavier, richer collection of dishes. The commonality?

UPDATE 9-16-12: Here again for dinner yesterday...they are still trying to pass off their beef as grass fed! It breaks my heart, since they know better and have been warned already. They did make one tiny change to their menu online & at the restaurant: the Filet Mignon, which they say is Grass Fed (it's not), used to say "from Never Ever Ranch" but when it was discovered (and admitted by Calafia) that there is no such ranch, the chef ?then says that's a general term that implies the beef is from a ranch that "Never, Ever uses antibiotics, hormones, etc." That's nice, but that's not "Grass Fed" beef, which has a much healthier fat and is much more expensive than regular beef. "Never Ever" is just another unverifiable marketing gimmick. Read the rest of my review below and I give you the details on grass fed vs. grain fed or finished beef. Guys, this is not hard. Find real grass fed beef then start using it. But please don't keep trying to pass off non grass fed beef as actual grass fed beef. I know it's because the price of real grass fed would blow up the cost of your Filet Mignon and Hamburger, but either do it right or stop taking peoples money for the wrong product. I really do like your restaurant and want you to continue to succeed, but I don't like to be deceived, whether intentional or not. ORIGINAL REVIEW: I've eaten here about 4 times over the last few months. Nice setting, good service (usually, unless you get those waiters who get really snarky & hard to find once they find out no wine/drinks/high value dishes ordered, only happened twice, other times waiters totally awesome) I've enjoyed the grass fed filet mignon and the grass fed burger during my visits, but now I hear there's a mini scandal about the grass fed beef not really being 100% grass fed? FYI: USDA rules state you can only advertise beef as grass fed if the animal has eaten grass from birth to harvest (slaughter) No grain finishing allowed, since the cows fat turns to more toxic omega 6 ratios within just 30 days of eating grain. If a cow eats only grass, it's omega 3/omega 6 ratios are similar to wild salmon. So I'm sure Calafia will fix this SOON! I caught another new restaurant in Santa Cruz, Suda, doing the same thing! ?It's a combo of pride, confusion, ignorance, and badly wanting the profits of 100% Grass Fed, but not the costs. Panorama Meats (Coop of 50 Western US ranches), who supplies Whole Foods with not only 100% grass fed, but 100% organic, does a great job of explaining the true definition of grass fed. http://www.panoramameats¡­ ?Also the American Grassfed Association spells out the fact on their website and even have a new article about this new problem of restaurants knowingly/unknowingly? mislabeling their beef as grass fed. http://www.americangrass¡­ ? I've also had the salmon, which when I asked the waiter if it was wild or farm raised, he told me it was wild, but raised in a lake where they capture them while they swim away?? What? So really they are farm raised and they know most people who know fish, won't spend good money on farm raised fish. Then found out Calafia indeed uses farm raised fish, Loch Duart brand from Scotland that are raised in big pens off the coast of Scotland...so not wild, that's ok, but tell us for sure so we can choose, don't double talk around the issue. Chico News & Review did a expose on this issue: ?"Loch Duart treats its fish with Slice, Panacur and Excis, all common parasite treatments, and the farm is not certified organic..." http://www.newsreview.co¡­ Environmental Working Group (EWG) does a great job explaining the difference in Wild vs. Farmed fish, read before you decide which to order/eat: http://www.ewg.org/node/¡­ P.S. I thought I'd already wrote a review here along these lines, but it disappeared ? I can't even find it in my profile? It may have been on their facebook site? But I'm pretty sure it was here and then yelp and/or Calafia deleted it without a trace? So now I'm taking no chances and copying all my reviews to re-post if deleted for no reason. Update: forgot to mention the hip and cool bathroom setup is not practical and potentially unsanitary: 1) You have turn off water handle with clean hand/dirty handle and no towels to use, 2) Metal bead curtain may look cool and give privacy, but all those dirty beads touch your whole body going in and out.

I ordered the sirlion steak and Calafia pizza. The steak had coffee and molasses sauce on top accompanied by arugula salad topped with onion strips. ?The Calafia pizza was topped with shredded beef, jalapeno, and other veggies. Apparently, they don't have any diet sodas. But they do make their own sodas with organic local materials such as agave sugar rather than regular commercial sugar. ?I tried their version of sprite and it tasted pretty close to the regualar sprite. ? The meal is pretty good but nothing to write home about. ?I find the unique idea of using local ingredients attractive. But then, if you dont really care about eating local and stuff, then it's a better deal to eat where you can unlimited refills with bigger portions.

Overrated. I had many things off the menu and routinely eat haute cuisine and must say, after reading the reviews and the website I was ready for an experience like Ubuntu + meat. (Ubuntu/Yountville is such a nice place to eat, too). None of the food was bad, the prices were OK and the wine was OK. But the food left much to be desired for me. I like to gear up and go up and spend lots of money and eat too much and try lots of things on the menu. I literally stopped wanting to try things after about 3 appetizers and 3 plates and a few sides. The death-by-chocolate was described a souffl¨¦ but it was really a quasi fudge-flan. Not the stuff food-dreams are made of. The most tasty thing I had between the beef, mashed potatoes, the side-salad (chard/almond butter), the pizza, the Chinese chicken salad and the tempura? The spicy fries. That's what I liked most, and that's not a good thing to walk away with a reasonably large bill and liking the wine and fries. I can go to IN N OUT, Beltramos or K&L Wines and be happier for less. ? I would do away with the shared seating and the window seating and make room for more tables. I was not able to face my wife while eating. Annoying. I would focus on taking all these nice ingredients and making the recipes taste a bit better. The raw materials are good, but the flavors were a bit odd - I'm not sure what restaurants they are trying to "beat" or measure up to, but to the restaurants that come to mind, such as JZ Cool in Menlo Park, I'd rather just go to JZ Cool.

I totally don't get it. Great concept. Great Menu. Everything looks delicious and is thoughtfully prepared. I love their focus on local produce and such things like making their own cola and alcohol for mixers. Fun. Smart. Good. But then you taste it. You were so excited. What Happened? Blah, Ho-Hum, Salty-yet-Bland, Self-Important, Nothing. If your tastebuds are half dead you will love it. Everything else rocks. Instead of Calafia you might want to consider just walking next door to Trader Joes and picking up one of those ready made meals while you eat it in your car in the parking lot. Sure, that might lack the ambiance of Calafia- but if you can get over that, the taste will be nearly compareable. Don't say I didn't warn you.

I had heard this place was started by the cafeteria chef at Google, and after last night, I can see the connection. ?The food does remind me of cafeteria food, that is somewhat more inspired than say, a hospital. ?The food is over-priced and does ?not deliver. ?I ordered a grilled crispy chicken salad that was supposed to come with butter lettuce, radicchio and blue cheese dressing, and bacon, in that order. ?The radicchio was very much predominant, which made the whole thing very bitter and I was actually unable to eat it. ?The blue cheese dressing was more aptly blue-cheese flavored dressing, at a stretch, since it was the consistency of non-fat milk, and there was not a speck of blue cheese to actually be seen, let alone a chunk. ?It tasted like watered-down Wish Bone from a bottle. ?When I told the waitress that the salad was actually awful, she argued, telling me that "some people like it." ?After she realized that I was not going to eat it, she offered to replace the radicchio with butter lettuce. ?I should have held on to the chicken, which did initially live up to the description, crispy, thin sliced breast meat. ?On the return, the chicken was underdone, in some places pink, so it was slimy. ? My son's meal, a vegetarian dish was as he described it, reminiscent of a cafeteria. ?Or something that his roommate might have thought of and made as a thoughtful gesture. ?The predominant ingredient was tofu, which was cooked to a rubbery consistency, so that it was difficult to cut or otherwise consume. ?It was a large cube. ?My husband's hamburger was ok, but when we got the bill, it was nearly $100 for what was essentially snack food for three, no real entree with say a large cut of meat to justify that tab. ?Our drinks were not to blame, two of us had house mineral water, and the third, a single beer. ? In terms of the atmosphere, it was very noisy. ?Had I not known better, I might have thought that we stumbled into a party for some toddlers. ?We were seated in what I called the kid section, the location in front of the kitchen where there are long tables, that were full of young, unhappy diners. ?My guess is that they did not like the food either. ?I have no problem with kids, but apparently Friday night is the night to go out with the family in Palo Alto. Finally, about the service, the waiters are friendly, though largely unskilled. ?An example, all the appetizer plates were cleared before the duck dumplings were gone, and we had to protest that being taken away.

Finding a restaurant that becomes one of your favorites simply by walking in by chance is always a great thing. ?That's what happened with Calafia. ?We were in Palo Alto, having just picked our daughter up from the Stanford EPGY program, were hungry and headed to San Francisco. ?We happened upon Calafia. ?My daughter had biscuits and mushroom gravy, I had the best burger I've ever had and my wife had Lexi's Lentils. ?All were fantastic. ?So we made a point on our way back South to Monterey to stop in again. ?This time I had the halibut salad special (freshest halibut I've ever had) and my daughter had the pulled pork bowl. ?Wife had lentils again (they were that good). ?Great service, great chef philosophy and terrific food.

I had dinner at Calafia last night. ?I think conceptually, the menu, the atmosphere and the decor were interesting and creative. ?But overall, the food did not win me over. ?We ordered quite a few dishes to try. ?Nothing really wowed me. ?I was really disappointed by the burrata pizza ...sounded enticing on the menu, but when it came, it was a mess...the crust was really soggy and the flavors just did not pop. ?Another disappointment was the pork belly buns, which were a staggering $16 for 4, yet boring in taste and the buns were dry and hard to palate.

If you're here for brunch, don't get the chicken and waffles. ?I mean, really, what was I thinking, ordering chicken and waffles at a restaurant in the bay area. ?And in Palo Alto, to boot! ?I really only have myself to blame. That isn't to say they were inedible, or rancid, or any other kind of unfortunate word that will lead to a misleading and unfairly maligning search result. ?They were just... not that great. ?Two small-ish pieces of chicken, not fried in any particularly notable or exciting fashion. ?Waffles were not particularly tasty or crisp. ?I had an agave based cola soda, which, well, which pretty much tasted like flat soda. And then when the waiter came around to give us refills, he inexplicably filled my glass with iced tea instead. Oh dears.

Expensive, but good food. Mediocre Service. Food -- I went here with a friend for lunch a few weeks ago and ordered the thai beef salad. The salad was very tasty. It had a generous amount of beef, but too little lettuce though. -- They have meat, vegetarian, and vegan options -- 5 stars for sure. Value It's really easy to drop $20 on lunch here. The entrees are quite expensive, though there are some cheaper options. Service -- Mediocre if not terrible -- The waiter tried to clear my plate before I was finished -- He kept hurrying us to leave even though there was no one waiting for a table.

Three and a half stars with the potential for 4. We're definitely coming back. EDIT: We went back. Two items of note: If they seat you at the front tables with no backs to the seats, there is no where to put your coat. It was raining, and people had their coats on their laps or thrown under the table. A coat tree would be great. Pay attention to the names of the dishes. I ordered the Angry pig wrap, thinking I could pick out the jalepeno, because I don't do peppers. Well, an entire pepper's worth of julienned jalepeno was on each half of the wrap. I picked it all out and still got heartburn from the residual oil. So when they say angry, they mean angry. Original review: Today was their second day open. At first they tried to seat our party of three at stools along the window, when there were lots of open tables, but they were happy to seat us at a table when we asked. The menu is nice: fresh salads, some pizzas, heartier sides and dinner options, most under $12. They make their own sodas with agave nectar instead of cane sugar ($3). We tried the lemon lime and it was pleasant, but I didn't notice the taste difference between agave and sugar. Tasted more like an Italian Soda than a Sprite. We started with fries for the table. They came in a small cone with spicy dipping sauce and would have been good if they were not limp and greasy. We told the waiter and they whisked them away, asked us if we wanted more, and took the fries off our bill, plus an apology from the kitchen. They were still working out the temperature controls on the fry-o-lator. No worries, we understood and they were very nice, good service. Two of my party ordered salads. The Modern Salad had beets, goat cheese, and a nice dressing over greens (watercress maybe and mint). Very nice. The other salad had generous helpings of braised pork shoulder over greens and was quite yummy. I ordered two sides: the carrot slaw salad with almonds and currants, and the vegan mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes were more of a puree, with fresh herbs, and were very nice but not too flavorful. I asked for a small side of butter, which they were happy to provide (I know, totally making them non-vegan). The carrot slaw had a vinegar-based dressing that was a bit strong and would pair nicely I think with the pork, and was a nice counterbalance to my potatoes, but shouldn't be ordered as a small dish on its own due to the vinegary taste being a bit strong. Keep it as a side. The waitstaff is still learning their roles and were very solicitous and friendly. And oddly for a place that showcases fresh veggies, a lot of big, beefy waiters. We were well taken care of. The restaurant space is finished with lots of recycled and natural materials, like hay in the walls, reclaimed timber, etc, which creates a warm, eco-friendly atmosphere. All in all, a lovely place for lunch or dinner. I will definitely come back in the hopes I can bump them up to a 4 star status.

This is one of the more pained reviews I can recall writing here on Yelp. More specifically, I *really* wanted to love this place. ?It's got an admirable history, a neat philosophy, and at least one friendly and helpful hostess. Beyond this, it's got Charlie, and as a Googler, I have a lot of love for that guy. ?And mind you, he's not just the planner, sitting at some desk; at least this Friday night he was right in the thick of things, passionately taking and transferring orders, chatting with customers, and so on. ?He seemed positively radiant! But -- here's the frustrating part -- the food I had tonight was surprisingly and disappointingly meh. ?Just plain bland-tasting. I ordered both a cup of macaroni (without the duck confit) and the Bohemian Pork Salad. ?I was initially caught off guard by the crispiness of the carrots and peas in the macaroni, but grew to really like this texture. ?Unfortunately, the macaroni itself was neither particularly creamy nor flavorful. ?The lack of either creaminess or zing made this dish pleasant, but not great. My salad was even less impressive. ?Conceptually, it sounded awesome! ?"Queso fresco, avocado, basil citrus vinaigrette, organic baby spinach,braised pork shoulder." ?But, once again, it just tasted bland. ?The pork had no kick at all, and seemingly little in the way of seasoning. ?And maybe my tongue needs fixing, but I didn't taste much in the way of either basil or citrus. ?Certainly nothing stood out as *unpleasant* in this salad; everything was clearly fresh, nothing tasted off. ?It was just, well, meh. Non-food-wise... our server was friendly and generally helpful, though not particularly speedy; it took at least 10 minutes just to get our requested waters. ?And I definitely enjoyed sitting at the bar watching Charlie and all the cooks. ?But -- particularly after popping ?over $50 on 2.5 dinners with no drinks or dessert -- I expected more, even in overpriced Palo Alto. * ?* ?* Maybe my tongue has just been overstimulated all these years, unable to appreciate simple, less-seasoned foods. ?But I've certainly enjoyed amazing healthy food (yes, including at work), so I don't think that's it. So perhaps against my better judgement, I'm likely to go back and give this place another shot. ?Maybe I'll ask the waiter to recommend something "especially flavorful." ? I really do want to love this place...

We came here with a group for a birthday party. ?I thought the ambience was spot on for a big group birthday party. ?The entrees were decently priced, somewhere between 11-20 dollars. ? We had the duck dumplings as an appetizer and some noodles that came with mushrooms. ?Both were delicious. ?I ended up getting the Vegan Lovefest pizza. ?I didn't really like it. ?It had a strange aftertaste that was bitter. ?I can imagine that there are probably some people out there that enjoy it, but it wasn't for me. ?A server noticed I didn't like it and made a comment about it, but I am not the type of person to ever send food back unless there is a hair or something disgusting in it. ?The person next to me had the tofu loaf, which didn't look appetizing, but he let me try some, and it was AMAZING. ?I need to go back JUST to order that. ? Will I give it a second chance? ?Probably.

After hearing many friends rave about this place, I picked this place for our girls night out dinner yesterday. We arrived at 7pm and the place was slammed and several groups were waiting so we put our names down and ventured over to the bar to grab a glass of wine while waiting. The initial estimated wait time was 30 minutes. Luckily we were not hungry yet and not in a hurry either. It was just our luck that one of the groups that was sitting in the lounge area on the sofas got seated shortly after our arrival so we had a spot to rest our high heeled feet. After 30 minutes wait time we inquired with the host how much longer it would be. The answer was 15 minutes. I got a little peeved, but also noticed that two 4-top tables had been done with their food and wine for about 20 minutes, the checks were paid up, but they were just not leaving... I saw that the waitress and host were somewhat frustrated with the situation, but of course they couldn't just kick the people out. Hence I didn't throw a fit about the extended wait time - they guessed properly and couldn't have anticipated that the "Hoggers" were in town for the night. Finally we got seated and our server arrived promptly and told us about the specials in addition to the regular menu. One of my friends picked the Pan Seared Filet Mignon (grass fed beef served with roasted shiitake demi glace, sous vide pureed cauliflower and butter braised dinosaur kale). It looked great and she thoroughly enjoyed it. My other friend and I opted for the special: goat three ways! It just sounded too intriguing to pass it up. I've only had goat once before (in a stew) and really enjoyed it. Our plates arrived and we were pleasantly surprised by the size of that goat dish! At the bottom of the plate was brown rice with pineapple and shredded goat. The seasoning of the rice medley was lovely and the shredded goat was juicy and tender. On top of that rice bed were several slices of goat tenderloin - seasoned perfectly and seared to a nice medium rare. Delicious! On top of all this rested two crispy flautas filled with goat meat. I enjoyed the crunchiness of the flautas but the meat inside could have used a tad more spice to make this third component of the dish a little more interesting. Flautas are kind of bland in taste in general, so it was a good call on our server's part to suggest dipping them in the juices that were at the bottom of the bowl. I'd definitely order this dish again if they ever run it as a special again and I happen to be there that night. We had a nice bottle of sustainable red wine (Kunde Cabernet Sauvignon) with our entrees and our server was very pleasant and efficient. I can't wait to come back here for brunch, lunch, and more dinners. This will be a go-to spot for me in Palo Alto when I'm too tired to cook. I love that they use organic, grass-fed, and local products as much as possible.

Service was great - friendly hostess, nice and competent server. ?Lotsa unasked for refills for our rootbeers Ambiance was great - hip decor with varying seating arrangements (bar, regular and communal tables) - plus: neat bathroom setup, minus: the space was a little noisy Food was so-so - three of our dishes were overspiced (eggplant tiger bowl, barley corn side, BBQ chicken bowl) enough that we didn't finish them. Surprisingly, the tofu-lentil loaf was the best of the bunch. ?The death by chocolate dessert was really just like a slice of fudge. ?Portion size was good and the prices weren't overblown. Calafia is good and a nice addition to PA. ?I wouldn't jump at going back, but I wouldn't dissuade fellow-Yelpers from going there.

I came to Calafia for an evening dinner with a friend. ?The place was pretty hard to find then again, it's the shopping center's fault. ? The decor is amazing...very comfy. ?Nice and modern yet a touch of rustic charm. ?The open kitchen is a nice touch. Ordered the fiery bottom BBQ pork bowl and my friend ordered the Cafe Pizza. ?Food came out very quick. The first thing that surprised me were the portions, a bit on the smaller side considering it cost $10.75. ?However, it filled me up just right and I didn't leave the place feeling stuffed. ?The ingredients were fresh, I just felt it lacked some flavor. ?My friends pizza looked good, shredded beef and peppers. ?Again, it didn't look like anything out of this world. ? Overall, I'd definitely come here again. ?It's good food served at a good price in my opinion. After dinner we checked out the market which featured a lot of fresh items. ?They all looked pretty tasty and were mid-priced.

We started coming here fairly regularly for breakfast/brunch. ?The reason we kept coming back was that the breakfast portions are on the small size instead of the belly-busters that many places serve and the food is well prepared, though not particularly notable. What will keep us from coming back is that the service is consistently inattentive. ?They deliver food and leave before you can ask for salt/pepper/hot sauce (which they do not put on the table). ?Refills on water? ?Forget it. ?Run out of coffee...you'll have to signal for it and hope that the staff isn't chatting together off to the side of the dining room with their backs to you. This isn't a one time observation...this is the result of fairly regular visits over a few months. ?We kept going back because it was convenient and the portion size was right. But after waiving both hands to get the waiters attention to get the check and then being told he hadn't brought it earlier because he thought we were 'enjoying our coffee' (which had run out long before the FIRST time I requested the bill on his fly by...which he ignored). ?Really, I can enjoy my coffee (if I have it) even with a bill sitting on my table. ? So, that's about it for my visits to Calafia. ?I just can't take the crappy service anymore. ?Sorry, Charlie.

Let's see, where do I start? Oh, I know... My mother saw this place on the news last night and thought I should take her to this place in Palo Alto. Being a convert from the computer industry myself to a Pastry Chef, I had this idea of a restaurant long ago that technology would meet food. Chef Charlie has brought this to light with his rendition of having WIFI ordering and great, clean, and health conscious food! I first would like to say that I have been to places like the good earth and hobees...not a fan!!! I saw the menu at Calafia, I said to myself, "let's see what Chef Charlie thinks fresh food means to him". First course: I am a sucker for all things lamb, so I had to try the lamb meatballs to start. Can you say..."O on a plate"!?!?! And the tempura that changes....so light and flavorful! Main course: My mother is Vegan so she had the Tofu Lentil Loaf. I know, I know...I was thinking the same thing..."he took all the fun out of that one". But our very outgoing waitress assured us that it was delicious. Much to my surprise, it had Thanksgiving stuffing written all over it!!! It was super moist, and just down right delicious! If that were set in front of me and I was not told what it was, I would have thought it was the best stuffing I had ever eaten! The only con of the plate I would have to say is the amount of mashed potatoes it came with. I am thinking it was a 4oz scoop, a bit much. But even those were just so flavorful, it was amazing of how "clean" everything tasted. I on the other hand love meat, so I ordered the Braised Short rib. OMG!!! Anyone who knows me knows my philosophy of a "Great" Chef. Which is, if you can take a crap cut of meat and turn it into something fabulous...that's a true sign of a fantastic Chef! Chef Charlie has a winner with the Short rib! Awesome portion size, and the flavor was fantastic! And the horseradish mash was brilliant too. Sure I have had that before, but this was the just the right blend of horseradish to mash ratio! Not too overwhelming, just right. Sitting atop a mound of sauteed greens with the cranberries and walnuts. Great combination! The sides were great too. If I were to have anything bad to say about the wait staff it would be that we could have been forewarned about about the greens on both of our main course dishes. I had ordered a side of the greens not knowing they already came on my dish. But the were awesome anyway, so I enjoyed them just the same. As a Pastry Chef myself, one of my signatures was custom made sodas. A previous review of Calafia stated "the Agave based soda tasted more like an Italian soda and not like a Sprite". My reply to that would be something along the lines that "if you were looking for a Sprite, you should have brought your own in. These are not commercial products, they are hand crafted and should be treated as such." Even the coffees are of boutique style...strong, dark and full bodied. Starbucks...look out! The desserts were simple and streamlined. I would have liked to see more "wow" with the dessert, being a Pastry Chef, but they were very tasty! Overall, I am glad to be able to take my mother out to eat *who has so many dietary restrictions) to a restaurant where a Chef is willing to meet all of her needs, and still have enough on the menu that anyone can go to enjoy a very nice meal. Bravo Chef Charlie! Thanks for being so social to walk around and talk to the guests. Another trait of a great chef is to find out what the guests like about the food, and take criticism. Keep up the good work! I'll be back to try something else on your menu!

What a disappointment! ?After all the other good reviews from fellow Yelpers or friends, I was really hoping for more. ?Everything on the menu looked so good and could have been so promising, I had a really tough time figuring out what to get. ? My husband had short ribs with horseradish mashed potatoes, I had a lamb sausage pasta with chard and tomatoes, and our friends tried the turkey meatloaf and some sort of rice dish. ?I didn't try the beef, but my husband's potatoes had absolutely no flavor at all. ?Compare that with my pasta, which had about 10 lbs of salt. ?The meatloaf looked really dry, and I don't think I heard my friend say anything at all about the rice. ?The only good dish we tried was the carrot salad. ? Given the price, location, and promising menu, I'd probably give this place another try. ?Hopefully, its just some initial speed bumps at the start, and they'll be able to figure it out soon. ?All the ingredients are right, they just need to know how to measure their spices.

I have to agree with some of the recent reviews that the service here is one of the worst I've had for a restaurant of this level! ?I went to this restaurant on spur of the moment without checking out the Yelp reviews. Two of us went on a Friday evening around 7:30pm. ?Went to the front and the hostess totally ignored us and didn't acknowledge that we were there. ?Several people came to the front area and same thing happened. ?Finally, I was able to flag down a waiter who then got the hostess to help us. ?Seating then was quick since I was open to being seated in the counter area. We got our menus and then the fun starts again. ?We had to wait about 10-15 minutes before anybody would come to take our orders. ?Somebody would always come by and say "I'll be right back" ?but would never come back. ? Ordered a combo arepas appetizer with the mushroom, beef and pork. ?The beef was the best and the pork was on the dry side. ?Also ordered a Wolfgang pizza and New Bohemia salad which were fine. ?Middle of the road tasting food. ?Service again was an issue-we asked for some black pepper for the salad and red pepper flakes for the pizza and the waiter never came back. ?Also, during the entire meal, nobody checked our water glasses or checked to see how our meal was going. ?But I did notice that other parties along the counter and other tables had some type of service! ?The final insult was when we had to wait another 15-20 minutes before I could flag someone down to give us our check; ?the restaurant had emptied out quite a bit at this time and I also noticed that the staff had time to socialize and clean wine glasses. I did talk to the manager, Matt, and he was somewhat apologetic initially but not totally. ?He just thank me for letting him know so "they could try to improve". ?When I finally summarized the entire night's service short comings, then he woke up to the full impact. ?He then at that time offered to give us some free desert and coffee which was nice. ?But I don't know if they really are going to re-train their staff for better service in the future. Go at your risk!

I may get grilled for saying this but I was not at all impressed. The food was fresh and you could taste every bite, however, my order of lacquered beef short ribs was salty. Maybe my affinity for foods is somewhat skewed as lots of things taste salty to me, however, my friend who's middle name is salt was the first to point it out. I kept my mouth shut as she had to tell me...dude, these ribs are salty. This while she proceeded to down the free RO (reverse osmosis) sparkling water which was gratis. ?Once you go sparkling, plain tap just seems out of the question. Our service was good but I felt a little too in your face. How many times during the experience need I be asked -- is everything okay? Honestly we were asked about 3 times in the hour we were dining (I think we waited longer waiting for a table). Maybe the sour faces we made caused the waitress to feel the need to ask. All I ask that we get to dine in peace. Lamb meatballs are good and are highly recommended. Avoid the Five Spice Chicken Fideo as they are still working out the kinks (staff person told us). Death by Chocolate Cake, only if you have room after feasting.

I came here for a happy hour drink last week and Charlie was doing an interview in his restaurant. ?He came by and apologized for the bright lights and then offered to pick up the next round of drinks on the house. ?We all thought that it was a very nice gesture of him. ?The table tried a couple of appetizers including the fiery drumettes, duck dumplings and the lamb meatballs. ?All the appetizers were very tasty and the drumettes had a solid kick to them that got your mouth watering. ? I came back later that night for dinner with my fiancee and the GM recommended that I try the tofu lentil loaf. ?I have to admit that under almost any circumstance, I would have passed on this plate given that it sounds funny and I would almost always prefer to order a meat dish over a vegetarian one. ?For whatever reason, I was feeling a bit adventurous and followed his recommendation. ? I was completely surprised by the dish. ?It reminded me of stuffing with the same texture and tasted nothing like tofu (I guess tofu does not really have much taste to begin with). ?The accompanying mashed potatoes and gravy also helped get me into the Turkey Day mood. ?We also had a mushroom pizza which was easy to share. ?Definitely a fan of the restaurant and the reasonable prices. ?Will be back again shortly.

The prices are reasonable, the service friendly and casual, and the atmosphere as hip and interesting as I've ever seen along the Peninsula. My wife had the Angry Pork tacos that were a little too ridiculous since they have habanero chilis on them. Our great waiter fortunately cautioned us and so we got the chilis on the side. He brought us some tomatillo green salsa that was warm and delicious instead. A tiny piece of habanero was painful and I can't imagine who would need this amount of spice (and how low that percentage of the population is). Minus half a star for that crazy use of over-the-top spiciness (then I rounded up). I had the beef brisket that was amazing. It comes with gouda mashed potatoes and deep-fried onions. I loved it. Felt like exceptionally made home-cooked food. We each had a dessert that were excellent as well. The special, peach cobbler, was perfect in so many ways, and the banana split used caramelized bananas, a perfectly modest serving of chocolate, and freshly local cherries. I love what this restaurant stands for with their California-sytle cuisine at a really affordable price.

Strolled right in at 7:30 last friday night at grabbed a seat at the counter. This place opened in mid january but somehow i missed it and just discovered that it existed last week. We ordered the papas con ajo to start. It was essentially thin cut fries tossed in a latin spice rub that was delicious. They were served with a cup of home made ketchup that tasted great, but there wasn't much of it (could have used a bigger bowl of the stuff). My GF and i split the angry pork wrap (braised pork shoulder with citrus juices, smoky black beans, brown rice & creamy jicama jalapeno slaw in a whole wheat tortilla) and the fiery bottom BBQ pork rice bowl (shredded pork shoulder with spicy bbq sauce, brown rice, wilted baby spinach, roasted yams, sunnyside up quail egg & micro greens). Yeah, we like the pork. My GF really enjoyed the angry pork wrap. I thought that if it were going to be called 'angry' it should have some serious heat, which it didn't, but it was still really tasty. Any heat that was lacking was certainly there in the rice bowl. Holy crap, was it tasty. With a 'fusion' rice bowl the temptation is to kind of mute all of your flavors and then bring out the super sweet - americanized asian flavor. That wasn't going on here at all. The pork just fell apart, showing that these guys aren't taking short cuts with this dish and are letting it cook low and slow for a VERY long time. It had a really spicy mexican flavor to it, but was served with brown rice like it was an asian dish. The micro greens and the quail egg on top add some refinement and and smooth out the way the pork just punches you in the face. This is a dish i'm going to have to try at home. We grabbed a seat at the counter looking into the open kitchen, so we got to see everything get put together, which i thoroughly enjoy. Most people would rather have a table, but give me the counter looking into the kitchen so i can watch the crew do what they do. We were sitting right in front of the desert station, and as much as we were tempted by how good everything looked, we opted to pass. We watched the chef, Charlie Ayers (of google fame, they do kind of hit you over the head with that) walk around the room while we waited for our food. Judging by the way he seemed to be schmoozing everyone, and the blue tooth in his ear (what else screams 'i want you to think i'm important, even though i'm not' like a blue tooth), i just assumed he was a self absorbed jack ass. But he made his way over to us, chatted us up and seemed to actually be a decent guy. Fun fact: his wife forced him to put hooks under all of the counters for women to hang their purses. 3 dishes left us stuffed for $28 before tip. I can get down with that. With interesting menu items, lots of pork, a casual setting, and reasonable prices, Calafia might be going into heavy rotation.

My vegetarian friend is out of her mind with admiration to the place and its owner. I think it is partly because there are not that many options for them vegans to have an eclectic dining experience around here and partly it is actually because of the food. Although Chef Charlie Ayers do try to bring his top notch work, the food plays only second roll for Calafia Cafe fans. The vegetarian dishes my friend made me try were tasty, and fun; I like the Crimson Quinoa Salad, the Green, Brown&Black, the Gingered Mashed Yams and THE BREAD ?IS YUMMY! but none of those dishes was enough reason to come back or filling as a mill. As a none vegetarian I also ate the Chinese chicken salad and it is good but again - small, small, small dishes. If not the food then what is the cause to come back and pay high price for small (small, small) dish, you might ask? The Chic, the ambiance, the hip, the decor. All those little things that join together with a "good enough" food and make this place a hit.

I'm a frequent visitor to Calafia because they have a few good core principles. Fresh, simple and healthy dishes! ?(being organic, gluten or dairy free, or vegan are just side benefits to some) Even though the menu changes every now and then (it's now "normal" food on one side and ?vegetarian on the other...with some vegan dishes thrown in) ?there are some excellent constants Calafia Burger - Juicy, ample, and very tasty. ?The bacon is excellent and the bun is about as good as Mayfields (which is right next door). Shaking Beef Salad - Very tasty. ?The greens are delicious (fennel, arugula, mint - can't go wrong with those) and the marinated steak with sesame seeds sprinkled all over are a very nice combo! The prices are good, the food is excellent, the decor is "hip" but not "hipster" (aka: douchy) . ?The wait staff is attentive and Charlie Ayers himself has treated us with great care ensuring our Calaifia experience was good. After your meal you can just walk over the other side of the establishment where the cafe/market is and order some quality coffee & desserts.

Plant based/vegan options. A little pricey but this is Palo Alto. Really enjoyed the vegan choices. Had a noodle dish that was made with a rich ground almond sauce, cannot remember the name but it was delicious. Community seating is a little strange, but they space you out, though I imagine when it gets busy you will be rubbing shoulders with a stranger when you eat... oh well get use to it. The vibe in the place is cool, the wait staff is very friendly. The cordial host had me and the wife wait a few minutes so she could seat us at one of the only 3 separate tables for two... very cozy and private. Note the restaurant does not serve food between 2-4 pm on Sundays but the market is open.... found that out despite what the hours say above. Will definitely be back to try some more plant food!

Went at dinnertime with my coworkers. Large party, so we had a prix fixe menu, which honestly didn't appeal to my tastebuds. I opted for the tortilla soup and the duck dumplings instead of an entree, and I wasn't disappointed. It's a little spicy, but not to where the point where my nose was running and I was sweating. Based on other Yelpers I see there are more choices so I will come back and give those a try. The stars were off mainly for running out of ?certain cocktails ... before 7pm?! Okay, I can understand maybe you ran out of a certain mix that disables that particular drink (some juju something, which, frankly, maybe it's better I didn't opt for a drink that sounds like a curse), but I ordered a second sangria and ... wha? The friendly waiter purrs, : "I sooo sorry, we havea no more sangreeeea. Chu wanna try someting else?" Uh, wha'd you run out of. Red wine?! Fruit? There's a Trader Joe's right there, dude. Get some two-buck Chuck and make MORE! That was quite perplexing. The ambiance was nice too, even with the sort-of unisex bathroom area (girls on the right, girls on the right!!). Staff was very nice, desserts were just amazing. Good place to try again.

I loved this place! Everything is organic, the prices are good and the food is delicious. It's also just got a great feel to it and did i mention the food was awesome? We went on a Sat mid-day with two friends and their 1 year old. The hostess was great to us with the little munchkin and although the place was buzzing, we were seated pretty quickly. ?I got the chinese chicken salad -- it was delicious. Light (i hate when salads come dripping with dressing! this one was perfect). Others ordered the burgers with string fries -- skinny fries that are so crispy and yummy. Mmm. We also peeked at the Go-Go market -soups are coming next week, but it looks like the perfect place to pop in for something quick and yummy.

My last review was fairly glowing, so today I went back to Calafia today with my girlfriend for an early Friday night dinner. We entered the restaurant and there was no one inside, all the diners were out on the sidewalk, which was seemed pleasant. One problem is that one of the diners has brought their dog which barked every once in a while. ?Also, the Paly kids, of which I used to be one long ago, were really annoying, walking through the sidewalk swinging their backpacks and riding their bicycles. ?In my generation we did not act like that and it bugged me to see this kind of lack of thoughtfulness, and nothing done by the restaurant. It took a while to get service, and the first thing I have to say is that they gave us water without asking. ?I usually prefer to be asked for water so I can get it without ice. We ordered. ?I got the Pork Shoulder Salad, the same thing I had the last time I was here, and my girlfriend had beef chow mein. ?We also shared a "smoothie" of banana, orange, carrot, and ginger with yogurt. The smoothie was excellent, light and not too sweet or icy, it was about the best smoothie I ever had - world class! The meals were not as good. The pork salad was good, but not as fresh and tasty as I remember. ?That did not keep me from downing every particle of it, but I was really hungry and I have to say it was just average compared to the last one. ?The pork seemed slightly greasy, and not fresh. The beef chow mein was watery and bland. ?All the mediocre ingredients were swamped with a bland sauce and it was hard to taste the different things that made this up. ?There were black mushrooms in it, which I love, but the sauce was so powerful that you could not taste anything in the chow mein and the beef was chewy and tasteless. ?I've had better food bowls from Jack In The Box, really. That was sort of OK, but ?there were several things that prompted me to write this review and leave a minimal tip. The first thing is that I finished first, and the waiter came by and collected my plate. ?I really do not like this. ?I do not see why they need to do this, It is less work and less intrusive to do all that at the end of the meal. Also, when they do that, we never saw another person for a long while. ?My girlfriend finished her meal and we just sat there waiting for someone to notice. ?Don't try to pretend you are johnny on the spot in clearing away a plate when you do not check on your customers, while they are eating or come back when they are done to give out the check or ask about dessert. Finally when a waiter showed up maybe 15 minutes later ... and remember - everyone in the place was out of the sidewalk - we wanted to have dessert, so we split a strawberry shortcake. We waiting a long time for the shortcake as well. When we finally got the shortcake, you could see the the strawberries on the top were slightly dried out so it was not freshly made. ? ?If it was not freshly made, why would it take the waiter 15 minutes to go get it out of the refrigerator and bring it to us when there was hardly no one in the place? ?If it was not freshly made why was it priced like it was? All of these items were premium priced. ?The check came about to over $45 almost ?for poor service and food I could get better at Hobee's just a shot walk away for about half the price and with better service. I was extremely irked. Then the waiter came back and I asked for the check. ?He told me what it was before he even brought me the check receipt. ?I had never seen anything like this before. ?I put my money in the little wallet thing, and he trotted off and came back with my change and a receipt again after what seemed to be, given the light customer load, another very long time. I am kind of stunned at this. ?I enjoyed Calafia the last time I was there, but it seems that everything now is cut corners and poor service .... but with even higher prices. I guess the norm here is to have waiters from South of the Border, but at least they can train them so they operate efficiently and in a timely manner and check on you once in a while. ?There was just no excuse for this poor performance. I just cannot say I will be giving this place another chance at this point, I am really bothered and disappointed when I thought I had found a very nice place that I could on for quality and value. One star seems low, but the phrase for the two stars is "I've experienced better" and that does not really express my disappointment, so one star it is, ie. "Eek! Methinks not.".

I was torn between giving this restaurant 4 or 5 stars due to the poor service we received, but since the food was phenomenal, I gave them the full 5. I just returned home from lunch at this new addition to the town and country shopping center, and I couldn't wait to write about it! Decor: It has a warm comfy homey feel to it. It's beautifully designed, but not cold, I think that's a really special thing to be able to accomplish. The couch and chairs in the waiting area were really comfy too, and since this place is popular, and you're probably going to have to wait, it's nice to have a comfy place to sit. Food: I ordered the Lamb & Greens. It was a penne shaped pasta with swiss chard, onions, lamb sausage, and tomatoes. It was AMAZING! I highly recommend. A women even stopped at my table and asked what I ordered since it looked so good. It was seasoned perfectly, and everything complemented each other. My mom had the tacos, and although they were a bit spicy for her taste, she really enjoyed them. Dessert: I'm still dreaming about the dessert. We ordered the meyer lemon tart. YUM YUM YUM. The whipped cream on top created the perfect balance between a subtle sweet and tartness. The only downside was the service, and it might of just been the person helping us, everyone else seemed very attentive and helpful. It took us longer than it should have to place our order, we weren't checked on during our meal, and our water didn't arrive until half way through our meal. Hopefully, this is just opening jitters... But with all that said, Charlie, my hat goes off to you, you really hit it out of the park with this gem. I can't wait to come back, again and again and again. Thank you for opening Cafe Calafia, Palo Alto was in dire need of a restaurant like this. :)

This restaurant was recommended by a local so that was a good start. ?It has a great eclectic atmosphere with individual tables, a large communal table and plenty of single row seating around tha windows and kitchen. ?Outdoor seating is available. ?There is also a take out are that is more of a mini-market with a large take out salad bar. ?An actual bar is wedged between the take out area and restaurant area. ?The kitchen is open so you can watch all they are doing. ?A fascinating lighting display is over the communal table which seems to fill up later. ?Interesting photos on the wall including a panoramic of a grateful dead concert at Stanford in 1982. ?The decor is modern yet warm and comfortable. ?You need to get your own salt and peeper shakers from a table that has a small gong on it. Service was excellent. ?The food is heavy on sustainable with plenty of both healthy and sinful options. ?Half the menu is for plant eaters and the other half for meat eaters. ?I had the arugula special salad with figs and heirloom tomatatoes which was tasty and fresh. ?My main entree was the short ribs with mash potatoes. ?The sauce was flavorful but a bit too salty. ?My daughter had the salmon which she enjoyed. ?My wife, the vegan, had a large salad filled with seeds and lentils that she seemed to enjoy. ?She even had small flower blooms in her salad. ?She talked us in to getting the vegan chocolate cheese cake which was actually pretty good considering it was vegan. ?Overall I thought the food was very good but not great. ?I do want to go back again and try other dishes. Before we left I got to bang the gong.

There are lots of options for non-meaters here. I like how progressive they are with their menus - fresh and they use high quality, lesser known ingredients. Tofu lentil loaf is on my faves...great mashies that comes as a side as well. The only thing is that they do not take ressies and for the 5 times I've been here, the hostess' have a major attitude. I'm not sure what the reason is but it would help if they were a little kinder to people.

Best food I've had in the area so far. I had the burrata and potato pizza, my husband had the tempura fried chicken and bacon-bits waffles. Both were excellent. I also tried my friend's tofu scramble which was quite good, and she went on and on about the home made english muffin. I will definitely be back! Yay for finding good food! Fresh ingredients, interesting flavors. Definitely a little pricy for brunch, but I'd say it's worth it. The service was very good, and the outdoor seating was a pleasure during brunch. And hey, we went across the parking lot to do our weekly shopping at Trader Joe's right after!

5 stars for sure! My Dad had been dying to try this place ever since he found out that Google's original chef had a brainchild restaurant, and sure enough it most definitely lived up to the hype. Fantastic, clean, organic, sustainable, creative menu with friendly, knowledgeable staff in an urban sophisticate environment -- if that isn't everything I want in a restaurant, what is? I had an asparagus benedict-like special for breakfast along with their amazing (and sugarless) hot chocolate; I can honestly say that I could eat that meal for the rest of my life if needed. Can't wait to try dinner!

A lunch review: I would give 3 1/2 stars if I could. ?There were little things that prevented me from giving a higher mark. One thing I noticed right off the bat were the paper napkins. ?For a higher end cafe which they are passing themselves off as, I would expect cloth napkins. ?I get that they're trying to save money, but providing only one paper napkin per seat with no dispenser readily available is a functionality issue. ? I'm more of a messy eater and I need more than one napkin. The couple times I've been here for lunch, the service was very good and attentive. ?My server was prompt, polite, and gave helpful suggestions when I had trouble deciding which entree to pick. ?The wait for the food to arrive wasn't overly long. On my most recent visit, I had the lamb burger. ?The meat was a little dry, but I appreciated that the tzatziki sauce and pickled cucumber juices balanced this out nicely. ?The clove mixed into the meat with the red onion and spinach leaf toppings rounded out the flavors. ?A good burger for sure, but I expect a bit more complexity when it's gourmet. ?For the side dish I chose the jalapeno jicama slaw, and was relieved to find that it wasn't too watery. ?I liked the initial bite of the jalapeno with the slaw, ?but wished they provided more of them. ? The more spicy kick, the better. The organic food quality coupled with the clean decor, and ambiance definitely assures my return visit.

Amazing!!! I have been both for lunch and dinner and both times the food was amazing. The service at dinner was more attentive than at lunch (they were totally slammed at the latter) but they didn't mess up a thing. At dinner I ordered the vegetarian meat loaf (can't remember what it's called on the menu) and the jicama slaw, both were INCREDIBLE! I looove vegetarian dishes as I think they have to be so much more creative with ingredients and spices to create an interesting dish. The only negative is the decor isn't all that warm. Other than that, it's a great place for both lunch and dinner, I'm looking forward to returning many times!

I wasn't happy with the food on my first visit. ?Technology-wise I'm a slow adapter - I didn't catch on to things like iPods or Web 2.0 until later, so maybe Calafia, a "Food 2.0" establishment will grow on me. ? I had a veggie burger and a side of fries and I didn't really like either. ?I sort of see a veggie burger as a staple Food 2.0 item and they should be able to do this really well. ?The major parts of the burger, the bun and the patty, were both way too dry for me. ?Yes, you can add sauce and toppings (thankfully the lettuce and tomato weren't dry), but you cannot cover up dryness like that. ?A wading pool in the middle of Death Valley is helpful, but that's still the biggest desert in North America, right? ?I also didn't like the fries, probably for the same reason I'm not a big fan of In and Out's fries. ?I think the moisture content in fresh, unprocessed potatoes makes them difficult to fry to a crisp without turning them into a long, skinny potato chip. ?Almost kind of burnt tasting and again the inside of the potato retained very little moisture. ? That said, I got seated right away at the bar, food came out promptly and our server was really nice. ?I may come back to give it another try since I like the concept and the location is convenient (although parking isn't as easy as it used to be because of the construction of the new Trader Joes). I probably won't order the veggie burger again though.

Read the other reviews... some of the criticism was the result of being NEW. At lunch today, I met the owner... nice and personable and well atuned to my mild criticism that there was a little too much salt. I liked the food bar watching the kitchen... seeing the dishes come out gave me an idea about the rest of the menu. ?My bean soup was a little too salty. The fries with garlic a little soggy. ?My companion's pork rice bowl was delicious! ? I suspect that the place can become a 5 star eventually. It will be destination place for me. ? The table arrangement feels ?they dont know if they want to be a restaurant or a wine-bar. ?It's not optimized for either but does look chic.

Been here about 8 more times and after sampling around the menu, I'm not in love with the place as I was at first. ?On my last visit I had the eggplant banh mi. ?For $9 I got a roll with 2 slices of eggplant 3 green leaves, some carrot slivers and flavored mayo. ?It came with a tiny cup of pickled mushrooms. ?I really felt taken advantage of. ? The sides with the other sandwiches are generally worthless. ?They really love jicama. ?I don't get jicama. ?Most things are really overpriced. ?I guess it's the high rent neighborhood. The service has really gone down hill. ?Some of the servers really don't give a crap, bring the wrong food, neglect iced tea refills. ?There's a general lackadaisical attitude that makes me uncomfortable. ? I still like some of the pizzas, but that's about it.

Mixed feelings about that meal, some of the food was really good stuff but some of it was actually sent back to the kitchen due to foulness. Avoid the potpies on the menu- too much gravy, small serving, overpriced & the peas were still uncooked, ewww. The mini cake that looked like a faux hostess cupcake was to kill for. I am drooling as I remember that cake. Go to the bathroom. It was really a creative design and layout. I love the multicolored tile floors in the stales. I don't know who Charlie Ayers is (but I saw the cookbooks everywhere) and I sort of don't really care about corporate diners or Google for that matter. So maybe I am not the "target" audience for this cafe, so maybe I just don't get it. It felt like a cafeteria in the design of the dining room but it was far more expensive then one.

I'm not sure how I feel about this restaurant- it seems like one of those obnoxious "we're organic, vegan, vegetarian, peta friendly, etc etc etc" and it seems pretentious. It's definitely yuppy- and you get the vibe of Palo Alto yuppy adults/professionals. The food is well... ok. I had this pork beef bowl thing and I wolfed it down b/c I was hungry and it was ok. The people I went with got a variety of things- tacos, salads, etc.. and all were less than enthused about flavors.... since there were none. And people got like beet smoothies that tasted like beet.. I just didn't get it. Regardless of the pretentious vibe the food wasn't that good... and I'm all for organic (lived in Boulder for 3 years) but I've had plenty of delicious foods and been to plenty of restaurants that are organic and vegan that take the essence of flavors and really make food a completely different experience. I didn't get any of that from Calafia...

We came here the other week for my birthday. There were 10 of us, including my 2 year old daughter. The hostess was this grouchy, rude, middle aged lady--she was grumpy from the start, but then when my 2 year old was standing by our table, the hostess didn't look where she was walking, nearly knocked over my kid, and then (with the most obnoxious expression on her face) said "i could have fallen down and hurt myself". Um, excuse me lady??? When there's a reservation for a special event, a large group, and YOU don't see a two year old under your feet, that would be YOUR FAULT. ?MORON. Moving on. The whole reason I picked this place was for the ambiance--kind of modern, yet simple & elegant & cozy. The menu was like nowhere else I've eaten--something for everyone! We ordered a few appetizers, but I was not impressed with the fries at all--they were sub par in my opinion--nothing special about them at all. I ordered the short ribs which were good however my husband ordered the salmon which he couldn't even finish because it was that bad. (And he orders salmon everywhere we go out. My mom also didn't like it). I think in general the dishes are hit or miss. I think they need to tone down the salt though because as much as I like all the flavors in their foods, I was parched througout and after dinner. The service was ok, but I think they need to hire a couple more waiters because we had to wait and keep asking for drink refills and anything else we needed, which was kind of annoying. Their desserts were pretty good. Price is reasonable.

Went to Calafia for lunch today. There was really nothing special about the food and I left hungry. I ordered The Simple Pizza. Would have been better off with some Trader Joe's pizza. The fries were okay. My co-workers were pretty unimpressed as well. ? Will say the service was good.

Only neg is that they don't take reservations, so you have to wait. ?You can call ahead and get on the wait list 30 minutes prior to your arrival though, so that helps... We're planning a group event there this fall, so I'll review that after and let you know if it's good for a buyout.

My husband and I were excited to eat here and try out the new tablet odrering system Calafia is testing - the Presto by E La Carte, a Palo Alto-based startup. Our first time here. Interesting, industrial, high-end cafeteria decor; pleasant front of house staff - we were seated right away. Ordering from the Presto was fun and quick - had our drinks and appetizer in a blink. Our server was very attentive and explained to specils, which are not pictured, as all the regular menu items are, on the tablet. That whole aspect of our meal was wonderful (except ofr the busboy who took our dirty paper napkins with the appetizer plate and we had to ask for new ones, which he basically threw on the table rather than placing them beside our cutlery). But now to the food... We were intrigued by the pork belly dumpling appetizer. My mouth was watering for some crispy-outside-melt-in-your-mouth-inside-socked-?full-of-pork-flavor bites, but instead...a nice dumpling sandwich, with all the flavor coming from the miso aioli ?and radishes rather than the pork belly - no bacon taste whatsoever, no crispy skin. Bland, except for the spice of the aioli. Disappointing. Dinner selections, which we shared: Crispy Chicken with Arugula, Golden Beets & Shaved Fennel - the chicken was crispy and well prepared, but the salad fell short. No zip, no acid, no texture to really make it pop. Shaved parmesan or asiago, or even crumbled goat cheese or feta would've given it some balance and another layer of flavor. Even walnuts or pine nuts would've been a welcomed addition. Not bad, but not memorable. Beef Chow Mein - Again, nothing that really made it sing. I don't know what would've helped - freshly chopped scallions, more sesame oil, garlic chile sauce - there was just no depth of flavor. Not bland, not hot, not bad, not memorable. We opted out of dessert though al the photos and descriotions on the Prsto look very appealing. Will we go back? Husband? Yes, probably because he liked the Presto tablet and he's a gadget freak. Me? In no hurry, sorry to say.

Beautiful restaurant. The milk bottle chandelier and stake stools are incredibly creative. I love to take my designer friends here and have them ooh and aah over the decor. And the food! Best: Turkey burgers! Sometimes soups and great side salads. Also, try to get yourself to like the Facebook Freeze smoothie. It is weird, I tell you, with its odd combination of blueberries and peanutbutter with yogurt. But it will grow on you until it is your go-to snack/meal replacement. Gardenburgers are pretty good too, and the meatloaf. Hit or miss: the sweet homemade ketchup still freaks me out a little, the day they had apple soup, I want to like their muffins but I just can't, the coffee is just not good (but espresso is ok for some reason), and the tacos can be a little on the small side for a meal. Tip: Try the soup first. They bring you out a little spoon of it, since it changes daily and no one can predict its success. Some days, best soup I've ever had. Other days, I suffer the injustice of a $5 cup of steaming self-loathing. But at least the little pot they serve it in is super cute! Also, ask for a salad with a sandwich instead of the slaw or fries. Their little spinach salad with jicama and citrus is really good.

I agree that not everything on the menu is great, but most of the things I've tried have been good.

My wife and I enjoy Calafia and have returned several times for great food and a great draft beer selection. The menu is divided into the plant and meat options. We have ordered from both, and I can certainly attest to being pleased on every visit.

Coworkers and I were in a frantic rush to find quick, yummy food that didn't include the syllables of Mc or Donalds in it. ?The words "market a go go" stood out and we made a mad dash. My friends got a sandwich, salad, pastry and chips while I opted for a smoothie. ?I tried the Facebook Freeze for $4.50 for a 12 oz. ?A little pricey but it was delicious. ?Not too cold, with lots of organic berries and I tasted a hint of peanut butter. ?I usually get sick of smoothies when I'm about 65% complete with them but I sipped up the last drops of this one. ?I would come here again to get a smoothie. ? I just heard my coworker remarking that her sandwich was ho hum. ? Just wish the guy behind the counter wouldn't have been so pushy about getting my order. ?There was no one behind us and I like to take my time to make sure I'm making the right decision.

I had a business lunch here and I wanted to see what was unique that was offered here. ?The first thing was how creative the decor was, very natural and organic -- like its food! ?The table I was sitting at had milk bottles as lamps! ?So creative! I had the lamb burger which was really good! ?Everything had a very organic touch about it, even the ketchup had a different taste -- not good or bad, but very...different! ?The service was pretty good, though I think they should have something for guests to munch on while waiting like bread (especially for starving guests, like myself at that time of the day). ? Other than that, kudos to the chef -- ?definitely a great place to dine!

Love what Chef Charlie Ayers does at Calafia Cafe: taking classic, familiar dishes and cross-culturally mashing them up into his own harmonious style that's not trendy or chic, just delicious. Definitely among my very favorite dining options in Palo Alto. Nice options in both Vegetarian and Meat-Eaters menus. Generous portions for the price points. Meatmeister loves Calafia's Biscuits & Mushroom Gravy: big buttermilk biscuits sloppy-topped with lamb sausage, eggs, and swirls of gravy. Meatmeister also digs Ayers' take on Chicken & Waffles: juicy chicken breasts sliced and fried tempura-style, with crispy "bacon-studded" waffles, and the maple syrup is legit (no fructose, no sir). Fresh juices and smoothies (brunch menu) are insane, both in jolting fresh taste and as pure electric color-fields in tall glass. The Green-Eyed Lady smoothie (zucchini, broccoli, arugula, celery, garlic) goes way beyond your average dose of greens. The Beet Generation is also wildly purple . Put a few of these on the table and you can see why Ayers' used to cook for the Grateful Dead... Tip: get to Calafia really early, and you're likely to see some tech superstars eat their breakfast.

I was expecting a bit more from all the reviews read here and elsewhere. The brunch menu was enticing and had something for everyone from lamb sausage and eggs, to a beef noodle dish, to a fresh spinach salad with chicken. But, the service was lacking at the bar (slow; eggs not prepared as ordered; no refill for water or drinks.) The hostess pointed us to the bar for better service. Note: The bar serves a total of about 6 people and is located near the "Go Go" portion of the restaurant. I guess I was expecting to be blown away, and instead I was barely satisfied. The small selection of local beers and unique smoothie menu would make me come back, but I'd probably grab something to go.

Had to try this place out since Google's former head chef started it and have come away very impressed each time I've been! What I've Had: ?Crispy Chicken Breast, Lamb Burger, Duck Dumplings, Horseradish Mashed Potatoes, Veggie Menu Items, Couple Other Sides The crispy chicken breast entree I got was very filling and tasted great. ?I loved what the chicken was paired with and I completely finished my plate. ?The mashed potatoes I had were very good but didn't blow me away or anything but the duck dumplings were also really tasty with the dipping sauces that were perfect. I must make clear that the lamb burger here is one of the best I've ever had. ?The meat was so juicy and perfectly cooked (even though I said medium-well which is not supposed to be dry/burnt like many places deliver) but the most amazing thing were the spices and herbs and the taste of the meat itself. ?The mixture is absolutely to die for and probably the BEST lamb meat I've had on a burger. ?The compliments such as the tzatziki sauce and spinach were great but the other kicker were the marinated red onions which were tantalizing. ?Have ordered this a few times and I've had trouble trying something new which tells you something! ? Can't wait to try more stuff and also can't wait to try things off the brunch and vegetarian menus. ?My friends have ordered a few veggie dishes which really have tasted great and you have to appreciate a restaurant that has a great vegetarian focus but also delivers on the meat side of things as well. ?The service and interior are also great here and I'm definitely excited to work so close to such an amazing spot!

we came here for brunch yesterday and sat at the big communal table in the front. ?i had a veggie burger which was nice but definitely not for everyone. ?i am big on tofu, and the patty was more tofu-y and mushy than a burger patty. ?it was good for me but i like tofu's texture. ?i got a side of salad rather than fries to make it healthier. ? i really wanted the smoked salmon and bagel, but i couldn't justify spending $16 for it.

I really wanted to love this place, the interior is nice but the food is a hit or a miss (the buttermilk waffles were disgusting). I know buttermilk has a slight tang but my waffles tasted like lemon lime and vinegar, it got me a little sick. However, the worst part was the service..one of the worst places I've been to this year. I've been here about 5-7 times and service was so-so but I didn't complain...until now ? This place is pretty small, only 6-7 tables were occupied and we couldn't flag down our waiter. He never asked us if we needed anything, he just took our order and I never saw him again (he shouldn't be waiting tables)...the check took 20 minutes so I had to ask another waiter and he gave me the biggest attitude and death stare like he didn't work there. This is a service industry get it straight and maybe your ratings might improve. This place has so much potential but I see the ratings average at only 3 stars on yelp. Not that great for Palo Alto.

Have eaten here twice. ?Loved the food here each time. ?Although it can run a little pricey, it was worth it for the quality of the food and service (the location is great also in the Town and Country Mall in PA). First came here for brunch. ?Everything was excellent down to the Barefoot Roasters Coffee. ?Although they have a limited menu, out food was excellent. ?Loved the potatoes and the toast came with this fantastic jelly spread. ?I normally pass on jelly, but this was good. ?The place was crowded and there are several brunch places around in the Town and Country. ?Our waiter was highly attentive and told us the full menu is offered after 4PM on Sunday. ?Had to come back!!! Our dinner was an out of this world experience. ?If they serve meals this good at Google, I would really become a fatty. ?We started off with the angry pork tacos. ?Excellent Google sauce and spicy habaneros on the side. ?You better like spicy before venturing here. ?I two glasses of water with this dish. ?Excellent flavors melding into our perfect pork tacos. We tried two entrees for dinner: ?Lacquered short ribs with horseradish mashed potatoes. ?The meat was tender and the sauce phenomenal!! ?Loved every single bite. ?Three huge pieces of boneless short rib perfection. ?The sauce was excellent and flavorful without being overpowering. ?I highly recommend this dish. ?Also tried the pork dish wrapped in bacon and served with butternut squash. ?Also very good. ?It takes about 15 minutes to prepare this dish and it was well worth it. ?The flavors are done so well I am drooling while thinking about it. Lastly, we had the caramelized banana split!!! ?OMG... this dessert was outrageously good. ?We hardly spoke and dove into this dessert like we were starving!!! ?Everything was great and perfect. ?The banana had a light creme brulee coating on it. ?The ice cream, walnuts and chocolate sauce was the perfect refined touch to this extraordinary dessert. ? Our dinner for two was about $100, but we ate a lot of food. ?Need to keep going back to try out more dishes. ?It is nice to have a restaurant like this near SJ. ? But note that the prices are a little steep but worth it for fresh creative ingredients and excellent interpretations of food.

Absolutely loved it. Food was fresh and yummy... best of all, they are all cooked in front of you after you ordered (you can see the actions in the open kitchen like if you sit by the bar like we did!). The place is totally green (from building fit out, to supplies used throughout)... and crowd is pleasant. Service is good too, staff were chatty and we didnt even need to ask when our drinks start to empty out... Can't wait until their market a-go-go is open, where you can grab a healthy takeout and run. Only reason not 5 stars is the relatively high price. A dinner for 2 is $45 and its just a casual meal... but i guess quality costs $... huh!

I've been here twice now and I really do like Calafia and like the little touches but there are definitely a few hiccups along the way. The first thing is the wait - because they don't take reservations, you wait a long time. And it appears as you're waiting, the two hostesses working the list get a little mixed up. It appeared as we were waiting, that several parties got seated before us...although they were after us on the list. The manager also offered one party free wine for their patience - they had arrived at the same time we did. Speaking of which, when we finally did sit down at the counter ?(which is fun to watch the cooks in action but the barstools get a little uncomfortable) the manager did come over and say he apologized for the wait and the dessert would be on him. So we ordered dessert...but the communication between the manager and the waiter didn't happen so we saw two dessert charges on the bill. I felt bad that the waiter then had to correct the bill. That was kind of unfair to him. The service is a little lacking. Because they are so busy, it was a long time between our drink order until we got to order dinner and our waiter probably only came by once and was less engaged. One thing to note, my dad who can't have gluten asked the waiter which dessert didn't have flour in it - the waiter said the chocolate coconut cake. Which was wrong of course given cake is made with flour. I was a little surprised and would have thought they would have been more sensitive and educated about food allergies. The last time I went, we sat at the bar and this was definitely the smart thing to do - since the bartender is always around, he definitely pays you the correct amount of service. Now on to the food - it's really great. Everything I've had so far has been great. The cheeseburger is great. Last night I had the steak which came with an arugula salad and crispy onion rings. It was very tasty - although I couldn't taste the coffee molasses sauce like the menu said it had. My dining companions both had the salmon which was a very basic plate but it was delicious. The papas fries to start as an appetizer are very yummy. The desserts are also excellent - my milk chocolate butterscott parfait was very tasty and I would absolutely order it again. I love the concept of this place - very local and sustainable sourcing mostly from local farms. And I like the tie to Google as well. So it's definitely a fun place but to be honest, the wait just kills it along with the lack of communication between the manager/hostess/waiter. If there was more attention to these things, I'd definitely come back.

I went to the Market-a-Go-Go and ordered the Calafia sandwich with turkey, wheat bread, and cheddar cheese. I was definitely impressed by the large quantities of sliced turkey they put on the sandwich and how the wheat roll stood up to all the sauces. For $7, I was pretty much full after I only ate half of it. Be afraid Whole Foods! Their sandwiches make a good rivalry! This place has great sandwich making skillz. They also have a make-your-own-salad bar that I might also check out. I don't need to trek all the way to Whole Foods anymore. I haven't checked out the sit-down area yet and will definitely scout it out soon.

We stopped ?on our visit to Menlo park because we liked the idea of Grass-fed beef along with a good solid vegetarian selection.We where greeted by the hostess telling us it would be a 20 minute wait for a table of 5 with plenty of tables and no-one else waiting. When we said we would walk around and be back she quickly got us a table. Not a good start. The food for the most part was good and the table service was great. Highlights on the food where the Veggie burger, Turkey Meat and Short ribs. The tofu was really tough and not very edible in the salad. The food is a bit heavy and covered in sauce. The health benefits of the grass fed meats are wiped out by the heavy sauces and reductions. Probably would skip this place next time thru.

I wanted to like this place. Town and Country needs more restaurants. The place looks great and has an interesting menu. I went with 2 other people. I ordered orange chicken salad. It tasted way too salty and then I noticed that it had no Oranges in the orange chicken salad. They brought me another one - took quite a while. And it was just so so. My friends both had the tempura. The sauce was good but the dishes were a little to oily. We had bread pudding and creme brulee. The bread pudding was dry with just a small ice cream ball on top. No sauce. All the deserts were very small. I won't repeat eating here because when all is said and done. The first and most important thing for a restaurant, even before service and way before decor is to serve food that you would come back for. Why spend this much for so so food.

My husband and I ate there yesterday. He would give it 5 stars. He loved his split pea soup and his Black Forest Ham panini. I had the mushroom arepas and I think that Coupa in downtown does a much better job of them. They seemed pretty bready. The slaw served with them was good. I came here previously and do not remember what I had, but it was fine. My friend's lunch got boxed up. She planned to take it home and add some seasoning and sauce to it to make it better. It was quite blah. Will try to give them another chance. It seems to have been spotty.

If you are looking for an American modern style of cuisine, in a trendy location then this is it, in Palo Alto. Kind of pricy, as expected. Food (as far as taste goes) is just OK. Some of their salads are pretty interesting. They make good coffee. Other than that, nothing special. Decor is nice and modern. 5 stars for service!

Stopped in here as it was next to the restaurant I was meeting my friends...as I have no idea where to go in Palo Alto. ?But I will never come here again. The service here sucks! ?The only reason they get a star is because of the "free" wi-fi. ? They had cold potatoes in their salad bar, and I asked if they could re-heat them. ?He looks at me as if I just asked me to make me Thanksgiving dinner. ?Then he's like...I'm not sure if I can do that. ?I could maybe put in the "some special oven." ?Then he goes to put in the oven, and it's still cold when I get it??? I also ordered a smoothie from the other server. ?And she gave me HALF a glass...And I'm like I just paid $4 bucks for HALF a glass.

2.7 stars. Review for the Caf¨¦. The food didn't hit the mark for me. I had the udon soup with clam, bacon and swiss chards. The three clams were gignormous but didn't really taste fresh. They were too cooked too long perhaps. The overly sweet broth really masked the taste of other ingredients.The noodles were not authentic udon thus lacked the chewiness. The portion was not big but I had a hard time finishing it. The pavlova dessert unfortunately didn't make things better. The meringue part was alright but the composition of the dessert which included creme anglaise, strawberry+meyer lemon sauce, a few pieces of fresh strawberrry didn't complement the dessert. Creme anglaise was quite weak. It tasted very eggy and the texture was a bit off. The strawberry+lemon sauce was alright but came too little to pull off other ingredients. I couldn't finish the dessert. Coffee was a life-saver when entree and dessert combined were too sweet. Service and ambience was good. Unlikely to go back.

This is one of my new favorite places in Palo Alto. I've had brunch and dinner twice now, and am always thinking of how to lure people to join me here. The atmosphere is hip yet casual. I would recommend coming with just one other person, because the wait (even on a weeknight) can be abhorrent with a group, and there are multiple places where you can eat at a counter, which is really only appropriate for two. Everything I've had here is good to great, and nothing feels so utterly unhealthy that you feel guilty the next day. I especially recommend the salmon salad. I have had the pork belly buns, and though tasty, they are really really fatty. Also, it's a great place to take your vegetarian friends (or yourself, if you are a vegetarian) because their vegetarian menu is really extensive and interesting.

their food is yummy. i would give a four stars to their food. but, their service is bad. i went there three times for brunch, and i don't know why i always get the same waiter. first two times his service was awful, we only gave him 4% tips and left a complain. third time he was great, that's probably because we were the only two tables there. my second time at the restaurant, i found a hair in my tofu scramble. they replaced it and offered us dessert. which is fine. like i said, their food is yummy. my third time there, ?same thing, food was yummy. i had the biscuit, but the cream was sour, i wasn't sure if that's what it was suppose to taste like, so they gave me another one with jam and butter. but, when my friends and i were chatting and having a good time, they cleaned out our table! and we weren't even done with our food yet! so we turned around and told him that (a different guy), he replied with a really bad attitude and said "i asked you if you are done with it and you didn't answer me!" i mean... what else can i do when he already stack all the plates together. and if we didn't answer you, that's obviously because we didn't hear you!! and my friend was still holding a little piece of bagel! wasn't that obvious that we were still working on it?!?! i'm really not pleased with their service. and there are other places that have good food and good service.

I wish we had a Calafia in my neighborhood. This is just a great spot for a casual lunch or dinner. The menu is wholesome, innovative, but familiar. The recipes remind me of meals we would attempt at home on days when we actually have time to peruse the market for ingredients and lovingly prepare them. But of course I'm not always blessed with the luxury of time to do that and plus Calafia does it with so much more flair and expertise! ;) The service here is also fabulous. The very first time I visited was for a friend's going away party and there was a minor misunderstanding with our reservations, which was resolved in a jiffy--before most of the party even realized anything was wrong. But then in addition to that, the owner even sent over appetizers for the table. It was a very gracious---not to mention yummy--gesture. Looking forward to more visits! :)

Even in a yuppie place like Palo Alto, I only knew of a couple of places that serves food that supports a Primal diet: Sprout and Pluto's. Even then, I'm sure Pluto's serves factory-farmed food. ? Thus, I was excited when a co-worker told me about Calafia. It's a restaurant run by Charlie Ayers, who ran the show over at Google. The food is all organic and locally-grown, so you know you're getting the best ingredients, and it shows in the food. I've been here for dinner and breakfast. For dinner, I had the sirloin steak. It's topped with a coffee molasses steak sauce and crispy onion strings. It comes plated with arugula salad as well. In the future, I'll probably pass on the onion strings, but only because of the health factor. Even though the steak didn't come out medium-rare like I asked, I was pretty happy with the end result. I'd also heard this place was good for breakfast, so I got my ass up at 6:30, hit the gym, and rewarded myself with a tasty lamb sausage omelette. I was glad the waiter accepted my request to sub out the toast/potatoes for a fruit plate without charging me extra (unlike some breakfast places I know, *cough* Hobees *cough*). ?I was a little surprised that fruit isn't mentioned on the menu. If any of the breakfast items came with real vegetables, I might be tempted to give this place 5 stars. ? Coffee is actually a little pricey at $3.00 -- had I known that, I might've just stuck with water. In general, just be prepared for a slightly more expensive meal, and don't be surprised if you get normal-sized portions. As an aside, Steve Jobs was sitting just a table away from me... his face buried in iPhone.

Town and Country has definitely classed up since I lived here and Calafia is part of this new Golden Age at T&C. ?They don't take reservations but make a "priority" list, which still meant we waited a while for a table for 3 at 7:30 p.m. on a Wednesday. ?Go figure. We shared brussels sprouts to start, which were nicely sauted and seasoned, if a tad too oily to feel totally healthy. ?My dining companions has the fiery bottom pork bowl (which is a favorite of his, and didn't fail to satisfy on this outing) and the double pork happiness. ?The second dish was a pork tenderloin and took a while to come out, and was unfortunately dry but we still all polished our plates. ? I had the tofu and lentil curry over brown rice, and am impressed with the vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free choices Calafia has, which are all probably as tasty as my vegetarian choice last night was. ?My dish was packed with protein and chard and yams, and there was a special kale salad that also sounded like a great healthy option. Our waitress Elise is new and she took great care of us. ?Looking forward to returning!

I can't believe it took me so long to get here! My friend and I were seated quickly, and the place was packed at lunch time. I love that the menu has vegetarian items on one side and meat-eaters items on the other, with a wide selection (though, admittedly, the ?menu didn't seem particularly cohesive). My friend had the shaking beef salad, which looked and smelled delicious, and I had the cold sesame udon noodle appetizer. The noodles were decently good, but I definitely did not feel great a few hours later. Unfortunately, the service was somewhat disappointing - our waiter wasn't friendly and we definitely felt hurried through the meal.

Well, the atmosphere is nice and the food is pretty good (though the menu needs a little expansion, imo) but the prices are really high for the amount of food you get. ?I'm not a big person, per se, I'm about 5' and 100 lbs. ?I paid $12 for a bowl of pasta with lamb sausage and I left hungry. ?Not just a little hungry, really hungry, like "let's go spend $10 at Taco Bell" hungry. ? So yeah, I like good food and I don't mind paying the price for that but... when I leave a restaurant... I want to be fed, okay?

I was in the area, needing a quick sandwich and found this place via yelp's ratings. ?Coming in I didn't realize the Market was apart of the restaurant itself. ?It's like a mini cafe attached to a nice restaurant. ?The restaurant looked upscale, nice and modern. ?The cafe was small, very simple and not as neat but I will say it was impeccably clean. ? Oddly, coming up to the counter the waiter didn't help me, though he helped the woman before me. ?Instead, I waited and waited and a chef helped me order. ?He was friendly and recommended the very popular club. ?With a short wait it was ready and he was the one to ring up my order as well - about $9 for the sandwich so not cheap. The ingredients were for sure quality, the wheat bread was thick, the turkey fresh, crisp veggies and very bold bacon. ?But honestly I wasn't a fan, the bacon took over the flavors and overall I felt everything seemed to heavy for a club. ?This pricey sandwich wouldn't have me coming back. Okay market. Okay food. Sorta pricey. Decent service.

What a great addition to the neighborhood! ?After being disappointed with Mayfield's, we decided to give the Calafia Caf¨¦ a try since they are right next door. Boy, am I glad I did so! ?First of all, the service is extremely friendly. ?After getting the somewhat pretentious attitude from Mayfield, it was a delight to be warmly welcomed into Calafia. ?The hostess did a great job of selling the place and convincing me to dine there a few weekends ago. ?After being seated, we were waited on by someone who is rapidly becoming our favorite waitress: Rachel (ask for her!). ?My 3-yr old son feel in love with her and that just about did it (now he always wants to go back). But this is not just about service... the food was great, too. ?We have dined there 3 times for breakfast and once for lunch. ?Each time at breakfast, I have ordered the omelet (which changes regularly; always an interesting combo). ?Perfectly cooked and served piping hot. ?My son usually gets a baked good of some sort; all of those have been good as well. ?And then there is the Clover-made coffee. Yum! ?I recommend going there just for that! ?A perfect cup of joe every time! Lunch was good as well. ?Ordered the duck dumplings and some jalapeno-jicama slaw with a Lagunitas IPA. ?The duck dumplings were quite good, but flirted with being overcooked. ?The slaw was nice - not too spicy and not too mayonnaisey (yes, that's a word!) - and, in the opinion of this wine lover, the beer was the perfect accompaniment. ?I grabbed a Clover-made coffee for the road and it was the perfect midday respite. I'll be back! ?Looking forward to trying dinner! ********************* Update: Went in yesterday and had an amazing lunch. ?The owner/chef was in the kitchen and decided he wanted to try out a new pizza. ?He sent it to our table on one condition: we give him honest feedback on the new creation. ?No problem. The pizza was targeting the breakfast/brunch audience. ?Thin crust topped with pesto, caramelized onions, bacon, and pouched eggs. ?WOW! ?It was abso-FREAKING-lutely amazing. ?Crunch of the crust contrasted with the soft onions. ?Sweetness in onions offset by the smokey/saltiness of the bacon and pesto. ?The perfectly pouched eggs added yummy yolk into the scene... stunning! ?We loved it so much, we ended up eating the entire thing and left what we had order untouched. ?We hope to see the item on the menu soon, but also wish him luck... the dish will be extremely difficult to execute consistently.

Never ceases to impress me. ?I've been to the restaurant three times total, and it's the only place in palo alto that doesn't disappoint or make me feel ripped off. ?Lunch was pretty good, more impressed by dinner. ?However the service is always good, and the food is well worth the money. ? Was there for brunch yesterday, which was fantastic. ?The blue max was delicious. ?I'm a slut for poached eggs, and these were excellent. ?In regards to service, I myself am in the industry and have been for the past 10 years. ?I go out to eat on my days off and have had every range of server imaginable. ?That being said, Jeremiah is the most memorable. ?He was fantastic, and a true asset as a server. ?He was friendly, accommodating, unpretentious and made the whole party I was laugh and feel welcome. ?The food is fantastic, but Jeremiah made the meal memorable. ?Thank you from one industry worker to another.

I love the intention behind this place and the pricing is quite reasonable for the great quality ingredients they use. Organic, healthy, local, sustainable without the pretention and high prices of most places that use these catch phrases; you can tell it's not just a gimmick with these people. I have long heard tales about how wonderful the food is at Google, and was thrilled to hear about the Google chef Charlie Ayers opening this place for us 'civilians'. Silicon Valley needs this place! I encourage everyone to try it. I'm hooked! I had the braised greens, gingered yam mash and rotisserie chicken. Yum! I love that they use healthy fats like almond butter but not too much! The balance between flavor and fat and oil usage is a hard one to find in most restaurants. Usually entrees are either brimming with fat, drowning in oil, or completely spartan and unseasoned (in the name of 'health'). Not here. ?The yam mash was a revelation, light, flavorful and not too sweet! The greens were tart with lime yet luxurious with the addition of a sensible amount of almond butter. ?The rotisserie chicken was made with a Rocky chicken and was well spiced and flavorful. Much better than Whole Foods' version. On another occasion I had the dragon's breath (great name!) ?curry noodles with eggplant and almond butter sauce. Another winner. Since I had the greens dish and gingered yam as sides with that meal also (I think I'm addicted) , I only ate part of the noodle dish and saved the rest for the next day. To my surprise, when I took the noodles out of the fridge the next day, they maintained a soft and delicate consistency unheated! That has never happened to me with any day old rice noodle dish from any other restaurant. Usually rice noodles harden and have to be reheated with a little water before they soften up again. (That didn't sound right.) But in this case they were still soft and delicate straight out of the fridge and I really enjoyed them cold. I have to ask them what these wonder noodles are! Dessert was some decadent chocolate dish which was a combo of mousse, cake and dark chocolate with two kinds of syrup on the side. After such a healthy feeling meal, you don't feel guilty about adding dessert and this one was so worth it. I only hope they expand the menu to include more rice bowls and more variety. I have not tried the pizzas or sandwiches but they looked good. I will be sure to be a regular at this place!

hip, bright, and clean. Incredible flavors. fabulous service. my only advice is to know that you will spend some money and plates are on the smallish side, but my friend and I split and appetizer and dessert, so it's more for people that like to try smaller portions of a few different things. I personally couldn't afford to come here every day, but for an occasional treat, it's well worth it!

I highly recommend the apple galette thing. ?It's delicious.

Had a tasty weekend brunch, but it was a bit pricey. ?I got the lamb sausage with eggs and hashbrowns. ?The sausage was amazing, the eggs were pretty typical, and the hashbrowns were vehicles for ketchup, also typical. ?The same eggs and hashbrowns would cost what, $4-5? ?The sausage was delicious, and I would be willing to pay $5 for them again. The OJ tastes *very* fresh, and was served in one of those little wine carafes. ?How big are those, 6oz? ?Again, though delicious, $3 is a little steep for not even a full cup of juice.

Atmosphere: weird! Strange square light things in the waiting area, pieces of 'aged' wood on the ceiling, and a giant photograph of some kind of concert from the sixties on the wall. Chairs were horribly uncomfortable, which might be good if they're trying to get fast turn-over. Bathrooms: OH MY GOD YOU HAVE GONE AGAINST ALL BATHROOM TRADITION!!! WHY??? People love having bathroom privacy, so why in the world would you make the handwashing area (sinks and mirrors) visible to the whole restaurant? And why would you put those little "vacant/occupied" signs on the bathroom doors that remind me of port-o-potties in construction sites or airplanes? Those cheap Toto toilets do not make up for the very strange and public design of the bathroom. Food: I had the duck dumpling appetizer for my meal. Fried and delicious, I ate all 8 of them extremely quickly. I also loved the fried green beans. Spring rolls and french fries were uninteresting... don't get them. The servers treated us well and all food came out on time and in the right order.

I had the Turkey Mushroom Buger and Jicama Jalapeno. As a previous reviewer said, the decor is very modern and has a very SF feel. The burger was tasty and unique (I couldn't tell it was turkey). Instead of fries I tried their Jicama Jalapeno. It ?was the first time I had it and it was interesting... One complaint I have is that their smoothies are good, but over priced ($5/each).

Had lunch here with friends while visiting the Bay Area. Brunch, more accurately -- I'd forgotten it was Saturday and was surprised to see a server walk past us holding a plate of pancakes, until we were seated and given the weekend Brunch menu. The decor was very modern, dark wood and clean lines and quirky touches (like the milk bottle chandelier above our communal table, made out of reclaimed bottles from a closed-down dairy, so our server said). The bathroom design is unique, in my experience, with a communal sink/mirror flanked by individual locking cubicles with toilets in them ?(2 for men, 4 for women), but no separate door to the sink/mirror area, and very loud hand-dryers. A little odd, but in keeping with the rest of the ultra-modern decor. The server didn't seem thrilled when our party of 5 asked for separate checks, but obliged. Unfortunately, the electronic handheld order device lost one of our party's meals in the process, so 4 of us had our meals before the last actually had her order put in. The server had done a breeze-by of the table after our meals were brought out and thought she saw all of us with food, so she didn't notice until we flagged her down to ask about the last plate. Still, the last meal came out fairly quickly. I ordered the Calafia Breakfast, which was eggs, hashbrowns, bacon and toast. Standard fare, nothing special, but nicely prepared (though my over-easy eggs were more like over-medium). Prices were good and if I lived in the area I'd probably return to see their lunch and dinner specials.

Recommended to me by my sister and since I was able to find a http://restaurant.com gift certificate I thought why not try this place. We were seated at the communal table in the front of the restaurant. The service was EXTREMELY slow. The food was actually pretty good. ?I had steak which was well flavored, my daughter had pasta which she really enjoyed, and my husband had the special of the day which he liked. ?Dessert was okay. ?The restaurant had a nice atmosphere. ?It also has a small market where you can buy food to go. ?They specialize in "wholesome" foods. Parking was easy, prices are reasonable especially with a http://restaurant.com gift certificate.

In a nutshell: Food: 4 stars P/C: 4 stars Service: 4 stars I can't believe I haven't written reviews yet for this location. ?It has become the token brunch place for me in the peninsula area. ?I've been there for lunch and for drinks as well - but the brunch menu is really good and I highly recommend. One thing that sets Calafia apart from others is its service - the servers are cool, calm and relaxed. ?Always very inviting and makes you feel welcomed. ?Of course, they are very knowledgeable and attentive to customers' needs. ?Just this time around - there was this really annoying couple sitting behind us, and the same server, Carlos, waited for them. ?They were like - I don't like this and that, don't put too much of this and that, and make sure you add this and that and I am allergic to blah blah blah. ?Cry me a freaking river - if I were Carlos, I'd be like, don't waste your money here and go cook your own freaking food.... ...intesad, Carlos was very courteous and smiled the whole time that he was listening to the pesky requests. ?Go Carlos! The food was very good - my friend got the eggs chiapas and I got the blue max - perfectly seasoned (some people may think underseasoned, but I love the simplicity of the flavors) and fresh ingredients. ?There's nothing pretentious about the dishes that Calafia serves - they use quality ingredients, prepared simply and well. The prices of the dishes could be a bit more economical - I know that the ingredients are fresh and the location is prime and everything, but the brunch items could very well be under $10..in my opinion. ? Other than that, it was another pleasant Saturday morning at Calafia!

Here's the review summary: Quality of food = 4 stars Homemade ketchup = bonus star Total = 5 stars The homemade ketchup almost made me cry. It was so f***ing good! I had it with garlic fries, and all over my burger and fries. The ketchup has a potent note of apple cider and many spices. The menu options are amazing with many meat and vegetarian options. The pizzas looked excellent as well. I ordered chicken wings for an appetizer, and they were tasty. I'd perhaps be happier with larger portions, but then again, I always say this. I'm a guy, I like to eat, and I like to eat a lot when the food is good. Will I be coming back? Abso-tut-e-lutely. Will I set a Guinness record for ketchup consumed in one meal? Stay tuned and I'll let you know.

Pleasantly surprised by this place. ?After reading the reviews by other yelpers, I was not sure what to expect, but ended up leaving happy and full of good food. As I went with a bunch of vegans and vegetarians, we stuck to those selections. ?I split the tofu lentil loaf with mashed potatoes, and enjoyed this as my main dish. ?The potatoes were amazing and such a great flavor. ?The lentil loaf was good, but not outstanding. ? The best thing I ate here was the chard appetizer, which was some time of mashed/creamed chard with almond butter. ?Everyone at the table agreed this was the best dish out of everything we ordered. ?We also split a butternut squash salad, red, brown and black (bean) appetizer, and lettuce cups. ?All were very tasty and had decent portion size. My friend ordered the vegan love fest pizza, which looked great, and he enjoyed it. ?I was also able to taste the grain shitake mushroom bowl, which was good, but not anything I couldn't reproduce. For desert they were out of the monkey cake, which was the only vegan option. ?I may come back to try it, as it sounded interesting (banana, chocolate). ? The space is inviting, large open tables and nice lighting. ?I would suggest coming here to a large group, as it is accommodating and has a diverse menu.

This place is quite good. ?Run by an ex-Google executive chef, the food is wonderful, with fresh ingredients and a wide range of geographic influences. It gets pretty crowded at lunch and gets a little cramped and noisy. ?So it is not a great place for a quiet lunch, but the food is well worth it. My friend and I had both had specials -- I had a Portugese seafood stew that was fantastic and my friend had a beef tenderloin salad with heirloom tomatoes that was pricey at $23 but, in his estimation (and he paid!) well worth it.

Calafia Cafe is a typical "I'm healthy and I'm coming here after my workout because I'm so fit" brunch spot. I tried one of their fruit smoothies, which wasn't as thick as I would like, and overly heavy on the bananas. For my entree I got chicken and waffles. I liked that the fried chicken batter wasn't the typical breaded fried stuff...it was the smoother, thicker, and tastier batter commonly used outside fried banana or fried ice cream desserts. The waffle was also not a typical waffle - it was flatter and tasted more compact but it was still good. My friend got the granola and yogurt, which looked pretty standard. I may have to come back here to try some of the other dishes before I judge, but for now, I think there are plenty other brunch spots to gain weight at than Calafia.

If I would have written a review for Calafia a year ago when I visited, it wouldn't have been so high. The food tastes rather bland across the board. HOWEVER, my husband and I just started a cleanse (the Clean Program) where our ingredient options are very specific. So far, dining out has been a challenge. But Calafia had several menu options that worked perfectly for us and the two we got were very satisfying. We noticed that many menu items were Gluten Free as well as Vegan and Vegetarian. There's a reason the food here isn't TO DIE FOR: it's really quite good for you. :) It's easy to eat healthy or with lots of dietary restrictions at Calafia. Much appreciated.

This apparently is a POPLUAR place in Palo Alto....I went for dinner here with some Ladies from work. Me not knowing and after being told by one person(a Doctor) that this palce was really GREAT!!!! Well, me being from the SOUTH (GEORGIA) knew not what to expect. It's located in a plaza with many other venues and TRADER JOE'S..Parking is very cramped and you are LUCKY to find a space. I am not a true wine drinker but dable every now and again I was suggested to drink a PLUM WINE....One WORD FABULOUS!!!! other Ladies had Vegan Plate, Pepperoni Pizza and I had the wings. The food was nice, our server was NOT the best he chose not to introduce himself to the table and he was not very helpful seeing that some of us were 1st timers. The atmosphere is pleasing if you sit inside or out. ?I thinik next time I will try the burger. They do have the pad so you can order your food yourself and pay at your table..Maybe next time that's what we should do and not bother with a server it may save us a TIP!!!!

I've been here twice already. The first time was at one of Charlie's friends and family preview nights. My friends and I ordered several dishes and ate them family style. The food was tasty and it was nice catching up with Charlie. The second time around, I dropped by and ordered some items to go because I was too lazy to cook dinner that evening. I was just coming from the gym and I was starving. I ordered several of the vegetarian dishes (sushi verduras, daily tempura, eggplant tiger bowl, crimson quinoa salad, chilly udon noodles, and braised greens & almond butter). I couldn't get home fast enough. The food smelled so good. When I finally got home, I was not disappointed - even the tempura held up. I gobbled up Charlie's food and felt good about it because I know that Charlie makes his food only with the bestest, freshest ingredients. I can't wait for when the Market a-go-go part of his cafe opens up (which is next month, by the way). Update (2/16): Just had to upgrade this place. Charlie has added three types of hamburgers to the menu and I get the feeling that more yummy options will be added as he goes along.

I just tried the cinnamon roll and biscuit (See photos). ?both highly recommended. ?The cinnamon roll is really greasy, so it's best if you can warm it up. I tried the Clover-brewed coffee. ?The bean of the day was Barefoot Coffee's Santa Colomba, described as "Heavy & Husky: A nicely low toned, with notes of a sweet nutty milk chocolate bar. Hints of marzipan and almond." ?The baristas are "Barefoot Coffee certified." ?First, they measure out an exact amount of coffee (see my photo), then the Clover machine goes to work. ?The result was indeed good, not great; the coffee had an initial sour taste, then blossomed into a savory finish at the end of each sip. The coffee cake was meh. ?The pate de fruit was too soft and mushy, as if they forgot to add enough pectin.

We've been to Calafia twice now for brunch. Both times, the food was excellent--we went with their breakfast menu and opted to sit at the bar (which is a great way to see what the popular menu items are!) The things we saw coming off the line most: Blue Max Eggs Chiapas Bacon Queen Calafia's Cheese Burger Roasted Chicken Salad with Persimmons We ordered coffees, which come in a tall glass with a big thing of cream (I challenge you to use it all!) and brown/white sugar cubes. The coffee was brewed to perfection, if I were to guess--I'd say it came out of a french press. For our meal, we ordered the Blue Max (Hashbrowns topped with saut¨¦ed mushrooms and spinach with two poached eggs, melted swiss cheese and lemon hollandaise with black forest ham) and a Buckwheat Pancake to share. It was the perfect amount of food, and it was clean-your-plate good. We'll definitely be ordering that one again! On our second visit, we wanted to try something different and went with the Calafia's Biscuits & Mushroom Gravy (Served with two eggs any style, two lamb sausage links and two buttermilk biscuits topped with mushroom gravy) and a side of bacon. The main dish was good, but it couldn't hold a candle to the Blue Max. I wouldn't order it again, but it definitely wasn't bad. The bacon on the other hand.....holy hell. ORDER THE BACON. You will not regret it and it's worth every calorie. We love Calafia, it's becoming one of our stand-bys on the weekend. And, the bar seems to stay pretty open or have a short wait that's worth waiting.

I'm basing this review on just my only visit today. I had their Palo Alto Club, which was described as ?"Roasted and sliced Diestel turkey breast, apple wood smoked bacon, leaf lettuce, tomato & mayonnaise on toasted multi-grain bread." ? First off, the bread was not toasted. In fact, it was a roll, which is just plain wrong for a Club. ?A club should be a double-decker sandwich. If it's on a oval-shaped roll, it's a hoagie or a sub, right? Next, way too much turkey. Bacon was hard, as if it had been fried off the day before. ?Mealy tomato. Overall, just a lousy sandwich. All for the fat price of $9.25.

Manager came over to our table and yelled at us for an unopened case a beer that we purchased next door for a tailgate later, and also about the service corridor.

For a new restaurant that was packed at lunch time, they still went above and beyond to accommodate us at lunchtime and seat myself, my coworker and our client. The menu was good with enough food offerings to make everyone happy.......and everything had a fresh twist on it. I had the eggplant panini and it was delicious, came out quickly despite the packed house and lunch rush, so despite being new that was quite impressive. Great place to come for personal entertaining and for business.

I'm the first person to give extra points for local, organic foods, but........ Things just weren't executed well. ?It was the chef's day off, but still. Harsh constructive criticism (eek): - Arepas were dry doughy and crumbly versus authentic crispy and then chewy. - Summer rolls (listed as spring rolls) were obviously made hours ago and just pulled out of the cold fridge. ?Tough, thick skins, bland insides. - Rice noodles w/ curry and tofu were so dry that you couldn't dish a portion out of the bowl. One, solid mass. ?Sadly sent that one back. - Was seeking salvation in the simple margherita pizza, and it ended up bland and too thick cheeze. On the upside, beautiful earthy design. ?Nice patio......

Oh, Calafia, I really want to like you. Your menu is vast, and so many of the dishes sound intriguing with such interesting combinations of ingredients. And yet...I so consistently end up underwhelmed. Unfortunately, the dish I chose last night didn't meet even that meager standard. I went with the Eggplant, Millet, and Kale w/yellow curry sauce accompanied by Puffy Tofu. Sounds great, right? Alas. The sauce was watery, pale and had very little flavor. The eggplant, even though cut in a small dice, was undercooked and thus rubbery and tasteless. I could not detect a speck of seasoning in the dish, which was bland, bland, and more bland. The outside tables, at least, are not set with salt & pepper shakers, which I actually respect. After all, the food coming out of the kitchen should be seasoned appropriately. But no. As for the "puffy tofu," I don't know what you picture, but pillows and clouds came to my mind, something light and airy. The four largish cubes were golden brown, and I had hight hopes, but I was a little put off when I had trouble actually getting my fork to penetrate one. ?I persevered, though, and put one in my mouth. It was akin to working my way through a kitchen sponge. Virtually inedible, and inexcusable. Needless to say, the rest stayed in the bowl. Had we not been dining with another couple, I would have, for the first time in my life, sent the dish back and ordered something else. To be absolutely fair, my husband ordered two of the specials, a salad and a pizza, and the bites I had of both were tasty. We also shared a banana split for dessert (which I sorely deserved), and it was delish. For that, I am awarding the two stars; if this review was based on my dish alone, I would award none if that was possible. And therein lies the problem with Calafia -- incredible inconsistency. Charlie Ayers, you need to run, not walk, down there and take control of your kitchen. I cannot believe that your chefs are tasting the food before sending it out. And if they are, and then sending it out anyway, well shame on them.

We stopped by here after hearing good reviews and reading about the place on yelp. ?We were there at around 1 on Sunday afternoon. First thing first.. the food was good. I would definitely come back. ?The bathroom setup is interesting and over all atmosphere is good. Food came super fast. ? What I didn't like was the wait staff.To list all of the mistakes that guy made would take forever, but here are a few of the highlights: Our waiter never told us about the specials. ? Never came by the table to refill the water... the only time he came by was to pick up the check. Even then, he made this comment, "just on time". Huh? Excuse me... Forgot to put in an order for my fiance's soju cocktail. ?So she never got it...(I had to double check the bill to make sure)... did i forget to mention that their was only a handful of people in the place when we sat down. ?So he has no excuse... he could have whipped out his little palm and placed the order. If I get over this initial experience and go back, I'll turn and walk out the door if I see the same waiter. ? So disappointing to get bad service... at a place that has so much potential.

This place is pure win. It is an excellent restaurant for meat-eaters and vegans to dine together at. ?I like the waitstaff and enjoy the plethora of good options. The food is extremely tasty and there is vegan cake... so that pretty much owns. I can only eat there every once in a while as its very rich though. Oh well... better to be delicious and rich than crappy and bland.

I read about this place in a food magazine (probably Food & Wine), so I was in the area today and stopped by to get an order to go: ?juice, duck dumplings and the Raw Deal salad. First, I should say the bartender who took my order was super gracious and efficient, and the male host today was also friendly and helpful and kind. My disappointment is with my juice - carrot, orange juice, peaches (ok, I asked them to leave off the yogurt, honey and agave, so perhaps this was why it tasted so disappointing), add ginger. My juice tasted like mildly artificially flavored ice - first of all, why was there even f'ing ice in my supposedly freshly squeezed juice? Second, no flavors of oranges, peaches, ginger or carrot. Did I bloody get handed crushed ice with orange coloring? My duck dumplings were good, however, and the salad was standard - healthy & yummy. Service was good, again. But I will not be going back probably. I will get my own juicer and go to the Plant Cafe.

The service was attentive and prompt and the food was exactly as advertised - interesting, fresh, tasty and moderately priced. I will definitely be back!

This review is based only on Market A Go Go... A great place to pick up a quick lunch (a small bowl of cavatappi with a turkey bolognese sauce for LESS THAN $5!): salads, sandwiches - yum! Add a self-checkout register (or two) and you and your lunch are ready to go! Though, I wish their pizzas were available to go at the market- hint, hint. ps - for all you working moms, they also have dinner packs in the market that look good!

"They make healthy food look sexy." My bf said this on our second or third visit and it's true. We're a fan of their chinese chicken salad.. so yummy. I really like this place for a number of reasons. I like the food, I like the ambiance (harkens a bit to Google cafeterias, as well as the gastronomy style.. but with Palo Alto chic), and I like the bar area where you can see the chefs preparing. Oh, and their cola with AGAVE is a totally delicious. Beats any fountain soda! A bit surprised they have to-go boxes.. Chef Ayers if you're reading this, I hope you're laughing :)

Heard great things about this place - I went to the Calafia for dinner but the to-go market looked cute! I followed our server's recommendation of the chicken on the "not so little plates menu" and it was GREAT! Had lamb meatballs as an appetizer - I'm not the biggest lamb fan but this was great! highly recommended. Good ambiance.

Lots of good vegetarian options. The best thing: Jicama Jalapeno Slaw! ?So spicy and delicious! Love the homemade sodas with agave. The veggie burger is yummy. The tofu verde wrap is pretty bland though. ?All you can taste is bland brown rice. ?Little skimpy on tofu and beans. ?Can't taste the verde salsa at all.

What a great new find! Dined here last weekend and now i want to go back, just because there was so much on the menu that enticed me. Can't say I was thrilled with my pick, the turkey burger, because it wasn't as flavorful as it could've been but I took many bites from what my boyfriend ordered, the pork rice bowl (I think) and it was DELICIOUS!!! Yes, that's three exclamation marks. It was that good. Only thing- I would recommend not going with a big group of friends- the seating doesn't accommodate for screaming over heads, as the only multi-seating dining tables are long and thin. Can't wait to try brunch here :)

Came back for a weekday lunch and had a somewhat better experience. My lamb burger was okay -- not bad, but not amazing. Fries came with this spicy red sauce that I couldn't decide if I liked; I would've preferred plain old Ketchup. I really liked my friend's butternut squash pizza though (special of the day). When our waiter first described it to us, I immediately thought "Pass" because I love meat. After tasting a slice though, I was pleasantly surprised. It was a flat bread pizza so the flavors of the butternut squash really stood out. Will definitely go for one of their pizzas if I come back.

I tried take-out from the Market side for lunch again today. My turkey sandwich was even sadder than last time. ?$9.25 for untoasted sourdough bread that fell apart as I was eating it, mayo, a couple of lettuce leaves, and turkey. ?The meat was good quality, for sure; but I have had better sandwiches from local grocery stores with similar meat, with more produce, sometimes with cheese, and at a lower price (Mollie Stone's, Draeger's, etc.). ? Maybe the chef is too interested in keeping in control of fancier offerings, of his staff, or in watching customers through the ceiling-mounted camera. ?I either missed last time or it's a new thing that there are signs saying "you're on camera/the chef is watching you from the kitchen." ? It's good to not keep that a secret; but I've gotta say that, even if it's meant as being light-hearted, it's a bit creepy. This time, the service folks were friendly and not quite so sad looking; so that was nice. What saved my meal from a lower overall rating yet again was dessert. ?Alas, no tartlets to be seen and the variety on offer was moderate; but the raspberry bar I chose was simply luscious. ? I don't think I'll be making an effort to go back anytime soon for lunch; but, if I'm driving by and luck out with parking, I will run in to nab dessert.

Tried this cute little place yesterday and we loved it. They had some great vegan choices and the staff were super friendly and helpful. The food was amazing, you can truly taste that they use fresh ingredients. I had the Tofu scramble with fruit, and my husband had the veggie burger with the jicama and jalape?o slaw, both were delicious! We will be back!

Just shy of 4 stars. ?After my pancake sins of yesterday I opted for something light and healthy today. ?There's a whole page of vegetarian menu items in addition to their carnivore menu. ?http://calafiapaloalto.c¡­ I got the Goat cheese arugula panini with onion marmalade, pumpkin & hemp seed pesto, mozzarella cheese on a ciabatta roll. ?http://www.yelp.com/user¡­ ?It was definitely for light appetites and I must admit I felt great when I left here. ?The onion marmalade was the star of this sandwich, which was nice; however, I probably wouldn't order again. Still, I like what they're doing here and want to try more vegetarian dishes. ?If I understand Chef Charlie Ayers (chef/owner) approach in his cookbook, he looked at food's effect on the brain and body scientifically when he was the head chef at Google, serving different food items at different times of day so it would affect performance accordingly. ?Interesting concept. ?I'd better have a productive day today! ? P.S. ?The Market side of this place has chicken pot pie to go for $4.95 and mac & cheese for $3.95--looks to be enough for 2 people. ?They also have house-made gravlax at $13-something for 10 oz., and it's very good. There are many other take-out items, but these are the ones that caught my eye.

Wholesome food and a fun place to eat alone or in a group. Calafia recently opened in Town and Country, and provides a welcome addition to Hobbee's. ?The atmosphere is friendly and has a number of unusual seating options for any size group. The opening menu is interesting. ?I'd like to see larger portions for the salads - I ordered one for lunch, and no one warned me it was going to be tiny! ?It was too fancy/modern in portion size. ?It was delicious, I only wish I had more of it. Several vegan choices - an eggplant stew that is tasty, but could use more vegetables + less mushrooms. ?It's sort of boring/dry the way it is, though it tastes like something you could eat every day. Drinks like fresh juices offered with lunch and dinner would be a great addition. ?(ex. Sprout Cafe offers fresh carrot juice.) ?Also, some high end teas would be nice, and not difficult to add to the menu. Dessert menu had a vegan sticky bun which I couldn't try being allergic to gluten, and unfortunately lacked any fruit based desserts, or ethnic desserts (berries with sorbet, coconut tapioca, etc) that usually save me from gluten filled dessert options. ?There was some chocolate flourless thing, but I'm not sure it was vegan, and I don't eat chocolate regardless. Sushi appetizer was not great - rice was way too hard. ?(try Homma's instead) ?Sides were good - chard with almond butter, and carrot salad both were tasty, though too strongly flavored/salted for one person to eat the entire side. Also, being vegan and allergic to gluten, this seems like exactly the kind of restaurant that would be all over that and label the menu accordingly. ?Unfortunately, I had a lot of trouble finding out from the servers what I could eat on the menu - though they were friendly and tried to be helpful, this was clearly an issue that had not been considered thoroughly in advance. For a restaurant that is supposed to be organic and unusual, I was surprised that there were not more radically unusual items in the menu offerings. ?Hopefully, as Calafia becomes better established they will branch out into even more unusual dishes. Calafia is off to a great start - when it smooths out service and irons out the menu offerings, it will definitely be 5 stars.

I am so excited about this restaurant. As a vegan, when I want to go out to dinner I typically end up driving from the Peninsula to San Francisco. There are just not enough restaurants here that have a menu that offers more than one item I can order and a groovy atmosphere. Calafia has it. The decor is eclectic and the layout encourages you to order a huge glass of wine or beer from their nicely chosen list and relax while you wait for your table. Mr. Charlie Ayers came over and brought us vegan tofu spring rolls with a fabulous dipping sauce while we got on the wait list for counter seating, which gives a great view of the chefs cooking away, but a table came open and we were upgraded. The menu is perfect. As a vegan there were many items that looked amazing and for once I had options! My husband, who eats meat, also had many organic entrees to choose from and eventually we both just asked the waitress to pick for us. I got the lentil loaf, and it was one of the best vegan meals I have had. The loaf was firm but just ?chewy enough, and the sauce was just outstanding. The potatoes and greens were a perfect side dish. My husband got the spicy pork bowl, and he enjoyed every bite. I cant wait to go back to try the pizzas, noodle bowls, etc.

Meh. ?Exactly. ? I was excited when I saw the menu, there were lots of things I wanted to try which rarely happens. ?I ended up getting the tacos. ?Meat was pretty tasty and well cleaned. ?I only picked out a couple little pieces of fat. ?I asked for no onions on my tacos. ?You get three tacos with this dish. ?Two of my tacos were onion free, one had onions. ?Kinda weird, right? ?The bbq sauce they put on the tacos ruined them, it was extremely sour and tangy. ?I also had their mojito - I don't think it had any alcohol in it, but it was refreshing and pretty large..... just tasted like seltzer water though, no sugar, lime, or mint flavor. My bf had the burger, he said it was pretty good, but that the best part was the bun..... odd again, right? ?The french fries were really good and really thin, which I like.... but the ketchup was extremely sour too. We ended up going here with two of our friends very last minute so I had no time to check it out beforehand, they'd never been to it either..... but I had to stop and ask them if it was a sugar-free free restaurant. ?Which would be fine with me, kinda cool even..... but they said no, so I can't figure out why everything they served was sour. ? Anyways,..... disappointing but not enough to flame them. ?I just wouldn't go back. ?OH, and our waiter sucked pretty hard. ?He pretty much disappeared for the night once he took our order. ?And our appetizers came out only about 2 minutes before our dinner did. ? Eh, oh well.

I LOVE this place. I've had great service each and every time I've been, the food is UNBELIEVABLE, and the wine/beers rock my socks off. ?I've been on at least four occasions now, have had something different each time, and have never been disappointed. Had a dinner with a professor, a group of friends, and even a date here, and it works for any type of dinner. On top of it all, this place is adorable. The bottle chandelier is cute, being able to watch your food being prepared is neat, and then you can shop at the market, if anything really caught your fancy. ?Can't say enough good things. Really.

I am torn on my decision on Califia. ?The service is a persistently lackluster based on the 3+ times I have dined here and the food is hit or miss. ?The atmosphere in the resto is great, but the seating arrangement was poorly planned having all four tops and no deuces. ?There is quite a bit of bar style and community seating as well. The lentil loaf (minus the gray) is extraordinary and the pizzas are okay. ?When waning a smaller portion I ordered the pot pie off the kids menu, I was delivered mac n' cheese (which was dry and not so yummy). ?Finally my intended order had arrived and it tasted like pure starch. This would not me my first recommendation for a sit down dinner. ?The Market A Go-Go is great for quick food and has an extensive salad bar. Overall it's okay. ?Not anything more, not anything less.

My friends and I checked out this place on Friday - we loved it so much we came back on Monday! :) When you walk in, you're immediately refreshed with how cool and clean the place looks. Its very contemporary yet not overly so. The color scheme is natural and greens and yellows and very soothing. We 3 sat down just oohing and aahing at the decor. ? If the servers reflect the restaurant, then I must say Carlos is the reason I gave the restaurant 5 stars - he was fun, friendly and (most importantly) very efficient! :) Friday we ordered burgers and one ordered noodles. ?I have to say, I wasn't very fond of the bun on the burgers - it bit too much bun if you know what I mean. Otherwise, delish. Today however, I was wow'd beyond expectations when I ordered the Chicken and Zucchini pizza - it was delicous and no complaint what so ever. Easy on the budget as well as the prices average around $10-$12. I definitely seeing us going back again and again. :)

Calafia cake - like a hostess hoho/ding-dong for adults. LOVE IT! Salads - prepacked or fresh are excellent but they're not cheap. Sandwiches - we had the club and it was OK...a bit dry but packed with turkey and good if dipped into the salad dressing that came with the salad. BIG TURN OFF: when the guy at the counter points to the frig and says, we have a premade one in the frig and "guides" us to the cold one...um, no, I think I'd like mine fresh, thanks. He gave no attitude when we asked for it to be made so that was nice but really, do you think I want the one that's been sitting around for half a day?

Not bad but not great. ?The decor is cool, and the hostess was very friendly. ?I thought the milk-bottle lamp array was very clever. ? I went with a group and had brunch; it was average. ?The service was weak; our server didn't come by to ask us how we were doing until we were almost finished. ?This might not have mattered except for the fact that there was something missing with my meal, and I couldn't seem to flag anyone down. ?Overrated.

May replace Mayfield as my favorite brunch place in Palo Alto. Delicious, tasty, and reasonably priced. French press coffee is rich w/ beautiful chocolate-y hues.

I really like the food here A LOT. It's always been good, and I've been about 5 times now. Brunch is probably my favorite, but I had a great lunch the other day and would recommend it for that as well. It's just really good food. The service is hit or miss. I've had both really great experiences and pretty bad ones. It also bothers me that every time I come here there are SO MANY KIDS. I get it, it's hard to take kids out to restaurants. My issue is that 90% of the time, these are the Palo Alto brats whose parents don't control them, and they end up throwing food all over the floor and just making a big mess. I know this isn't Calafia's fault, but it really puts a damper on my meal when the kid at the table next to me is screaming and throwing its mac and cheese on the ground. If your kids aren't ready to eat at a sit-down restaurant, don't bring them. Come for the food, because it's delicious and worth it. Just hope you don't end up sitting next to a curmudgeon like me who hates your kids. :)

I've been 4 or 5 times now, and the fact that I can't remember if it was 4 or 5 is a bad sign. ?The food hasn't been memorable. ?The inattentive service has been. Last night, a Thursday, our party of 3 arrived at 7PM. ?The place was not crowded and we were seated immediately near the center of the restaurant. ?Then we languished, thirsty and starving, for 8 or 9 minutes before we got any attention whatsoever. ? ?The waiter was friendly and sort of apologized for our wait which got me over my discomfort for the moment. We finally got some water, but no bread was served. ? Zero stars so far.... Our appetizers, 2 servings of chicken drumettes and the jicama salad, were fairly tasty. 3 stars for the apps... My wife ordered their burger with fries. ?I watched her burger sit on the bar for 6 or 7 minutes before it was served to her, and her skinny fries were cold by the time she got them. ? My "Very Angry" pork tacos were a total disappointment, flavor-wise. ?The pork was succulent, but the only thing angry was me. ?The waiter had even warned me that they were going to be super-spicy (Yum!). ?But they were bland, not even salted. ?The only flavor I could detect came from the excessive amount of cilantro all over them. My daughter's chicken burger was so-so, she didn't mind it. So the food on the whole rated two stars. ? Spent 70 bucks and came away very disappointed. Anyway... poor service, mediocre food most of the times we've tried it.

Returned for dinner last Friday and the place was bustling much more than at brunch. The market is up and running as well. While waiting for a table took a stroll through the display cases and was pretty impressed. If I worked in the area the salad bar would be a great place to visit. We turned down the counter facing the front window because it really isn't comfortable. So without a reservation we ended up at the bar to dine. Service was okay - not exceptional but nothing outwardly wrong either. We started with the duck and shiitake dumplings. A long plate arrived with what appeared to be potstickers in more of a square pouch shape. A ponzu inspired dipping sauce was served on the side. The filling was not the shredded duck as described more of a minced or ground filling. Not bad, not worthy of a return visit to order again. The wife was craving a burger and was not disappointed. She thought it was one of the best burgers had in a long time. When it arrived she asked for condiments and the bartender returned with two ramekins - one mustard and the other ketchup. Not too surprising but upon tasting each of these it was evident that they're made in house. Big PLUS++ It was served with a nice coleslaw with thinly sliced jalapenos (no ribs or seeds) but not too spicy. Spicy was reserved for my dish - the fiery bottom bbq pork rice bowl. A shredded pork shoulder bathed in a HOT ketchup based sauce accented with orange zest and warm spices. This sat atop a bed of raw baby spinach and brown rice. Garnishing the whole dish was a sunny side up quail egg. Absolutely AMAZING dish if you can withstand the heat. Get ready for some water, milk or whatever you need to cool the palate. Overall we'll return for the food. Charlie can be found walking around the dining room speaking with guests and making sure they're taken care of. Let's hope the rest of his staff can follow suit.

I met a friend here for lunch today and I was pleasantly surprised. It carries the essence of a cute trendy bistro, with out the high prices. The menu looked so interesting. There were many things on the menu I would like to go back and try, there were many tasty sounding flavor combos! Today I decided to try the Eggplant and Spinach Pannini, it was excellent! we had the garlic fries for an appetizer and they were phenomenal, get them, they are a MUST! They are served with the chef's version of ketchup, which is a bit sweeter then regular ketchup, the waiter told us it has hints of cinnamon and honey in it. yummy! Other posts have complained about the service, however I didn't notice anything lacking in this department. He was rather attentive and friendly. ?Bathrooms are clean and individualized, i.e. private stalls but public hand wash area, this was awkward when I had tried to fix my hair in the mirror because it is rather visible in the restaurant. oh well. I will definitely go back, it was a perfect lunch spot; quick, tasty and reasonably priced for a Palo Alto restaurant.

A friend of mine told me about this place a while back. So I finally decided to try it out..andthen I came back the following week and took another friend. We all loved it!! We sat at the bar so we can see all the food coming out of the kitchen. The bar is the BEST seat in the house if you have 3 or less people. (so we can see what people were ordering and what looked good!) The first visit was a good sampling of their vegetarian items. I was PLEASANTLY surprised as it was really good! I couldn't get enough of the Tofu Lentil Loaf with Miso Mushroom Gravy...Delicious. The texture was like a regular meatloaf and was tasty. I finished the entire dish. I tried both the mashed potatoes and the gingered mashed yams....OMG the yams were sooooo good! The mashed potatoes were good as well..but I preferred the yams! We also tried the Tofu Verde Wrap...ask for extra Tomatillo Sauce..it'll make it much tastier! YUM YUM. That was our first meal there and the following week I returned again. The Spicy Napa Salad...wouldn't get it again...there was NO SPICE and felt the flavor lacked a little bit of flavor. However, my friend had the Turkey Burger and raved, the New Bohemia Salad was really tasty as well. The service was wonderful! So spot on and very informed about their menu and when I was interested about the decor. Jerome our waiter gave us alot of info! Very cool that they used recycle wood/glass etc very green. I actually liked the layout of the bathroom because instead of stalls..you get your own bathroom - nice and enclosed! I haven't tried out the market yet..but it actually looked good.

Came here twice for dinner after I discovered all these new restaurants popping up in the revitalized Town and Country. ?What drew me to the restaurant is the cool decor -- you can tell the owner/designer really cared about presentation and the look and feel of things. The modern, casual atmosphere makes it quite inviting for families and single diners. ?The seating arrangement is also fun -- there is a communal table, a counter section facing the kitchen, a bar area by the market, regular table section and a nice waiting area. ?Absolutely love the wooden stools at the communal table, and the industrial chandelier overhead. Sat the counter both times -- there is a special hook underneath the counter for the ladies to hang their purses. ?Nice! ?The meticulousness of design continued into the selection of serve ware -- I particularly loved the serving set of the Mac N Cheese, which comes on a little wooden tray with cut out holes to hold the small Le Creuset casserole, it's lid and the fork. ? OK. ?Enough about how things look and onto the food: Mac N Cheese -- I was hooked by the presentation so had to order one myself. ?Anyhow, how can Mac N Cheese ever be bad? ?Well, I think this is definitely a healthy interpretation -- while the pasta was al dente, there was just a lack of overall flavoring. ?Barely tasted salt or the cheese, so if I had to describe it, "healthy and bland" comes to mind. Fiery Bottom BBQ Pork Rice Bowl -- ?Good blending of flavors in a what feels like a very healthy meal. ?But for $12, it is definitely overpriced. Forget what it's called, but think it was a side dish that had chicken skewers and broccoli tempura over brown rice. ?This was a perfect dish. ?All the stuff I like and frankly, just the right portion for a light meal. ?Would definitely have this again next time I visit. While I enjoyed the atmosphere, the food can feel a little pricey for what you get, but boy do you feel healthy eating here.

Saw ads of Calafia in the Metro, and decided to try it for brunch one weekend. food: tried the dragon noodles and poached egg breakfast set. Ingredients were fresh, but overall very bland. Maybe the chef was having a bad day... price: little pricey atmosphere: casual modern feel *side market offers to-go items like salads and sandwiches

I heart Calafia for breakfast, and go here almost every weekend since discovering it in late January. ? The food is so delicious, and we're talking the good ol'eggs-bacon-toast staple, which is my favorite. ?Yesterday I branched out and tried the daily scramble, which consisted of bacon, swiss and spinach - yum! ?The breakfast dishes I've tried also include the obligatory hash brown that everyone appears to serve, but Calafia's hash brown is a little slice of heaven - perfectly seasoned, and the perfect amount (I hate plates half full of potatoes that you end up wasting).

Delicious food. I usually go for the daily special. Amazing coffee. I recommend getting a french press brought to your table. Fabulous service. Wow. They really care. I sat outside with my dog and they brought out a bowl of water for him. Very kind. You should definitely check this place out.

This is based on a brief visit for an afternoon snack. ?The service was super slow and our server was very 'zoned out'. ? The food was ok, but a bit on the spendy side. ? May give them another chance during lunch and dinner, and hopefully the service is better next time.

I love Calafia. I love their motto "Slow food served fast". I love their decor - casual and funky and kewl. I love the staff - it's pretty easy to love a place that treats their regulars like family. I really love their food. It's so nice to go to a place that I can order anything on the menu and not have to cross-examine the waiter to find out if it's going to destroy the planet. I know the salmon is wild, the veggies are locally sourced (we belong to the same CSA) and the beef is grass-fed. The food is prepped and the menus planned out so that everything can be finished quickly and served up hot in a short time. The flavors are good and the specials are creative. The menu changes occasionally, for a seasonal feel, but with some old standbys sticking around. And the desserts just keep getting better. I'm heading there now - gotta get my strawberry shortcake fix! This is the best strawberry shortcake I think I've ever had. The staff are occasionally a wee bit laid back for the "served fast" part of the philosophy, as other reviewers have mentioned getting frustrated waiting for a condiment, but it's never been an issue for me - and I'm not exactly known for patience. ;-) The staff very obviously care about the food and about their customers, and that's far more important to me. In short, the food is healthy, sustainable, yummy and a good variety: vegan, child and carnivore-friendly. They even have a water-bowl for patron's dogs (in the outdoor seating). Did I mention the strawberry shortcake?

I give this place 3.5 stars = good, not great. Food - Pro: Great menu with a full page of vegetarian and vegan items. They also have nice specials. Con: Imperfect execution of the menu. Abience - Pro: Nice decor and general vibe. Con: Very loud. Plus they have large community table with little stools that look great, but are not fun to sit in for an entire meal. Service - Pro: Friendly and willing to answer questions. No attitude. Con: Slow and often missing in action.

Stopped in for the first time and thought I'd try the market. ?I bought the pulled pork sandwich that was marked including Kettle chips. ?When the lady rang me up ($18 for a small carrot salad, brownie, sandwich, chips, and a coffee) I asked about why I was charged for the chips. ?Apparently it's only a deal for they Paly High kids. ?A little signage would have helped me from feeling duped. ? The food was good though. ?The pulled pork was on a brioche bun and went really well with the carrot and almond salad. ?And the Barefoot coffee tasted great. ?I'll have to be more careful next time as $18 for a to-go picnic type lunch was a little steep for ?me.

Cute place with good food and service! The staff was nice in letting us know what's good. Ordered the hanger steak, ground lamb, lentil bowl, and special kale salad. Ordered a bunch of their smoothies too. We shared everything. Hanger steak was seasoned right with bleu cheese. However, only expect about 5 little pieces and lots of fries. Lamb was good and tasty. Didn't have the gamy taste. Kale salad was my fave. The combo just worked and was super fresh tasting. Delicious cranberries, goat cheese and quinoa. THe lentil bowl had a subtle curry flavor. It had tofu and a type of rice. It was good! Smoothies are delicious and humongous!

I am a student at Palo Alto High School across the street from Calafia and I came over for lunch on a rainy day. The food was extremely overpriced and the service was awful. I waited for a long time in line to pay, in fact my food was cold by the time I started eating. Also, one of the workers asked me to leave my backpack outside, ON A RAINY DAY! I had already paid and was eating my food and they didn't want me to have my backpack!? Completely ridiculous, students don't come here! I wish there was a no star option, but I guess I'll give them one.

Happened to be in Town & Country at the drugstore and decided to try Calafia for lunch. Nice ambiance, not a big place, set up modern cafeteria style ?and it was buzzing with a lunch crowd. Had the tacos (shredded beef with napa cabbage, cilantro) plus a side of chard in olive oil, garlic mixed with cranberries, walnuts & some other stuff. I have never tried chard before in my life. The mixture was quite delicious, though sweet. Next time I'd be braver and try the swiss chard with just garlic and olive oil. Oh yes, the main dish -- 2 tacos, generous on the beef, nicely spiced (zesty and juicy!), could use slightly more cabbage & cilantro to create more of a contrast. Lunch was quite filling. Portions are not huge, but just enough. Overall, a good experience. Fresh, well-prepared foods - very Californian. I found it a little expensive for a cafe ($10 for tacos, $5 for sides) -- didn't expect a sit down place. Their market is suppose to open in mid-Feb. They also have coffee bar. And the sparkling water - crisp. Water is meant to be free. I'll be back.

A good meal and great to see a new business doing so well! Loved the ?great organic feel to the decor and a really nice busy vibe! We will certainly go back. Food was good, excellent use of fresh ingredients and certainly tasty. We had the chicken wings which were good but not hugely exciting, the beet carpaccio with goats cheese was lovely, fresh and clean flavors. For mains we had the "Angry" Pork wrap and the Beef short rib both perfectly prepared and packed with taste. Maybe the portion on the beef is a little small? If I had to raise any negatives and this is purely personal, I am not a fan of flowery wording on menus, I just find it a distraction from what it is all about. What could be "Angry" about a pork wrap? Like I say, just personal taste, the food was still good and not angry at all! Well worth a visit...

I'd have to say the pizza is pretty good here, however the crust can be thinner. But considering you would have to pay more next store for pizza that is about the same makes it a good deal. We had brunch there and that was also solid. We've been here about four or five times since they opened and have been typically satisfied. They get busy because they have a great atmosphere and friendly staff. The food really varies depending on what dish you order. Last time I got the chicken noodle bowl (some 5-spice variation) and was disappointed. I'd have to say it was mainly mushrooms and tomatoes with about 1/3-1/2 of a chicken breast cubed, and disappointingly little noodles. It was like a Pho with a spicy gravy instead of the soup and only say a 1/2 cup of rice noodles. Now considering that it the least expensive of the ingredients, I would have expected more noodles to fill out the dish. Well, since they are a new restaurant, perhaps they are working out the kinks. I notice there were other reviews also mentioning consistency problems.

Yep, I'm a fan. I've eaten here maybe 8 times now and thought hey - its time to let the yelpers know about this place! My favorite meal here is brunch - I have gotten the special on the brunch menu 3 times - yummy, yummy, yummy omlets, eggs with asparagus and hollandaise sauce yum! a side of bacon please. For lunch I've had the tacos - which are spicy but not too spicy, I've had 2 paninis both delicious with their little side salads. Chicken salad is served at lunch and at bruch becuase its just so darn delicious. I've stopped in the go-go market and grabbed a muffaleta wedge, chips, a drink and checked myself out instead of waiting around on those people to make up their minds at the counter on what they wanted. Ambiance is very cool, hip - feel like I have a little of the city right here in PA. Its great food, great place and all for a very decent price.

The place is well designed, as I would expect from a new ?upmarket cafe in this price bracket, but the food and service are not up to par. ?The "dragon's breath" noodle and "spicy" tofu curry was bland and uninspiring. We had two desserts, an apple galette, that was pleasant, and a pannacotta that was good, (but the citrus sorbet with it was odd). 2 glasses of wine each, and we had spent $50 a head (incl tax and tip). At least the wine was good!! The service was ordinary- the meals didn't come out together, and it was hard to get out water refilled. When the server told us she is going off service, and would we mind paying our bill now, before we are finished eating, I wanted to tell her to PO- but peer pressure got in my way.

Didn't really know what to expect when I walked through the doors!! ? My friends and I were looking for a different place to eat that was affordable, close to work and had food for us all (one my friends is vegan). ? I checked yelp and found this place. ?On top of being affordable and food for us all, they also serve beer, wine & cocktails. ?(ALWAYS a plus in my book!) As soon as you walk in the door you are transported into a surprising unexpected scene. ?You are not in a "cafe" but a tres chic diner. This place was perfect for our lunch time antics. ?Not only were we were seated promptly, as soon as we ordered our food was immediately on the grill. ? We had the pleasure of being served by Carlos. ?He immediately gave us the specials and was awesome from start to finish. Two of us feasted on the cheeseburger and shoestring fries, which was absolutely delish! ?I loved the size of the fries ($11). ?It was all surface area --no filler. ?Whilst the other, delved into the world of the Dragon Breath Noodles ($11) (to which i replied....."wow, and I have to sit near her the rest of the afternoon. ?bada dum), and although they are not something I would ever get (she is uber healthy and vegan), they looked delish. ?She said it was a masterful blend of healthy and interesting. ?The drinks were served cold from the tap in a very nice size glass for the price. ?$5 Was the place clean and nice??? ?ABSOLUTELY!!! Did I enjoy my experience???? ?EMPHATICALLY YES!!! Was my server awesome??? ?DEFINITELY YES!!!! Were the prices right for the food?? ?ABSOLUTELY!!!! Would we eat there again??? MOST DEFINITELY!!!!!

I really like this place. I've eaten at the restaurant for several times for lunch, once for dinner and once for breakfast. I've also gotten takeout at the fresh salad bar multiple times. ?Everything is freshly prepared and generally portions are not too big, not too small. ?However, some of the items are really small like the crab cakes - teeny weeny. ? One of the things that I need to try next is the Yellow Curry Chicken on top of quinoa. ?My friend had it for dinner and let me have a taste - wow lots of fresh flavor including pronounced coconut and it had a lot of fresh veggies. ? They have a lot of selections for vegetarians, and some for those on low carb diets. There is patio seating and sometimes we bring our dog and enjoy a meal outside.

Always a good place for lunch or dinner. This is the fourth time I've been to Calafia and have enjoyed every meal so far. This time I had the Black Bean and Rojo Tofu Tacos. My friend had the Veg Soy Groat Burger. ?We both enjoyed our selections. The service has been great every single time I've been there. I have only one teeny tiny complaint that's hardly worth mentioning BUT I'll go ahead and mention it anyway. The plate my tacos came on was way too small. It was cute, trendy (oblong) but I had a hard time cutting pieces of the taco without it spilling on the table. Maybe I was supposed to roll them up and eat them by hand but it just didn't seem the correct thing to do.

Seriously, this place is awesome! If you're into fresh, flavourful and colourful food, then check it out. I am addicted to the Maple Roasted Carrot and Tofu salad. The Tofu Tacos are also d'lish! They serve complimentary sparkling or still water (which I believe they filter themselves), and it always comes with a dash of lime. They have a LOT of vegetarian options and label everything Vegan or Gluten Free on the menu. there are also a lot of Gluten Free options! Huzaah! I also highly rate the service in this place, it is attentive and incredibly friendly. Every time I've been I have a wonderful wait-staff experience. Thanks Calafia! I'm addicted.

This is one of the few good places to eat in Palo Alto. ?Palo Alto has a lot of fancy restaurants, but few of them serve really good, tasty, quality food. ?This place is a little on the expensive side, especially once you start ordering drinks too, but I guess that's Palo Alto for you. Here's what I've tried and LIKED: - Chicken & Waffles: crispy tempura chicken with bacon studded waffles and maple syrup. ?The chicken was lightly fried with tempura and very moist. ?The waffle was nice and crispy. ?This was pretty darn good. - Wake Up Blend: Banana carrot juice OJ ginger bee pollen yogurt. ?I think their smoothies are delicious and not too sweet. - Shaking Beef Salad: grilled marinated hanger steak, fennel, arugula, mint, rice wine vinaigrette, sesame seeds. ?This salad is awesome. ?The steak is flavorful and tender. ?The mint really gives the salad a nice aroma. ?This is a salad that a meat lover can enjoy. - Mahogany Salmon Salad: Served with sliced Asian pear, wild arugula, ume plum vinegar marinated cucumbers, warm quinoa pilaf, rice wine vinaigrette. ?This salad was not as good as the shaking beef salad, but still very good. ?The salmon was cooked very well and the mahogany flavor was nice. ?I don't think the quinoa pilaf did anything for me though. - Guanciale Burrata Pizza: Zoe's cured pork cheek seasoned with rosemary and garlic, sliced super thin and served with nutty and creamy burrata cheese, tomato sauce, fresh oregano. ?The crust is nice and crunchy. ?I like the saltiness of the pork cheek. ?This was a good pizza. ? Here's what I've tried and was less of a fan of (but they were still good): - Braised Greens, Almond Butter (VG)(GF) rainbow swiss chard, saut¨¦ed with shallots, glazed with cider vinegar and finished with a vegan turmeric scented almond butter, dried cranberries and walnuts - Calafia's Biscuits & Mushroom Gravy: served with two eggs any style, two lamb sausage links and two buttermilk biscuits topped with mushroom gravy Note, the tablets they have on the table for you to play with are kind of amusing, but buggy. ?Also be careful or you might inadvertently press a button for more levels in the heat of a game, and it will charge you.

"The little restaurant that couldn't" A bit disappointed after having a late lunch here. The food is above average, but not great. It seems this place aims high, but fails. Examples: The "Wolfgang pizza". The toppings are very good, but the dough is moist, soft, and not crispy. Too bad. The gnocchi do not look home-made, and the pumpkin sauce has an industrial feeling to it. Their famous "dragon" noodles: The noodles were overcooked, soft and mushy. Their espresso was, frankly, undrinkable. Service is very good, but being charged 20% for a party of 7 for lunch takes away one star.

Eh. Had dinner there recently. Dishes are certainly creative here. ?My boyfriend ordered the spicy barbecue pork + brown rice dish, and I got the pork belly pizza special. The BBQ pork and rice dish, which at first doesn't seem like it would work, turned out to be good. Way better than my pizza. The pork belly on the pizza just tasted like gelatinous horse hooves, no flavor at all. Pizza dough+cheese+tomato sauce wasn't spectacular either. The flavor to this pizza just wasn't there. Both dishes came out to be $30 plus tip. Also found a dark speck floating on top of my iced water (looked suspiciously like a bug). I may or may not return, probably should do some research before ordering though to see what others say is good.

Busy, loud & we waited a while for a table, but I don't hold any of this against Calafia because it was a Friday night when we stopped by, and it had just been on network news the night before. LIKES: - Decor - Informal atmosphere - Open kitchen (I always hope that open = clean) - The FOOD! ? - I had the angry pork wrap, which was delicious! ? - My GF had some sort of angry pork pizza, which was just as good. DISLIKES: - A little crowded and diner-y feeling (albeit upscale diner-y)

They do not take reservations. Went with a group of 6 and was seated immediately. 20 minutes later had to ask for someone to come to our table with water + order. 15 minutes after we ordered our drinks arrived. 35 minutes after we ordered our food arrived all at once, even though we ordered courses. ?

We had the: Goat Cheese Beets & Walnuts Arugula, basil citrus vinaigrette (Think Beet Carpaccio on crust) - Quite yummy even the next day hot out of the toaster oven! Modern Salad Golden beets, goat cheese, arugula, crispy onion strings, minty vinaigrette - lovely and light. And finally my favorite the red beet Quinoa Salad with even more arugula....we really like beets & arugula....it was a light meal for a hot evening....paired with a red sangria and a Happy Ending Beer. Service was a bit scattered but was sincere and apologetic for delays in alcohol delivery and seating assignment . It didn't seem that full of an evening to warrant such scatteredness. But server was sweet and offered her suggestions for beer. This was our second time here. The first time we sat outside at the mammoth slab of tree table - which is a great spot to people watch. This time we sat inside in view of the bar & the open kitchen. I prefer outside when the weather is so gorgeous.

My rating: 75/100. I had brunch there around 12:30 on Sunday. This place was famous for their chef from Google. I had their Daily scramble and Google Gulp. The food is simple but with fresh and organic ingredient. It was delicious without heavy taste of butter and sugar, but it took a little bit longer for the food to be served. If you are not in a hurry (if you are, try their market for a quick pick up), this place is great place to be.

Called before to make reservations for a birthday dinner. ?We were told that they don't take reservations, but we could call 30-45 minutes ahead to get our name on the list. ?Asked if they did anything for birthdays, like "sing or put a candle on dessert." ?The hostess DIDN'T KNOW. ?How do you work at a restaurant and not know this? ?She put us on hold and was able to confirm that they do birthdays. ? Got to restaurant 35 minutes after we called to get our name on the list. ?The hostess looks at us and says "Oh, the table with the birthday". ?Really? ?How dense are you? ?We then had to wait another 20 minutes for our table. ?But we called ahead? ?Headscratch. ? We ordered a lot of food. ? - Duck Appetizer and Soup of the day. ?Both pretty good. - Crispy Chicken - totally devoid of flavor - Short Ribs - grissly and kind of gross. ?When we pointed this out to the waiter, he told us that was to be expected with their beef dishes?! - Beef noodles - pretty good. - Soju Jito - disgusting. ?Couldn't finish this! - Chocolate Tapioca dessert. ?No candle, no happy birthday or anything. ?Thanks again for that. ?We got stomach aches from the tapioca. ?

Have been to Calafia many times and i can't say enough about this place. Charlie is brilliant and such a nice guy. Servers know their stuff and are very friendly. Now, on to the food. Here's my issue...EVERYTHING is so good that I can never decide what I want. Do I go back to old favorites or try something new? I make up my mind, then a server walks by with something else that looks amazing. Just had the fish taco special this week...fabulous! as was the red, brown & black. Other outstanding items...tempura fried veggies, beet salad, super salad, grilled peach salad special, simple pizza, tofu lentil loaf, duck dumplings, duck salad, mahogany salmon salad. The only reason I don't mention more is that it's a new menu and i haven't had a chance to try them yet...but i will!

I would describe this place as health food with cocktails. And I really like that as a concept. You can get some pretty grainy stuff here, with lentils, quinoa and sprouted this and that. But then you can get a pretty decent Cosmo. What could be better? Now there are concessions to meat-eaters and not-so-health oriented types...my husband got a pepperoni pizza (he loved the pepperoni...), but what I love is the health food served in an upscale and buzzy environment. Unique and fresh.

We had the burratta pizza with fries for a quick dinner and food was terrific. ?The problem is that we were seated in the Market A Go Go side of the restaurant, where they seem to place extra seats for dinner. ?They had the unused salad bar from lunch there (which was not cleaned up very well), the waiters were less attentive on that side, and the ambiance is just different over there compared to the cafe part of the restaurant. ?I think they could have at least cleaned up and/or covered the salad bar before they start dinner. ?They had pretty cool toilets here , BTW.

I was highly impressed! Great food, great service, amazing chefs, awesome atmosphere... I was especially impressed with the overall design of Calafia, from the graphics to the architecture. How cool is the identity and the refurbished barn wood. Everything just seemed to go together perfectly... even the unique bathroom tiles and the couches in the waiting area. So different, yet so perfect. I really enjoyed watching my food being created as well. They had nothing to hide. And beyond that, it felt healthy without the lack of taste. My mouth was watering with joy. The menu was quite unique and in all the best ways; variety, originality, creativity... I will definitely be going back, this time for dinner. Thanks for a great experience in afternoon dining Calafia.

Had dinner at the kitchen counter, first time we had been there. Had spring rolls, pad thai noodles, and sake. Food was healthy tasting but I was not jumping for joy. I sort of considered it ok. I had no problem with the pricing, after all, Palo Alto is not an low cost location. One thing that was strange, to me anyway, was the sake was cold? Will go back again and try something else. Overall would recommend, worth a go.

After a recommendation from a friend and reading through the Yelp reviews, I decided to take a friend here for dinner. ?I found out the restaurant does not take reservations for parties smaller than 8, but the man who took my call was kind enough to advise me to call 30 minutes before our arrival. ?If there's a list they'll put you on. ?I called and was luckily there was not wait. We arrived at the restaurant - parking was a snap and when we walked in I immediately fell in love with the decor. ?Totally up my style alley, from the chairs to the dishes. ?While there were plenty of seats at the bar and communal table, we decided to wait for a private one. The hostess said it would be about a 20 minute wait, but 5 minutes later she came back and said our table was ready! ? I chose the restaurant because I'm vegetarian and my friend is vegan - and was pleased to find lots of selection on the menu. ?Our server was super friendly and took the time to make sure a vegetarian dish could be made vegan. ?Here's what we had (on a scale of 1 - 5, 5 is the best): Papas con Ajo - nicely well-done seasoned fries [4] Tempura Jalapeno Shrimp roll - really good with the lettuce wrapped around the roll and noodles on top [4] Butternut Chilijack - without the cheese - nice spice with all of my favorite fixings - corn and cilantro - a huge serving which I couldn't finish and had to take home [4] Tofu Lentil Loaf - holy moly that @#$ is good! [10] - it was hearty, loved the sauce! I'd definitely go back again to try the other dishes and will bring my family next time. ?Saw kids at other tables and it looks like a family-friendly place.

The food is very tasty, healthy, and reasonably-priced. There is a variety of food types, from regular "comfort" staples such as burgers and tacos to more exotic fare. The specials are always awesome. They keep awesome beer on tap -- stuff you will be hard-pressed to find elsewhere. My wife and I have been eating here a couple times each week for about 6 months. We're "regulars" now and are familiar with most of the staff. There are myriad eating establishments in both Palo Alto and Menlo Park. We wouldn't come back so often if it weren't so great. The wait staff is impeccable -- they take Charlie's standards very seriously, all while maintaining a casual atmosphere. Ask for Jeremiah or Carlos -- they are awesome servers.

A friend told me about Calafia some time ago and we decided to try it out. ?The first time I went there, about 6 months ago, the food was awesome and the Macaroni and Cheese was to die for. ?An over-flled big bowl that ended up lasting us both 2 meals each! ?It became my favorite place to get "healthy" mac'n'cheese. Unfortunately, though, there is inconsistency in the food. ?They forget to add ingredients and when I question it, they argued that the kids don't like it so they don't add it anymore and they changed the menu (but they didn't really). ?The portions have become significantly smaller where the "Big Bowl" of Macaroni and Cheese is really only half filled now. ?It's curiously tasteless too. Other food is interesting in design, but way too salty or lemony. ?Although I'm wondering if the saltiness is supposed to cover for the "bland"ness that others talk about. ?Doesn't quite hit the mark. I stopped going for a while and then when I went back, I noticed that nothing much had changed. However, the Goat cheese, Beets & Walnut pizza is heavenly and worth going back just for that. ?Also, do try the vegetable smoothies. ?They are very healthy tasting.

I experienced the Market A Go Go salad bar for the first time on Monday...went back for the second time that Thursday! The take-out salad bar options are endless. Great vegetarian options - two different kinds of soup - healthy dressing choices - it's all great. The sweet potato chunks were my favorite, as well as their macaroni salad. You pay by weight - both times my cost was less that $6 but left feeling completely full and satisfied. Definitely a great, quick stop for lunch.

I made a return visit to the market to purchase dinner items and again, I wasn't too thrilled. ? At 4:30, there were 4 ready-made dinner kits out, which as I said before "You need to have a lot more dinner kits available for people who will be coming by after work to buy dinner!" ? I wish they offered each type of dinner kits, not just 1 or 2. ?I purchased the rib kit (serves 3) and really wasn't very impressed with it. ?The rib meat was pretty good, although very fatty and little edible meat. ?The sauce was a very thin, soy-type sauce, kind of odd for ribs! ?Also, horseradish mashed potatoes and braised chard were included, which were not exciting, I don't like horseradish and these were very heavy with it. I do love that is was very easy to prepare, just boil water in a large pot and place bags in for 25-35 min. (per package directions). ? And for $34.00, I don't think it was worth it quality or taste wise. ? ? I may try another dinner kit in the future if they will ever stock the other kits. ?Otherwise, I will pass. ? There were many more salads, sandwiches, rotisserie chickens and side dishes out compared to my last visit which was a plus. ? Beet & Walnut Salad ($9.00)-The package claims it will feed 2, I disagree w/this for the portion included. ?This contained field greens, beets, goat cheese, spiced walnuts and vinaigrette dressing. ?Taste was good, however, the biggest gripe for me is that this is not a good value for the amount of salad and few toppings that were present. ?Please lower the price or include more in the package! Crimson Quinoa Salad ($3.00)-A good side salad w/quinoa, currants, onions, cilantro, beet juice, cumin and vinegar. ?Taste was good, interesting textures, color was very pretty, however, I prefer the carrot salad which wasn't available. ?As w/the carrot salad, I don't think the quantity is worth the price. ? I was happy to see that the chicken pot pie I liked from last time was reduced in price from $6.95 to $4.95, which is a much better price/value, IMHO. ? I really want to like this place, but they are making it hard w/their inconsistencies, lack of items available, variable portions & prices. ?People want to feel like they are getting good, quality food for a reasonable price. ?I don't think the prices are reasonable for some of the items such as salads, dinner kits could be lowered a bit and the sandwiches are more $$$ than Village Cheese House. ?There is a wide demographic of customers that come to this place from high school students to working families/individuals to seniors. ?Each customer is looking for convenience in ready-to-eat items that are of good taste, quantity, quality and a good value for our dining dollars in hard economic times. ?Please consider this when portioning and pricing. ?There is a lot going for this place, it's very accessible, the atmosphere is a trendy bistro feel and I really do want to come regularly. But I have to feel that I am getting value for my money. ?If I don't feel that way, then I cannot continue to patronize this establishment.

Trendy community-type place for casual and quick dining. Cost to worth it ratio: 4 (most items around $10) Highlights: - Atmosphere: cross between cafeteria, airport eatery, and nice restaurant with modern d¨¦cor. - Wine: loved my macmurray pinot noir--light enough but not watery, fruity but not jammy sweet - Duck potstickers: fantastic! The wrapper dough was the perfect thickness and tasted fresh, the minced duck and spice mixture was spot on, and the dipping soy sauce mixture pulled it all together. These were not typical potsticker shape, rather square purses. Only nit here was that made them hard to pick up and dip, as they were a bit fragile. - Hamburger: totally made fun of the hub for ordering this, but it was one extraordinary burger. Meat paddy was a good size--compromise between a thick burger and a super thin In and Out one. What made it so much better than the average burger was how juicy and tender and buttery it was. Add the applewood smoked bacon and cheddar cheese, and you have a winner. - Service: no complaints. Nice waitress who plugged in our order in her little computer and delivered it pretty shortly thereafter. Wine was served in a mini carafe and she filled my glass when she saw it was close to empty and asked me if I wanted a box right close to when I stopped eating. Midlight: - Beef tacos: good portion with 3 sizable tacos in double bagged white corn tortillas, but the meat itself was lacking seasoning. I did however, enjoy the thin line of BBQ sauce with a kick, although not really that spicy as advertised. I could have used more sauce as well. Chopped red onions were a nice touch in flavor and texture. ? ? Lowlights: - Seating at window: a bit cramped (bumped elbows with my neighbor a few times) and the seating level there was a bit off. Either the chairs were too low or the long table was too high. - Minor uncomfortable moments: when we arrived, we weren't pleasantly greeted at the hostess stand, but witness to one employee snipping at the other about if she knew how many people we were and bluntly correcting her when she was about to put us on the list when we could be seated immediately. Not a great first impression. When we received our dessert menu, mine was printed or cut crooked and crumpled a good bit. ? I was worried by some low yelp ratings, but we liked the place for what it is and will be back.

We were invited for dinner by friends who heard about this restaurant. We did not ask our daughter about the place and later on found out she had been there before. Not impressed, she had told us after the fact. The place was becoming busy when we arrived and it was a weekday. The staff were all very gracious and accommodating. ?We were seated once we were complete. The menu was explained adequately. The starters, salad of organic greens, slices of apple, crumbled goat cheese, some dried cherries all mixed with a light vinaigrette. Great summer salad. The goat cheese was a little too generous for me, even if I love goat cheese. ?It overpowered the rest of the salad. I did leave some on my plate. The main course was a grilled ahi tuna sitting on roasted corn and red pepper sauce. Great combination of colors and flavors. ?Unfortunately, the tuna was a monumental let down. I wanted so badly to eat it. Instead, I ended up eating around it. I ate all the corn with the sauce. the tuna was hard, chewy, dry, and tasteless. ?I wanted to cry for the tuna but, we were all chatting away at the table. ? Then came the dessert which was a peach galette with some ice cream. Pleasant. Light enough. The wine pairings were so-so. ?Could have done better, really. I would give two points for the great service and the good salad and corn with red pepper sauce.

I had a HORRIBLE experience at Calafia today. We were a group of 10 Stanford graduate students with a reservation for 7:30pm. We waited for 45 minutes to be seated. We asked to speak with the manager to convey our discontent with the long wait. The owner appeared and simply started YELLING and CURSING WILDLY at us. I have never had such a disgraceful experience and I will never come back to this place.

I'd been excited to try Calafia since first hearing about it, so I suggested it to two friends who wanted to have brunch in Palo Alto. We were meeting at 1 o'clock on a Saturday afternoon, so we figured we'd have a bit of a wait. To be on the safe side, I stopped at Mayfield and put our names on the waiting list before heading on to Calafia. After spying the great looking food people were eating, I would have been happy to eat at Mayfield--and I wish I had. I wanted to like Calafia. The concept is great, as is the decor, and the menu, but our experience was far from perfect. It seemed like they were short on waitstaff, which probably resulted in our tepid meals. On the way back from washing my hands, I saw what looked like our order on the pass--sure enough, it was. But it wasn't brought to our table for a few minutes. One friend ordered the French toast with a side of poached eggs. The toast was delicious: crisp on the outside but soft on the inside and tasted of orange. The eggs, however, were cold. My other friend and I had the smoked salmon with poached eggs and red pepper hollandaise sauce on a potato cake. I'd asked for the hollandaise on the side, which arrived tepid. To his credit, our waiter, who was taking an order at the next table, saw that I wanted something and promptly had someone bring me more sauce. Unfortunately this sauce was just as cold. Since the waiter was otherwise occupied, I had to get up and ask the kitchen staff for hotter hollandaise rather than wait for my already lukewarm meal to go completely cold. At least the GM noticed and came to our table to ask what was wrong. He apologized for the food arriving less than hot and explained that he had some new people working. He also took my friend's side of poached eggs off the bill. I will probably try eating here again, but I think I'll wait another month or two for the kitchen and service to get the kinks worked out. If the GM hadn't made the effort to stop by our table, and our waiter and the hostess hadn't been so personable, I probably wouldn't be back.

Last night was my second time eating at Calafia and I was extremely disappointed. I even brought friends this time because I had raved about it so much! We ordered my favorite angry pork wrap and while we were cutting it and dispersing it between 3 people, we found plastic in our food. YES PLASTIC, like seran wrap...and we were told, "it sometimes happens." The manager offered us a desert on him....and at the end of the meal they charged us for it on our bill. Not only did they charge us for that, they also charged us for the plastic pork wrap. In the end they took only those two items off our bill. ?Next time they should handle it a little differently.

Five stars for the Crimson Quinoa Salad, which is superb. Five stars for the staff and decor, but I'll withhold the last star until a second visit. When we dined, we were with a party of seven, which included two children, and they were very accommodating. Perhaps if my wife and I were dining on our own, we would explore the full range of the menu more and pick a nice wine to accompany the meal. It's too bad that Calafia is basically in the middle of a strip mall. High-end or not, there are nicer locations in the area, like in Woodside, where Calafia's new Californian, global fusion cuisine would really shine. This is a place for kids, for couples, for friends, all for relatively little money. A nice place, to be sure.

I really wanted to like this place since I can appreciate the concept, and I live right down the street from it. ?But it was disappointing. ?I did like the warm decor and open layout. ?However, I have to say it does have a bit of intimidating pretentiousness in the atmosphere, considering the concept is "slow food served fast." ?The idea of organics and local food is always great but de rigueur for the Bay Area. ? Ultimately, I found the service pushy and the food overwhelming. ?Our waiter made us feel pressured to order a lot to increase the bill. ?He told us that portions were small, which they weren't, and encouraged us to order alcohol plus two appetizers. ?The two of us barely finished half our food because we both got sick of eating it. ?Plus, he got two of the dish orders wrong and barely came to check on us. ? The spicy fries appetizer was the best part of the meal, not too overly spiced and nicely crisp in a paper cone. ?I got a simple pizza as my main meal. ?It felt a bit undercooked with a tasteless crust. ?I also ordered a chard side dish that was supposed to just be sauteed in a little olive oil, salt and pepper....what emerged was a smoky dish with raisins and walnuts, which was another greens dish on the menu that cost more (and I recall he charged me more). It was ok, but a bit sickening after a while with the intensity of the flavors. ?I didn't have the energy to ask the waiter about the discrepancy...I just wanted to eat my food and get out of there. ?My boyfriend got some eggplant tiger rice bowl, and he barely finished half of it. ?It was smoky and slow-cooked; all the flavors just melded together in a brash but boring way. ?I could barely eat 2 bites of it before getting sick of the flavors. ?We were excited about the dessert menu, but given our poor experience with the main meal portion, we opted to forgo dessert and get out there. ?Still, the bill was pretty hefty for a Saturday lunch. ?This place was not worth it at all.

1. Bland food. Many of the dishes were well prepared in other aspects, but ALL of them were universally MASSIVELY lacking salt, to the point of tasting like they were all straight out of the blander. Chicken wings with Google spicy sauce? Needed a salt shaker to make them taste right. BBQ Pork over brown rice. Second salt shaker. When I mentioned this to the waiter, he said they were dedicated to "health" and that's why everything was so massively under-seasoned. Really? So, after he recommended the garlic fries app and fried wings in blue cheese sauce apps, and slabs of fatty shredded pork with eggs over rice, nixing the salt was because of concern for my health? Give me a break. 2. Terrible service. Now, you'd think with the need for this much salt, salt and pepper would be easy to get, right? Think again. The waiter greeted us with a barrage of cooing about how great everything was at Calafia, and how dedicated everyone was who worked there, and then disappeared for far too long while no water, no bread, appeared on our table. While taking our order, he boasted about the state-of-the-art order entry system, that took him three times as long to take our order as a waiter at Chilis would take. When the apps came and were massively under-seasoned, it took me three requests before I had to get up and ask the front of the house to bring me a salt shaker. When the runner brought someone else's meal to our table, I said something like "no, it's not ours, but we'd love some water and it's been a really long time since we asked someone else" his only response was a sarcastic "Cool!". Perhaps too much Google at play here, after all. When we ate our meal, our water glasses stayed empty. Finally, when we went to pay, we went, literally ---- inside, after waiting twenty minutes, to find someone, anyone who would give us a check. My recommendation - NO A Go Go.

Calafia Cafe is an upscale, vegetarian-like cafe/restaurant. They make vegetarian meatloaf and other vegetarian dishes and are very vegetarian-friendly. However, their food is overpriced.

Disclaimer: As an ex-Google employee, I've been familiar with Chef Charlie's cooking since 2002. When walking into Calafia, I almost felt like I was walking into the Google cafe circa 2004 -- lots of organic, healthy, and local food, a few idiosyncracies (you'll never see any ketchup or corn starch gravy here, nor will you see any name-brand sodas), and a staff that seems very excited to work there. ?The main difference is that now I have to pay for the meal. All items on the menu are in small portions, and each one feels exquisite and unique. ?I would expect the menu here to change constantly; come back next week, and the item that you really liked last time won't be here any more. ?This is a good thing and a bad thing, for reasons I'm sure you can figure out. Another good-thing-bad-thing is that you're paying for quality here and not quantity. ?If you have a small appetite and appreciate good food, this place is great and affordable; but if you prefer to wolf your food down without savoring it, and prefer lots of calories per meal, you'll probably find yourself wonder what the fuss is here -- you better just walk to the next block and go to Kirk's Steakburgers if that's the case. Case in point: At any pizza joint, you can get 8 fried chicken wings with a cup of bleu cheese dressing on the side for $5. ?Here, you're getting 5 wings for $8 -- but the skin is carefully peeled off the wings, the wings are lightly-but-fully fried on the outside while the meat inside is so tender that it melts in your mouth (I'd swear it's been braised, but that clearly is impossible, right?) put over a tangy sauce that clearly is bleu cheese based but not overpowering. How well will Calafia survive in this current economic climate? ?Who can say for sure, but I know I'll enjoy every trip I make here.

Came here on opening week. Love the ambiance of the place. It feels so warm and inviting. I love how you can have flat or sparkling water for free. The food ingredients are extremely fresh and seasonal. The dishes were really only ok. Nothing blew me away. The lamb meatballs and short ribs were my favorites of the evening. The pizza was really spicy, almost a bit unbearable. The wine was very reasonably priced. I would skip desserts, they didn't excite me too much. We got to meet the chef which was very cool and he is a very nice guy.

In a nutshell, WAAAAY overrated and WAAAAY overpriced for mediocre food. ?Unfortunately for us, it must have been Charlie's night off. Food: - Tempura. ?Really should be called batter fried vegetables as it does not in any way resemble the light, crisp veggies one would expect in Japanese cuisine. ?Would not order this again. ? - Pot pie. ?Cute mini iron pots but gravy seemed heavy on the corn starch. Left me craving a Marie Callendar frozen pot pie. ? Definitely would not order this again. - Short rib & mash potatoes. ? One lonely short rib and some ordinary mashed potatoes. ?Tasty, but could easily prepare at home. ?Would not order again. - ?Doughnut filled with creme brulee with a dark chco. sauce. ?The flavors didn't quite work together and doughnut was cold (bbbrrrrr) and too dense. ? Would not order again. - No comp fresh bread! ?What's up with that?! ? Can't recall another restaurant in similar price category that did NOT offer fresh bread & butter. ? Service: ?Slow. ?Too slow. ? ?DIY water refill. ? ? Servers never asked how the food was. ?(They're smarter than they seem). ? ? Ambiance. ?Pleasant, dark, casual decor Noise level. ? Poor acoustics. ?Incredible noisy. ? Seating. ? Not good for groups, unless you don't mind sitting on stools. Price: ? Avg $30 a person, without alcohol beverage (and no comp bread basket).

I dined here with a coworker when I visited this area earlier this year. We arrived late on a weekday evening and were seated promptly. The server was attentive and helpful, happy to provide suggestions as neither of us had eaten there previously. The food was good, especially considering the price. Water glasses stayed filled and food arrived in a timely manner. If I find myself in the area again, I'll probably return.

First time at Calafia and I can't wait to go back. Had the loveliest lunch, daily special homemade gnocchi with butternut squash and a shaking beef salad. ?Everything was cooked beautifully, food was fresh and delicious. ?Great service by the sweetest waiter (that's you Jeremiah!). ?Prices are very reasonable for this quality of food and ambiance. Ended our meal with the bread pudding and tea (yum!). ?Looking forward to going back.

This is a good place to meet for food and drink with friends in a casual ambiance, there are many reasonably priced choices on the menu, mostly organic, the portions are small, coffee are individually brewed, the staffs are friendly and helpful; by the way, they make their own catch up, the duck pizza with goat cheese is excellent.

I would say that this place was a bit too hyped up for me (with the Daily Candy notice and other friend's raving reviews) but all in all I can see the charm of Calafia. My girlfriend and I stopped here on a Saturday night and were promptly seated at the island directly facing the kitchen. Not having to wait 30 minutes is always a bonus for me. We both decided to order the fiero chicken bowl. The server was quick to point out taht this dish is not spicy despite the "5 spice Seasoning". I am a fan when servers make recommendation or point out attributes of a dish for diners. She was nice and would routinely check up on us to let us know that our food was coming up. The dish itself wasn't bad but it wasn't spectacular. I chop this up to my own fault because I had previously known that I am not a big fan how easily "5 spice" can overpower food. The broth accompanying the noodle was delicate and got overpowered when the chicken soaked in there for too long. For dessert we had the warm apple gallette and it was delicious. The vanilla ice cream complimented the warm puff pastry, cinnamon flavored apples and the drizzling of honey. I was sad when it was gone but my waist thanks the small portioned dessert. I would definitely venture back and try some other items. The portions can be a bit small. I think that if I were to come with the boyfriend, we would have to order an appetizer as well.

It was okay from start to finish. ?I didn't have so much of a problem with the portion or the prices, what lacked was service and taste. ?My guest and I were seated at the bar (seats were fine, but nowhere to hang purses) ?and greeted by a less than stellar bartender. ?He was nice, but not the most attentive. ?No one refilled my wine glass (BIG pet peeve of mine), we had two bites of our appetizers before our entrees came out (why call it appetizers if its going to be served in conjunction with the main dish??) and the food was generally greasy (funny, considering the chef's 'healthy" approach). ?The daily tempura was composed of over-fried, grease saturated uneven slices of onion and green beans with the crust breaking off. ?I don't think it was seasoned either. ?The fries were tasty, but resembled shoestring fries requiring tweezers to transport them into your mouth. ?Also, there was more spice than garlic. ?The chinese chicken salad lacked flavor and while I enjoyed seeing the baby pea shoots on top of the bed of greens, it was the most difficult salad to pile onto your fork. ?(Chef, I challenge you to try eating your salads with a dinner fork.) The crispy noodles were under-fried. ?The duck and goat cheese pizza was good, but again greasy! ?Also, could have used a little more seasoning. ?The 'death by chocolate' cake was pretty basic, but good. ?Also, the bartender handed us our doggie bag with the container sitting on its side...who does that? ?That just made no sense. ? As a plus, the place is sparkling clean and new. ?Sparkling water is complimentary and the hostess was extremely hospitable and polite. ?I'm not sure I'd return, but it was nice to see a new place at town and country. ?I'm hoping they can work out some of these kinks, it has great potential.

Such potential, but many dishes fail to hit the mark. The vegan pizza is just ok, it needed help. I bought one to-go a few days after my first visit, took it home and "fixed" it. Much better. They also take a swipe at Whole Foods inside their pizza box. Weird when you think that they have a similar customer base. It hasn't stopped me from shopping Whole Foods. Just keep improving on a great concept and leave the childish antics to others.

I am here at least twice a week. Their food is unparallelled in quality in the entire Peninsula. They are meticulous in also attending to special dietary needs as well like food sensitivities/allergies. I work in the medical field and also have Celiac disease with regards to wheat and gluten. Never have I been in an establishment more thoughtful and careful regarding such dietary restrictions. And did I say organic? Wow! If it's out of season or not just as fresh as it gets, then it is not served.Try the kale side dish. ?Wisely run and as healthy and tasty as it gets....shhhhh.

We went with our 2 kids for an early Sunday dinner. I love the decor, though they seemed to plan the space in a way as to minimize available table space. Very few tables in a rather large space. Food was hit and miss. The fries and the pizza we ordered for the kids were excellent. The pork salad was pretty tasteless and not worth pursuing. The same can be said for my 5-spice chicken fideo bowl with cilantro, mint, etc. I expected a burst of bright flavors and was quite stunned when there were NONE, zip, nada. I sent my spouse running for a salt shaker to try to add something. The chicken was obviously excellent quality and perfectly cooked, it just didn't have any flavor. I thought perhaps someone in the kitchen messed up and forgot to add salt when cooking the noodles or something. Or perhaps the chef was trying to make a statement about sodium intake. But the rest of the dishes really tasted fine by comparison. My husband's lamb sausage bowl was very good, and redeemed the dinner. The service was very nice, and accommodated us and our children very well. But I agree with the other reviewer that our opinions of the dishes were never solicited, even when we turned down an offer for a to-go box for the uneaten chicken dish. I will return since we live nearby and understand that restaurants need some time to settle in. the prices, service, and food quality is good, I just won't order the chicken or pulled pork.

Went there for dinner mid-week. ?Had a local amber ale, which was bitter but tasted great. ?The ambiance is very nice, with lots of room between tables and a modern decor. ?Also, apparently the bathroom is really cool, although I did not try it out myself. The food, however, was not good. ?Verged on bad. ?I had a turkey burger with mushrooms. ?Burger was fine but the bun was stale, and since the bun can make or break a burger, my entree was a bust. ?My dinner companions had the salmon and a noodle bowl. ?The salmon was fishy with tasteless greens. ?The noodle bowl was improperly seasoned. ?My friend said it tasted "crazy." ?I thought it tasted bad. Feeling unsatisfied with the meal, we ordered desert. ?Turned out to be a waste of calories, in my opinion. All in all, Calafia's food falls far short of its pleasant decor.

I posted this on the other "Calafia" yelp page, not knowing this seems to be the main review page....... __________________________ I went to like it and I wanted to like it, but I left the restaurant very annoyed. My wife pegged it once we were out the door - PRETENTIOUS. The staff is not though. They are cordial and personable. I would advise the managers to train the wait staff to wait more than one bite before asking is everything "looks" good. It looked good, honestly. This leads to my next point. A new business really needs continuous feedback. Surprisingly, we were not given the chance to offer any. Now, if I had just opened up a new restaurant, I'd be all over the staff on the customers experience. I'd also be roaming the restaurant myself talking to every customer I comfortably could. ?For example, the expediter, at the front of the kitchen, who was not more than three feet from us and not busy, never took an interest in what we thought of our food. ?As a person who is responsible for what comes out of the kitchen, it would serve that person well. I noticed the kitchen staff gazing around the dining area and I suspect they'd love some honest feedback. It would really help with the next point. The food is the real issue here. I ordered the "Calafia pizza". There were four toppings - cheese, roasted pork, sauce, and jalape?os. It would have tasted no different had all the items, including the dough, been pureed together or served the way it was. It had some flavor, but no distinction among ingredients. Also, there could not have been more than $2 in ingredients in the whole pie. The pork addition was no more than a garnishment, barely more than a couple tablespoons. I wanted to say something, but the concept on the item failed more than on just ingredients. My wife ordered the chicken fideo noodle bowl. Where's the chicken? I thought it was a vegetarian entree, but was informed otherwise. On top of that, it had NO flavor. The menu is all over the place, vegetarian, Mexican, Asian, and Italian rolled into food with no identity. ?Adhering to the orthodoxy of local, sustainable, and organic is going to kill the place. The atmosphere is comfortable and the service tolerable, but the food is the problem right now. It's trying to be something it can't be. Our bill was $28, which included one beer and soft drink. With small portions and no flavor, it was not worth it. Where's the balance between Alice Waters' pretense and Calafia's prices? IMHO, honest food. I am a strong and vocal advocate of local sourcing and want the place to succeed. For now, I'll be rooting from the sidelines.

I really wanted to like this place. ?Tried it three times. ?I don't like it. ?I had great expectations for ?inventive, tasty, ?food creations, but the selections I chose were rather expensive with small portions and lacked flavor. ? I had one professional-grade server, but the others either joked stupidly to cover for mistakes such as bringing the lunch menu at dinner ("Ha ha, someone was playing a joke on me.") or ignored me ?for long periods of time as was the case with the bartender ("Ya know what ya want yet?"). ? No offer to refill my empty water glass even though he had no other customers. ?Did not ask if my food was good. The place is just awkward. ?As a single diner, I was offered a seat at the bar, which I tried once and had the aforementioned bad experience, or at the counter in front of the cooking area, where I once sat perched atop a stool, face-to-face with the bustling cook area and felt rather self conscious. ?To my left was an open, unisex, ?post-restroom wash area, which I thought was completely unappealing. ?Why would I want to see people coming out of the restrooms, adjusting their clothes, and (hopefully) washing up??? ?Yuk. ?I'm surprised the health dept would approve that germ-laden area so close to the food prep/dining area. ? Three strikes and Calafia is out.

This place was packed on a Friday night but luckily we'd booked a table for 6 before heading out. ?It's funny because I'd been to CVS right across the way, but always walked by Calafia. ?They served us pretty quickly and I ilked the low-key atmosphere here. ?My chicken was really juicy and came with fennel and delicious beets. ?I think they try hard to serve organic, fresh vegetables. ?We also tried the vegan pizza and the steak tacos and both were good. ?They have an extensive vegetarian menu also, which is basically required when you live in this area.

absolutely delicious. the ambiance is casual elegant, with a small cluster of tables in the center flanked by counter seating at the window and in front of an open kitchen. sitting in front of the kitchen can be quite dangerous as you will preview all the enticing dishes that pass thru. with most items under $15 on the dinner menu it's very tempting to order another plate just for a taste. there is a wide variety of items to pick from. appetizers, pizzas, rice bowls and wraps to more traditional plates like salmon w/brown rice. it can be slightly overwhelming trying to decide given so many options, yet the consistent theme running thru the menu is an emphasis on wholesome, primarily organic, and healthy ingredients. as i was in a vegetable mood, i settled on the bohemia salad and the papas con ajo (herb-seasoned fries), both of which were fresh and flavorful. i also sampled the tasty shortribs, served with mashed potatoes and some sort of steamed greens. the mashed potatoes had just a hint of horseradish and complemented the tender beef shortribs. i was stuffed and happy, but still managed dessert when a plate of cookies and milk showed up in front of me. this is definitely one of my new favorites in the area. its simple, healthy, and quite affordable, perfect for times like these.

Color me thrilled!! My review is for the Market A Go Go.. I can see i've encountered a new spot to put on the rotation! Wonderful salad bar w/ all organic loveliness. The quality and the pricepoint are right and I would prefer to arrive at this salad bar than Whole Foods, you can feel the food is made w/ care. Nice roasted eggplant pieces and organic eggs and some garbanzos w/ a simple blend of spices.. It was ecclectic. I'm excited to at all I saw in the deli case, more salad, some entrees.. And the prices for the food quality was surprisingly good. They have trappings of a Soup section, but its not up and running yet, and i will look forward to that as a warm addition to lunch. But overall, high quality food, quick and easy stop off and exceptional prices for the product! I look forward to twisting the arm of one of my health-foodie friends into having a sit-down dinner w/ me here!

i can't think of anything witty to say about this place. the food was decent, the service was good, the prices were a teeny tiny bit on the high side (well... this IS palo alto...yuppyville usa), and overall, i had a lovely evening. i think my one complaint would be that the portion sizes were really small. ?or maybe it's b/c i ordered off the kids menu (i really wanted pot pie, okay?!). ?but still! ?even a kid would have left hungry. ?actually, with kids being morbidly obese these days, i'm sure a kid would have left starving. i therefore compensated the small portions of my meal by ordering dessert. the peach blueberry galette. ?it was... good. i have no complaints about it. but it wasn't memorable. oddly, what was memorable to me was the bathroom. very interesting design.

Maybe it's unfair to judge Calafia after just one brunch, but I have never let that stop me before. I like the space which is modern, clean and open. The menu had several appealing choices, but nothing screamed spectacular to me. Fries were overly crisp, pancakes were a little bland, and my chicken, arugula sandwich could have used more of the tomato jelly. What really bothered me is that although the prices are reasonable, they charged us $3 for a side of toast. Having said that, I really like Calafia approach to food and will be sure to try it again even though I was underwhelmed by the brunch.

We had dinner at Calafia 3 times so far and we like this place a lot. One side of their menu is all vegetarian. The other side of it is a mix of veggies/meat dishes. They use fresh, organic and local ingredients and almost everything we've ordered here tasted very good and fresh. ? So far, we've tried: bbq pork bowl, wakame salad, short ribs, pork dumplings, apple tart, chocolate cake, steak salad, chicken drummettes and carrot almond salad. Carrot almond salad was a bit bland but everything else tasted pretty good.

After being shut out at another brunch place in Mountain View, my friends and I took a drive down El Camino Real and ended up at Calafia. This place gets really crowded around noontime or so; even though we got there around 11:15 or so, we still had to wait about 10 minutes before we could get a seat. Once we were seated, the service was reasonably quick, and our waitress was very helpful and attentive in terms of making sure all of our food was taken care of. The brunch food itself is fantastic. I'm not sure where the various dings, even at the 4-star level, come from. If this place were in Manhattan, it would be one of the most popular places on the strength of the brunch menu. All of the items looked delicious, but I decided to go with the egg, lamb sausage, and biscuits in gravy. The biscuits were a little less moist than I would have preferred, but the gravy was perfect - not too heavy for a morning meal, but flavorful enough to make it hearty on its own. The lamb sausage was excellent; you get a couple of meaty links that aren't oversized (I'm not a fan of the sausage that looks like it's about to burst). Eggs are eggs (scrambled, in this case), but they did a good job in making sure they weren't too soggy (as eggs can turn out), but not too dried out and firm either. The orange juice didn't taste as fresh as other places I've had, so that's a slight knock, but hardly something that hurts the rating. The food is 4.5, but I'll round up in this case. As noted, it gets crowded in the morning, so definitely get here on the earlier side if you don't want to wait. But the food is worth the wait, and the atmosphere is nice and laid-back.

ok maybe 1 1/2 stars hello fellow yelpers, hit this place up do to some reviews found online and a suggestion made by my wife, I had high hopes for this place walking in the ambiance I would give 5 stars simply because it is laid out different, you get a sense of crate and barrell walking in through the restaurant side, the aesthetics of this place with the wall color, hard wood beams supporting the roof, huge landscaping photos if not pieces on the wall and even there utensils, plates and bowls catches your eyes, the straw table place mats give you a sense of home if you are of filipino descent haha sorry every filipino if not most has placemats on there dining table = ) but we are here to judge the food folks sadly it didnt measure up, I am not a real big fan of health food but that is kinda what I got from the place when eating there. Me and the wife ordered the lamb meatballs, to me they were a bit to gamey and pricey for 3 pieces $8.50, my wife ordered the sirlion steak that came with lil salad on the plate the sauce was so overpowering she could not finish her meal, so if you go and get the sirlion ask for the sauce on the side, tasted like mix of horseradish and A1 sauce, she ordered the meat medium which was not juicy but dry, sad really.. I ordered the BBQ pork plate with brown rice and what tasted like spinach but I might be wrong haha with a fried quail egg on the top, my meal was fair nothing to really write home about.The egg on top made the bowl!!!! But it is a quail egg haha so small, the pork was ok could of bought it at trader joes and whipped some some regular steamed rice instead of brown. in all I am more of meat and potatoes kinda guy gotta have juicy steak or any other kind of meat, got to have sides that makes you appreciate the food more mash, gravy, or at least something that you know they took the time and effort to make. you know the kinda of food where the chef would say dammm i'd eat that haha food * 1/2 sorey wasn't impressed not at all price $$$ $8.50 for 3 lamb meatballs, $18 for the sirlion, $17 for the bbq pork bowl... would not go back service * our waitress was pleasant but she kept on forgetting to refill the water at our table and it took her about 3-5 min each time we flagged her down for a request, it was not that busy on a tuesday nite On a side note, a good restaurant to me, keep the cups of water full if you need to leave a pitcher to stop from coming back and forth to do so haha this is in general for all restaurants the market on the side small and cute nothing else I can really add to that ha!

i think their dishes are hit or miss. the chinese chicken salad is very good and filling - you can order it at brunch or other meals, and you can grab it to go in the market as well. the soups tend to be very very salty. even if you're not a vegetarian, the tofu lentil loaf is tasty. the pizzas are decent. gingered mashed yams are very soothing.

i met a friend for brunch today at calafia. ?we had a short wait, and were seated at a communal table. ?the ambiance was fine, the waiter was friendly, and the service was accommodating. the meager rating is based on my experience with the food. ?i ordered the daily special, which was two poached eggs with roasted asparagus over hash browns with lemon hollandaise sauce. ?i liked the asparagus, although found the spears a little strangely seasoned for the dish. ?one of the eggs was a fine example of poaching, while the other's yolk was completely hard. ?the hash browns were okay on the outside - comfortably cripsy - but mushy on the inside and very uninspiring. ?i felt blasphemous when i requested ketchup in an attempt to enliven the potato, until the fancy, spicy, non-yummy ketchup came out. ?plan thwarted! ?i also tasted an unexplained small chunk of what i think was parmesan cheese in one bite. ?where did that come from? solidly unimpressed. ?meh. ?i almost feel like they were trying to be fancy with this dish, but missed the mark. ?oh well. ?my friend enjoyed her french toast (very simple), and the coffee tasted fine. i won't be clamoring to return.

The beef was cooked to perfection, with just the right amount of flavor and tenderness, and I don't know what they put in their dressing but it was amazing. Even with the beef, it felt like a light portion. I must say though, the portions are not very big ad it is on the pricey end. My friend ordered their asian style noodles which tasted good, but I would get the salad for sure if you come here. An entree is $10+ per dish. Ambiance is simple and clean, service is good, but again...slightly pricey food but I guess you always have to pay more for good quality food.

I've held back from reviewing this place until I've had at least 3 meals here. But after today's meal I feel like I can be objective here. This is a review for the cafe side and not the market Go Go part of this establishment. We went to the Calafia cafe with a large group for a busy Saturday brunch. I pretty much tasted 4-5 dishes. Let's start with service which was decidedly subpar with an attitude which is the worst if you ask me. Not only the waiter was slow but also had the nerve to say they ran out of bread which they charge for even though you could see the bakery side of the house is full of baguette breads! Then after our inquiry she goes and brings a basket and says "here, you can now eat bread!" I almost got up to talk to the manager to point out her rudeness but didn't want to make a scene. As for the food I had the chicken salad($14) which I can honestly say was the worst I've ever had. It was cold with a few small pieces of chicken plus bland greens. My friends hash browns were under cooked. The burger was tasteless. The french fries were good I must say. The french toast was ok but dry. One main theme of this place is an "attempt" to make the food healthy but that's done at expense of taste which defeats the purpose. At the end of the meal the waitress brings the check which includes her %18 tip with a section to add more tip! LOL!

This review is for the "market a go go" side. ?I came here to grab a lunch the other day after running errands at T&C. ?When I saw they had chicken pot pie, I had to get that, since I love chicken pot pie and am always on the lookout for a good one. ?It was very reasonably priced ($4.95) but didn't really taste that great to me. ?It was a bit non-traditional - instead of a crust on both the top and the bottom it had no bottom crust and was topped with a puff pastry crust. ? Normally I love puff pastry, but here it was a bit soggy and didn't really taste that great. ?The filling was a little off to me too - it had a lot of pepper and kind of had a spiciness to it that I didn't love. ? Maybe if I had eaten here instead of taking it back to work it would have been better, but by the time I ate it the whole pie was soggy and kind of chewy. ? I wouldn't rule out coming here again for affordable take-out, but I would definitely skip the pot pie.

4.5 stars! I'm a little hesitant to write a review on a place so new as it's bound to evolve over time, but we were thoroughly impressed by Calafia and would love to see it get lots of business. It was a bit hard to find the restaurant - it's on the side of Town & Country facing Embarcadero, in the same building as Long's Drugs. We arrived around 6 pm and were told the wait could be 45 minutes. We had a seat on the comfy couches in the lounge, and decided to order our wine while we were waiting (Note: you can order the full menu in the lounge too, but the tables are pretty small). The wines were all reasonable, ranging from about $18-40 for a bottle. It seemed like there was very little markup vs. what you would pay retail, so getting a bottle was a no-brainer. I lost track of time, which is a good sign, but we were seated in less than 45 minutes. We were at the table by the window. All the tables in the restaurant are large and communal, so you're usually right next to other guests. We sat on stools that ?were perfectly comfortable, but it was slightly inconvenient that I didn't have anywhere to hang my purse and jacket. DH had the Papas con Ajos (fries with garlic) and I had jicama slaw for appetizers. The fries were served in a cone of paper in a metal basket. If you frequent Google cafes, you'll recognize the style. They were very tasty, especially with the dipping sauce. The slaw was tasty but nothing special. For dinner, I had the Tofu Lentil loaf. ?It came with dark greens (I think it was chard) and smashed potatoes. It was fabulous - the miso mushroom gravy was so savory (I want the recipe!) and the loaf was deelish. I also enjoyed the greens and potatoes. DH had a vegetarian pizza (called something like I Need a Miracle) and it was very good. We finished off our meal with coffee made in the fancy Clover machine and shared Death by Chocolate. It was good, but more fudgy than I expected. Don't get me wrong -- we finished every last bit, including the caramel sauce and whipped cream. Our server and the rest of the staff there were friendly. The decor was simple but chic. Maybe not the place to go for a romantic night out, but it's really tasty food and reasonably priced for the quality. I noticed that it was a lot less crowded by 7:30. I look forward to going back and trying more items from the menu.

My husband and I love this restaurant and have been here multiple times. First, we love the products that they put into their food. Our favorite brunch dish is the eggs chiapas. They sometimes use a green sauce or a red sauce depending on the season. The restaurant is decorated really well. The menu is divided into two parts: vegetarian and non vegetarian. The staff there is very dog friendly.

I like the variety of food offered. I tried the lamb burger and had some noodles my sister ordered. Yummy. Also had some of their fish chowder. The service is really slow...we waited around for a half hour after our meal, just waiting for someone to show up with the bill. When a server finally arrived (not our original server), she charged the credit card to another table's order. So then we had to wait for it to get corrected, took another 10 minutes. Very frustrating...don't go here expecting a quick lunch.

Like other Yelpers, I really wanted to like this place. ?The biggest turnoff for me was our arrogant waitress. ?When the food arrived there was a noticeable mistake with one of our dishes and when we flagged her over she said in a rude tone "what is the problem?". ?After that, we got the silent treatment. ?There was no 'how was your meal' or 'thank you' when we left. ?I can safely say none of the people in my group will be going back. Decor: ?A Food: ?B- Service: ?D

Google cafeteria with some wait staff. Food was fair, but overpriced. Really nothing special about the tastes or textures, and the presentation was pedestrian. ?They aspire to trendy cooking, but sous vide, sous what! ?Hostess was very nice and accommodating, and the duck dumplings appetizer was worth getting again. ?Otherwise, no reason to go back.

I have had consistently bad service and coffee here. I only go to this place because it offer vegan and vegetarian options along with their meat plates. I went there for the first time on a recommendation from a friend. We were seated promptly but it took around 15 minutes for our server to finally take our order. Our drinks came about a minute before the food which also took around 15 minutes. I went back during the week on a Friday while I was shopping with in Town and Country with friends. Since one of them was Vegan and the other ate meat, I thought I'd give it another chance. The place was practically empty, and although we were seated almost immediately, we were left waiting for a long time before our server came. Out of everything we ordered, we all agreed the only good part of the meal were the fries. Even the coffee tasted horrible. Our server came back maybe 20 minutes after she had delivered the food, she hadn't checked on us once since the busboy and hostess brought our food and drinks. She noticed that the only thing we really ate were the fries and none of us took more than a sip of our coffee. We mentioned the coffee tasted really bad. Her reply was "That's too bad" This morning I thought I'd give it one last chance. I took my boyfriend. We actually meant to go to the restaurant next door but it was packed and the wait was too long, so I figured the service must have improved since our last visit. How wrong I was. As usual, we were seated as soon as we walked in, the place was pretty empty. We waited and waited, we were gathering our stuff because we were going to walk out when our server finally came. We both ordered the same thing. The drinks took a very long time to get to us although there were only about 6 tables occupied and there were many servers and other staff there. Again, the coffee tasted really bad, I asked my bf and he said it was terrible too. Our server never came back to check on us. We finished eating and waited around for 10 more minutes before he finally came back to check on us. But that was around 25 after he gave us our food. ?What really bothered us is that shortly after we had gotten our food, a party of three was seated right next to us and our server was so attentive with them, talked to them about the specials of the day, offered to bring one guest a taste of some weird soda they serve there because she wanted Pepsi and they don't carry that. What was it about us that made him dismiss us like that? We were dressed well, we were polite and pleasant when we addressed him. I think I've had enough of this place.

Visited for lunch with a group of co-workers (6 total). The restaurant is nice and they have outdoor seating. I ordered the duck confit salad. It was bland for my taste. My coworkers ordered the Roasted Mushroom & Black Bean Tostada and Mahogany Salmon Salad. They also thought the food was just ok and a little on the bland side. Given all the restaurant options in Palo Alto, I probably won't be going back to this place for a minute.

Calafia opens January 20, 2009, but we were lucky to attend a soft opening the weekend before. Chef Charlie Ayers (http://www.chefcharlieay¡­) is doing what he does best and is serving fresh, perfectly prepared dishes. He's assembled a dedicated service staff and a kitchen staff that knows what's cookin' and how to cook it. Charlie is all about fresh, local, seasonal, and organic. Lots of veggie dishes, and meat cooked perfectly for the omnivores. (Notice the placemats and napkins are from recycled materials.) All this yumminess is at reasonable prices, too. We'll go back again and again, and bring friends and family, to sample everything on the menu. Go!

Food - very good and seemingly wholesome, although I'm pretty sure fried tempura veggies albeit organic, garlicky scrumptious potato strings (addictive!), and big entree plates can't be too good for you. ?Still, I am a new fan! Ambience, wait staff, prices and menu are all great. ? Their lemonade with agave was so good that I had to have two servings. ?I will be back!!

I got the turkey burger, and it was too dry. I thought I could compensate by adding ketchup, but the small portion of ketchup they give you on the side isn't nearly enough. Also, the ketchup tasted funny, maybe they make it themselves or something. Also, the burger didn't come with a tomato which would have helped with the dryness. Geez when you order a burger at Denny's you at least get a tomato with it. Also, when the waiter asked me if I wanted any condiments, I asked for mustard, and I got Chinese hot mustard. Also, there was no drink menu when we arrived, so I couldn't order a drink when the waiter first came. So, I had to wait for the waiter to come again, and then again to get my drink. So I was there for 10 minutes without a drink. A glass of water when we first sat down would have been nice. Also, the smoothie was a little more watery tasting than I would have expected for a more upscale place. A little less ice, and more ingredients please. Things weren't totally bad though, the ginger yams and fries were good, but the the burger, beverage, and service weren't as good as Denny's or The Counter in Santana Row.

Deeply disappointing. Let me be clear. ?Neither the food nor the service were awful. ?However, they were mediocre at best. ? Among other things, salads were served at the same time as main courses, fries were served cold, and some dishes were simply forgotten. ?(To be completely fair, our server was very friendly and worked to correct these problems with a smile.) ?The udon noodles were sticky and gloppy, and the cheese on the cheeseburger hadn't been close to melted. ?We had a table of 10, and no one had a single dish that was actually great (or even very good). ?I'd heard about the wonderful, fresh ingredients. ?All I can say is that it's a shame those ingredients were put to such uninspiring use. ?I won't be going back. Last point. ?The decor is clever, bordering on pretentious. ?That would be absolutely forgivable (perhaps even cool) if the food were great. ?Given the reality of the food, though, it's just annoying.

Stopped by for a quick bite Solid food. Cheeseburger was good, not exceptional. However, with the chese burger came excellent home-made pickels, and excellent bacon, as well as decent fries. But for $12 I expected more. ?( for an excellent burger, check out magnolia in SF). Macaroni was good but portion very small. Mojito was good. Beer selection is good but too expensive: $8 a glass. Probably better to use the market and get food for picnic; market is reasonably priced for the quality

Brunch with baby and babydaddy on Saturday at about 12:30pm. Cons: ? - It was either the waiter's first day or he's just a terrible, terrible waiter. ?(Nicolas) ?We know some waiters can be good because Carlos graciously handled all of Nicolas's mistakes. - babydaddy got chicken and waffles. ?The waffles were so overdone they couldn't be hacked through with a fork and knife. ?When the people next to us got the same dish and I saw what the waffles were supposed to look like, I asked the manager and Carlos if that's what the waffles are normally like. ?They both grimaced and said no, we'll remake them for you. ?Well, we suffered through burnt, hard, dry waffles, and no, we're not going to eat two more. ?Then someone explained they have two waffles irons - one is *really* hot and the other is normal - so, there you go. - I got the Calafia breakfast, scrambled eggs and bacon. ?Bacon was limp and glistening with grease. ?I know, yeah, it's bacon, but this was like a bad pepperoni pizza. ?I had to blot it before I could eat it. ?My breakfast was delivered without toast (it came about 5 mins later, while my food got cold), then I had to ask for jelly, then for more butter (because the scary waffles absorbed all moisture around them), then for salt and pepper. Original waiter never came back, never asked how food was, just brought the check after the waffle debacle. They didn't offer to take the waffles off the check. - Dear god, it's loud in there. ?Babydaddy and I couldn't hear each other across the table under the wooden ceiling. ?We had to read lips to communicate. Pros: Staff was awesome to 14-month old baby. The 1/2 re-cooked waffle we got was actually delicious. ?It was light and fluffy goodness. ?The tempura chicken was also good (albeit a bit greasy). Hashbrowns were decent. All in all, we'll go to Joanie's or Cafe Brioche. Oh, and the website prices are all lower than the actual prices. ?By a couple of dollars. ?Lame.

Calafia is a great casual restaurant. Run by the first Google executive chef, Charlie Ayers, Calafia serves California fusion cuisine -- from Fiery BBQ Pork Rice bowls to Vegan Pizza to Lamb Burgers and everything in between; it is likely that I could eat here for an entire month and never have the same dish twice. The food is fresh and tasty, and the prices are pretty reasonable. They have a market next to the cafe/restaurant part which sells a variety of items that are local to the bay area such as TCHO chocolate, as well as to-go items and the cafe's own bake to prepare meals.

as we were wandering around town and country, we noticed a couple good looking restaurants in the plaza. ?calafia looked pretty happening, with a big crowd and a pretty casual vibe, so we decided to check it out. ?as we went up to the hostess, i noticed some signage that said calafia was owned by the original Google executive chef. ?"How cool!" I thought. ?i had just been talking earlier in the day about how i've still never tried google food. ?this was my big chance! ?we sat at the counters overlooking the kitchen. ?since i really like to watch cooking and see food, i was definitely excited about being able to watch the kitchen. sparkling water comes complimentary, which i tried, realizing i'm still just a plain old tap water girl. ?i ordered the mozzarella, basil, and tomato sauce pizza - wanted something simple. ?i also tried the duck confit. ?both were very good...not too ostentatious but still very well executed. ?for dessert we had the apple caramel bread pudding. ?the apple must have been soaked in rum or something, a little too strong for my taste. ? i thought this restaurant was really cool. ?it's too bad i don't live closer to mountain view, because i would definitely return. ?i really liked the fancy food, casual vibe. ?after this trip i realized, wow...Google really IS eating well.

Found this gem in the middle of town in country on a Sunday evening. It was a wonderful experience. My boyfriend and I were seated in Jeremiah's area. Calafia has a pretty diverse menu so my wondering eyes could not zone in on one item. Service=5 We asked Jeremiahs for his recommendation and was excited to see it was our first time. We ordered everything he suggested. Jeremiah is a big part of why they are getting a 5. He made us feel like valued customers, checked in on us from time to time so it wasn't overbearing. I hope all the waiters there are like this. Food=5 1. Lacquered Beef Short Rib: Full of flavor, soft, just melts in your mouth. The horseradish smashed potatoes could of used some more sauce from the short ribs. 2. Wolfgang's Pizza: amazing if you like duck. 3. Jicama Jalapeno Slaw: tossed with the perfect amount of spices. 4. Macaroni & Cheese Adobo: Hot and cheeses, I asked for the adobo on the side but next time I just leave it altogether. 5. Pear Tart: OMG, I don't normally like sweet foods or desserts in general but this was perfect, just the right amount of sweet, sour, creamy and flakey taste and texture. I paired this with a cup of coffee. Our total bill was around $75-80 (we order some beer). What I like about this place is that it supports the local farmers, all the veggies are fresh from our community.

Calafia is dead to me. It was a Sunday night and the restaurant was steady but not packed. My brother-in-law, myself, and my baby sat at the bar to order take-out meals and enjoy a drink while we waited. We sat down and it took a few minutes before Mike even greeted us with a quick over-the-shoulder 'I'll be right with you'. He did eventually get to us and we ordered beers. He did not offer us menus or ask if we were having dinner or any further inquiry. I got up and got menus from the hostess. Still with the menus sitting in front of us, we couldn't get the bartender's attention to place our order. I sat at the bar and used my cell phone to call the restaurant and that fantastic petite hostess kindly placed our order, because the bartender seemed busy she said. Mike never came back to us. So when another server came to the bar, I asked her how I could get my phone order. The bartender was coming back and she mentioned it to him, he turned to us and said, 'Oh, you have a take-out order? You called it in?' He didn't even know we had placed an order yet he never asked us if we wanted anything. The entire situation was pretty unbelievable. Friendly service helps smooth over the mistakes. The service was neither friendly nor attentive. I've had a few average experiences at Calafia and many good ones. The average experiences never kept me away but this one has. The GM said he was going to "make it up" to me but he never replied to my email.

Maybe I'm heavily biased because this place is owned by a former Google chef, but Calafia is probably my favorite Bay Area brunch spot. Get the "chicken and waffles" (crispy tempura chicken with bacon studded waffles & maple syrup....a must!) or any of the fresh fruit smoothies. The smoothies are incredibly fresh and come with fun, Silicon Valley - themed names such as Google Gulp, Facebook Freeze, and Zazzle Zinger.

Sooooo good. Being a self proclaimed foodie this restaraunt was a lot of fun. Sitting at the counter in front of the kitchen is a must. We had a lovely beet salad for an appetizer. Then we all shared the wolfgang's pizza with super yummy duck and we watche the cook prepare it in front of us. We even talked with the chef and founder of the restaraunt as he was working in the kitchen. The short ribs were very nicely braised with very nice horseradish potatoes and brussel sprouts. The gingered yams were very good with maybe just a little too much ginger. For dessert we had a very nice ginger creme brulee and a pear galette with some of the best vanilla ice cream I have ever had. The ambiance was very enjoyable and the the service was very nice as well.

came here to grab some lunch and chose this place due to our initial impression. walking in, it had a very modern, chic, & romantic ambiance. dim lighting included. it was somewhat busy during the lunch hour so we had to wait but only about 10 min. when we were seated it was hen that we realized that the menu revolved around a vegan theme (noodle entrees, lentils, rice bowls, veggie wraps, tofu dishes etc.) luckily they had a few non vegan to pick from. the waiters had fancy electronic hand held gadgets to quickly get our orders to the chef. & even though they were busy our food came out so fast it was almost unbelievable. i had the chicken, arugula, goat cheese, pumpkin seed pesto panini sans the pumpkin seed pesto. it was pretty good but i was expecting to have something on the side instead of just an a la carte sandwich, but sadly the rest of my plate was naked. my friend had an asian style clam noodle bowl which she enjoyed as well. i wasnt disappointed with the place, food, and service but i would probably check out the other places in the Town and Country Center of Palo Alto before coming back here. interesting fact: this cafe is owned by Google's 1st in-house chef! put that in your back pocket.

Calafia doesn't have the best or most inventive food in the world--if I could, I might give it 3.5 stars for food--but its fresh, inexpensive, tasty and relatively healthy, so I must thank them for filling a MAJOR void in the immediate Stanford vicinity. I've been several times and tried several different things, but my favorite is the yellow curry chicken bowl (I love curry and quinoa, so its really a perfect comfort food dish for me). The pizzas generally have really great toppings (but pizza snobs will cringe at the crust)--they will also generally make customizations to the pizza on the menu if you ask. The tempura is nice and crunchy and all of the veggie sides I've had have been ample and fresh. The fries taste a little healthy, which is no good in my book. The wine selection could use a little work, but the corkage is only $15, so I can forgive them that. The beer selection, on the other hand, isn't that bad. So, in sum, if you want something decent and inexpensive near Stanford and don't want pizza or burgers and you have eaten at Med Wraps already this week, Calafia is really the only place to go. They also take reservations for parties larger than 8 and are very accommodating for larger parties. As people have mentioned in other reviews, half the menu is vegetarian, so it can be particularly good if you need to satisfy a mixed group of meat-eaters and non-meat eaters.

Primarily based on food, I can't give this place higher than 2 stars. ?I ordered the chicken arepas off of the appetizers menu as my entree, and it was just one of the blandest things I've eaten at a restaurant in a while. The jalapeno-jicama slaw that came with it was basically inedible to me. I'm sure not all of the items are this bad but the menu was so.. random and nothing else really sounded that tasty either.

I came here after a backpacking trip, so I might have had googly eyes about the fact that had iced water, but whatever, I thought this place was pretty good. ?The food was creative and ran the gamut with a bit of Asian, Latin American, and European flavors. ?The spring rolls and crab rangoon were both good appetizers. ?For the main, I had the lamb burger. ?It was a maybe a bit over-cooked, but spiced right. ?Service didn't seem too bad, but we were outside and enjoying ourselves. ?Water was constantly refilled and the price of the food (about $6 for the appetizers, $13 for the burger) were reasonable.

Was randomly driving by last night and decided to pop in. ?My BF and I were pleasantly surprised. ?First off, we didn't know it was an organic restaurant, and secondly, it was pretty fast. ?The atmosphere was warm and intimate, and the service was nothing special. ?I started with a cup of their "meatball soup" that was creatively served in a mini-stock pot on top of a wooden board. ?It was cute! ?It tasted just as good. ?The soup was hot and tomato-ey with spinach and chunks of meat. ?For the main course my BF and I split the "not so small plate" Turkey Meatloaf. ?They weren't kidding about "not so small"... it was PLENTY for the 2 of us. ?Bonus points for them splitting the entr¨¦e onto 2 plates without us asking. ?The meatloaf was served covered in gravy and on a bed of mashed yams (not too sweet) and swiss chard. ?It was deeeelish!

Meh. My three-star review sticks. I went there for a salad from the marketplace the other day, and for starters, they were terribly slow at preparing it. (It took about 10 minutes.) One would think that in the 10 minutes they were taking to make the salad, that they were preparing it with the utmost attention to detail. (Hence it taking so long.) Alas, no. When I was ready to devour my salad back at the office, I discovered that they failed to include avocado, one of the key ingredients in the salad! What was worse was that there was a freshly sliced avocado in plain eyesight on the counter that they must have completely overlooked when making my salad.

Went for brunch. ?Ordered a Blue Max, Apple and Cheese pizza, burger, and tofu scramble. ?The poached eggs were way overdone on the blue max, and the bed of hash browns were not cooked all the way through. ?The pizza was not seasoned well. ?The burger did not come with veg at all (the burger next door at Mayfield is much, much better), and the homemade ketchup was overly sweet. ?Service was prompt, though. ?Overall, it was just mediocre food with a good, kid friendly atmosphere and good service.

Went here at 8/8:30 on a Sat night and we were seated right away. ?We were lucky in the sense that although we were in one of the communal seating areas (they had some "private" tables too for parties of 4-5 it looked like), we didn't have people right next to us. ?On the down side, though, we only had stools for chairs which I was afraid would make my back hurt, but fortunately didn't seem to. ? To start, my bf and I shared 2 appetizers, the Papas Con Ajo and Duck Dumplings. ?The dumplings were really awesome and tasty. ?The papas were good too, but overshadowed by the dumplings since those were so good. ?I wish the fries had some more exciting dipping sauces to go with them, I think that'd make the dish more appealing. For main dishes, my bf got the Mucho Macho Taco and I the Angry Pork Wrap. ?The angry pork wrap tasted very healthy and good and filling at the same time. ?I liked my wrap better than the tacos because the wrap had the jalapeno to give it more flavor. ?Had the taco had jalapeno or some kind of salsa along with it, it would've been an A too. We both got the agave flavored sodas, which were pretty good and had free refills (I appreciated the waiter telling us that cause I would've never expected free refills from a place like this, but once I knew that, I didn't feel like I had to nurse the drink anymore). At the end we got the Death by Chocolate to top things off. ?I'm a chocolate lover, but I wasn't too impressed by this dessert. ?It reminded me of the fudge recipe found on the back of a Domino's powdered sugar box in the form of a slice of cake. I also have to say that ?given the emphasis on local/organic ingredients, I was hoping to see more on the source of the meat. ?I was hoping the restaurant might support humane certified ranches, but since I didn't see anything about the origin of the meat on the website or menu, I guess that's expecting too much : / ?In general, it'd also be nice to see the specific locations/farms where ingredients are from so it's not as much of a blind promise of local organics.

My friend and I went for lunch today, she works around the area, and I wanted to check it out. As soon as we entered the place we were seated very quickly, and they were accomadating when we asked to move to another table. I ordered the Chicken Fideo bowl, and my friend had the Cardinal Press sandwich. My chicken bowl was good, but I knew I should have ordered the eggplant and mushroom panini. I saw one come fresh out of the oven...and it looked YUMMY. When you stop by try the Agave soda too, I had lemon-lime and first, but then opted for orange and it was much better. ?Last but not least, you have to try the flourless chocolate cake..SO GOOD!!!

Yay! I had lunch here today and it was really good. I love me some pickled veggies and Calafia has the best in town. Their Muffaletta looks like a softball. It's probably the least healthy thing on the menu but boy is it good! Salami, ham, prosciutto, provalone, and picked jardinere veggies with olive jalepeno spread on a super yummy boule bread.

When I visited the restaurant I was still recovering from ?3 wisdom teeth pull. ? I had the potato burata pizza which was good if you like lots of cheese since it was drenched in cheese which made the pizza dough too soft. ?I had potatoes pizza before but they were always sliced thinly, this one was in small chunks like the potatoes you roast with rosemary. My hubby has the Kalafia burguer which came with no mayo, only a ?homemade tomato sauce. ?He enjoyes it but did say that something was missing. ?My father in law had the lamb burguer and that after trying a piece it was definitely better than our other dishes. The mother in law got a chicken sandwhich which it didn't look that appetizing but I was not able to have a bite of it :) Past reviews did talk about the amount of kids in this facility, and yes there are lots and lots of kids. The space between the tables are really really small, which make me a little bit uncomfortable when other guests sat at the next table. There is a very nice selection of items for vegetarians and also for meat eaters. I eat both, but there are other places that I can get a better meal. Prices were decent for the overall quality of the dishes. ?Quite cheap actually for a Palo Alto 'pretty nice" restaurant. At the end my clothes smelled greasy......

Service can be spotty, the smoothie combinations are weird and the sour coffee ain't my favorite. But for a carnivore like me, brunch at Calafia is a no-brainer. I order three sides: 2 eggs, thick/crispy strips of bacon and a bowl of house-made lamb sausage -- all for just 12 bucks. It fills my belly and makes me happy. Thumbs up.

I had dinner at Calafia with two friends on a recent Sunday evening around 6:00pm. ?The only three-top immediately available was outside, and given the glorious early evening weather, we chose that option over a 10-15 min wait. ?Service was on the slow side - they seemed rather understaffed - but apart from being rather hungry, we weren't in much of a hurry. Calafia was started by the former Head Chef at Google, and the emphasis is on fresh, organic and local ingredients, with plenty of vegetarian, vegan and low-carb options. ?The menu is double-sided, with one side being entirely vegetarian/vegan and one side being omnivorous. ?From the omnivorous side, I chose the burger, asking our server if I could replace the bacon with avocado. ?His response was, "I'd love to accommodate you, but unfortunately we can't provide organic avocados." ?I was going to respond that non-organic avocado was just fine with me, but it turns out that because organic avocados were unavailable, the substitution would not be possible at all. ?After a few blinks, I requested that the bacon simply be omitted. ?This request was noted, along with the rest of the orders, using a flurry of taps on a Palm Pilot-like device. ?One of my friends ordered the salmon open face sandwich, and the other ordered the crispy chicken breast. My burger, with cheddar and grilled onions, was a perfect way to satisfy my meat craving. ?The accompaniments were a mountain of fries (unevenly cut but still evenly crisp), housemade pickles, and housemade ketchup that really tasted more like a tomato jam. ?The salmon was the most attractive entree of the evening, with salmon, arugula, and some apple layered over a very thin piece of crisp bread. ?He thought the dish was excellent but simply not very filling, given that the only carbohydrate was - to paraphrase his words - "a big flat crouton." ?The chicken was also carefully presented, with arugula and fennel shavings mounded on top. ?This dish apparently tasted good, though the chicken was slightly overcooked. Both of my friends complained of lingering hunger, which we all agreed could have been avoided had Calafia provided a bread basket. ?The salmon and chicken entrees would have been perfect for lunch or a light dinner, and Calafia is lovely in that it's both classy and casual, but keep in mind that some of the meals they serve are definitely insufficient for hungry 20-something-year-olds.

Went here recently for dinner. Was very lively but we immediately got a table for four. Service was perfect; the very friendly waiter turned up exactly when we wanted him to and had great recommendations. The menu had plenty of interesting, "California-style" ideas and was fully half vegetarian. The food came in generous quantities and was delicious, although some was not quite as flavourful as we might have hoped. We shared a couple of desserts and they were also great. Can't wait to come back and try some more of the options.

Only been a few times so far since it is new, but this looks really promising to be among the great restaurants in Palo Alto (quite a competitive marketplace). Menu- interesting dishes, with a definite nod toward healthy and some organics. ?Some nice and original beers on tap. ? Food - Went for a dinner and weekend brunch, very tasty indeed. ?Easy to share smaller dishes and appetizers, which was fun with guest. ?Some items with very nice spices. ?Decent portions help you so you don't overeat. ? Service- Really excellent. ?Plentiful servers who were obviously well trained. ?All have a smile on their face and seem to be happy- there is a great vibe in the place. ? Atmosphere - Very cool and unique interior and some great tables for outside seating. ?Some good music flowing through the place ("was that a Grateful Dead tune from a live show?!?") ? Prices - resonable. ?Appreciate that they didn't get too greedy and jack things up, they could have with their quality level, but it will help them keep it nice and busy in these tough times. Additional - There is a cafe connected which is yet to open, should be really great addition. ? Overall - This one is off to a great start, they have really thought things through and have executed perfectly thus far.

Second visit to Calafia Cafe and it wasn't so good at all. ?I ordered the Pad Thai Noodles with Beef Skewers. ?The noodles arrived drenched in a sauce that was so tangy and salty that my cheeks puckered with each bite. ?Unfortunately the noodles just kinda absorbed it in and got worse and worse. ?The bar staff (where we were sitting) asked how it was and when I told them that it was too salty they kinda just said, "yeah, i made the sauce today, too much tamarind huh?" ?and then didn't even offer to exchange it for something else. ?If he knows it's not right then why serve it and why ask how the meal is if you're not going to do anything proactive to change it??? ?The accompanying beef skewers were all right, but honestly I wouldn't know if they were seasoned or not after the noodles. ?A big BOOOO for Calafia Cafe.

When I took the first bite--hard and crunchy--I wondered if some shards of plastic hadn't inadvertently fallen into my Chinese Chicken Salad. Horrified, I kept chewing. ?And crunching. Upon closer inspection of the wafer-thin noodles,I discovered why: ?they felt hard, brittle, almost to the point of not being edible, ? Were they just stale? ?I had no idea. ?But the texture of the noodles just didn't work for this dish. The other things that doomed this entree (if you could even call a few shavings of lettuce and herbs with some chicken and dressing thrown in), was the chicken pieces were small and dark. ?Again, chefs, WTH? ?Please use longer stripes of white chicken breast! ?Especially for a dish close to $10.00. Now the place was cool. ?The huge communal table with bottles converted into lights overhead, was just way neat. The coffee, apparently from Barefoot Roasters, was great. ?Even though it took awhile to get it and my waitress didn't offer a refill. ? I think the other side, the mini market take out area is probably the way to go. ?They have smoothies and salads, sandwiches and other dishes. ?Much more economical too.

I've been to Calafia twice (lunch and dinner). ?I'm not impressed by the food. LUNCH: ?The Dragons Breath Noodles were horrible and tasteless! ?I was really hungry so anything would have tasted good but the noodles were tasteless and mushy. ?The yellow sauce was bland. ?I felt like I was eating glue. ?For $11 the serving size was TINY. ?The bowl was about the size of my hand. ? I also had the spicy fries. ?I don't like Calafia's thin cut fries. ?They are very oily but not enough salt and seasoning. ?Tasted like fried shoelace. ? DINNER: ?I had the turkey meatloaf with yam mashed potato. ?This dish was pretty good. ?But for the price I expected the serving size to be bigger. ?I was still hungry after I finished the entire plate.

I LOVED this restaurant. ?I'm surprised by reviewer Neha's experience with service - we had fabulous service. ?Both the hostess and our waitress were very attentive, without hovering. ?The decor is very nice, with some outstanding touches, and the ambiance is excellent. ?I love being able to see the kitchen and see just how well all the employees work together. The food was amazing! ?My boyfriend was initially skeptical, as he's not really into organic food and definitely not into vegetables. ?But he ended up falling in love with the place. ?He had the pan fried chicken with salad, cherry tomatoes and blue lake beans. Normally he hates green beans, but he demolished these. ?The serving was huge - I've never seen such a big chicken breast in my life - and it was delicious. ? I ordered the 5-spice chicken salad which was nice, but nothing special, and the greens with almond butter, which were to die for. ?Filled with some of the most nutritious foods you can get: chard, onions, garlic, turmeric, cranberries, walnuts, almond butter and lime juice, this could be my new go-to comfort food. ?A little on the tart side (they could lighten up on the lime, although for me it was great) this "side" was a meal in itself. ?We skipped the oh-so-tempting desserts because the servings were so generous that we took half our food home. ?I'm going back Thursday night with a girlfriend and can't wait to try some of the other dishes. I love that the kids menu is not reserved for children, too. If you like your food fresh, local, organic and interesting, definitely give Calafia a shot. ?If you aren't adventurous, this might not be the place for you.

Because this restaurant was opened by the former chef at Google, I wanted to try it, so my friend and I went for brunch/lunch on Saturday. I really like the simplistic look of the cafe, especially, how you can just look right into the kitchen. The kitchen spanned the entire length of the back and we sat right in front of it. I didn't know it was all brunch food on the weekends until 3pm, so I was already a bit disappointed. I was trying to avoid eggs and such, so I was glad to order the Tofu Scramble. Already, I didn't have much expectations for the dish since I never tried it before, but it was pretty good and tasted healthy (a big plus in my book). I think I would go back to try their lunch items. It's hard to judge a restaurant by just its breakfast food. It's reasonably priced, so maybe I will be back for sure!!

We ate here for breakfast. ?The food was good, but it was overpriced for the amount of food we got. ?I got the lamb sausage with eggs. ?For ten bucks I got two sausage links, some scrambled eggs, and some hash browns. ?The sausage was very tasty. ?The eggs were nothing special, and the hash browns looks like they were out of a box. ?My other friends agreed that the food was good, but there just wasn't enough of it.

Really dont understand all the complaints about the service on other reviews. Had a great server Jerome. My friends and I had a great experience here. We got the Tofu lentil loaf, eggplant and roasted pepper pizza, ginger mashed yams, greens with almond butter and mac n cheese. Super vegan friendly! Only dud was the mac and cheese -really really bland. Cant wait to go back and try more of the menu.

I'm one of those people who just visit Yelp to read the reviews but rarely write a review herself. But this place was so amazing that I felt like I had to write a review about it. You don't get to eat a pizza with shredded duck legs and Oaxaca-style mozzarella (Wolfgang's Pizza) everyday, or even sour cherry tart (it was heavenly I must say). I have quitted drinking soda for about 2 years now, but they have this homemade soda which they make with agave that just tastes amazing. The only reason I had to take a point was that first, where we were sitting the seats didn't have a back so that made it a little uncomfortable. Also I ordered cappuccino which after tasting cappuccino in Italy, I couldn't take more than just a sip. Other than that everything I tasted was amazing.

I am a big fan of their Market. They have reasonably priced, prepackaged salads that are excellent (the closer you get them to 12pm and 5pm, the fresher they will be). I also like their deli section: just make sure NOT to order there when the girl with the straight-ish blond hair is behind the counter (she will give very little meat, and pile on the cheese instead... I got a Ham and Cheese sandwich from her, and she made it more like a Cheese and Ham sandwich with only two slices of meat and four slices of cheese.). I bought a packages of 5-spice in the Market, and I've used it for making jerky -- it's wonderful! I have eaten at their Restaurant section a few times. True, their appetizers are meant to be for people with big budgets (many of Chef Charlie's fans are not exactly poor of course, so maybe that's why). Their desserts are FANTASTIC. If you're on a budget, skip the appetizers, and go for the dessert. They have desserts that aren't available in the Market section. If you're on a real budget, then skip the main course and the appetizers, and just go for the dessert. The pizzas: you need to ask them specifically to not leave it in the oven as long as they normally do (and really emphasize this), otherwise the crust will be dry and hard to chew. (They used to leave them in for shorter times when they first put pizzas on their menu, but they've started to put them in for longer and longer until they see the crust on the bottom is slightly black to make sure it's cooked -- of course, when that happens, it's a little over-cooked. Then again, they aren't a pizzeria, and they do want to make sure that they don't give you undercooked stuff.) Everyone I know raves about the spicy stuff on the menu. And despite what people claim: it's not like the food at a Google cafeteria -- it doesn't taste mass-produced. (Not that mass-produced food tastes *bad* per se, it just tastes different.)

Have gone here for lunch 4 times now and have enjoyed each one. ?The food is fantastic and perfectly portioned. ?The Fiery Bottom BBQ Pork Rice Bowl is a very unique and flavorful dish. ?The Daily Tempura never disappoints - arriving crisp and hot. ?The garlic fries are a must try. ?Can't wait to come back and try other items on the menu. The wait staff are always helpful and can answer any question about the food. ?Will definitely go back.

We've walked by many times and Calafia always looks so promising. ?We finally decided to stop in for lunch in the restaurant. Although the food wasn't great, the service was worse - and strange. ?We were seated quickly and through the course of the entire meal, two waiters seemed to be trying to work together to serve us but refused to communicate with each other. ?We ordered drinks from one and then had to repeat the order for the other. ?We ordered the meals and had to tell the other we had. ?On it goes. The primary(?) waiter had a strange approach. ?He was very very rushed, to the point where we felt unwelcome. ?We certainly weren't pushing him to work that fast. Between the two of us, we had the turkey meatloaf sandwich and the lamb burger. ?Everything was either rather bland or had a strange set of seasonings. ?The only thing that stood out was the yam mash on the side of the meatloaf. The worst past, though, was that we had a $10 coupon to try them out. ?One waiter took it but, of course, did not tell the other, and did not discount our meal. ?When the other appeared, I told him about the coupon and how it wasn't reflected. ?Then he charged my credit card the full amount and insisted the other waiter had applied the discount. ?And, just to avoid any confusion, he took away the itemized check so I couldn't prove him wrong? Let me assure you, he did NOT take off the discount. ?I can add up the cost of the items we had and plainly see that. ?But at that point, I was so weary of dealing with the service that I let it go and went home. Plenty of better places right there in Town and Country.

Mediocre. Riding on the tails of the google name too much. Service was spotty, took a while for the water to come. Waiter seemed rushed. Was extra attentive to the big group who sat near us. The waiter was eager to tell them about the specials and was forthcoming about suggestions. We were dismissed more or less. Got the glamour drink $5 made of cucumbers, avocado, melon and lime, very bland and tasteless. I had the shortribs with yummy yams, DL had the hanger steak. They were quite good, quantity was just enough for us to be tempted by the dessert menu. We finished with the bread pudding. $7 Total bill before tipping came to about $51.

My wife and I went and had outstanding service, very attentive, friendly and even gave us a free side dish to try because of a mistake in the kitchen. ?We had just two salads which were both outstanding and two sides (very creative selection of sides) which are extremely generous portions. This was our second time here. Previously we came and had a great breakfast, they make almost everything homemade including the Ketchup. ?Was a fun place to eat and reasonably priced.

Delicious food! We came on Monday based on a recommendation from a co-worker. That place with that chef who fed Google. Wonder what Google cafe was like? ?If it was like Calafia, Google people are just so lucky! We were seated at the bar. I was glad that there were hooks under the table, but sadly the hooks were too small to hold my purse (it's a small one). ?So I had to hold it on my legs the whole time. ?That's my only complaint. :) I had the Short Rib - simply awesome - fell off the bone. No idea what kind of sauce it was, but it was sooo good. ?Very tasty, with saut¨¦ed russell sprouts and mushroom, and mash potato. ?Perfect size - not too big. ? If anything, maybe they could pour a little less sauce onto the plate, so it does not make the potato too salty. ?(Okay, that was kind of a complaint.) ?I think the $18 was worth it. My husband had the Pulled pork sandwich, and said it was ok. ?He liked my dish much better. We will be back for sure. ?Maybe come for breakfast one day, to enjoy a tasty lazy Sunday.

We have been here two times. ?Food is healthy, tastes good, and a very good value. ? We went first for a Saturday lunch just after they opened the restaurant in Feb ?09. ? We shared a Chinese chicken salad and a ham/jarlsberg panini with dijon. ?The salad was light and the sauce was perfect. ?The sandwich ingredient mix was just right, without the "slug" feel of some ham&cheese. ? We went back for dinner in early March 09. ?We shared marinated beets with baby arugula. ?Excellent. ?Angry pork wrap made me realize one can eat pork without the oozing fat...and it was gooood. ?With black beans, rice, and slaw, the mix was just right. ?The eggplant/mushroom panini was well done; the wife stole the rest from me.

6 stars would still not do this great place justice! I just returned from one of the best meals I ever had in palo alto. yes, downtown and cal. ave. included! Upon entering we were promptly greeted with a welcoming smile from the cheerful hostess. Although it was dinner hour (7:30) the wait was not long. Exploring the marketplace and bakery kept us entertained as our counter seats were readied. We love watching the kitchen activity and were not disappointed with the show. Not only was each dish being so meticulously prepared, you could feel the love that was being put into them! My two guests and I are , or have been, in the food service industry so we should be the hardest to please. That didn't happen here. Every single item we ordered or were recommended to dine on was outstanding. ' WE STARTED WITH THE DUCK DUMPLINGS .CEASAR SALAD AND THE SUNSHINE PIZZA FOR OUR MAIN COURSE THE SALMON, SPARE RIBS AND ANGRY PORK WRAPS. WITH A GLASS OF PLUM WINE .WE ARE 3 BIG EATERS AND THE FOOD AMOUNTS WERE MORE THAN SUFFICIENT. AS A MAJOR SWEET TOOTH HOLDER, I COULDN'T EVEN THINK OF HANDLING ONE OF THEIR FANTASTIC DESSERTS . UNTIL I SAW THE CHOCOLATE ~BUTTER SCOTCH PARFAIT! IT WAS TO DIE FOR. KEEP UP THIS GREAT PLACE AND YOU WILL BE ONE OF THE STAPLES OF PALO ALTO DINING! Thanks Calafia for a great evening! RETURNED ON FRI 5/1 AND ONCE AGAIN WE WERE GASTRONOMICALLY DELIGHTED! BEET CARPACCIO AND FANTASTIC LAMB MEATBALLS TO START THEN SIRLOIN STEAK WITH COFFEE MOLASSES SAUCE AND CRISPY CHICKEN BREAST COOKED TO PERFECTION FOR OUR EXCELLENT DINNER. I THINK I'LL THROW MY KITCHEN AWAY AND EAT HERE 3 TIMES DAILY!

I've been to Calafia twice, once for takeout cuz the wait was too long and once for lunch. ?For our takeout dinner I had the short ribs which were pretty tasty with good horseradish mashed potatoes. My husband had the meatloaf which wasn't that great and he didn't enjoy. ? We shared the veggie tempura with friends but they got soggy by the time we got home. ?Our friends had the salmon entree which they really enjoyed. My second visit to Calafia was for lunch. I had the angry pork wrap which was pretty tasty. ?Not super spicy but a little kick, nice flavor, generous portion for lunch. ?We sat at a table outside so the service was a bit slower but still ok. Go again? Yes, I would come back if I had time to wait for a table or wanted to take out.

My family of four enjoyed our dinner last night at Califia. We started with chicken drummettes. All four including kids liked them. We had barely got the drummettes when the main courses arrived. They could have waited five minutes.. I had the Japanese Beef curry. Very tasty. I asked the waitress for a wine recommendation and she recommended a great zinfandel. The only minus was that the wine serving was rather small. Hubby had the fiery bottom pork rice bowl. He loved it but I found it a bit too spicy. Kids had the pizza and spaghetti and meatballs. They enjoyed both. The desserts were really good. Kids both had the ice cream cookie sandwiches with chocolate sauce. Ice cream is from Rick's ice cream in PA. Hubby had ginger creme brulee with lemon cookies. He really enjoyed that. I asked for a single scoop of vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce. That was really good. The place is LOUD! We had to talk very loudly to hear each other. Also, we had to wait 45 minutes for our table (we arrived at 6.45 pm on Saturday) but we walked down to Books Inc and shopped while we waited. We will return!

My wife and I were entirely underwhelmed by our lunch. ?She had the chicken tacos, I had the cheeseburger with fries and we shared the jalepeno & jicama slaw. ?The slaw was OK, if a bit watery, and everything else was bland. ?The burger was undersalted, the fries were greasy and not even remotely crisp. ?My meal came with house-made "catsup" that tasted almost entirely unlike any catsup I've had anywhere else. ?A big disappointment after reading all the good review on Yelp. We were there around 2:00 on Monday afternoon, definitely not prime time, but that's no excuse for the low quality of the food. ?Maybe the cook was off and the janitor was manning the kitchen? On the other hand, the decor was very nice, and the wait staff was attentive and pleasant. ?The house-made cola was also good.

Calafia,Calafia, Calafia. I wanted to like you I really did, but man was it disappointing. I'm really not much of a yelper because I don't usually have time but this was really NOT OK. I called in a to go order at around 1pm, give or take 15 minutes. I ordered the biscuits with gravy and a smoothie. I was told the wait would be 15 minutes. Ok no big deal, I show up at 2PM and they tell me my order isn't ready! What? What happened to 15minutes?? Ok, I really didn't mind that much until I opened and tasted the food. It basically was two stale biscuits plus a dollop of gravy. Seriously no joke. SUPER salty, the sausage was ?like sucking salt! I tossed the entire thing, Ok, I ate the egg that came with it. My co-worker shared with me. She had the same experience! She could only stomach the egg and tossed the rest! With out me even saying anything to her! Like I said I wouldn't have minded the wait if it was worth it. Would I go there, no thank you. What a shame. At least they have an appetizing

I would not call this a place that takes reservations! ?We have tried four times to do so, and only once have we succeeded. ?The first two times we came in on Sat. afternoons and asked the hostess if we could make reservations for 7 pm, only to be told to go home and call in after 5 pm. We did so and were told they were booked the rest of the nite, next time call earlier as they book up quickly!!! ?Months later we tried again, calling in the late afternoon only to be told to call back after 5 pm. ?We did as told, only to find no reservations available before 8 pm. ?The fourth time was a charm, and we got in at the preferred time of 7:30. We assumed that as this place was so popular, there must be something worthwhile about it, but it was not the service. ?We arrived at 7:15, only to be told to get in line (it was a long one). ?We explained that we had reservations, and were told again to get in line. ?By the time we got to the front of the line it was after 8 pm, and we were told to sit in the waiting area. ?By the time we were called, it was 8:30. ?We were led to a table shared with several other people, and sat on very uncomfortable metal chairs for 20 minutes before a waiter came to take our drink order. ?By the time we actually got our food it was nearly 9:30. That is two hours after our reservation time!!! ?The food was excellent, healthy and creative, but not worth the time, trouble, and wait. ?We did not bother with dessert or coffee because of the late hour, and because we were afraid of how long it might take. ?As such, by the time we left it was nearly 10:30 pm, too late to go and do anything after dinner. ?The noise was out of this world, too, we could not hear each other or the waiter. ?All the concrete and metal probably intensifies this. ?We won't return.

I came to this restaurant because I heard that it had a gluten free menu and vegetarian options. I was really impressed by the vegetarian options and the relatively wide variety of gluten free choices among them. On my first visit I tried the chard in almond butter sauce because I was not all that hungry at the time. It was a delicious, invigorating dish and I felt so good after eating it. I wish restaurant food was always this healthy and nourishing! On the second visit, my husband and I came to celebrate Valentines Day and we had a house white wine that was very pleasant. Then I had the "vegan love plate" and he had the salmon dish. I adored the pureed cauliflower and the rest of the sides, but I found the giant lima beans to be a bit plain and crunchy for my taste. Mostly I just wanted them seasoned a little more. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the dish and enjoyed the experience of trying it. I probably wouldn't order it again, although I would get the cauliflower puree again as a side if the option existed. One thing that I found rather distressing is that both times my husband and I sat with a clear view of the kitchen. He happened to notice that they seemed to have one pot (or possibly two) that they boiled all the pasta in. I was interested in the gluten-free labeled noodle dishes, but because I have Celiac disease and cross contamination can make me sick, I asked if the "gluten-free" rice pasta was boiled in the same water. Because it was, they advised me not to order the pasta if I was sensitive. I found this quite disappointing, and it made me concerned that the gluten-free labels on the menu were not appointed with full consideration of cross contamination issues. I also wondered, although I did not follow up on this, if hot water from the pasta pots was added to other dishes. It is a small, efficient kitchen and because of its small size, their options are limited. However, for clients who simply trust a gluten-free menu label but are sensitive to cross contamination (as anyone with Celiac disease is), this is an unfortunate oversight. Nevertheless, I was so impressed by the chef's healthy and interesting menu (and because the dishes that I ordered had not made me sick, as sometimes occurs in restaurants) I did return for a third visit, and will probably return again. I ordered the Super Salad on the recommendation of the waiter, which is a healthy raw kale salad topped with yummy things like goat cheese and nuts. To be honest, I'm just not a raw kale person. I like it wilted, if not by heat, at least by acid, so this dish wasn't exactly to my taste. I liked all the seasonings and the tiny amount of quinoa for interest, but because it was based in raw kale, it just wasn't my thing. Someone else who did like the texture and taste of raw kale would enjoy it, though. In the future I would like to try the horseradish mashed potatoes, beet salad, beet quinoa salad, and butternut chilijack dish. I love the passion the chef displays for vegetables, and his interesting, healthy approach. If they ever fix the cross contamination issue with the noodle water, I would love to try the asian pasta dishes that are naturally gluten-free. And I might have that braised green dish with almond butter again, because I felt so darned good after eating it! The atmosphere at the restaurant is pleasant and modern, with a lively atmosphere. The prices are high, but I understand that the rent and quality of ingredients make that inevitable. I liked the approach to food and found it a fun place to go with my husband for a casual evening out. However, I do think they need to work a little bit more on procedures for offering safe gluten-free dishes. If you are sensitive to gluten, you might want to ask about preparation procedures when ordering. I almost forgot- the banana split really is divine, and not all that bad for you if you share it. The bananas are coated with a little sugar and then torched for a crunchy topping, and then topped with ice cream and (not too sweet) whipped cream. I think there is a little fruit garnish too. Delicious!

I come here quite a bit for lunch(generally at least once every time I'm in the Bay Area). The service is very friendly and the food tends to be a great mix of interesting items such as curries and stir fries as well as standard American lunch fare such as burgers and sandwiches. Everything on the menu has an interesting twist to it. The menu is often changing. I was just there today and I'm a bit disappointed that the lamb burger and the salmon sandwich weren't on the menu but it's nice to have a bit of variety. It's in quite a good location just off El Camino at the Town and Country shopping center so it's a great lunch spot if you work in Palo Alto or at Stanford.

A dream come true. Fabulous selection--come for tacos or salads or pizzas or Asian noodle bowls. Everything is healthy. Everything is fast--and pretty cheap. Staff is friendly and knows customers well. Great for sitting alone, for having a party (reserve the communal table for a group), for quick take out, for a date, etc. My husband and I come about three times a week (at least).

I'd give Calafia 3.5 stars. Three of us went here for a celebratory dinner one weeknight. They don't take reservations, so we went a little on the late side, hoping to miss the crowd. When we got there, we were told we had a 10 minute wait, or we could sit at the community table, available immediately. We chose to wait, but ended up waiting at least 20 minutes for our table. We were really hungry, so we ordered some pork belly buns for an appetizer. Some sort of pepper on them was so hot that I literally couldn't taste any other flavors. Once I identified the source, I removed the rest of the peppers and enjoyed the buns. I had a chicken and goat cheese panini that was very good, but not amazing. Another person had the burger, which he said was really good. the ketchup tasted a little different than usual ketchup, but was very good. the fries were excellent. The third person had beef chow mein noodles, which looked delicious. Pluses: the beer selection, the fries. Portions are just right. Well-priced. Minuses: Doesn't take reservations. it was really cold in there, two of us kept our coats on.

I really love the way they divide thr menu, with a side for meat eaters and a side for vegetarians. Everyrhing is clearly labeled as vegan, gluten free, etc... I also love the fact that veggie or nonveggie alike, the food is uniformly yummy. My hangar steak was tender and had excellent flavor, but it was quite a bit more done than I asked for. The grilled escarole and blue chese served with it was delicious and the shoestring fries were ultra crispy. The vegan chocolate cake was delicious snd really moist inside, but you almost needed a jackhammer to get through the outside layer of chocolate. We had to practially destriy the dessert for it to be edible, which I hate to do. I really love a nice presentation, which the cake, and pretty much all of the dishes we ordered, definitely had. ?I also enjoyed the bites I had of my friend's quinoa salad and banana split. Calafia is a nice plave to go if you happen to be anywhere near Stanford. The service and atmosphere are good and you can count on finding some inventive, tasty cuisine.

I am not surprised by some of the reviews about how rude the owner is and how he treats his customers. I have patronized this place several times and on each occasion I was subject to watching and hearing how the mangers as well as the owner talk to and treat their employees. I was totally disgusted by the lack of human decency as well as the lack of concern for professionalism on the part of the owner and managers. The way they speak to their employees in such a disgusting manner regardless of being in front of customers is appalling to me. I go out to eat not only for the food, which is sub par at this place, but most of all for the service and ambiance. If I could give this place negative stars for manager/owner service and ambiance I would. I hope that they actually read these reviews and take these comments into consideration when it comes to how they run their establishment. If it were not for your prime location, you would be underwater. You are nothing without your customers, get it through your skulls.

Really good: big menu with many healthy choices (as well as a few not so healthy choices); good service (not A+, but very attentive); nice informal, lively environment; great for family meals; free, filtered flat and sparkling water a plus; outside tables not so nice and the communal table is okay if you don't mind eating next to strangers; wine list is probably a B-, but you can bring your own wine if you're fussy. ?I had a wonderful halibut special the last time I was there- good as any dish I've had at a Mobil starred restaurant- while my kids enjoyed their favorite grass fed burger in the peninsula. ?Really worth trying.

had dinner here tonight. ?got the pork bowl and the beef burger. ?the pork bowl is great and I would get it again. ?the pork is cooked very tender and has a great flavor - its topped on spinach, brown rice, and sweet potato. ?the burger is very lean and the patty is not very large - probably good if you want a lighter burger, but not as good if you want a big juicy burger. ?got the bread pudding for dessert - that was GREAT and is topped with vanilla ice cream. ?decor is super nice. ?service was great as well.

Duck dumplings were delicious. Try an agave sweetened soda! ?I felt that the pork buns left a bit to be desired but that is likely because they were meant to have habanero peppers on them which we opted to have on the side. ?Without that ingredient, they still had a touch of spicy, vinegary (no doubt the pork was brined) flavor, but they seemed a little "dead" like they could have used a touch of salt. ?Since we stepped outside the chef's design, can't really blame him. ?The service was friendly and attentive and the main dishes were fantastic. ?I had the pork belly with blackberry demi glace and it was expertly prepared and delicious. ?My wife had the mahogany plank salmon with quinoa which was very tasty as well. ?I would definitely recommend this place to any foodies looking for a nice evening out. ?One word of warning though, they will try to seat you at large family style seating tables which is nice if you're into that, but expect to wait a little bit as we did if you opt for a more private affair. ?We were seated a four top next (very close in fact) to a a two top and that was about as private as it gets.

Ordered a sandwich. ?Waited approximately 30 minutes for it to be made. ?I asked for no mayo, got about a half a cup of the stuff smeared on the sandwich. ?The excuse was that they were working out the kinks. ?I saw about 6 staff/cooks walking around doing nothing. ?They had to be reminded about my order. ?I would have sent it back but I didn't want to wait another 1/2 hour. ?Even if it was a new place, how hard is it to make a freaking club sandwich?

The food and location are great - the service is lacking. ?I have sat to eat in the Cafe five different times since they opened and the service only got worse. ?I have been there when only two tables were occupied and although one waiter was serving both and the other table had clearly finished, our waiter continued to bring our drinks and food to the other table. ?In order for me to get my check, I had to go over to the bar and ask someone else for it - then still wait ten minutes. ?The take out is good - save yourself the agravation of waiting to be served and then being forced to tip.

Not my first visit here, but may be my last. The ambience is nice, but was disappointed with the food. The chicken sandwich was barely edible. The bun was stale. My wife ordered the Veggie burger, and had a similar experience. The reason for the 2 stars is the service and the ambience, which were both good.

My Partner and I drove down from San Francisco to Palo Alto not for the food but b/c we find waiters aggravating and thought it would be fun to have a meal where we had minimal contact with one. Not what happened. After waiting for a table we were seated and promptly picked up the Presto tablet to order. We had almost gotten through our order when a waiter arrived at our table and announced that he was Jeremiah, the tablet was Presto and they were one person. After a bit more chatting (on his side- not ours) he asked if we would like to hear the specials (Hmm- why don't they put them on the tablet?). Not wanting to be rude, we listened and then went back to the tablet. Because time had elapsed we had to start over on my partner's order. We punched in our drink orders as well and pushed the button for send order to kitchen. A screen appeared telling us s/o would be by to check our ID's. After awhile Jeremiah came back and checked our IDs and then asked if we wanted to order. We said we had but he seemed to say it hadn't gone through. We gave him the order. The tablet disappeared. When he brought our meals, we asked for the tablet back b/c we thought we might want to order more drinks. Jeremiah checked to see that our meal was to our satisfaction and hovered over our table and the table in back. In the end, we just wanted to get away from him so we didn't order more drinks. The food was fine (my partner had the Calafia burger and I had the brick pressed chicken salad) hence the three stars but we can get adequate food in San Francisco and while the computer service sounds nice, it clearly hasn't been adequately implemented. Atmosphere is cafeteria style if you like that kind of thing.

I signed up for Yelp specifically to review Calafia, which should reveal a great deal about the strength of my feelings towards this new restaurant. I was very excited for Calafia to open, given the reputation of the chef, the moderate prices, and it's proximity to Stanford. Unfortunately, I will not return to Calafia as I cannot give my money to a place that treats its customers so poorly. My first two experiences were decent. I viewed the cold and incompetent hostesses, rude waiters, and frequently discontinued menu items as symptomatic of a tough opening, though I later found out that this restaurant has been open for a few months now. Besides, the food was decent, and the price was acceptable. My last experience pushed me over the edge. On a Sunday night at 7:30pm, two of us were made to wait a half an hour for two seats at one of the high bar-type counters. The restaurant must have been busy, there must not have been any seats open, and there must have been people in front of you, one might observe. Busy, yes, but there were four open counter seats. People in front of us, yes: an older couple, one of whom was in a wheel chair and therefore could not sit at the counter. The hostesses could not process the fact that someone in a wheel chair could not sit at a high counter, and argued with husband about seating the handicapped wife at the counter. When the hostesses finally understood that the couple needed a proper table, then refused to seat us, claiming that the couple needed to be seated before we were, leaving us waiting for 30 minutes while there were open spots. Not only that, but they refused to give us any time table for when we would be seated. When we were finally seated, I attempted to order a beer. I am 25, but look young, so I am accustomed to being carded. I am, however, not accustomed to having my drivers license declined. I have an out of state license, which the server refused to accept. He then showed my license to the manager, he of no more than 25 years, who looked up briefly from his T-Mobile Sidekick (not exactly a work phone) to shake his head no. I asked to speak with the manager so I could provide other identification, but he refused to come over. I understand that it is challenging to deal with out of state licenses, but Calafia is located across the street from Stanford, where a majority of those who are of legal age (undergrads and grads) are from out of state. Alcohol sales drive a restaurant's profit, and students will be a major source of their alcohol sales, therefore one would think that Calafia would equipped to deal with carding in a better manner. The waiter came back 10 minutes after the beer incident to take our order. I tried ordering the hamburger: no luck, as they were out. I tried ordering a sandwich: no luck again, as they were out. One would think that the restaurant could have reprinted their menus to reflect these changes. The menu is a simple piece of paper- easy to reprint- plus I had been there two days prior, and they had reprinted their menus in the intervening period. Our food came 10 minutes after ordering: they are certainly prompt in that respect. The food was bland (a chicken dish and a pizza), and it was delivered without a comment. No one came to ask us if the food was ok. We paid the check and walked out without a goodbye on their end. Recommendations for Calafia, if an owner happens to be reading this: replace your hostesses, especially the older woman, as they are not able to deal with high volume traffic in a professional manner. In a high throughput, no reservation establishment such as Calafia, it is important to have upbeat, enthusiastic servers. Some servers are very good, but others have terrible attitudes. Replace the ones who are not up-beat, enough, and retrain everyone to be more communicative regarding the menu options / their recommendations. Lastly, I know you plan to open a market in the space next door, but you should consider a flexible arrangement that allows some portion of the market to be used for food service: you are busy, and will only get more popular as the kinks are worked out. You need more space than you have, so using portions of the market could be a good idea.

I think Calafia is finally finding its footing! ?I love their steak tacos with lettuce rather than tortilla wraps and their shaking beef salad. ?It is still expensive, but the slim-friendly dishes are tasty and satisfying, and everything is expensive in Town and Country. ?I also love their Market salad bar for a quick lunch to-go.

went there for dinner on a saturday night around 8:30. the waiter told us that the huge saturday night rush had just left so it quieted down a lot. the inside seemed really fun, although my friend and i sat outside which had nice lighting and was a lot quieter. immediately upon sitting down and just reading the menu i knew i'd want to come back, and i totally will. the food is seriously good. i got the mahogany salmon salad -- which was salmon on a bed of arugla and quinoa. the quinoa was a really nice touch. my friend got the crispy pork belly which was so rich (but in a good way!) we got a side of miso mashed potatoes which were surprisingly vegan despite their total creaminess. wine selections are good and affordable too. the service was really good, each person who waited on us showed great courtesy and attentiveness.

Quality, portions, and service are always consistantly fabulous! All the servers are great, but Carlos is our favorite! We drive from the Campbell-San Jose area regularly to eat at this cafe. Vegans, vegetarians, organicist and meat eaters all have a variety of choices and all are excellent. If you have any questions the entire staff is educated on the menu and dish choices. The Chef Charles was formerly with Google and I believe at one time the Grateful Deads Chef, but the Cafe is definetly alive and thriving. On a busy night Charles made a point to come out and personally check to make sure the food and service were up to expectation. I do have high expectations and this place exceeded them all. Make the drive and be ready for a great dining expierence. My wife and have been frequently been going to Califia for about a year now and will continue to visit Carlos, Charles, and the entire staff at Califia. Make this a regular destination and you won't be disappointed!

It felt like mom was cooking for me at Calafia - just great food. ?I am so happy to find a place in Palo Alto that is comfortable and provides healthy good food for a reasonable price. ?We arrived at 5:30 last Friday night and were asked if we wanted to sit at the window bar - I thought that was a bit strange since I was holding my 3-year-old's hand and anyone with kids would have known that communal sitting isn't best (easiest) for little ones. ?However, they did provide crayons for him once we were seated. ?Our server was good - if not a little green - and the food was as well. ?The herbs and yummy toppings on the fries made them finger licking good and the bbq pork with brown rice and spinach was healthy and yummy. ?We will definitely be back!

Had a great experience yesterday at Market a Go Go. ?I needed 7 sandwches for a meetng that day and called in the order. Normally, they need 48 hour notice but they were able to accomodate me. ?I got there at 11:00 and everything was ready and they checked me out super-quick. ?Everyone loved the food, especially the 2 Vegans. ?They had the Vegan Palo Alto club. ?Neither had ever had a smoked tofu sandwich and absolutely loved it. ?They were also very excited about the soy mayo. ?I'm not vegan so, I don't understand why one would get excited about soy mayo but I can imagine if you're on a special diet, it's difficult to find meal options and variety. ? I did'nt' get to eat since I was the presenter so, I went back and had the Sand Hill sandwich. ?Soooo yummy! ?I actually don't like Swiss cheese and didn't notice when I ordered it that it had Swiss Cheese. ?I didn't read the description well at all because I also didn't notice it had butter. ?Wow! ?The first bite was sooo awesome! ?I noticed the Swiss immediately but it had a nice smooth, sweet flavor and was a very nice cheese. ?I also noticed a hint of butter which really brought out the flavor of the Sourdough bread. ? I also don't know why I ordered it because Ham is one of my least favorite deli meats. ?However, the smoked flavor was just so nice and was perfect with the Swiss cheese and all the flavors blended so well. ?I intended to only eat half of it because it was large. ?Well - forget that! ?I ate the whole thing. ?So, I don't like Swiss Cheese and Ham is not my favorite choice but, I LOVE the Calafia Sand Hill Sandwich. ?I would have that again and again. ?Crazy, huh?

I am very please to have all the new restaurants in the T&C. With so many options available service and quality should be a priority. Unfortunately NOT a focus here. At least not for take out. Stopped in for "to go" sandwich at 2:30pm. The grilled cheese sounded promising - 3 kinds of chese, arugula and ?sundried tomatoe? - the place was empty, but it still took nearly 20 minutes to get a sandwich. 15-minutes into the wait, they tell me they are out of arugula! ?At $7 and the better part of my lunch break, the final produce was nothing special - mostly bread/cheese not fully melted. ?I shared by disappointment with the manager, but got only a sorry and goodbye. There are lots of alternatives eats available at T&C. I suggest you try one of them.

We had the root beer agave soda, caesar salad with rice paper, crouching chicken pizza, and turkey meatloaf with gingered yams and greens and all was delicious. ?The tiger sauce on the pizza was a little to hot for our tastes, but that's more of a personal preference. ?The meatloaf, yams, and greens were very much like I would cook at home on nights when I have time - healthful and tasty takes on American food. ?We definitely want to come back and try other dishes. ?Our server was very attentive. ?She said the chef will not do substitutions because he had a particular vision for each dish (or something like that), which is understandable, but on the other hand, does make it less user friendly and limit your choices if you have a food intolerance/allergy etc. ?Also, the fact that they have agave sodas instead of the standard junk food sodas was great.

Not bad at all. I had the fiery pork bottom bowl, it was spicy and quite tasty. The quail egg was a nice touch and I am not a fan of runny egg, but the egg was little so the little bit of sunny side up quail egg was quite good. My friend had the angry pork roll, it was a little bland but it was jazzed up once we asked the waiter for some sauce to dip it in. I liked the atmosphere and the service was really good. We got our food really fast, which helps when you are on a 1 hour time frame for lunch. I am looking forward to going back to try the other items on the menu.

I am giving Calafia 5 starts because I believe it executes its mission perfectly. Is it The French Laundry? ?No. ?Is it trying to be The French Laundry (where meals take 4 hours and cost perhaps $1200+ for 4)? ?No. ?Here's what I think is special about Calafia. ?We eat pretty healthy and mostly organic at home. ?We cook pretty well. ?Sometimes, we don't want to cook for ourselves -- but that doesn't mean we want to eat crap. When we go out with our family (which includes small children), especially on a weeknight, we're still in the mood for healthy food, mostly vegetarian, definitely local ingredients -- and we want it served in a casual, friendly, rather quick manner. ?*This* is what Calafia is. ?You can stroll in, order a pretty nice glass of wine, order some very, very good, mostly healthy food, and get out for just a bit more $$ than what you pay at Fresh Choice. ?And Calafia is just miles and miles better. ?(Can't believe I'm even comparing the two.) When we ate out as a family during the week, we often used to end up at Fresh Choice or Country Gourmet. ?Seriously, we liked those places -- but I doubt we'll ever go back to either. ?From now on, it's Calafia. (As for the service complaints that I have read on Yelp, we didn't encounter any problems. ?To repeat what I said in the beginning of this review, it's not the type of service you see at The French Laundry. ?(Thank god -- I can only take that level of fawning attention a few times a year.) ?They were pleasant, got our order right, and got us in and out without any waiting. ?In other words, the service met our expectations and we have no complaints. )

We went here two weeks ago and were really watching the service to see if it was as bad as some people reported. We did not want to eat at the first table offered and there was no problem sitting somewhere else. Our wait person was fine. Our food was served in a timely fashion. My ice tea was refilled. We were asked if everything was okay or if we needed anything else. This was on a week day at dinner time.

I've been here twice for dinner, and the food is very good. I think the ambiance is really appealing, the service is good, and the restaurant appropriate for this affluent area. But very recently for a small at-home catered party we ordered catering from here and the food was mediocre. For appetizers we had the chicken, shrimp, and chipotle beef skewers. The chicken was super dry and not that tasty. We got the sauces to go with the mixed platter of skewers, but we didn't know which skewer went with what sauce. We also had the quesadillas, which are remarkably good. For the main dish, we had the eggplant and the chicken parmessan, the macaroni and cheese, and the herb crusted beef tenderloin. Everyone loved the beef tenderloin, but we were dipping it in the lemon aioli which was meant for the shrimp skewers (above). The macaroni and cheese was not a hit with the adults or children. And the eggplant parmessan was very, very basic--no complexity to the marinara sauce and the eggplant was way too thickly breaded that it tasted like wet, soggy breadcrumbs. Not great! For the price (VERY pricey), the food was just ok and not worth it.

About to pay an arm & a leg, waiting in fear from the large head chef to decline my request of adding sweet potato fries, part of today's special sandwich that is only available for meat eaters only. My request gets declined.

Excellent food and atmosphere! ?Highly recommend- unique menu and really tasty. ?I loved how my soup was presented, and the fries are addicting. ? My husband ordered the burger and I had a pizza- both very good. ?We waited a bit for a table (no reservations and the place was packed) but we ordered a drink at the bar and then sat on the comfy couch/chairs in the front. ?Worked out perfect. ?Would definitely come back- cannot believe we haven't been before! ?Nice date spot too.

The decor is nice and the food is OK. The service leaves much to be desired. The hostess was rude and confrontational. Our waitress was careless. She forgot about our table and took another table's order before us. When we brought this to her attention, she didn't apologize or correct it. I can not recommend this place.

I'm surprised at the quality. ?I had both dinner and bought food to go from their deli store. ?I think Safeway salad is was much fresher and more flavorful. ?Definitely no competition to Whole Food salad any day. ?I bought their chicken salad ...blah tasting, lemon vinagrette too artificial lemon flavor and feta cheese did not enhance the flavor. ?The fried tortilla was at best chewy and wasted calories. ?I bought their coffee but haven't tried it...I had their chocolate cake with creme filling- good but not awesome. ?The restaurant was terribly disappointing. ?My friend had the chicken dish, I had their ribs. ?We also had the lamb appetizer-luke warm with orange sauce...sign of not so great. ?Really, lots of other mom and pop ethnic restaurants can smoke this place for lamb meatballs. ?The ribs were exceptionally tender...but way too much sickeningly sweet barbecue sauce covering the ribs. ?I managed to taste the ribs under the sauce...under salted at the core. ?Their side dish of chards was too over cooked and evenly salted. ?I sat at the counter facing the kitchen ...and watching the way the chef cooked that night...I knew exactly why my food tasted horrible. ?The chicken was dry. ?I like their decor.... ?I have for many years envied Google's employees and had thought about posting for a Google date on CL just to get an invite to their restaurants for lunch. ?I'm glad I have laid that desire to rest with this restaurant experience.

the food is rather expensive and mediocre. ?the service is poor. ?the parking is relatively convenient. ?the only redeeming factor is this place has a decent vegetarian/vegan selection which makes dining in groups relatively flexible. ?their omnivorous dishes though are rather sub par. ?everything here seems priced 100% more than it should be. ?i may give this restaurant 2 stars if i had some obscure dietary restriction. there is something amiss with the waiters... their presence really ruins the ambiance. ?the food is bad but coupled with their rude food delivery (they almost just throw the plate on the table) and their unpleasant radiating stench makes the dining experience almost unbearable. ?(several of the employees wear some sort of perfume that is detectable at least 3 feet away.) after being seated the waiter comes and recites a laundry list of ingredients used in the specials. ?the longer the list is totally doesn't correlate with how good it tastes. ? definitely an interesting beverage menu item is the juice from wine-grapes. ?(not fermented, so ridiculously awesomely sweet as expected). ginger mashed yams - not really edible. ?too sweet and for some reason also sour. papas con ajo ?- (potatoes with garlic) not sure why this menu item is in spanish. ?the fries themselves are pretty unsavory... they are hard and crunchy ... if i wanted potato chips i would've ordered that instead of unhealthy looking semi-rectangular-prism-shaped potato slivers. ?the included special red sauce tasted like funky watered down ketchup. tofu lettuce cups - looked not edible pulled pork lettuce cups - not really good. duck dumplings - good. ?seem like regular gyoza but with duck meat inside. ?couldn't really taste the difference. ?not sure why it costs over 10$ for six dumplings (in other words why one dumpling is over 1$)... did they import the ducks artificially raised in antarctica or something? chicken drummettes ?- good. ?apparently the head chef is from google? ?so they named their sauce 'google style sauce' laquered beef short rib - unpleasant. ?the meat looked burnt. ?the meat didn't even seem fresh. ?it looked like something they just pulled out of a microwave. grilled hanger steak - looked like $h1+ on a plate with a side of shriveled fries. banana split - bruleed banana? ?unnecessarily sweet. ?diabetes anyone? ice cream generic, probably just scoops of store bought generic ice cream. chocolate cake seemed like a chocolate cheese cake in consistency. ?probably due to it being some special ingredient free cake.

I took one of my little old lady friends to dinner for her birthday after we had both seen a segment on the restaurant on a local news channel. ?The show highlighted the organic, sustainable nature of the food and it showed with their menu. The show also featured the technology side of today with the ability to order and/or pay via a hand held device. ?We never saw anyone with any tech gadget so I finally asked our waiter when we were almost done with our dinner. He said he doesn't push it ?much as it slows him down. ?Whoops....not sure that was the intent of the tech gadget! ?Our meal was very good. My friend had salmon, with brown rice and cooked greens. I had a bowl of potato soup with pancetta. ?I was pleasantly surprised when the soup arrived being made from a broth and not a milk base. It was served on a small wooden platter in a cute mini red Le Creuset soup bowl. ?While I was glad they didn't serve any bread or special crackers, etc., I was also a little surprised that there wasn't even one skinny cracker! ?I also had the special sweet potato & green bean tempura which was excellent. It was lightly breaded and not greasy at all, veggies were very crisp. ?We each had a glass of local wine. Loving the beer and wine menu, we had difficulty choosing from all the local and some new suppliers that are all within a few hours drive. ?We'll be back for another meal soon!

My friends and i had brunch here on sunday, and lets see, we like this place because of their "green" way of doing things. ?The food was good, i had the tofu scramble, it was well seasoned and tasted good, and i had the yogurt and granola cup. ?That was ok, well in their defense, the granola was made healthy, so there's no sugar in it, it's all natural for me i'm use to the bad sugar kind, i think if they put more yogurt in, it would not taste so dry and would make a healthy dish a bit better. ?My friends had the french toast, noodle, salad and eggs and lamb sausage, they all like it, espcially the french toast that was gone before my fork hit the plate....but they did feel the portion was a bit small, but for the price it was good. ?DUh, they should have ordered two dishes like me....lets see what else, oh the service, was ok, i think they are under staff and for a restaurant of that level i would not expect to have my waiter bring out the water for me or the miscellaneous knick knacks as part of his task they should have someone else for that, then we would ?not have to wait as long. ?I mean the waiter was great but i think was just overly tasked. We all said we'd go back to this place.

My wife and I went there for the first time. ?She was excited at seeing all the vegetarian dishes as well as being organic whenever possible. ?The d¨¦cor is very nice, the staff exceedingly friendly and the prices are reasonable (but not a good value). ?I had the Mucho Macho Taco and she had the Veggie burger. ?They were the worst soft shell tacos I have ever had and I am not one prone to superlatives. ?They consisted of shredded beef, lettuce and onion. ?The meat was incredibly dry, didn't have much flavor and refused to be broken down regardless of how much I chewed. ?I barely ate one taco and passed on the other two. ?The staff wondered why I didn't want the other two or if I wanted them boxed up. ?I declined saying I was full. ?My wife said the Veggie Burger had good flavor but was also very dry and that the Veggie Burger at The Counter was much better. ?French fries were passable but apparently had not been cooked recently (same could be said of the taco meat). ? The claim is it is "slow food served fast." ?Unfortunately to achieve that claim the food needs to be cooked beforehand. ?How long beforehand is the issue. ?They seem to have more than enough staff in the kitchen to reduce the time between cooking and serving. ?Initially we mentioned we would come back and try another dish but upon further reflection, will pass.

I guess we have to find another cafe...we had been going to Calafia for the last year, about 2/3 times a month and usually enjoying it. The last 3/4 visits have been terrible. The location and ambiance are nice (but a little loud sometimes) but the food and service have gone downhill. The waiters put on a show and no, I don't care a damn what their name is. The food is now coming quite cold and without much flavor. I belatedly thought I should have called the waiter back and yelled "FLAVOR PLEASE". My last daily scramble was OK, except that the tomato slices (2 slices) accompanying my eggs were the top and bottom of the tomato!! WTF??!! Not even a slice from a better part of the tomato? I put it aside of my plate but I doubt the bus boy pointed it out to the cook. Maybe the cook didn't like our waiter? Getting back at him? I hate being collateral damage. Conspiracy theories aside, everything seems to point to success going downhill fast. Cheers!
