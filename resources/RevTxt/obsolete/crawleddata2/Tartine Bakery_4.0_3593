Tartine Bakery is so lovely! Ê I got the banana cream tart and a glass of pinot noir. I was a happy girl :) It was pretty packed when I got there (a little before 5pm). ÊI waited about 15-20 minutes to order and analyzed this delicious piece of goodness. ÊThe cream was light and not too sweet, but the banana and chocolate at the bottom had the perfect texture and sweetness. ÊChocolate sprinkled around gave it a nice touch. There are only a few seats and few more outside, but you can walk to Dolores Park to enjoy your baked goodies. ÊGreat place to catchup with friends!

After we went here, we spent the rest of the time trying to go back, but were never successful with our time. Oh well, maybe another visit? Some food was amazing, and some was so-so. After visiting Seattle's Bakery Nouveau so much (and loving it), I was comparing the two. The chocolate croissant here was not as good, but still yummy enough that I polished it off. The croque monsieur was barely edible for me, but I don't like sourdough, and this was super sour bread! The frangipane...oh man. Soooo good! If you told me I would prefer an almond/fruit tart to a chocolate croissant, I would have said you're crazy, but it was that good!!!! The morning bun was also good, but not my favorite. If you like orange marmalade a lot, then you will like it more than I did. The bread pudding looked kind of gross by the time we opened the container, but it was also yummy. The fruit was really fresh and the pudding nice and custardy. We definitely want to go back and check out more of the treats (chocolate cake!) and return for some of the favorites (frangipane!). If the line seems long, don't worry, it will move quickly! (Faster than we could make up our minds!)

I can see why there's always a line wrapped around the block. Its a very small bakery with limited seating. But by the looks of it everyone is buying and leaving. I went all the way their to try their famous chocolate croissant, which by the way is my favorite, but they were sold out! This is about 2pm in the afternoon, guess they are really that good. So I opted to try the banana cream tart... This was heaven! The tart itself had a delicious crust, flaky too with a layer of chocolate at the bottom. The cream on top was not too sweet at all, or the custard and real slices of banana inside. I was truly in heaven, and I'm not a sweets fan at all. I will give that extra star, the next time I'm SF to try this chocolate croissant..

This place is always so popular and packed. I like their bread pudding and their cookies. If you have time, eating their sandwiches are super delicious, but also very heavy on the butter, so come with an appetite.

My rating is purely based on how freaking delicious the pastry that I had there was. If i wanted to be more difficult, I'd dock points for the service. The service was terrible, as I was told by my cousin who did the ordering (I got our seats while she ordered). It wasn't one, but two people who serviced her who treated her poorly. There's no real excuse for bad service, but I'm going to make it a little easy and just rate based on the food selection. I have to admit that I made my order selection based on how beautiful the lemon tart looked while I was in line. The perfect crust lining, and beautiful football shaped whipped creme atop the lemon filling was a delight to my eyes. I had to have it, and so I did. The lemon tart was easily one of the most delicious desserts I've ever had. The crust was amazing, the lemon filling the perfect amount of tartness, and the whipped creme a perfect blend of light. We also had the tres leche cake which was delicious as well. It wasn't exactly my taste, with the textures all wet and soft, but I did enjoy it, and I'm sure others would too!

My wife and I went to Tartine Bakery today. We waited in line for about 20 minutes. The Morning Bun was pretty good and the bread pudding was just okay (we're not bread pudding fans apparently). The Banana Cream Tart and Coconut Cream Tart both looked good, but were very pricey at $7 each. I want to give them 3.5 stars, but Yelp doesn't allow 1/2 stars. (Overall Grade: B-)

DEE-LISH-OUS Stopped by on a Wednesday afternoon, around 3pm, with a welcome break from the long weekend lines. I had just eaten so I'll just have to stop by again to try a sandwich. What I did get to try! The morning buns are fantastical, even better warmed up at home. I understand why these are always the first to go on the weekend. The banana cream tart was heavenly! With a thick crust with some chocolate layered on along with come caramel sauce in the tart itself. Everything YUM. Overall I think the morning bun was more worth the calorie intake but I what would I know? I ate almost everything I bought in one sitting. With my water to balance my diet, of course. I have to say just the smell of the bakery is enough for a 5 star rating. Maybe overrated for you if you don't order the right items? Thank god I got the inside track from my sister! So ready to try the rest of this delicious menu! Eat up!

I did not think this place was anything special. Maybe it was an off day? Came in the afternoon around 2 on a random Wednesday, there was barely a wait. The place smells amazing, like BUTTAry goodness. I opted for the Banana Cream Tart. It was 4'' in diameter for $7. When you dig into this, my fork couldn't even get through the flaky crust. I had to eat the banana and cream part first out of the "tart bowl" and then use my hands to break apart the crust and eat it separately. The crust was definitely overcooked, almost a bitter burnt taste and way too stiff. The experience I had eating this was nothing that I expected.. My friends got the Morning Bun and Bread Pudding, which was recommended by other Yelpers. Morning Bun was probably the best, but it was nothing extremely special. I thought it was a bit too overbaked as well, but I can see why everyone loves this item if it was prepared properly. The Bread Pudding was horrible. My friend ended up throwing it away before finishing it! It was a curdled blob of hot mess. Would not recommend this.

I was showing a friend around town and she wanted to grab some pastries so I took her here. Tartine is usually pretty busy every time they're open but it's okay because we had some time to look over the display case to decide on what we wanted. She chose to get the lemon tart and I chose to get a tres leches cake slice. The lemon tart was almost $7 if I remember correctly and the tres leches slice was $5.50. The tres leches cake slice is really big so I feel that the size suits the price. The quality was great in the way that they actually let the cake soak up all the milk! I've gone to so many places and tried so many different tres leches cakes that weren't soaked up properly so I REALLY appreciate that Tartine made it right. For a side note, the tres leches cake has a bit of a coconut taste so maybe if you don't like coconut, you might not like this cake as much as I do but I don't see the harm in trying it out, you know? It was really good. My friend really liked her lemon tart too but I think she was put off by the price a little. Love Tartine. I wish I could get pastries from here all the time.

San Franciscans love to wait in lines for good grub! Let's face it, regardless of the time of day or day of week you come to Tartine, be prepared to wait. BUT, the light at the end of the tunnel is... pretty much everything on their menu! So far, I've tried their Spicy Turkey hot pressed sandwich, Banana Cream Tart, Croissant, Chocolate Walnut cookie drop, and their giant chocolate chip cookie (I think it's about 6" in diameter). Here are my thoughts: Spicy Turkey sandwich - They say it takes about 20 minutes to serve upon ordering, but I remembered mine arriving in about half that time. It's served with a pickled carrot which I really didn't care for (it's a carrot that tastes like a pickle... meh), but the turkey sandwich is beyond fantastic. Spicy turkey topped with cracked pepper, provolone cheese love, spread with delish pesto in between buttery toast. The sandwich comes in 3 halves, so it's easy to share with another person. Banana Cream Tart - Fresh banana slices hidden inside a flaky pastry that's spread lightly with caramel and dark chocolate, and finally, topped with a huge dollop of lightly sweetened cream. The sweetest part of this dessert was definitely the filling inside that's mixed with the sliced bananas. Be careful, the tart is tough to break apart with your fork because the dark chocolate layered inside is hardened so you gotta use your hands sometimes. I loved this dessert; just sweet enough not to spike a diabetic's blood sugar ;) Croissant - Buttery, flaky, definitely not for the calorie-conscious (then again, you probably shouldn't come to Tartine if you are). To be honest, I'm not a great judge of croissants, for I don't eat them that often, but this one was delicious and leans on their Êmore affordable side of the menu. Chocolate Walnut cookie drop - Kind of tasted like a mixture of a cookie and brownie. On their cheaper side of the menu, and worth trying if you are a chocoholic like me. Giant chocolate chip cookie - Expensive, and definitely for sharing. It's a lighter cookie, for it's super thin, and can almost pass off as a wafer. Again, for the Tartine first-timers, be prepared to WAIT. But as many other Yelpers have mentioned, it's completely worth it. Better to take public transportation if you don't live in the Mission, because street parking is nearly impossible to find.

I had a mixed experience with Tartine as the food was good but the service and organization was way off. ÊI ordered the morning bun (delicious), bread pudding (my friend loved it but I am not a fan of bread pudding) and the quiche with ham (average). ÊThe wait was about 15 minutes and the seating is limited. ÊIn fact, I would hate to sit inside because its so crowded and busy in there. ÊThe problem is that there was so much disorganization as it pertains to our order and we had to wait about 20 minutes before we were clued in to the fact that something is wrong and our food is not on the way. ÊThe confusion was blamed on a new employee. ÊAlso, customers are asked to bus their own table which I dont mind but please don't make me go inside and squeeze in between people and chairs with a pile of plates and cups. ÊIf you want me to work, please make it easier for me.

As the Star says Meh. I've experienced better. For being such a famous SF bakery I was very surprised with my experience here. Walked in long line (to be expected) finally get to front someone greets me then disappears. Waited for about 5 minutes before someone came back to help me. Asked for some cake slices but they said that the cakes were to be sold whole and a slice was not available (for any of their cakes). Got a chocolate chip cookie that was not moist and not special in any way shape or form. Then got the bread pudding, per the employees recommendation. It was perhaps the eggiest soggiest bread pudding I have ever had. And it was watery towards the bottom which was gross. Ê Lastly asked for the pound cakes one of each, chocolate was by far the best but even that was something that I was expecting more from. Spent about $17.00 total getting stuff to try and I was really let down by all of it. I would defin. say this is a place that has been over-hyped and might have been good at one point but it was really just Meh in my honest opinion.

Found myself in the city nearby Tartine and figured might as well make my special city trip worthwhile and try it out. ÊThis place is fascinating. I got here around 12:30 PM on a Friday. ÊLucky me, there wasn't much of a line. ÊUnluckily, though, no almond croissants or ham and cheese croissants left. ÊBummer. That said, there was plenty of other stuff for me to choose from. ÊI decided to get a frangipane tart topped with what appears to be a blackberry/boysenberry type topping, a large serving of the bread pudding with a berry topping, and morning buns. Everything was delicious. ÊThe pastry dough in the pastries was super flaky. ÊThe morning buns in particular are great. ÊNice, slightly crispy and flaky exterior topped with some granulated sugar. ÊThe inside is much softer, like a good cinnamon roll. ÊAnd there was a hint of orange to brighten it up. Truth be told, I wasn't paying attention to what anything cost since I was in awe of this place. ÊBut now that I think about it, it was $21 total for everything. ÊNot bad, but as I think back on it, seems a bit pricey. ÊBut I'm not really complaining because everything was fantastic. ÊWould love to come back and try some of the stuff I missed and maybe a sandwich or something.

I arrived late Friday afternoon to see a small line at the door. ÊIt moved fairly quickly, but I had enough time to study the bakery case. Items are displayed beautifully. I selected a banana cream tart and a couple of chocolate chip cookies. The only bread available was a walnut loaf so I ordered that. ÊService was pretty efficient. Cafe itself was crowded with no seats available...I wouldn't eat there since tables are smooshed together and this appears to be the type of place where people meet and hover. ÊI don't have the patience for that. ÊI can't enjoy a pastry with people literally looking over my shoulder. Chocolate chip cookies were thin, crispy, and huge (about 7 in. diameter). ÊI shared the cookie with my sister who did not like the slightly overbaked taste. ÊI actually liked that aspect of the cookie. Banana cream tart had a bright banana flavor. ÊHusband and mom had a taste and both said that they did not prefer the bitter chocolate shavings on the tart. ÊBeing naturally contrary again, I actually enjoyed the pairing of chocolate and banana. Walnut bread was a large country style loaf - freshly baked with a wonderful aroma and crunchy, dense crust. ÊWould be wonderful sliced and buttered or for Êgrilled cheese sandwiches. Highly recommended. All in all, first experience at Tartine was fine. ÊTotal for all was about $20, so any future indulging on my part would have to be carefully considered.

I absolutely love the croquet monsieur sandwiches served with picked carrots. The ham sandwich is super good, but I have to admit they aren't shy with the mustard and it made my eyes water a little.

The food here gets 5 stars. They lost a star (or two) on service. This food and goodies at this French-style bakery surpasses anything I've experienced in Paris. We tried many items including the bread pudding (that day with raspberries and nectarines), the Croque Monsieur (nothing short of amazing), brownies, a couple different tarts, etc. Every item brought superlatives to our lips. There's no denying this is simply amazing, rapturous bakery. It's a given that this place is tiny and popular - you are going to wait in a line, usually a long one, and you aren't likely to find a seat. Also be forewarned that the place is expensive. The service was split. The two red-haired women were accommodating and sweet but outside of those two we were treated as if they were doing us some kind of favor. One was so bitchy that my children commented on it. The woman at the register pretty much snapped at us and when they left an item off our order they were quick to blame us and seek additional payment. Everyone in our party of six independently brought up the poor attitude of the service.

Another visit to Tartine and this time I tried some items I hadn't had before: Tres Leches - I was actually pretty unimpressed with this. ÊTres Leches is supposed to be a rich, extremely moist cake and this was more like a good-tasting French-style cake. ÊI actually do have to give them points for making it their own thing...they took a known item and added a French spin on it. ÊI think if you're a fan of Tres Leches, you may not like this cake, but would appreciate the creativity. Ê Even though it's not a typical Tres Leches cake, it's still good. Devil's Food Cake - Fantastic! ÊA great, perfectly textured dark chocolate cake with caramel and chocolate ganache...this was excellent and had the perfect amount of sweetness. Chocolate Pudding - A fantastic, chocolatey pudding that is rich and creamy. Ê Tartine does a fantastic job with almost all their items...there's almost always a line out the door, but it's worth the wait.

dang this place is expensive! the three items i got were delicious but still not really sure if it's worth the price tag. the morning bun, as everyone says, is the perfect combo of flaky, soft, and crunchy. i thought it tasted even better after a few hours when the cinnamon on top became slightly caramelized and the crunchy parts became even more crunchy the almond lemon tea cake was delicate and tasty but $4.5 for a pound cake sized slice is kinda ridic the lemon tart was super delicious- sometimes when you eat a lemon bar or pastry, it tends to have a weird aftertaste which usually means that its artificial flavoring. but this tart did not have that aftertaste at all- tasted super fresh and legit! and the crust was really good. so glad that there was no line when we went in the middle of a weekday afternoon whoo

I got here around 8am one Thursday morning to buy pastries to deliver to some of my friends who work in the city. Since it was early and a weekday, there wasn't much of line. I got about 15 pastries of a few varieties, but only personally got to try the morning bun and frangipane croissant. The morning bun lived up to expectations. The pastry was flaky on the outer layers, but soft inside. The orange and cinnamon also came together well to make the flavor interesting instead of just plainly sweet. The frangipane croissant was pretty big. More importantly, it was DELICIOUS. I have no idea what goes into the almond paste thing, but it was so addictive. I think I actually liked this better than the morning bun. I would give this place 5 stars if the girl serving me hadn't looked so annoyed when I asked her if I could have a few paper bags for the pastries (I got mine in a huge box cos there were so many, but since I was bringing it to people at various locations I thought having small bags would be helpful). Maybe it was a little troublesome, but there were no more than 3 people behind me in line, so I didn't think it was so bad... ): I still love this place though, and will come again, even if it means waking up super early to avoid the long wait in line!

I *really* want to give this bakery a higher review, but I have to be a honest Yelper... 1) Bread pudding with seasonal fruits - 4 out of 5 stars. I had to wait about 10 minutes but it was well worth it. This was the only dish that I truly liked! It was warm and comforting, and the tangy fruits really complimented the sweetness of the syrupy bread pudding. 2) Morning bug - 2 out of 5 stars. When the server handed it to me, I noticed that it wasn't warm... and since I had a whole bowl of bread pudding, I decided to take both buns to-go. Unfortunately when I finally had a chance to take a bite, it was way too hard, not soft/moist/warm. So I re-toasted it for about 2-3 minutes... didn't help =( The bun left an aftertaste of heavy/bitter butter and orange zest. Would not order this again. 3) Croque Monsieur - 3 out of 5 stars. It just didn't taste special to me. Again, it was served cold. 4) Chocolate eclair - 3 out of 5 stars. Again, nothing special/different from this eclair. 5) Lime passionfruit bavarian - 3 out of 5. The coconut flakes were chewy, and the cake was a little too sour for me. 6) Chocolate cake - 4 of out 5. The cake was moist and very chocolate-y, I would order this again. Overall, it was a great first-time experience. Try to go early (i.e. 9-10am on Saturdays) to avoid the lines and to get a seat at the table. This place gets crazy packed!!

Nothing to add from my previous reviews but this was the first time we went to Tartine right when they opened. We got there at about maybe 7:46 a.m. and there were already about 15 people ahead of us so the line wasn't too bad and seating was readily available. The thing is that they don't have their full offerings ready to go at 8 a.m. For example, my cousins from Australia were visiting so I wanted them to try everything! But they didn't have the small individual banana chocolate cream tart ready (they said it would be ready later in the day). I wanted to save room for Bi-Rite so I ordered for 4 of us: 1) 2 Ham & Cheese Croissants 2) 2 Chocolate croissants 3) 1 Morning Bun (I still think this is okay but not amazing....but if they served it warm then it would be a whole other thing and probably phenomenal). 4) Vegetable quiche (again...I'm never amazingly wowed by their quiche. Just think they're OK). I got lemon cream tarts and an almond frangipane tart to go. Another good experience at Tartine but perhaps my hyping up the place to my out of town guests also made me feel the food was a bit less magical than I had imagined.

okay, the line was long but it moves quickly. very quickly. We were in before we even knew what was happening. I put CP at a table while I went up to order. Two coffees, one morning bun, one croissant. Plus a banana tart to go. If you get a coffee you get a mug and are directed to the corner to fill your cup. Be aware you have to push through people still in line. It can get dangerous. The morning bun was recommended to me by multiple publications and many yelp friends. I liked it but it's not my normal thing. It was very soft with a good sugary crisp on the outside, a little citrusy. It's tasty for sure but it wasn't as good as the warmed butter croissant. There must have been a pound of butter per croissant in this recipe. It was so warm and soft and buttery. Like a little breakfast blanket. I thought about laying it out and taking a nap in it, all wrapped up in its luxury. Don't try to relax in this environment. The bakery is small and packed. Hectic. But the community tables are nice. We gave the tart a go a few hours later and it wasn't nearly as good as it looked. I could have skipped that.

Tartine... I want so much to taste what others are tasting, but I have yet to taste the amazing. I've been here four times in the past three years. My first time I ordered a little cookie to go, can't remember exactly what it was, but it was small... maybe a shortbread. It was good, and I was pleased with what I ordered. The second time I sat down and had a sandwich. It was ok, edible, but I don't remember it. I do remember the pickled carrots that came with it... and they were way too sour... no carrot flavor. Ok, so my first experiences were pretty forgettable. The next two... were rememberable for how terrible the food was. I ordered a slice of pecan pie at around 7:30pm on a Friday night. What I really wanted was a slice of the banana cream pie, but was told the last banana cream pie on display was only for sale whole... Umm, it's 30 minutes before closing, who's gonna come in and buy it? Yeah, I know about rollover, but I wasn't the only one who wanted a slice. The woman behind me also expressed interest in a slice. So I settled for a slice of pecan pie to go. I took one bite while walking down the street. Terrible. Inedible. The filling was waaaaayyyy too sweet. I know pecan pie is supposed to be sweet (that's what everyone tells me), but this was overpowering. I've had good (award winning) pecan pie, and yes, it's sweet, but still enjoyable. I couldn't eat this. I still can't believe that a place of this caliber would sell something inedible. I tried to salvage it by saving the rest till I got home, where I scraped out all of the awful filling, and warmed the crust. The crust was good, very flaky, but the filling was inexcusable. After sharing my pecan pie experience, a tartine follower convinced me to go back to try the bread pudding, which apparently was amazing and made with day old brioche and fresh berries... etc. Well, I did, and it was worse than the pie! The bread pudding had an horrible eggy taste, like that hardboiled egg smell... it made me wonder how long it had been sitting out. It didn't help that it was cold, with cold chunks of sweetened eggy custard (that had the consistency of siken tofu) and soggy bread. Everything seemed to be sitting in a puddle of it's own juices, yuck. I couldn't imagine how anyone could recommend this. I could only think (and hope) that they had underbaked it, and that this was some sort of fluke. I couldn't et it, and gave it to a homeless man I walked passed. A few moments later I turned around and it didn't look like he was enjoying it either. The only thing that saved my fourth visit was that I was with a friend who ordered a loaf of bread from them. I believe it was whole wheat spelt. The bread was good, good crust, nice flavor, and texture. I'd order bread from them, but I'm in no hurry to return. I'm also still interested in trying their banana cream pie and heard their croissants need to be tried too, but I am in no rush.

Things I've tried at Tartine were their banana cream pie and berry torte. The first was divine! Fresh, fresh bananas, creamy vanilla custard, crunchy yet soft crust, just the right amount of whipped cream, finished off with chocolate shavings. SO GOOD! The berry torte was delicious as well. This did not disappoint. Sweet, but sour berries, mixed in the cake batter, topped with a streusel and finished off with a dusting of powdered sugar. Mmmm! This was a rather large/heavy torte. It gets pretty filling!

As you can probably judge by Tartine's large number of Yelp reviews, it's a popular place (and that's an understatement). Be prepared for the line to go out the door (and the seating inside to be crowded), but luckily, the line moves fairly quickly. Things I've tried on several occasions: - bread pudding: dense, thick, and creamy; they add a fair amount of berries, which is a nice touch - morning buns: for all the good things I had heard about the morning buns, they were slightly disappointing. They were described by a friend as a cinnamon bun except without the sticky cinnamon - indeed, mine came out rather dry and wasn't as delectable as hoped. - walnut drop cookies: excellent! think of them as chocolate bliss compacted in a small bite. - brownies: also wonderfully chocolate-y The bakery is also a little pricey, but it's definitely worth trying if you're passing by Dolores Park/Mission area!

The most perfect bakery on the planet. I daydream about opening my own bakery, and Tartine is what it'd look like if I did. (But with more cat pictures, let's be honest.) Everything is in the open, and from my place in line, I could see croissants at rest on a workbench. I read in their cookbook that they bake in real-time, which is just amazing. The morning bun and quiche I had were simply perfect. The long line is worth the wait, and it was surprisingly easy to snag a couple of seats.

We tried the Morning Bun and the Double Pain Au Chocolat, which seem to be two of the most popular things to get based on the 7x7 guide and the thousands of Yelp reviews. They were definitely delicious, but I don't think they're worth all the hype they are getting. Luckily my wife is super thick skinned, and she went inside while I got on the back of the insanely long line, and sold them some story about how we forgot to order something, so they just hooked her right up with our two pastries and we didn't have to wait at all. Awesome. I probably would subtract a star from this review if I had to wait forever for these pastries, but all in all, they were very good.

This place is amazing. It has some of the best baked goods you can find in SF, which is why it's so hard to give it a three star rating. The fact is that the line for this place is ridiculous. I would imagine it could take someone more than a half hour to endure waiting in this line, however I have only tried waiting once when it was crowded. After waiting for more than fifteen minutes and not even making it past the front door--I left. If you want to enjoy this place, I would probably say to get here in the early morning, although I can't say it's any less crowded from experience. I love you Tartine, but I refuse to wait.

It definitely lived up to the hype, if that's what you wanted to know. My friend and I waited about 30 minutes so by the time I got to the front of the line I was FAMISHED and ordered a ham & cheese croissant, a normal croissant, AND a morning bun. The morning bun was on the sweet side and it was mehs to be honest. I could've lived without it. What I loved most was the ham & cheese croissant.. ahhhh my mouth is watering at the thought.. It was perfectly flakey and soft with fragrant cheesy aroma in every bite.. mm.. this is a must-try. I wish I could've tried other items on the menu but unfortunately, this is a rather expensive bakery and it just wasn't worth dropping more money for bread. I definitely wouldn't wait in line every day for tartine, even for that delectable ham & cheese croissant.

Crystal J. put it perfectly when she noted the line, the reviews, and the obvious pie heaven that Tartine serves up daily. Do not be discouraged by the number of people, just be patient and get excited like a little kid at Disney World waiting to ride Splash Mountain. I saw sandwiches the size of my head from the back of the line and had I been more hungry, I'm sure I would have had one for three meals and still wanted more. Sadly, my trip to Tartine only yielded a quiche for an afternoon snack with a friend. As I dreamt (still dream) about the pesto coated bread and ginormous desserts, I thought about returning before I left the city but our paths sadly never passed. When I return to SF, however, this will be my first stop. Please, someone, go each a sandwich in my honor.

One of the shortcomings of turning into an adult in America is that you are slowly weaned off of sleep. ÊFirst the periodic day-time naps go. ÊThen we start going to school full day, and afternoon naps are out of the question. ÊBefore you know it, you're a full-blown adult and can barely even get 5 hours at night. ÊTime ceases to hang around in extra quantities, schedules fill up, and sleep takes a blow to the stomach. Speaking of stomachs... The days when there are moments available for even just 15 minutes of nap time are precious. So if you foresee one in your future, my advice is to make it count. Head to Tartine for breakfast, and find yourself in a pastry dreamland. ÊThe buttery croissant with its flaky golden shell is ambrosial, and the morning bun has been touched with citrus and cinnamon sugar to die for. ÊThe lemon bar, arguably my favorite dessert, makes a better morning-time snack than you'd readily believe, and the almond croissant is the perfect little sister to the traditional plain. If savory is your game, by all means order a gougere. The ball of gruyere and pepper is pure heaven. Stand at the little side bar and sip your coffee and love your pastries. Love all of them. Enjoy it. Because when you're done, you're really done. You haven't the choice but to make your way to the nearest bed, and whether fantasy-induced or whether by pure calorie overload, seize those 15 minutes, squeeze your pillow tight, (slip into your elastic-waisted pants, of course), and dream pure love for Tartine Bakery.

I tried 4 things and the best by far is the bread pudding. I got a cup but should have for the bowl. I am spelling this completely wrong but The franjappan was my second favorite. You don't see almond and blueberry together often and the flavor is moist deliciousness. Êwe had 1 Red Roobious tea which was normal but served nicely. I went on a Tuesdat 2pm.

Yeah see that line out the door and 3,500+ Yelp reviews? There's a reason for that. I was initially disgruntled by the line, but came back later in the day and found out what time it was in the Mission: it was banana cream pie time. Ê That pie was the BEST THING I EVER ATE. If I could fuck this pie and then marry it and then divorce it when it cheated on me with all you SF foodie sluts and then sue it for child support money just to keep it in my life, I would do that. So waiting in line for twenty minutes really doesn't seem so bad after all. Morning bun, coconut cream pie and ham and cheese croissant are all deserving of high marks. A +++

Okay, so let me just start by saying that I used to always come here. In fact quite regularly. But I haven't been here in about three years because the line is just too damn long. There were always lines, but never like it is now . I blame this on Yelp. In fact, I think Yelp has really ruined a lot of good things for me. With that said, their chocolate chip cookie is divine. Thin, crispy, and chewy. For $2 (probably more now), it's not cheap, but it's well worth it. Their other sweets are usually pretty good, some are just meh. I recently had a couple of their cakes at a friends house, and the chocolate one was ridiculously heavy. I mean, like one bite of it and I needed coffee or tea. I finished around half a small slice before I had to stop. It was good, just too rich and heavy. The savory stuff is pretty decent. Their croques and sandwiches, I don't think I've ever disliked one. Sadly, my relationship with Tartine is over. Life is too short to be spending much of it in lines. Thanks a lot, yelp...

Arrived for my first visit around 8:45am on a Tuesday morning. We found a table easily although by the time we left at 10:15am there was a line practically out the door. Although not a full-on breakfast place we definitely left stuffed. We shared a small bread pudding and a large muesli. Definitely should have ordered the small as the muesli was huge and mixed with filling full-fat yogurt. Once we added on two bags of cookies, a latte and an apple juice we were at a $40 breakfast.

A good friend was kind enough to surprise me with a delicious Morning Bun one gloomy SF morning, and boy, did I enjoy it! I wish I was able to warm it up a bit before eating it, but it was good nonetheless. I don't know how much it cost, so this review is solely based on taste and texture. It's got a decent amount of sugar sprinkled onto it - maybe that's what makes it so good - but the bread itself is quite artfully crafted. Overall the bread is just delicious and fun to peel off and eat.

I took gingin, my pug to Dolores Park to see Hunky Jesus. Afterwards, since we were in the neighborhood, we dropped by Tartine's for some sweets. There's a big ole sign in the window that says: NO DOGS, so I left little gin tied outside. As I entered the belly of the bakery, I could hear and see people cooing and taking pictures of her. She is a smashed face beauty if I do say so myself. Upon exiting with a bagful of goodies, I found gingin still sitting outside, but for some reason, she was sitting there with a two year old. The little girl LOVED gin, and was busy petting and kissing her. Apparently, the parents of this little girl had so much faith in gingin, a strange pug they had never met, they decided to make her the babysitter as they picked out pastries. Yep, Tartine is so good, you'll leave your two year old child out on the sidewalk under the watchful eye of a pug you've never met. BTW, mon petite carlin is awesome with kids, in fact, if the employees at Tartine were as awesome as she is, I might have given the bakery five stars. Sadly, they are not. Also, for being such a fabulous French bakery, their coffee bar sucks. Everything else is amazing.

I can see how the morning bun continuously makes it on the 7x7 Big Eats list. It is literally drool-worthy. Even the mere sight of it makes my mouth water...yum! (http://www.yelp.com/userÉ) My friend Matt-e C. was sweet enough to wait in line at Tartine one Saturday and bring me some treats, including the morning bun. I was super excited to try it since I could never bring myself to wake up early enough to stand in line for it. =P I couldn't wait to get my hands on it and the first bite was like heaven. Buttery, sweet, doughy, sticky goodness. I ate that baby up in a quick minute! We also sampled the pain au jambon and gougere (http://www.yelp.com/userÉ). I loved the pain au jambon with the salty ham/cheese combo plus flaky pastry around it. The gougere was the most bland out of all 3 and I wasn't really feeling the herby taste but it probably would have been better warmed up. I can't wait to return for more baked goodies next time!

I died and went to heaven the day I went to Tartine for breakfast. Went with some coworkers one Friday morning at around 9:30am. Of course there's a line out the door and we have to wait for 25 minutes. This is SF, where people apparently don't work on Fridays. At least the line gave us some time to figure out what to order. Morning bun, clearly. Chocolate croissant, clearly. We also decided on the ham/cheese croissant, veggie croque monsieur (based on what the table we passed by in line had ordered, thanks guys!), and a banana cream pie. Yeah, that was breakfast for four. We weren't indulging or anything... Morning bun ($3.25): ON. POINT. That's pretty much all there is to say. Citrus glaze with sugar sprinkled on top. Perfect combination of crunchy and soft, it melts in your mouth. Chocolate croissant (~$4): Also delish. Surprisingly, it wasn't my favorite (and chocolate croissants usually are). Ham/Cheese croissant (~$4): I liked this second to the croque monsieur, although the two aren't that comparable considering the CM is like a meal in itself...the croissant rocked. The ham and cheese combination balanced nicely, and I didn't feel like I was eating something super-heavy. Vegetable croque monsieur (~$8): This item made me extremely happy. The bread is delicious. The vegetables are delicious (mushrooms, asparagus, and others I can't remember). The cheese is perfect. Everything comes together to create this wonderful open-faced sandwich. The coffee is Four Barrel which is an added bonus! We managed to snag a table outside but your best bet is to get it to-go and eat at Dolores or take it home (if you can last that long). Be prepared for a long wait. But know that it's WORTH IT. This place is famous for a reason :)

Can't deny the food is yummy... best you can get. But the service and attitude of the staff still bites the big one. If you say you're open at a certain time, you should open at that time, especially if you know people arrived early just to avoid the lines. By the way, the long line that develops as soon as the door eventually opens is due to bad service, not because there's a lot of people.

I've heard really good things about Tartine; in particular, the breakfast pastries. So, I stopped by Tartine on my way to the Bart Station one Saturday. It was around noon and there was a line---There is almost always a line when I pass by this place. I was behind maybe 10 -15 people and waited for about 30-40 minutes. However, when I reached the counter and looked at the food, my impatience was taken over by excitement. I bought a morning bun and a scone to go. I didn't plan on finding any seating but I can tell you that finding seats is difficult. There are many small tables but the turnover rate is slower than other places. The morning bun was perfect. It was just lightly sweetened with this citrus glaze. The scone was just as good, nice and doughy, but still light. I need to go pack for the croissants.

Rushed over here on a Sunday morning with two of my girlfriends for some deliciousness before a Golden Gate Park music concert. There were about 15 people ahead of us so we just waited patiently and gazed at everyone else's pastries for about half an hour. I went a bit overboard and ordered the chocolate croissant, 2 almond croissants, banana creme pie, bread pudding and a latte. My girlfriends both ordered the Croque Monsieur and latte + OJ. Honestly, I only liked the croissants. OK, I LOVED the croissants. The chocolate croissant had a chewy and flaky consistency with a good smear of rich chocolate down the center. It was the best croissant I've ever had. The banana creme pie and bread pudding weren't any where close to spectacular though. Marie Calendar's banana pie and Universal Cafe/Town Hall's bread puddings are much tastier. At least now I know better and will only order the croissants. Seating was a nightmare. You basically have to stand over others like a hawk and swoop in as soon as they move an inch towards the exit. That's SF for ya, 4 stars for amazing croissants!

Had some time to kill before some dinner reservations in the city, so hubby and I decided to stop by and try Tartine. It was 4:30 p.m. on a Saturday, and I wasn't prepared for such a long line out the door! I thought, 'wow, this must be good!' I waited about 30 minutes. I wanted to get a couple of pain au chocolats, but they were sold out. Also wanted to get the banana cream tart for my husband, because he loves banana pies, but they were sold out. Settled for a small coconut cream tartlet, 2 Friands, and a croissant. The croissant was huge, and would have been really good (it was buttery, flaky, and crispy) but some inattentive baker allowed it to burn and there were 2 scorched spots on the bottom that made it bitter and ruined it. The Friands, which are labeled as "chocolate bites covered in ganache" were like a little mini flourless chocolate cake and were dry. Hubby said that coconut cream tartlet was "okay", so wasn't impressed overall. I still like La Farine way better and don't think this place is worth the wait. The croissant would have been good if it wasn't burned, so giving the extra star because I think that was a fluke.

okay hungry reader, here's the game plan. come to tartine on a sunny morning and eat to your heart's content. during your meal, take a few moments to appreciate how amazing the bread Êthat makes up your sandwich is. once you're done eating, wobble down the street to ride out your food coma in dolores park. get up after a few hours and grab some bi-rite ice cream or visit the bi-rite market for cold drinks and any snacks if, by some miracle, you're hungry again. MUST HAVES: - banana cream pie - pecorino and crushed almond sandwich HONORABLE MENTIONS: - morning bun (especially if you like that hint of orange flavor in your pastries) - fruit tart - chocolate hazelnut tart - it even has whole toasted hazelnuts on top! don't be too daunted by the line...it moves reasonably quickly. another plus is that the bathroom's surprisingly really clean/nice smelling!

You know those commercials where the sexy, skinny supermodels slowly eat an ice cream bar or a juicy hamburger? That's what I feel like whenever I eat the banana cream tart. Except, there's no "sexy" way to eat this thing. One bite in and already the tip of your nose has a dollop of whipped cream, your shirt has flakes of pastry crumbs, and you're trying hard to keep the tart from breaking in two. But once you're back in business, OH THE ORGASMIC DELICIOUSNESS of it all begins to set in. Also worthy of a near-orgasmic adventure: the double pain au chocolat (chocolate croissant). It's on par (if not rivals) some of the best stuff I've had in France. Yes, seriously. It's almost unfair just how GOOD these things are, and most definitely worthy of the obscene amount of people that wait in line for 'em and other amazing treats.

Purchased a slice of Lemon Bar and a Tres Leches. As I attempt to stay away from dairy, I tried a sliver of cake with my fork and it seemed good but tasted dry. Tres Leches is supposed to be soggy and fall-apart gooey, almost. Or maybe that's just what I'm used to from the Mexican Bakeries I've enjoyed it from in West Chicago. The Lemon Bar was pretty good but I only managed to eat half of it. I LOVE lemon but this was almost a little too overpowering. I might come back for a snack if I'm in the area ever again but to purchase a full cake, I would probably go to a Mex bakery.

This is the stuff that dreams are made of. Well, my carb dreams, anyway. It's always a stop (and sometimes multiples are in order) when I'm in town. As you're rushed through the inevitable line, don't wonder what that bowl of fruit is -- I shall tell you. It's their bread pudding. And it is not to be missed. Heavy on the egg and milk, it's perfectly porridgey. Add in some strawberries and it's amazing for breakfast on a foggy day. The gougere is a lovely, cheesey, chivey, popover, with a strong egg vibe. Eat it warm. The frangipani croissant is an almond croissant -- which I love like no other thing -- with frangipani jam in it. It just made it sweeter, which to me was unnecessary, but loving all the rest, I can't fault them. The coffee is good, and free refills on drop are offered. I'm rating this in generous SF-style, as the terrible atmosphere and service almost every time I am here makes it super unpleasant. It's the type of food you want to sit and enjoy, cafe style for a few minutes. But even if you snag a seat, the line snakes around the store and the glares of death from other patrons make for an un-relaxing experience. And the overworked employees rarely crack a smile or have the patience to answer questions. Take it to go and enjoy.

I'm not sure why I haven't written a review on here before but I have been here multiple times by now. This place is my standard in which I try to gauge everything I bake to compare to them (I am aware it is a high standard). I have tried many things at this place and here are a few of my favorite items: - Lemon Tart (full of lemon flavor but not too sweet so it has a nice tarty flavor to it) - Morning Buns (it's like a cinnamon roll but with croissant dough and an orange glaze. nice and flaky with generous amounts of cinnamon sugar on it) - Banana Creme Pie (Has nice chunks of banana in it with a great chocolaty crust to add to everything) - Country Loaf of Bread (Come at 4:30 pm when the bread is fresh and you will not Êbe disappointed. Keep in mind it's still bread so don't expect anything but good tasting bread) They are on the pricier side of their desserts but if you build such a rep like they have, it's understandable why they charge their prices. The constant line out of the door speaks for itself.

OMG. the croissants are so big, and flakey and buttery and fluffy, with just the right amount of chew and crisp to them. yes, there is a line out the door, but it usually moves quickly. however, getting a table may be another issue. hopefully, other patrons will be courteous enough to finish their goods in a timely manner so that others can also indulge in their gluttony while sitting down. i got the ham and cheese croissant. my bf for the chocolate croissant. i hear there are many many other great things to eat, like tarts. dont bother with the brioche bread pudding. you'll be so disinterested in that pudding after your first bite of the croissants. you have to go. and buy extra for the rest of the day. and then, walk around the corner to wash down all that sugary buttery deliciousness with a scoop of bi-rite ice cream.

Since the day my colleague recommended this place, I could not wait to give it a swirl. We finally had the chance to drop by on a Saturday afternoon. Needless to say, parking is a pain in the neck; we spent 20min just trying to find a parking space on the street. We were taken aback to see a long line just outside the bakery and it took us 30 minutes of wait time to enter this place. The bakery goods looked so enticing and the aroma was so tintillating that I almost passed out in glory. We finally decided to order a ÊBanana Cream Pie and it was magically delicious! I enjoyed every bit of the cripsy crust, bananas and the cream. Apart from being a bit on the pricey end, I LOVE this place and would definitely like to return to try more of their bakery goods.

My review stands nearly 100% on the bread alone. The pastries are fantastic...but the bread...it's the stuff legends written about. Chad's commitment to breadmaking as an art form is evident...I have not been able to find the combination of a perfectly thick crust, perfect acidity and purity of flour anywhere but Tartine. Whomever mills their flour deserves an award. I bought a couple of loaves. Took them home. 3 days passed. I cut into a loaf that had not been opened...the integrity of the crust kept the moisture inside, and the bread, while not as perfect as when it came out of the oven, was delicious. Try doing that with any other "artisan" bread from another place, and in 3 days, you will have a brick, even unfit for toast. I would like to thank Chad for showing the world what bread our ancestors ate, and what it is supposed to be. There so much garbage posing as great bread in the world, Tartine's loaves are just superior in every way.

For the 2 1/2 years I lived in San Francisco, Tartine was on my list. So when I found out I was moving I made Tartine a priority for my last week in the city. The bf and I headed to Tartine early Monday morning thinking there wouldn't be too long of a long but we were wrong! I think we waited in line for about 15-20 minutes which I guess isn't too bad but longer than I would have liked. Well as for the food we got a slice of quiche, the morning bun, banana pudding and a slice of lemon meringue pie! Nothing like sugar overload in the morning! All delicious- my favorite was the bread pudding!

Overall, they know what they are doing. ÊThe pastries are all very good. ÊButter croissant is the best I've ever tasted and it is one item that makes me Êgo back to Tartine. ÊChocolate eclair is so tasty. ÊCakes, on the other hand, are a bit too sweet and heavy. ÊAs to the line, it is just too long.

I made a point to come here during my short visit to SF. The bakery items that I ate were very good but I expected better. I've heard so many rave reviews and I think it's unfortunately overrated. The service is painfully slow and the employees don't seem to care or move any faster. The prices are very high for most items, which I wouldn't mind spending if it was warranted. I understand they specialize in bread and it might be worth trying (I didn't) but you can get other items as good or better elsewhere.

Normally i wouldn't spend $20 on pastries, but when you're on vacation throwing $20 bills everywhere seems normal. There was line out the door when we arrived but it moved quickly enough. Unfortunately they were out of plain croissants but we still walked away with an almond one, a morning bun, quiche, a couple coconut macarons, and two coffees. We scarfed it all down and enjoyed every second of it.

The food is good, but not great that I miss them, but I decided to revisit the bakery to try something new. So I went there for Wednesday lunch and the line was much shorter than usual. What a disappointment. I mean I could not get to the food. I was told it would take 20 minutes to make a sandwich. Come on! 20 minutes for a sandwich? Besides, their sandwich is not that complicated! When I asked for a croque-monsieur, the counter lady said they only have cheese for croque-monsieurs. Without ham, it is not a croque-monsieur. Then I asked for a tomato quiche which she recommended, she started, "Actually, you know...we don't have it right now..." I gave up and left. What really bothered me was the attitude of the staff. The counter lady, who sort of looked like Michelle Williams Êwith much more power, was an example, but none of the staff looked very friendly or helpful, at least when I was there. I ended up with Bi-Rite Market where I got a really good sandwich in a flash with friendly smiles :) Thank you, Bi-Rite!!

My friends recommended we stop here for dessert after lunch at nearby Luna Park. It was a good decision! We took a banana cream tart ($7) to-go and later ate it with Peet's Coffee. DELICIOUS! Great to share between two people. We thought the banana cream was just going to be, well, cream, but there were also good sized chunks of real banana mixed into the banana cream. Also, the tart pastry was lined with a layer of dark chocolate, which sent me to a dreamy food heaven. Wow, loved the chocolate! Recommended! I know I'll be back. Perhaps I'll try a famous morning bun for breakfast next time.

4 stars for the pastries 3 stars for the food. balance 3.5 stars. Heard about this place and finally got to try it. MORNING BUN ($3.85): - has a marmelade lining within the bun - one of the most raved about items at Tartine Bakery - a bit sweet but didn't quite make my heart stop beating FRANGIPANE CROISSANT ($4.50) - similar to an almond croissant - my friend really enjoyed it and couldn't stop raving about it - croissant was very flaky and with the touch of roasted almonds it's a good combination CHOCOLATE CROISSANT ($4.50) - very good toasted - chocolate melting into the flaky croissant - delicious with an awesome cup of coffee BANANA CREAM TART ($7) - was very excited to try it - the filling was decent but I wished the shell wasn't so hard - I prefer a more flaky crust with a banana pie - probably would NOT order again considering the cost and my indifference to this creation SPICY TURKEY SANDWICH ($13) - Peppered turkey breast, provolone, broccoli rabe pesto - served on thick slices of bread - the sandwich was extremely oily (probably from the pesto) - though it sounds like a great combination, I definitely would rather walk a bit further and get a sandwich from Ike's They also serve picnic boxes if you're playing to head to Dolores Park afterwards. SERVICE: workers were friendly and helpful. The line actually goes relatively quickly since most people are regulars here. There is a separate line for coffee but that is CASH ONLY. I believe you can order coffee at the pastry and food line with a card if you need to. The sandwiches take about 15 minutes so make sure to allot time for that if you're in a rush like we were. I'm not sure how seating goes, but it seemed like you have to find your own seat...so you gotta watch for vacant tables like a hawk. Outdoor and indoor seating available. ENVIRONMENT: tight spacing. hipster-like at last by the way the workers were dressed (no distinct employee uniform) then again I'm not surprised since we're in the Mission District. Very casual ambiance and seems to be the place to go especially if you're going to or coming from Dolores Park. The high-ceilings also make it more classy. Though really it gets super hot in there since it's small and no A/C. Overall, more of a place to grab pastries than anything else. Even then the pastries are a tad bit overpriced. Since I'm not from SF, I wouldn't consider it good enough to be on my SF must-go places but I would recommend it to anyone who hasn't tried it before. Otherwise Tartine Bakery to me is just a "every now and then" type of place and I probably wouldn't crave it.

We got here on a Sunday morning, about 5 mins before Tartine opened and there was a line wrapped along the sidewalk. ÊWe weren't overly concerned since we were just trying to pick up some pastries to go. ÊThe line went fairly quickly and we spent the time oogling the pastries and trying to decide what to get. We decided on the Banana Cream Tart, the Lemon Tart, a morning bun and the croque monsieur with ham and asparagus. ÊI also got a hot chocolate for myself. Ê The banana cream tart was wonderfully light and not overly sweet. ÊThe lemon tart was tangy and tasty but denser than the banana tart. ÊThe morning bun was pretty good but was cold. ÊWhen we got back to our room, I popped it in the microwave for a few seconds and it was AMAZING. Ê The croque monsieur was yummy as well.

I've made two stops to Tartine's. The first time, we came on a Saturday around 5pm, since that's when we heard they have fresh bread. However, there was a huge line out the door, so I would advise not coming at this time. Especially since by the time we got to the front, they had sold out of most of their bread, and had few pastries left. I ended up buying a frangipane tart and a half loaf of sesame bread. The frangipane tart was great! It's made of berries with a flaky crust and almonds on top. The bread has a really hard crust, and as I dont typically like the crust, I wasn't that fond of the bread. The second time I came by was around 1pm, and I bought a morning bun. It has a slight lemon taste to it, and they cover it with a course sugar. It's messy to eat, but pretty good. Of everything I tried, I was most impressed with the frangipane tart. I'd still come back to try an eclair, and their olive bread. But the only thing I would get again would be the tart.

My sister came into town and I thought she would really enjoy Tartine. ÊNow given my negative Nelly review before, you would think I would not come back for more... but the name says a lot and has won the hearts of many a foodie, so I figured it was time to bring the family.

Ê A coffee, morning bun, croissant with ham and gruyere, along with the slice of tres leches did put us around the $18 dollar mark... but this time I felt it was worth the experience. Go early.

In most American cities, to create a line as long as the one at Tartine, you should post a sign saying "Free Money". In San Francisco that sign should read "artisnal food priced in the upper quadrant of its market segment". This place just isn't better *enough* than other very good places nearby - like Dolores Park Cafe, a short walk away - to justify this sort of wait time and crowded atmosphere, unless you are religiously adherent to the Temple of The Tartine Baking Method. My latest visit there featured the standard-issue 30 minute wait, a very good croissant and good coffee, stressed-out and abrupt service, and ridiculous crowding by American standards. It did not feel welcoming or worth the wait. To reference another review, it really did feel like I had gone on a ride at Disneyland - The Tartine Ride - and I left feeling like I woudn't need to do it again for a long time.

I was lucky enough to experience this bakery when I visited and I not only dropped some major cash, but also my jaw. This. place. is sinful. Ê It was a Tuesday morning, but the place was jam packed. There was not a table (or ledge) unclaimed and there was a line to the door. Did I mind? Not after seeing what was in the display. Their treat assortment was taunting me the whole time, and I couldn't decide...I had a really, really hard time. The line moved pretty quickly for its length and the staff were working their butts off, but still had smiles on their faces. There were little menus on the side as we edged to the cashier so I did a quick glance, placing my bet. So I ordered a black coffee and an almond croissant. Can I just say their bread is the most delectable thing I've ever, ever tasted? It melted away in my mouth. I pulled one spiraled piece and unearthed a treasure trove of almond slices. It was covered, filled, bathing in almond and it was the most perfect thing in the world. Their baked goods are easily the greatest I've tasted. Once I polished that off (far too quickly to my extremely disappointed realization) I had to get back in line. I had to get something else. So I got a Lemon Cream Tart for "later"--my excuse so I wasn't guilty. Ê I was proud I waited until that night to dig in and it was so unapologetically delicious. The lemon cream was soft, tart, sweet, and the crust was flaky, perfect even after sitting in the fridge while the unsweetened cream on top brought this little tart all the way to "I'm moving to San Fran just for this shop".

*sigh* The thought of Tartine Bakery just brings a pleasantly warm feeling over me... Similar to that which the San Francisco sun brings me mid-day, perhaps while i'm out in Dolores Park, Tartine Bakery treats in hand... This amazing corner bakery is humble. Authentic. Connected to it's roots. Real. Homey. Comforting. Bare bone. When walking into Tartine Bakery, the baked goods are front and center. Yea, there is a coffee bar in the right/back corner, but once your section of the line creeps in through the doorway --- it's all about the goods... I've had the Morning Bun and the croissant (no chocolate ones were available for devouring on the day of my visit :() ... and unfortunately nothing else yet... The Morning Bun... Zesty... Sugar covered (in a churro-esque kinda way.) Soft. Moist. Still warm when I had it. Was magical... These are the kinda treats that stay with you... That make you long for that corner, no matter where this journey we call life may take you... The Croissant... Warm to the touch... Shatteringly flaky... The individual layers could be seen when cut in half... It was like an architectural work of art... A baked good put together by the hands of an amazing craftsman... But, approachable.... You see this croissant, and what you don't feel, is that sense of delicate-ness (and I mean this in the most positive of senses...) It begs to be enjoyed... Again and again... My cousin and I got lattes for there, and they were served in splendid mugs... We sat by the coffee bar as it was actually a bit full, even on a Friday morning... I grabbed the mug with two hands, and the warmth of the latte pulled me in for a sip... It was as if I was hugging the mug, and the latte just hugged me right back... A landmark of the San Francisco food scene at it's absolute finest...

There is always an outrageously long line wrapping around the side of the bldg on weekends, but for good reason. ÊThis place's wares are totally worth the wait. I had an open-faced breakfast sandwich with ham and gruyere with asparagus. ÊIt was served with pickled carrots. ÊEvery bite was delicious and savory. For a dessert, my friend and I shared a double pain au chocolat. ÊIt was perfect for sharing: the chamber containing the filling was split between two halves equally.

I love Tartine. I can proudly say this is the BEST bakery in San Francisco. Everything here is good and worth all the calories. I feel good every time I devour their buttery and flaky croissants. My other favorites include frangipane, chocolate cake, morning buns, bread pudding, croque monsieur, banana cream pie, etc. And the list goes on and on. The only downside is the line. I typically hate to wait for my food, so if the line is over 15-20 mins, I would rather come back later. The line gets very long on the weekends, so make sure you get here early to beat the crowd.

GOOD. GRIEF. I will never be able to eat a ham and cheese croissant without comparing it to the perfection of the Tartine version. It was perfect. Nice and buttery, perfectly salty from the ham and the cheese, warm and a little gooey. Even writing about it is making me sad because I want to eat one right now. Sigh. Also the best antidote to a hangover I've ever had. I felt immediately better upon scarfing that flaky, delicious, pastry down. Everything else was amazing as well--the chocolate croissant, the morning bun (oh emz--lightly sweet with a touch of orange), the ganache tarts. I can't talk about it anymore. I'm getting too sad that I don't have them in front of me. I'd walked by before during a previous trip to SF but kept going due to the intimidating line. This last time I did not let that deter me. I was dead set on getting a box of pastries to take in the car for our ride down the Pacific Coast Highway to LA. Best decision I've made in some time. We went on a Friday morning and the line was still out the door but the line moved relatively quickly and the staff was incredibly helpful (even as I hemmed and hawed over what to get). The space is relatively small so eating in seems like it might be tough but for takeout it was perfect. I drooled over all the cases as I got closer and walked out with two boxes of stuff (a big box of pastries and a small box of sweet treats). Totally worth the wait and the (somewhat high) price for those delicious morsels. I'm already looking into getting my friend out in SF to overnight me some croissants. I'm jonesing, y'all!

Almost 3,500 reviews already written for Tartine Bakery, so I will keep this short and simple. I really love Tartine Bakery. I wish their coffee bar would accept credit cards because I never have cash. Be sure to bring your own packets of hot sauce if you're ordering hot food items. Their spinach quiche is just too bland without some kick from Tapatio. Don't get discouraged about the long lines; it moves quick and they get you in and out fast! Be ready to order. You will get dirty looks from the people behind the counter if you're not. I prefer to enjoy my pastries there with a hot Chai Latte. MY FAVES: Double pain au chocolat (THE BEST! Flaky croissant. Love the spicy chocolate!) Morning Bun (Sticky icky and I like it) Gougre (best when fresh and HOT) Spinach Quiche (Love the flaky crust) Chai Latte CASH ONLY FOR COFFEE BAR.

I followed yelp recommendations and had the banana cream tart. Everything about this dessert was great, until I hit the crust. The crust was lined with a layer of dark chocolate that simply masked the flavor of the banana cream pie. Don't get me wrong, I love chocolate but the chocolate overpowered the remaining flavors in the dessert =[

Food: Excellent. ÊIf I was just writing a review on the food, I would give this place 5 stars. ÊMy husband and I are obsessed with their croissants. ÊThe are little drops of heavenly buttery, flaky goodness. ÊI can't have a croissant without comparing it to Tartine. ÊThe morning buns are pretty good as well. ÊThey have a slight hint of orange and cinnamon which blends so well. ÊDon't even get me started on the shortbread cookies...yum! Service: The people working there are just not friendly. ÊOur product is good, so deal with us, is the attitude given almost everything I walk into the store. ÊAll of my orders have been to -go. ÊI'm not even in the store more then 10 minutes.

I came here one afternoon hoping to get my hands on their banana cream tart and boy was I in for a treat. I mean it did require a bit of a time trying to find parking.

The breakfast bun is honestly amazing here. ÊI'm a big fan of hearty heavy desserts and sweets, so I'm more of a cinnamon bun person but once I heard that Tartine was know for their morning bun I had to get it. Ê Crispy on the outside, soft and flaky on the inside. ÊSugary but still a little tangy from the orange zest on top. ÊA perfect breakfast for someone with a sweet tooth, but also for someone that isn't obsessed with sweets because it's so light. Ê My boyfriend got the croissant with the ham and he picked out the ham and said it taste better without it. Ê Also, the line here is a bit ridiculous. ÊWe had to wait in line for about 30 minutes on a Tuesday just to order our breakfast. But that didn't really make a difference to me, crowds= good food. ÊI would happily wait in that line again to get myself another morning bun.

Everything about this place is delicious. I cannot get enough of the gougre breakfast pastry (cheesy, savory goodness). In fact, I kind of see it as a more of a 'breakfast, lunch, dinner, and in between meal pastry.' I recently tried the Brioche Bread Pudding with raspberries (classic and caramel-y), the Lemon Tart (tangy yet creamy), a toasted croissant (buttery, fresh, & crispy/flakey, but super moist and rich on the inside), and the Bavarian Fruit and cream cake. Great espresso too. My only suggestion: why must you scoop the Bavarian fruit-cream cake as if it is ice cream? In terms of presentation, there has to be a more graceful way to slice/serve this flavorful mouthful even though it all looks the same inside my belly. Don't let the line discourage you. The place is small and packed most of the time. It may feel as if you are expected to order without having perused the entirety of the display case, but just indicate that you have yet to make a delicious selection. You really can't go wrong. Everything that I have ever ordered here has been incredibly flavorful.

I didn't get why people raved about the morning bun (it doesn't look that appetizing) but I figured I should at least try it once so I got it and it ended up being much tastier than expected. ÊI'm interested in trying their croissants next time. ÊThose looked delectable. My friend and I were severely disappointed they didn't have the banana cream pie/cake thing (apparently they don't make it on Mondays). ÊInstead we got the lemon tart which I thought was GREAT but my friend thought it was too lemon-y. Ê Must come back here (on any other day but a Monday).

While going through photos, The Man just showed me one he took when we were at Tartine last week and I just kind of made a pathetic sad sound because I know that I won't get to go back there for ages. Which, while good for my waistline, is bad for my heart. Or soul. It's probably good for my heart actually. The Gougere was from another planet, so cheesy and soft, he ordered one, but I nearly ate it all and vowed to learn how to make them (Tartine has a cookbook yo!). The eclair we ordered was hands down, like, by miles, the best eclair I've ever put in my mouth. The vanilla custard was full of black specs of vanilla bean and tasted like pure comfort food heaven (I'm a sucker for a good custard). The chocolate on that sucker was perfect. It was full, dark, and the perfect balance of sweet and dark. OMG, I want another one NOW. We had just been to Four Barrel Coffee that morning and weren't impressed with it, and when I found out that's what they served at Tartine, I was disappointed but hopeful that a better barista might make a difference. Unfortunately, I'm just not a fan of Four Barrel. But that's totally OK because I am so not there for the coffee. Tartine will be a go to destination on any future trips to the bay area because I am 100% down with that shiznat.

ok it's been a while since i was here, but I can understand why the line went for half a block. the croque monsieur was devoured with the quickness--the cappuccino was done by a barrista (including the fun coffee art) and along with the obscene amount of pasties that bought that morning, I have to say we were very happy about making this stop. If i were to stop in this place again I wouldn't mind sitting down for a proper meal here. I think i remember eating the banana cream tart and the lemon tart--to be honest I'm not sure if i was a fan of the texture of the tarts--something about the custard was off... The morning buns were pretty good too =] all in all it was worth waiting to have at as the first meal of the day.

To call an establishment my favorite bakery in the world is quite a statement, I know, but believe me, I am not exaggerating. I have been to an obscene number of bakeries throughout my life and this one tops them all. While I do have a favorite American Bakery, French Bakery, etc, Tartine is my favorite bakery overall. During my first and unfortunately my only visit thus far, I sampled about 8 different items with the help of my family. The croissant, morning bun, and chocolate croissant were the best breakfast pastries I have ever had in my life! A hot and frothy cappuccino went perfectly with these treats. The whole wheat bread was absolutely amazing. It was chewy and hearty on the inside and had the perfect amount of crunch on the outside. Bread like this puts grocery store bread to absolute shame. The lemon cream tart is, what a surprise, the best lemon tart I have ever had. It might sound ridiculous that I am calling all of these things my favorite, but I stress that I am not exaggerating. I also tried the clair, lemon meringue cake rectangle, devil's food cake round, and tres leches cake round. Needless to say everything was to die for. I am considering moving to San Francisco, right around the corner from Tartine, just so I have the option of eating there whenever I please. That my friends, is my dream in life. Tartine is a small business, and I am all about small businesses, especially in large cities where things tend to get swallowed up by the hustle and bustle of big business and traffic. Small eateries are the gems of a town. They add a unique flair to a busy street.

Tartine's bread comes out of the oven around 5pm and within an hour its usually within an Êhour. Though a loaf of their bread straight out of the oven is number 24 on the list, when I went at 5 o'clock to get some fresh bread, there were no morning buns left... so these two items might have to be done on two different visits. But you might luck out if you go at 5... who knows? So the Morning Bun was heavenly. Their croissants are super super buttery, and because they bake them at a high temperature the outside is super crispy and flaky with a the center still being soft. The orange zest in the filling adds a subtle citrus hint that adds a whole different level of flavor. The only thing that I wish is that the flavor was dispersed a little more. The twisted center is where all the flavor is, but the outside is tastes mainly like a normal croissant- which is still good, don't get me wrong. I also like a lot of sugar on the outside of my morning buns, which this one did not have, but I think it was just an off day because all the photos I see online of the morning buns at Tartine have a good amount of sugar on the outside. I did like however that they used crystal sugar. Morning Bun is $3.85 and is on 7x7 magazine's Big Eat list. There sandwiches also look amazing and I will definitely have to go back and try one of them. The one that most caught my eye was sheep's milk cheese and quince jam.

I finally had a chance to come by - I am not usually a fan of breakfast baked goods so I never really felt like going out of my way to come here. However, since I had some time to spare in SF before heading home I decided to drop by. I ordered: - Morning Bun - nice and crispy on the outside, tender on the inside. Seriously the best I've ever had (and this was at 4pm on a Friday) - Coconut Creme Pie - the two pies I shared w/ the BF in 3 days because they were both so filling. The creme is amazing and not too sweet. - Banana Creme Pie - I thought I would prefer the coconut pie over the banana since I love anything coconut, but i LOVED this. The banana creme has vanilla beans inside it. Both pies were amazing but I love the banana one. - Croque Monsieur with Ham - didn't try it but the BF loved it. Tartine will make anyone into a fanatic. I recommend going at odd hours because when I came there was no line. Parking was a pain so my BF just idled somewhere with the car while I bought the pastries.

In terms of tastiness, my morning bun was good. It had the mild complexity of orange zest and cinnamon sugar and flakiness of buttery goodness. Points for you. Although, Tartine has managed to gain another review about the customer service issue and snobbiness. I've worked in the food industry before and understand that shitty customers can ruin your day or even permanently jade your outlook on even bothering with good customer service. But really guys. We patronize your store and we support your paycheck. A little common courtesy and kindness would be appreciated. Or even an acknowledgement that I exist I suppose?

Their bread pudding is incredibly amazing! they use seasonal fruits and give you the biggest proportions, and its hard to consume every last bite because it's sooooo filling. The food is great and some of their foods are priced on the high side but all worth it. Definately worth the money, and definately one of the best bakeries i have ever been to.

This is my second time visiting SF and I was so keen on eating the baked goods at Tartine again. I had its morning bun previously ... And it was so unforgettable! I took my family here to celebrate Mothers' Day. The line at 3pm was quite insane but it moved really quickly. Also, we managed to snag a table as most people were taking the baked goods away. They didn't have any morning buns left ... Nor banana cream tart ... Which was slightly sad :( Ordered: (1) croissant (one of the best croissants eaten in my life - comparable to the Parisienne standard), (2) croque monsieur with ham (I highly recommend this ... 3 layers of ham, long beans and cheese on top of perfectly baked baguette), (3) brioche bread pudding (Ahhhhh ... My sister and I were very awed by its moderate sweetness, softly baked fruit toppings and tender custard!) and (4) frangipane tart (the almond nuts were so crunchy)! Tartine, please open up a brunch in New York, New York!

First, I was flabbergasted by the line that ran out the door and far down the side of the building at 10 am. ÊSecond, I was shocked by the huge tubs of butter I watched them mixing through the store window. ÊHowever, once I took my first bite of their morning bun, it all made sense. That morning bun is fantastic. ÊHints of orange swimming amidst bites of the crispy exterior alternating with the plush and soft insides, all equally delightful and delicious. ÊThis is one of the most delicious, decadent pastries I have ever enjoyed. The chocolate croissant is also amazingly flaky (certainly in no small part to aforementioned tubs of butter), with tremendously generous amounts of Valrhona chocolate, more than I have ever seen in a chocolate croissant in a very long time. The croque monsieur was an afterthought, but a delicious surprise. ÊCheese, asparagus, bread, spicy turkey - I told myself I was only going to have one bite (who could eat more after a morning bun AND a chocolate croissant?), but I couldn't help but go back for bite after bite until the croque monsieur was no more.

I finally got to tried the famous TARTINE! When we walked in around 3pm, it was packed!!! Good thing we found seats outside! I got the bread pudding and chai latte and my friend got the chocolate tart and latte. Okay- Bread pudding, I definitely liked my bread pudding with more bread texture than pudding. It is a bit too soggy for my taste, but nevertheless, the fruits were baked perfectly! Chai latte- definitely has enough spices, so thumbs up!! Chocolate tart- she loves it because it wasn't too sweet, and apparently the chocolate taste wasn't that apparent. Latte- She said it was one of the best latte she had in her life because usually when latte goes cold, it has a bad aftertaste, but this one still tasted well after it became cold!! I definitely can't wait to come back here and try the different desserts!!! Especially the famous morning bun that everyone seems to rave about!!

YUMMMMMMMMMM!!! The bread is so delicious. You have to come promptly at 4:30pm when the bread comes out if you want your pick of walnut, plain or olive. Since we got here at 6pm, we only had plain (country) as an option. However, it was still delicious. A huge loaf for ~$8. We asked the cashier what cheese we should get the bread. She wasn't very helpful, but did try to pitch the "Tartine" book since it has 100 recipes or something. We also got the eclair which was pretty darn good. I want to come back for the banana cream tart. Apparently, a lot things sell out quickly so come early!

**Review is strictly based on the coffee/service** My friend and I decided to make use of a nice sunny day to take our dogs for a playdate at Dolores Park. Being the adults who needed some extra boost in energy, we wanted to drop by Tartine Bakery to get some iced Blue Bottle coffee. My friend goes inside to order our drinks while I wait outside with the pups and when she comes out with coffees in hand, we walk towards the park. As I look at the drink, I notice I can see some milk particles floating around in the drink and asked my friend what milk was used. She said the iced coffees were already pre-made and they weren't even cold when given to her (she had to ask for more ice to be put in). Seriously, WTF - the coffee wasn't even fresh?! Dare I say, I actually tried the coffee and when I drank it, it tasted SOUR. I could barely taste any coffee - it just tasted like sour liquid. The sourness was definitely indicative of spoiled milk. After the first couple sips, I had to throw it away. It just wasn't drinkable and later my stomach actually started to hurt. Coffee isn't that hard to make, Tartine. Please get it together before you poison someone.

This quiche costs 38 clams! Debbie Downer. Wah-wuuuuuuuuh. The people: Hey, these people are pretty and hip and cool! That girl's tattoo is great! Why don't plain white shirts look like that on me?! We could totally be friends! I love Tartine! Buuuuuuuut ... is that mustache really necessary? Did I just get attitude from bangswoman! Seriously, why don't plain white shirts look like that on me? Debbie Downer. Wah-wuuuuuuuuh. The space: Beautiful! Nice, modern hardwood floors! Big windows! Bright light! Clean everything! I love Tartine! Buuuuuuut ... There are like five tables in here! I can't sit down! Those fools aren't even eating anymore! Even the outside seating is taken! And it's so cold outside! It's 8 a.m. in San Francisco! Debbie Downer. Wah-wuuuuuuuuuh. Of course, this is mostly facetious. Everyone knows the ups at Tartine far outweigh the downers. But seriously, open up a bigger spot, no?

Tartine, you're no longer a unicorn to me! I've passed, discussed, and planned to come numerous times, but the dreaded line out the door and packed tables had deterred me all these years. A friend and I made plans to FINALLY taste the treats. Verdict: + Almond Croissant- SO goood, huge, flakey, filled with good yumminess, slightly more toasty on the bottom than preferred, but ... I still ate it ;) ++ Gougre- I could eat you ALL DAY LONG. Crisp on the outside, chewy, airy inside + Orange cinnamon morning bun- WIN, huge, chunks of refreshing flavor, crispy ++ Bread pudding- Delightful, light, perfectly sweet, love the seasonal fruit ++ Banana Cream Tart- YUM, after breaking into this one, I didn't want to stop. The layer of chocolate on the inside coating the crust was brilliant! We skipped out of the crowded bakery and headed to the sunny park. Bliss :)

I like this place. I want to love it... but in all honesty, I don't think it's good enough. I know, I just broke a lot of people's hearts. Listen, your morning bun is good, but not amazing. Nothing I've tried, including the croissants, the sandwiches, the bread pudding, the fromage blanc bavarian, the banana cream tart, the shortbread, the friand, the rocher... (I've tried a lot) has made me love this place. There is one item I do love though, and that's the Summer Fruit Bavarian. That shit's the bomb, but it only comes during the summer. Maybe if it came year-round, I could give this place 4.5 stars, but honestly, it costs way too much! I think Tartine's a good place; don't get me wrong. I just don't think it's as amazing as people (and lines) make it out to be.

1. Find parking 2. Stand in line 3. Order anything -- you won't be disappointed. My personal favorites are the banana cream tart and also the coconut cream tart . My other half really loves the bread pudding. 4. Fight for a seat or take your goodies to a nearby park. Tartine is definitely as good as it gets.

Yes, of course I had to try this place since I was in SF. ÊIf you're walking from the 16/Mission BART, walk down 16th instead of Mission, unless being accosted every other block and smelling urine is your thang. Knowing we had to catch a flight in 2 hours, and knowing that buying one of EVERYTHING was unrealistic (no matter how tempting) we tried the following: Ham & cheese croissant - buttery and delicious. ÊAsk them to warm it for you. ÊWe did not, but wish we did. Gougre - decent; nothing to write home about. ÊWould probably have been better warmed. Chocolate chip & walnut cookie - just to wash down the cheezybreads with something sweet. Prosciutto and Provolone sandwich - came toasted, warm, and in 3 large pieces. ÊDelightfully tasty, just make sure you have something refreshing to wash it down with. All in all, a positive experience. ÊEven the wait on a late Sunday morning (around 11:30am) was bearable (about 20 minutes). ÊPlus the weather cooperated. ÊAgree with another reviewer that it's best to take your goodies 1 block away to Dolores Park (weather permitting) and make a picnic out of it.

This was one of the best experiences in SF. We got a bunch of ham and cheese croissants, brownies and other assorted baked goods and headed to Dolores Park on a sunny day.

This bakery sells the prettiest desserts I have ever laid eyes on. I first tried their banana cream tart, and then returned a couple days later to try their lemon cream tart. I couldn't help it. It was calling my name. The banana cream tart was very good, but the puff pastry crust knocks it down to a 4/5 for me. The Hillstone Restaurant Group's banana cream pie still reigns supreme in my opinion. The lemon tart on the other hand is absolutely divine.

Prepare to line up, but it is all worth it! Afterall, long line mean high product turnover rate, which means you will always get the fresher baked goods! And indeed, everything at Tartine is fresh and delicious! My personal favorite: Lemon Tart--Creamy, rich, sweet and a little tart. Perfect with a cup of tea. Fresh fruit cake with balvarian cream--my good friend get me this cake on my birthday all the time, and I just love it! It's so fresh and light, and the sweetness come solely from the fresh berries...a total guilt free treat! Quiche--They have their daily and seasonal flavor, one with meat and one vegetarian. They're filled with flavors and not overly salty at all. I also tried their fresh loaf of olive bread. Wow, you have to come early for them or pre-order their bread because it's fresh out of the oven and they get sold out fast.

Now that I've been here three times, I need to add a Reminder to my iPhone: double down on the quiche. Yes, it's expensive, but it's almost perfect. I've only had one sandwich here, but I'd take points off for the bread to meat ratio -- there is way too much bread. I'm told by a girl who likes bread pudding that the bread pudding is good. Whatever. Just go with the quiche.

As we near the 10th anniversary of the opening of this wonderful Mission district establishment, let us take a brief stroll down memory lane and remember how Tartine became what it is today. Pastry power couple and coowners, Elisabeth Prueitt and Chad Robertson, left their Point Reyes neighborhood back in '02 where they first planted their roots at Bay Village Bakery and took over the 18th and Guerrero space. ÊLittle did they know they were at the forefront of a croissant revolution. It was during the beginning of this decade when the Dolores Park area was reinventing itself, after the successful renovations of Bi-Rite Market and the unprecedented success of the Italian eatery Delfina were both occurring. ÊThis neighborhood was truly preparing itself for a major facelift. The couples' first book, "Tartine", was critically acclaimed as a success in '06 (which happens to be available for perusing while having brunch at Zazie) which was quickly followed with James Beard award nominations for the both of them. ÊVictory finally came in '08. Chef Robertson's 2nd book, "Tartine Bread", goes into more detail around his infamous recipe for country bread, taking root from his culinary training first in New York and then abroad in France. Today, people from all over the Bay Area, let alone the country, seem to willingly wait for the amazing croissants or croque monsieurs, a true piece de resistance.

Since the last time I was here I developed a milk allergy, so that has actually drastically changed what I could eat from this place! I embraced this opportunity and tried new things...and wasn't disappointed! This place must funnel through thousands of people every day. It's amazing that the food still tastes good. Be ready for it to take a while and to be a little bit chaotic. I actually realized this time around that a lot of their stuff is just soaked in cream or doused in creme fraiche, so if you're like my bf who I have accustomed to drinking soy or almond milk all the time you may not feel so hot afterwards if you order the bread pudding or other such creamy items. There are some things, though, that are delicious without weighing you down. The lemon bar is pretty good, but what stands out is the crust, which steers away from overdone shortbread. The wedding cookies are excellent, bursting in showers of sweet (though they are so sweet that your teeth might hurt a little!) I also ordered the pastrami sandwich, my first non-sweet item from Tartine. Would have been better with the cheese, but was pretty good--the meat was flavorful. You have been forewarned...this sandwich is HUGE! It comes with a cute little pickled carrot to finish it off. Best eaten when warm! Overall my second Tartine experience was pretty great and, in spite of the hype, Tartine still lives up to its reputation.

I came here after hearing about the hype and the fact it was featured on Man vs. Food. I got the bread pudding with peach and strawberries. Honestly, the bread pudding at El Greco was a lot better. This place it was served soggy and it tasted more like a mix between flan and bread. I was expecting more of a variety but it was eh. My friend got the lemon tart which I sampled. It was too tarty for me and the lemon taste was too strong. The crust was really hard as well. The only nice thing about the bread pudding is that the syrup served with it was hot. I really don't get the hype about this place.. there are barely any options and the options that are available isn't that great..

I came here after seeing it on the Best Thing I Ever Ate on the Food Network channel. They suggested the morning bun so we ordered that to try. It was good but it wasn't amazing. I came back here before I left to the airport for my flight home to grab some morning buns for my bf's sister. They only had two left so we grabbed the last two and some orange juice. Wasn't amazing but it was good enough to come back to bring something home for the bf's sister.

I took my sister to Tartine for lunch the other day, I'd never been before but had heard about it, and was constantly walking past the front door when the line would wrap around the corner of the street. We were lucky and missed the lunch crowed, whew. ÊShe ordered the spicy turkey sandwich, which was good but not really spicy. ÊI had the pastrami sandwich, which was spicy and delicious. ÊNeither of us finished our sandwich because they were gigantic! ÊSeriously the largest sandwich I've ever had, we ate the leftovers for breakfast the next morning.

Why 5 stars? ÊBecause it's consistently the best breakfast I've ever had. Ê --- Ê --- Ê --- Nearly two years removed from my first experience, Tartine proves to have the best Ham-n-Cheese croissant ever created. ÊI'd put it up against any croissant I've ever tried...and even things I haven't tried. ÊWhat's up France? ÊWe've got you beat at your own game! As was the case in the summer of 2010, I enjoyed said croissant, along with a banana tart. ÊI went to Tartine twice on this trip and found out the hard way that the tarts are not ready until around 9am. ÊI was sure to go back the next day a little later on in the morning. Ê I tried the latte and the cappuccino. ÊBoth were super. ÊIt's very impressive to watch them pour the latte in the form of some kind of flower/tree. ÊI know a lot of places are doing that, but I'm easily impressed. ÊAs many others have noted, make sure to bring some cold hard cash if you want to get caffeinated up, as the coffee bar is cash only.

I'm a French guy who love good croissants, so I went to this famous bakery to see if it was really as good as popular. First, the wait is really long, it's super crowded so it's stressful, any change (like heating up the croissant) takes forever, and in the end, the croissant was ultra heavy and fat - absolutely not refined. I really think I prefer eating a croissant at Starbucks (and trust me, I'm very picky when it comes to croissants). A little bit disappointing. PS: In French, "tartine" is how we call toasts with butter and jam :)

As a SF native, I feel like a poser having never had anything at Tartine. I've been to every other place on that gourmet corridor (Delfina Pizzeria, Delfina Restaurant, Bi-Rite), but not Tartine. Ê Now that I've had Tartine, turns out... I wasn't missing out on anything at all. Ê I tried the morning bun, banana cream tart, and frangipanne croissant. I seriously don't see the big deal. It's not that they're bad, but I expected fireworks to shoot out of my head with Tartine having been listed on 7x7's list every year. And these pastries were EXPENSIVE! I'm used to overpriced things in SF, but 4 pastries for $19 is absolutely absurd.

In love with Tartine! Even being aware of the line I decided to give it a try and loved it. You will have to wait a little bit to make your order, will wait a bit more to find a place to seat (in case you want to stick around) and will wait a few more minutes to get your food, but believe me, all the waiting is worth it. Their sandwiches are amazing, with super fresh bread and other ingredients. Their tarts, croissants and pastries also look great. Since their sandwiches are pretty big you can share one with a friend to have more room for the "desert time" since this is heaven for pastry lovers. PS: I've been to Tartine during the week when the line is not that scary...

As a visitor to SF, I was tempted out of my morning slumber by a coworker who wanted to take me to Tartine. He'd had "the best breakfast of his life" there recently, he said. Thus, he had vowed to make a pilgrimage from SoMa to the Mission every day for a cup of their coffee and something sweet to go. Though I've heard about Tartine's long lines, we showed up at 7:30 and strolled right up to the register. After seeing a gentleman hunched over a steaming brioche bread pudding piled high with peaches, I had to go for a cup. I grabbed a morning bun too, out of sheer gluttony and a desire to share it later. I also ordered a latte for purely scientific purposes: my coworker had assured me it was excellent. And it all was! Excellent, I mean. The latte was so big, it was practically served in a bowl, and the brioche bread pudding was so rich and sweet, it kept me full past lunchtime. But was it worth the morning trek from downtown? One long, crowded MUNI ride later, I had to wonder. I think if you're in the 'hood, visiting Tartine (along with Bi-Rite Grocery and Bi-Rite Creamery) is a great idea. But you can't really swing an all-organic baguette without hitting someplace delicious in SF; Tartine is simply a standout among them. So though my coworker's going back a third time today, one lovely breakfast at Tartine was enough for me.

We were here around 10:30am on a Friday morning with the pleasant hum of street construction right past the front door. The line was about a 10-15 minute wait (maybe 6 people standing outside of the store itself). Not as bad as it looks! My friend and I shared the following (listed from least to most favorite) Croque Monsieur - You have a choice of ham, turkey, or mushrooms. They were out of turkey so we got ham (although in retrospect the mushrooms looked really tasty). It's basically an open faced toasted sandwich with butter, ham, sun-dried tomatoes, and cheese. I don't think there was enough cheese to actually justify calling it essentially a grilled cheese. The best part was the bread (which I'm guessing is made there). It was like a rich wheat bread with a soft inside and hard crust with lots of oats. Besides the bread, the second best part was the funky tiny pickled carrot that comes with it. My friend who hates carrots, gobbled it up. It doesn't taste like a carrot, but has the same texture with a hint of spices. Conclusion: Not worth your time/money unless you need a savory morning pick-me-up. Morning Bun - At first my friend described this as the love child of the cinnamon roll and croissant. As we were eating it though, it was more like a croissant pregnant with a cinnamon roll. The outside is relatively hard with clearly defined flakes (like a croissant) and the middle is like the middle of a cinnamon roll. It has a hint of citrus and is glazed on the outside. It was just okay--a little too hard for me and a little too sweet. It was the kind of sweet you sort of find sticking to your teeth as you're chewing. Banana Cream Tart - THE BEST. Period. A hard, flaky crust topped which chocolate and a caramel sauce. The filling is mostly banana and whipped cream--which was not even close to how interesting the crust was. The total was about $22 for all three. Overall, Tartine is the type of bakery that focuses on quality ingredients with care and attention to every pastry. The only thing I don't care for too much is that they seem to be the type of bakery focused on a distinct contrast between hard and soft (think turning the oven to a really high temperature so you get that crunchy crust ---that you can barely even get a plastic knife through). I'm more of just a softie.

Oh, Tartine, how I hate your lines, and how they rouse me from my lazy Sunday mornings just so I can beat the crush of people! For that, you have my eternal ire, but really, it's only because I'm out here much less often than I'd like! I still remember my first time, where a friend and I ordered ~$75 worth of small pastries, taking bites out of almost all of them. These included their vegetarian quiche ($4.25), bread pudding ($3.50), banana cream tart ($6.50), pain au chocolate croissant ($4.25), frangipane croissant ($4.25), morning bun ($3.75), and a smattering of things to go. My most recent visit this past weekend included a subset of these, as well as a frangipane tart, to try something new. All things considered, their frangipane croissants are easily the winner of the bunch, with almost all the others vying for a close second. And considering I don't even like bread pudding, that's probably quite a feat they've accomplished here. The only things I'd really pass on are their coffee drinks, and their frangipane tarts, since the fruit completely overpowers the pastry. A few things to keep in mind: their banana cream tarts aren't what you would normally expect when thinking of banana cream pies, and are instead much lighter; prices may be a bit high, but their pastries are massive - one would be wise to split them up into several portions; they don't open until 9am on Sundays, but don't be surprised to see a long line even before doors open; and seating can be a bit tough to find sometimes, but don't be afraid to share a table!

My husband and I finally paid a visit to Tartine this weekend. I have to say I am torn on 3 stars or 4. We arrived a little after 4:30 on Saturday and there was already a line out the door. I immediately jumped out of the car to jump on line and my husband was on a mission to find parking. I would say it took about 20-25 minutes to make my way up to the counter and for my husband to find parking. After waiting in line and wanting to try Tartine for months we decided to order a variety of items. We ordered the following: ~1 Small Frangipane Tart : It was a flaky pastry filled with boysenberries, almond paste and citrus flavors. Delicious with a cup of coffee or a tea! ~1 Bostock (Recommendation from the girl helping us): Toasted slice of brioche bread filled/stuffed with almond paste, orange jam, topped with sliced almonds and powered sugar. Also great with a cup of coffee or tea. ~Brownies (3 per bag): We decided they were more like thick squares of fudge topped with walnut halves. Overall,, the pastries were very good, brownies not worth the $8. Now for the bread.... Each day they have 3-4 breads to choose from. All large, rustic loaves. ~Country Bread: Large rectangle shaped loaf. Warm right out of the oven and crusty. We were thrown off how strong the sour was. We would prefer less sour or no sour at all. Makes a great grilled cheese! ~Walnut Bread: Also a large, rectangle shaped loaf. Same as the country bread with walnuts. We felt like it was missing something but we plan to try making french toast with it. ~Sesame: Large, round loaf, top covered with sesames and inside also included sesames. Were looking forward to heating some up for dinner or perhaps for breakfast. Less sour taste compared to the country. ~We also ordered a wheat but they were apparently out already. Breads are $8.25 for country & $8.75 for all others. The long line, timing of bread ready and parking makes us lean more towards 3 stars oppose to 4. Our total bill was $68 for 6 loaves of bread (bought a few for family), 2 pastries and a bag of brownies. Not expecting to walk out spending that much! Another reason why I vote it a 3.

Tartine is the place that made me fall in love with food. I'll never forget the first time I went. It was 2005 and I was a fresh-faced new college grad getting accustomed to life in the Mission and in the working world. At that time, my idea of good pastry was a Pillsbury Funfetti cake. A co-worker took me to Tartine at 2 in the afternoon on a Thursday. The line was as it is today, out the door. ÊAll it took was one bite of the Croque Monsieur, a slice of the devil's food chocolate cake, and a sip of a beautifully crafted latte and it was like an epiphany. Needless to say, I have loved Tartine ever since. Though I rarely make it into the Mission these days, I make a point of stopping by when I am in the area. Tartine is a stand-out bakery and a modern San Francisco classic. For first timers and out-of-towners, be sure to try something savory and something sweet. Care for something classic? Maybe a croissant and chocolate chip cookie fit the bill. Or perhaps something a little more unique? ÊWhy not try the olive bread and the tres leches cake?

I may have overused the word "love" in this review, but this place just brings out my emotional side. Ê Like everyone has said you are going to have to wait in a long line, but trust me... good things come to those who wait. ÊLove it.

Banana Cream Tart: Taste was defintely elevated, considering this was probably the most well done cream, chunks of banana laced with caramel included. ÊPie crust was perfectly flaky and layered with dark chocolate. ÊWhip cream on top was PERFECTION. Ê But after I finished it, I still felt a little empty. ÊNot my stomach of course, but maybe my heart? ÊThe quality of Tartine's pie was great, but instead of making me want more, I began to long for Nation's super cheap banana cream pie, quality which was so much lower yet desirable!

Omg hot pressed sandwich was bomb! Prosciutto and provolone with some arugula. Bread is amazing! Rustic, chewy, crunchy!!! Came out warm and delicious! It was $13 but big portion. Came with spicy pickled carrot stick...felt like bugs bunny but it hit the spot! I wanted another sandwich but was too full..needed room for dessert too. Morning buns are amazing..crunchy, buttery, flaky, chewy from apricot glaze on top. Best almond croissant I've had thus far. Croque monsieur is delicious..mostly due to the bread. Brownies are good but expensive..$10 for 3. Coffee is only so so but love drinking lattes out of a bowl!! I always somehow spend over $30 here..I can get carried away.

I came with a mission- to order a Banana Cream Tart and a Morning Bun to-go. When I got there, they were sold out of the Morning Buns [it was approx. 3pm] :(. So, I just got the former and we also ordered the Coconut Cream Tart. IMO, the Coconut Cream Tart was better than the Banana Cream Tart. I think it just depends on preference though. Apparently, I like coconut more.. because each time I took a bite of the Coconut, I felt a tingling sensation surge through my body and I smiled. I was giddy yet calm at the same time.. LE SIGH. Water is self-serve behind the counter. Morning Bun & Passionfruit Lime Bavarian Cake- I'm comin' to get you next timeee! GET IN MY BELLLLLEYYYY!!! :D

I will not wait 45 mins for bunch. I'm not in NYC where's there's a wait for everything and I don't believe that this place is so much more superior than others to warrant such a wait. SF has many more local eats that aren't crowded with tourists. So why did I give it 4 stars? Banana cream pie. That is the only reason. Although good, everything else here is a bit over priced. The whipped cream feels like eating a rich wonder cloud. The crust is a perfectly crunchy and the bananas just taste perfect with the cream. If you go, get the pie! Tip: Go early in the day or they will run out. Happened to me twice. Third time was the charm.

ÊSave up for the best bread, best tart, best cake, best cookie, yum yum yum.

Tartine was one of the places that the interwebs basically forced me to try while I was in SF last year for a visit and we were not disappointed. We got there well before opening to beat the rush and get a table and were delighted to see them squeezing the juice while we were waiting and watch the final prep for opening. In my opinion, you know for sure that you've found a winner when your expectations were instantly raised after your first bite of their food and Tartine did that for my girlfriend and I. We had 2 different croissants (chocolate and the ham and cheese), a ham quiche, croque monsieur and fresh squeezed orange juice. Everything was fantastic and we walked away completely stuffed to the gills because we could not stop eating. So rich and satisfying I would 100% recommend people make the effort come to Tartine and change your expectations like we did!

When I was a kid, I heard stories of how people in Russia would have to wait in long lines, just to buy simple things like bread and milk. It was unimaginable to me, what a sorry place, they had no choice but to stand out in the bitter cold for hours, just for a loaf of bread. So I have to laugh at myself and my self imposed capitalist counterpoint --waiting on a freezing Sunday morning for 45 minutes (i'm sorry, but the line does NOT move that fast) --for fancy pastries and butter laden pressed sandwiches. We live in a land of ludicrous plenty --how many other amazing bakeries are there? (Mission Beach Cafe and Delessio, to name a few in the hood)... --But there I willingly stood, with dozens of other suckers, waiting for my chance at a chocolate eclair. The wait wasn't so bad, because my husband just got me a new ipod nano and downloaded Dan Savage's podcast, so I had plenty to keep me entertained before my friend came. And I weathered the cold, because I was wearing my nice puffy north face down jacket (I may look ridiculous but I'm warm and you are not so shut up). But the problem with waiting in the cold for 45 minutes is two fold. One, you start thinking, this food better be damn good. I mean, I could've finished my croissant and be back in bed had I gone to Mission Beach Cafe. And is it so much better? ehhhrrrrmmmm.... It's definitely worth a 15 minute wait. But 45? Really? The second problem with the wait is that you can't just buy one cookie after waiting that long. You have to maximize the investment you made. For me, that meant buying gougeres, and a morning bun, and chocolate hazelnut tart, and a scone, and soppresata pesto pressed sandwich, and bread pudding, and a ham and cheese croissant. Do you see why this is a problem? Add in the tea and it was a 50 dollar expenditure. Of course I didn't eat it all in one setting or all by myself, but honestly, it's ridiculous. Which brings us to WHY it's ridiculous --the food itself is soooo rich. I literally ate a third of my sandwich, that was it. Because in addition to the soppressata, cheese, and pesto, the sandwich was pressed and grilled with butter (or maybe olive oil? Êhope, hope?) so that it was crisp. The whole thing was just a brick of varying kinds of delicious fats. Note that I am not saying it's not delicious, it is. But it's SO heavy. And isn't it kind of cheating, like putting bacon on everything is just a shortcut to guarantee popularity? ÊIn fact, the main saving grace on that plate was the spicy pickled carrot, which is a mark of genius, to balance the richness. So yes, Tartine is delicious. But when you see the line going past the front of their building, past the front of their kitchen, and past the house next to that, you really might want to remember those poor babushkas in Russia. Or your poor arteries. It's a great place, but maybe just a few times a year.

I had my first Tartine encounter today; and it lived up to every good word that's been written here. My friends and I jumped on the Muni and headed to the world famous bakery for breakfast on our last morning in the city by the bay. I had lots of images in my mind from all the food porn I've seen in the Tartine coffee table books. I was delighted to see it looks just as beautiful in person. I resisted the urge to press my face up against the glass and softly weep. Ê There's nothing I love on this planet in quite the way I love a hot ham and cheese croissants, and this has to be the patron saint of hot ham and cheese croissants. It was so flaky, not greasy, the cheese was warm but not totally melted and the ham just a tiny bit crispy. Every bite was perfect as I took my time with each flaky layer. The latte was also great, and I especially love that it is $4 even. It was warm enough to sit outside, I met the nicest couple and their two little greyhounds, discovered that this particular block of Guerrero happens to also be the mecca of darling (and adorably dressed) children, and to top it off, I had lovely company! What a perfect start to the last day of a wonderful visit. It's a good life guys. Croissants from Tartine certainly don't hurt. xo

ahhh Tartine :) Tartine was recommended to us as a must-stop-by-while-you're-in-San-Fran by my boyfriends co-worker. I hadn't even heard of it nor had it come up on any of my Yelp searches for a good bakery. Anyway, we missed it on our first pass because it is an unmarked black building with cars battling for parking on the curbside. Once we finally found parking, there was a line. Yes... a long, long line, and no free tables. Popular is an understatement for this place. My eyes feasted on the goodies behind the glass case while I waited for my turn to order. I settled on the croissant because it just looked so good. Tony chose the Banana Cream Tart. I got to the register, having passed the other goodies I was thinking to switch to, but I had to compose myself from getting a little too excited. We had to enjoy our new pastries in the car, but my croissant was seriously a melody of warm, crunchy, buttery, flaky goodness. It was worth the 3 bucks I shelled out for it. The one bite I got from Tony's tart was light, tasty and perfect as well. I wish I could have sat and stayed to gather the whole ambiance of the place, but what I experienced was good enough to bring me back the next time I'm in town. Or it could have been a blessing in disguise that I didn't get another opportunity to just jump back in line and spend all my money tasting the other pastries!

Saturday morning 10AM wait wasn't too bad and I was lucky to find parking around the corner. Waited about 20 minutes and finally got to the window display of goodies. It was a lovely display of pastries. We my list in mind, we started ordering: * Croissant $3.85 (4.5 of 5) Yummy. I really liked how they baked it. It was flaky, layered, and buttery inside, but there was crisp on the outer layer. I didn't really appreciate Bouchon's crossiant, but I really like Tartine's and I would get it again. It is so different from local supermarket. I strongly recommend this one. * Bread Pudding $3.75 (2.5 of 5) It is ok. I would skip this next time. Had fresh fruit and was a little soggy for me. * Open Faced Sandwich $9.75 (3 of 5) on Tartine Country Bread covered with smoked ham, fromage blanc, shitake mushrooms, spicy turkey. Gourmet open face sandwich to fill the stomach, but I can pass it next time. ÊMaybe it would taste better if they reheat it in the oven when you order it, but $10 was a little pricy for one piece of bread. * Banana Cream Tart $7.00 (5 of 5) A must must must must try. Oh my. The best tart I ever had. Not that sweet and I love the small coating of chocolate layer between the pastry and the cream. And the chocolate shavings on top add an extra texture and flavor to the tart. I even like the tart pastry that holds the cream content. Absolutely wonderful creation, I am not a fan of tarts, but I am a fan of Tartine's Banana Cream Tart! * Morning Bun $3.85 (4 of 5) Tasty especially with a cup of hot tea or hot coffee. It has a cute overflowing muffin shape. And I noticed the outside and the middle tastes different. The outside parts are a little crispier, but the middle is a little moister because it is thicker. I like the middle more. But it is a great piece of pastry. This item is listed on 7X7 2012 100 Top Eats, but I think the Banana Cream Tart is much tastier. Delightful pastry morning selections and I believe it was worth the wait. The banana cream tart is a must try.

Advice to first timers to Tartine: Try to come here before 1pm if you want their best goods, and before 10am if you want to guarantee it. ÊThat pretty much means their morning bun (dyam that orange zest!!!), croissants (butter HEAVEN), coconut or banana creme pie, quiche, or bread pudding (I dont' love their bread puddings, but my aunt does), and gougeres. ÊI love these things so much I bought Elizabeth's cookbook to learn how to make the croissants, and of course I got the bread book when it came out (one of my favorite reads of all time!). And don't you ever, ever, go the few days before a major holiday (ie Thanksgiving or Christmas). ÊThey will run out of everything they have that is good, which means you're left with those weird friande things or their hazelnut torte, or mexican wedding cakes which are good, but not Êwhat Tartine is worth the journey for. ÊThen you'll get all grumpy you paid like 7 dollars for something that's not what you wanted and a medicore latte, on top of that obnoxious hipster service (i'm just kidding, most of the girls there are very sweet). ÊThey won't even have country bread, which is usually sold out a week before the holidays. ÊThey might have their croques left, but let's face it, their croques aren't that awesome, you'd probably rather have an entire loaf of that country bread or their pressed sandwiches. Shout out to their pressed sandwiches. ÊI always get the one with the rapini and sopressata. Ê*drools thinking about it* Oh and one more thing, if you don't know about their country bread, you gotta call in and reserve a loaf 72 hours before hand. ÊOr come around 4:45 day of, get your ass in line, and make sure that you are one of the first ones there as soon as it comes out of the oven. ÊIT'S SOOOOO worth it, because the deliciousness of the bread decreases exponentially the longer you wait to put it in your mouth. Êtrust.

So after reading reviews here and on chowhound, I had to go. I'm a dessert person and am always looking for great sweets to eat. There was no parking so I got out as my dh circled and eventually double parked. There was a line out the door at 1:30 Saturday afternoon. ÊI called and text my dh when I got closer to the desserts to tell him the choices. No reception! Ok it was broken reception, same thing! Get a booster people your phone has to work at all times or forget it. 1 star so far off from me. The choices were fancy sweets no good old fashion cookies and cakes. Very played with type desserts. Everyone there raved about the lemon tart with whipped cream and the fruit tart. So I went with the line of people ordering that. The staff was unfriendly and not helpful. They just wanted to keep the line moving. ÊThe person in front and behind me got the same treatment. We were both from the east coast and were surprised of the lack of service. ÊVery expensive for not great dessert. The lemon tart was way too sweet and after 2-3 bites I was finished, very unlike me. I love sweet. The fruit tart had a dry crust. My dh felt similarly. We threw it out. What a waste!

I don't understand why a perfectly good dessert place would be closed at 7 or 8pm every night. Ê Maybe it's so they can save energy to fight the weekend morning crowds in search of the morning bun. ÊIt's a small space, but on a weeknight, snagging a table isn't as challenging. I was disappointed that their espresso machine was broken, as I really wanted some dark coffee to go with my dessert tonight. A part of me needed something savory, so I tried the giant gougere, mostly hollow (as it should be) but with a thin layer of peppery cheese. ÊI imagine it would have been much better warm, but it satisfied my salt craving. As for sweets, the chocolate pudding was smooth, not overly sweet, and pretty addictive. ÊIt's easy to put spoonfuls of it into your mouth mindlessly. ÊThe devil's cake was kind of your classic layered chocolate cake - pretty dense, not overly sweet, definitely needing some coffee to go with it. ÊI'm usually not a big lemon person, but the lemon cream tart was actually pretty good - very smooth with just the right amount of a pastry shell crust, not too tangy. There were lots of other tempting items in the case. ÊBrownies and cookies are on the more expensive side, but other cakes and breads are more average in price. ÊI can't wait for the banana cream tart with chocolate and caramel this weekend (thin crust, generous amount of bananas, relatively light cream...)!

I would have given this place 4 stars, had it not been for the prices. Maybe i'm just cheap, but I bristle at ponying up $14 bucks for a sando. Tartine by all accounts, is tasty. The shop is a smorgasboard of wonderful smells & mixed company. The decor is warm & homely. Nice to sit outside on the sidewalk seating when weather permits, and the location is fabulous. Right next to Dolores park! I ordered the spicy turkey pesto ($13.50 + tax), one of their warm press sandwich options. It was delicious though i certainly did not taste any 'spicy'. The bread was a bit oily but it held its crunch. The pesto was generous, the turkey was not. Could have used another couple slices to hold up to the thickness of the bread. Came with an interesting little in-house pickled carrot. I also purchased some pastries to bring home to my husband. Buttermilk scone w/currant - $4+--yum! crumbly inside, great crunch on the outside with sprinkled sugar crystals. Croissant - $3.95 --buttery & filling. regular iced tea (no refills) $3 in a small stingy glass. *sigh*

Tartine is an amazing bakery. ÊI have been here at least 3 times and love it every time. ÊI recommend the ham and cheese as a standard delicious item (that is always on the menu) but also recommend picking whatever you fancy from their delicious selection of pastries and treats once you get inside (there will be a line, it will be worth it), or whatever else you find on the menu - like the ham and mushroom open faced sandwich. ÊWish I could be more specific but their menu changes frequently and even though I'm bummed the previous items may not be there when I go again instead I'm pleasantly surprised by something new. Yay Tartine!

Stopped in at Tartine after having Ike's and Bi-Rite since I was with a group of visiting friends and we were determined to have the creme de le creme that SF had to offer... so despite being stuffed, we had to stop and at least grab a few goodies to-go. The selection is pretty extensive, but I was here to try their morning buns - which they luckily still had in stock. The wait at ~1pm was out the door and probably 10-15 minutes long. The line was tightly packed up along the walls of the small interior and overall it was like being in a can of packed sardines... I would probably avoid ever dining in here due to how cramped everything is, unless it was a nice day and I could nab the 1 or 2 tables they have outside. The morning bun ($3.75) is quite large and the orange zest in there gives it a nice "wake-up its morning!" kick; however Tartine's morning buns also have an [overly] sticky and syrupy quality to them that I didn't care for as much. Maybe I shouldn't have heated it up in microwave? but I think I personally prefer the clean and crispy, fluffy morning buns from La Farine in Berkeley... but overall, this was a delicious and solid offering from Tartine I'm not sure if Tartine is quite "BEST BAKERY" ever title worthy if you ask me, but I'll probably stop by again since I frequent SF quite more often than Berkeley now-a-days... plus I'd like to try and see if their bread pudding and banana cream tart are worth the hype and Food Networks' claims of Tartine producing "The Best Thing I've Ever Ate".

It can be awkward to cut and share but who cares what it looks like when it tastes this good?! The morning buns are also tasty and there's a a slight touch of orange flavor to them. ÊThe pastries all look so pretty behind the glass counter and I want to try their croque monsieur or paninis next. Although I like Tartine, it's quite expensive and I always have a slightly stressful experience coming here because of the long line, unfriendly service, and fierce competition to grab an open seat.

There's a high correlation between how long I wait in line for baked goods and how much I order. ÊWell played Tartine, well played. From the morning buns to the double pain au chocolat - this is not the place if you're on the Paleo diet. ÊMy favorite time to come is on a rainy weekday, if I'm lucky enough to get a window seat with my crisp tasting pastry and latte. ÊMakes a gloomy day wonderful. ÊWhile community tables aren't usually my thing, I enjoy sharing a table and the people watching here. Ê Until next time Tartine...

The items I wanted to try were not available when I came here. I guess I should've come in the morning. I didn't want to walk out empty handed, so I decided to try the rocher (meringue cookie) with cocoa nibs. Not to be crass, but my friend said it look like dried poop. The rocher was chewy and airy with a crispy exterior. Interesting texture, but I didn't really care for it. I will have to pay another visit in order to experience the wonderfulness of Tartine.

Now I finally understand the buzz around this place! The wait was only about 10 minutes on a sunny Saturday afternoon, definitely worth it for the delicious baked goods and sandwiches. - Loved the sopressata pressed sandwich, where the slightly bitter and spicy broccoli rabe made it amazing. A little bread-heavy in proportion, but hey they're known for their freshly baked bread - Brioche bread pudding was very good and not too expensive either. I'll be warming up the leftovers - Morning buns were satisfying, though I would have expected a little more sticky yumminess to them (maybe because they were 5 hours old??) But glad to cross it off my 7x7 big eat list - Four Barrel coffee was, interesting. Nothing beats Blue Bottle Yes it's a little pricey, but you're in the Mission foodie area and the stuff is great quality. I still can't decide whether I like Bouchon or Tartine better - but both are top notch. Really enjoyed sitting at a table outside and people watching too. I didn't encounter the rude staff that some people complained about - they were pleasant girls, albeit efficient.

We saw a random guy sitting on a bench eating the most divine looking panini. He told us it was wild mushrooms. So we waited in line.. It went quickly and we were ready to order, but we didn't see the mushroom panini! Boo.. We had our heart set on it.. But chose the pastrami.. As we were about to order, my boyfriend asked if they had the wild mushroom panini, and she said "we sure do!" Each hot panini takes about 20 minutes and they give you a letter (not number, a letter).. We chose to take our panini to go, but we soon realized that by the time our panini was ready, a table would open up! We could have saved a box.. Now we know! Patience is a virtue.

This pains me SO much to give 2 stars, but I really can't rate it higher. ÊI was SO excited to go here, and I just happened to be in the area. ÊThe fatal flaw? ÊI came like 10 minutes before closing and they were out of pretty much everything. ÊFor that, I do not blame them; that just means they have fresh buns in the morning. ÊAnyway, we asked the server what was good that was left and she recommended the lemon meringue pie and this chocolate hazelnut tart. I also got a coffee to go with my tart. Ê The house coffee was good, but expensive. ÊThe tart was really dry and crumbly and overall NOT DELICIOUS. ÊThere were nuts, which I like, but it made it overall really bland. ÊI honestly did not finish it and i was pretty hungry,. ÊI also do not like wasting money or food that is overpriced. ÊThe lemon meringue could have come from Safeway. Ê So yes, very disappointed.

I always wanted to try Tartine's for the longest. Bought here by an amazing short video and Yelper friend ( http://vimeo.com/14354661 ). We came here during the morning and there was still a long line on this rainy day. So the line eventual started to move like waiting for coffee at Starbucks. First time coming, I went straight for their very popular Morning Bun ( http://www.yelp.com/biz_É ). The morning bun is a very sweet, flaky, and simple pastry that goes really well with their house coffee. The next time I went was during the afternoon and I bought a whole huge loaf of their famous bread ( http://www.yelp.com/biz_É ). It was still hot off of the oven and the aromas drove me crazy. I really want to just bite the whole loaf of bread. I do have to say this type of bread is something you would want to eat freshly baked. ----- + Pro: I dont think you can go wrong with anything here! - Con: Premium prices \( ^,^)/ Overall: Famous little bakery, that definitely deserved its title.

Tartine is one of those places that my wife is dying to visit every time we visit SF. No matter what time we seem to go, there is always a line out the door and no place to sit. However, like magic, no sooner do we order our food than a couple of seats at a communal table or counter open up. Let this be a lesson to you annoying seat-savers out there: just go through the line like everyone else, and everything will work out! Without fail, we always order the morning bun and some type of croque monsieur. Most recently, I had a mushroom croque, but there is no such thing as a bad choice. Not only are the croques themselves good, but the picked carrots served alongside are great as well. We also recently tried the banana creme tart. I'm not a huge banana fan, but I could appreciate where this tart was coming from, and my wife loved it. If you're going to have any sort of sweet breakfast pastry like a morning bun, it'd be a shame to not have a cup of their delicious coffee as well. The lattes come large--I've seen smaller toilet bowls--you can definitely share one if you don't want to make a huge caffeine commitment.

I wish this place didn't always have a line and offered more seating. However, it is just as good as everyone says it is. The last time I went I had a tres leche cake and croissant bread pudding with strawberries. The tres leche cake was okay but a tad sweet for me. The bread pudding.... YUM! It was almost like a cross between traditional bread pudding and flan. Of course they were out of morning buns so I'll have to go back.

Note: this review is only for the take-away morning buns, not for the experience of actually sitting down and having coffee/food. ÊI took off a star simply because every time I've walked past at a normal "coffee" hour, the place seemed so packed it wasn't worth it to stop in. There are a few bakery items from the Bay Area I miss dearly, and tops on that list are morning buns (which are starting to spread in popularity across the US, thanks to Starbucks) and Dutch Crunch Bread. Anyway, the Tartine morning buns in question were also "scored" (yes, scored) right around opening, so there weren't huge lines to contend with, and they were hot and at their peak of awesomeness, although I would gladly eat a 3 day old one. ÊThey were, in a word, epic. ÊUnlike the goods sold by other fine purveyors of morning buns, Tartine's have a distinctive orange-peel flavor, something I have not encountered elsewhere. ÊSwirls of light, fluffy, buttery croissant pastry enrobed in the perfect mix of cinnamon sugar, candied orange peel, and general deliciousness... ÊYes, they are crazy pricey for what they are like everything else in this gourmet corridor (Bi-Rite, I'm looking at you), but I haven't found a breakfast pastry that quite matches its awesomeness yet....

I finally went to Tartine after years of hearing about it from friends. ÊAnd Wow! The morning bun was good in so many ways- it was flaky, moist, crunchy, I could taste the butter, the glaze had a very distinct orange zest that set the flavor off. ÊThe lemon almond pound cake had the most amazing texture- I have never had such a good pound cake. ÊTartine clearly knows their business in the baking department. ÊIf you like baked goods, you really do owe it to yourself to get over to Tartine. One star off because the coffee is absolutely miserable. ÊIt doesn't even taste like coffee. ÊI would have brought it back and asked for a refund if that had been convenient in any way. ÊIf anyone actually reads this review #3,500 (just a guess on the number) take my word for it and get a coffee somewhere else. ÊThere are plenty of wonderful places nearby. ÊNowhere, however, will you find baked goods equal to Tartine's.

And it's not even that they are actively obnoxious or snotty. ÊThey just...don't care.

The happiness that you will undoubtedly experience upon making first acquaintance with a ham and cheese croissant from Tartine Bakery can be absurdly compared to a number of rites of passage through life. ÊI could compare it to the day that I finally received my high school diploma except that never happened. ÊI could compare it to the day that I lost my virginity but when I really think about that night, I'm quite sure the memories are less about happiness and more about relief (and ultimately regret). ÊI could compare it to my first love but can you think of a word that rhymes with ostrich and reminds you of dogs? ÊActually, come to think of it, thank God for subsequent loves, post-virginity experiences, and higher education! ÊRites of passage in life can totally suck. Ê In any event, all of these experiences have nary a tangential relationship to the aforementioned ham and cheese croissant. ÊWhat beckons you to this treat? ÊThink crisp and buttery layers of flaky crust with perfect slices of Niman Ranch ham accompanied by tender husks of gruyere cheese. ÊThe treat shatters pre-existing notions concerning the relative amount of enjoyment one can receive by ordering what generally amounts to a rather unsatisfying breakfast. Ê So you are a vegetarian? ÊTry the bread pudding and I dare you to forsake logic and claim it fails to satisfy your culinary desires. ÊIn the incredibly unlikely event that does occur, maybe you should move on to the morning buns. ÊIf you still don't like your food, just shoot yourself. ÊYou don't deserve to live if you can't appreciate anything. Ê Tartine is one of those rare gifts from the culinary Gods. ÊGo forward, plan on a good wait, and enjoy the opportunity to eat at one of the nation's best bakeries.

The banana cream tart is all MINE! =D I came here during the week in the afternoon with my husband. There were plenty of banana cream tarts to go around. =) This banana cream tart is better than any pie version you'll ever get. The tart crust is flaky and the bottom is layered with caramel and chocolate before having bananas, cream and chocolate shavings piled on top. The best part of the whole thing is the caramel surprise in the crust. I also tried the lemon cream tart. It looks beautiful. Definitely good for people who love tart desserts. It was a initial shock to my taste buds, but it's very refreshing. The best discovery of the day was their morning bun. It's in the shape of a muffin but it tastes like a croissant wrapped with cinnamon sugar. SO. GOOD. Thank goodness I don't live nearby this place.

This place never lets me down. I get so many compliments for bringing Tartine goods at parties. My thing is...share the good stuff. If I'm not bringing a dish made from the heart, then bring something that speaks from the heart. Tartine works for me! There is always a line, but it's a line worth standing in... The staff there are extremely busy, and I would suggest for customers to know what they want before ordering. Avoid asking stupid questions such as, "What's really good here?" or "What would you recommend?" Answer: "BUY THEM ALL! THEIR ALL DELICIOUS!! JUDGE FOR YOURSELF!"

Signs that indicate you are at Tartine (because they are too hipster to actually have a store sign): 1. Looooooong line that rivals that of Bi-Rite 2. Corner of 18th and Guerrero 3. Lots of bread-oriented displays in the windows (huge windows... again, with no sign) The line was long but manageable... I think it took a good ~25 minutes to order. But once inside, the countertop displays were mouthwatering!! Let me break it down for you: -if you're feeling sweet-- the bread pudding was so good. The bread was just soggy enough so that you can really soak in the flavors and textures, but still bread-like enough to not question what you're eating. They even give you small, thin slices of apples that are baked with (I think) cinnamon and they're yummy as well. -if you're feeling savory-- one of the baristas told me that the provolone & prosciutto sandwich was really good, and it was :) it was made with arugula (my favorite), warm melty cheese, and their homemade bread. If you're near Dolores Park and do not feel like enduring the long lines of Bi-Rite, go ahead... knock yourself out with those of Tartine.

I had a Lemon Cream Tart. Maybe thats not the thing to have here, it was nothing to write home about. I imagined everything would be amazing like it is at Bouchon Bakery, but it wasn't. Sitting outside was also less then satisfying as well as the overall feel of the place and people behind the counter. It does not appear delicate or delicious like a good bakery should, neither did I feel tempted to indulge and I do not recall it smelled very delicious of baked goods either.

Last weekend my bf and I were visiting San Francisco, and we made the pilgrimage to the mecca known as Tartine Bakery. I couldn't wait to get my paws on a ham and cheese croissant and, to my shock and disbelief, the girl behind the counter proclaimed they were all out. I repeat: ALL OUT OF HAM AND CHEESE CROISSANTS. I couldn't believe my ears. You're kidding, right? But I came all the way from Portland... So instead, I settled for a regular croissant, which was still fabulous, a slice of ham quiche, a croque monsieur for my boyfriend, and a 3 pack of brownies to take home. Can we talk about the quiche? It's not something I would normally order, but my friend had suggested I try it. It was so delicious, fluffy and moist, it literally melted in my mouth. It was truly magical. Ê I wished I had ordered more items, but the line was out the door. You really only get one shot to order, so you better make it count. Next time I visit, they better have those frigging ham and cheese croissants. I will also be sure to order one, maybe two, of everything.

Tartine Bakery is both a bakery and a small restaurant. I came around 1:30 on a weekday and they were still packed full of people eating. The line for their pastry wasn't too bad around this time. The layout of their bakery/restaurant is pretty awful as it's not very efficient. The only way to leave is to go through the tables to the exit. Their pastry is DE-LI-CI-OUS! Morning buns should be the staple of what you're buying. They're that good! The outside is nicely baked to a golden brown while the inside is still soft and moist. I also liked their croissants since it was soft, flaky and crunchy. I haven't had their other pastries, but I'll definitely be back for some more.

No bakery fans can ever leave SF without a visit to the esteemed Tartine Bakery. We arrived at 5:15pm and though that wasn't considered prime time for a visit to a bakery, people were standing in line to purchase Tartine Bakery's freshly baked goods. Surely there was a reason why this place won the coveted James Beard Award for Outstanding Pastry Chef. Any pastry chef today who owns their own other bakery take pride in having previously worked at Tartine Bakery. Tartine Bakery specializes in freshly baked bread ranging from rye, sesame, sourdough, etc. Since it was the weekend of Halloween, pumpkin bread was also available. These breads were sold in big loaves and people were buying them whole to bring home. Surely this would be our go-to place for fresh loaves of bread if we lived in SF (but sadly we don't!). A very friendly gentleman overheard my husband and my discussion on what to order and, and then proceeded to recommend us the bread pudding. When he told us that he and his wife drive all the way from Oakland every weekend just to get the bread pudding, we were sold on getting that. It was absolutely perfect and really the best bread pudding I have ever eaten. I am generally not even a fan of bread pudding but Tartine Bakery changed my impression of bread pudding. Topped with raspberries, it was soft and fluffy and not dense. Tartine Bakery made us a little jealous that Chicago does not have a stronger bakery culture. The next time we are flying out to San Francisco, Tartine Bakery will find us there again.

They make a great lemon tart. The crust is buttery and crunchy. When I took my first bite, the lemon made my jaw tingle....just the way I like it! I am a fan. I usually can't eat all of my dessert, but I managed to eat the whole lemon tart and lick some of my container because it was that good. Once I restock on my lactaid I plan on getting their banana cream pie. YUM! I kept hearing this girl behind me talking about a morning bun. I really wished I knew what she was talking about then because I would've ordered one. It sounds amazing, so I have to come back again!! There was a line but it wasn't too bad on a Sunday afternoon. Don't plan on sitting inside because the tables are full. Plus you'd be sitting amongst people who are trying to order and that can be awkward.

Oh hype monster, you've reared your ugly head with Tartine. Everything I had was good, but I wouldn't say that any one thing was jaw-droppingly amazing. I had their famed morning bun, almond croissant, and banana cream pastry (not at the same time, of course). I'm not sure how I feel about the orange marmalade (i think that's what i tasted) in the center of the morning bun. The banana cream pastry didn't strike a chord with me. I thought the almond pastry was the best thing I had of the three, but nothing I couldn't find in another bakery elsewhere. I just couldn't shake the fact that each one these things had a dense quality to them that made subsequent bites less and less appealing. Well, at least I gave it a try. On the bright side, I will never have to wait in that ridiculous line that snakes along the sidewalk to get into this place.

My friend was coming from Seattle and she was dying to try this place. We got the morning buns since they were all the raged, an almond filled croissant, and lemon cream tarts.

Especially when you got to the middle where the orange glaze is the most concentrated, it was eating a chewy gummy candy. It started to stick to my teeth. The almond croissant was pretty burnt and the lemon tart was just ok. The crust was really sweet and after eating a quarter of it, I felt sick. Try out the espresso bar too. I got the latte and it woke me up. I always get lattes and these were strong, plus it went down smooth.

Heavy is the king's crown. ÊWhen you are ichiban in craft breadmaking, peeps can't help but hate. ÊBut please, can't we all just get along . . . break bread per se? Ê Actually, let's break THIS bread even 'cause it is ridiculous good. ÊIt is next-level, supernatural good. ÊWe got the country bread, and its crunchy crisp crust and tangy chewy crumb sent me to another planet where I ended a century-old martian civil war by serving this bread to the warring martian tribe factions. ÊThey confirmed for me that Chad Robertson is actually not of this universe. ÊHe's just visiting to school this realm on self-made leaven, fermentation control, etc. Note: All the hype about waiting for the bread is na-na. ÊI walked up at 4:30, waited for 1-2 minutes while other customers got croissants and such, asked for the bread, and got it with not much hold-up at all. ÊGuess it was just noise.

Bread lover's orgasm is what Tartine Bakery is. Absolutely delicious pastries, sandwiches and Francophone baked goods is what this place is about. I had the croissant. It's crispy on outside and heavenly moist on the inside. Not too buttery either. If I can be picky it's a little too crispy on outside, I think it was in the oven couple seconds too long although I thinks this croissant's are one of the best I've had in US. La Duree is my favorite croissant still. The cheese in the quiche is absolutely delicious. I don't know what kind of cheese they use but it seemed to be a little bit stronger then the cheese I've been used to eating in American made quiches. They had a vegetarian quiche and ham and arugula quiche. The crust is pie crust and it was a little burnt but still very good. I'm wondering if the chef's in love because both the croissant and quiche seemed to have been in the oven a little too long. Lines are out the door but it's 15 minutes wait to order. The place is small with about 4 tables inside and 4 outside. If you look inside the kitchen you'll be surprised how many people are working in there. Lovely little place, decor's very minimalist with wooden table and chairs. Definitely go to Tartine Bakery and take out your favorite pastries and bread.

Every time I come to San Francisco I always stop by for at least 1 of their sweet pastries. ÊIt's always fresh and consistently delicious. ÊTheir CROISSANTS are the best I've had in Northern California and their PASSION FRUIT LIME BAVARIAN CAKE is my favorite cake there.

ÊI'm not a big fan of sour but I can appreciate a well baked loaf. ÊA full sized loaf is over a foot long. The only thing that sucks about coming here is trying to find parking and a place to sit so I can scoff all the goodies I bought.

This place is full of tourists and greatly overrated, With so many good bakeries and restaurants in the Bay Area this place is just okay. The food is good but really not worth jostling for position to try to get a seat while trying to balance your coffee and your slice of overpriced cake while you get shoved around. Hazelnut chocolate torte was bland, the lemon meringue cake was mediocre, and the croque monsieur was good but in Paris it would be a dime a dozen.

One of my absolute favorite places to eat in all of San Francisco! ÊIn SF, the quality of a restaurant is easy to judge....just look at how long the line is out the door. ÊTartine is a great French Cafe offering some seriously tasty treats. ÊI have been going here for years and have yet to be disappointed in anything I've ever tried. Ê FOOD Quiche - 5 out of 5 - The kinds vary from day to day but I've had the ham and cheese along with the spinach and they are both amazing. ÊMy favorite quiche I've ever had.... and I rarely order quiche from anywhere else. Croque Monsieur - 4.5 out of 5 - Open face sandwich with bchamel, gruyere, thyme and pepper and opped with smoked Niman Ranch ham. ÊTasty and amazing! ÊThe ham is oh so good and the herbs and the gruyere really bring it together. ÊOn the downside, the bread on the bottom is a little thick and kind of hard to eat with plastic utensils. Eclairs - 5 out of 5 - Best eclairs I've ever had. ÊSoft outter shell and vanilla custardy goodness on the inside Lemon Meringue Cake - 5 out of 5 - I don't even like Lemon meringue...but my cousin ordered it and I ended up eating half of it. Mocha - 5 out of 5 - Ok, I admit that I am a coffee snob. ÊThe coffee they serve here is truely special! ÊAnd this is the best mocha I've had. ÊI have two favorite cups of coffee in the world. ÊOne, the mocha, is here and the other, Vanilla Latte, is in LA at the Conservatory of Coffee, Tea and Coco. ÊOften times I swing by and go straight to the coffee bar just for this. OVERALL If you don't mind braving the lines, you are in for something pretty special.

Definitely one of SF's gems. On a sunday morning, at 9:30 am, the line was out the door, and doesn't move too terribly fast. I think a huge part of it is that people want to dine in Tartine, and seating is a bit limited. Only got to try the morning bun and the croissant. The croissant was good, but not great. The crust had a much firmer gluten structure than what I'm used to with other croissants. If you eat it straight, you might not be too impressed with it, but I'm a dipper, so if you dip the croissant in coffee, it's pretty decent. Actually it's kind of awesome, because their drip coffee is really good in that it's west coast style coffee (not over-roasted so you can taste the floral notes in the coffee). I would highly recommend the morning buns though. I don't care if they're sticky, but they're the perfect texture and the hint of orange is really nice. I bought a three pack of brownies to bring home, and they were pretty decent but nothing mind-blowing.

One of the best bakeries in the United States. Entering Tartine is the equivalent of entering a cathedral dedicated to baking. The theme this SF weekend has been waiting in line. At night, I was in line at Mitchell's for gourmet ice cream and in the morning I was in line for former baked goods. Experience gave me the same feeling as Bouchon Bakery but it's more accessible. Get the morning roll! Heavenly combination of butter, sugar, & flour. Croque Monsieur was solid too. Not to mention the bread pudding with seasonal fruit and double chocolate croissant. Secret is you don't need to wait in the long line for a latte. Grab your latte then join the deluge in the bakery line.

After passing by so many times and wonder at the line as well as hear people raving about this place, I got to try. It's not bad, don't get me wrong. But it's not exceptional either. Because of the name and reputation I was expecting all the pastries taste exactly like they do in France (I grew up there) but it's really not the case. I would give 3.5 and maybe 4 stars but long line + parking situation + high price bring it down to 3.

i've been here a few times and ordered something different each time, but overall i think the baked items are too buttery. at times it tasted so buttery that i felt like i should just eat a stick of butter because i couldn't taste the other ingredients. chocolate tea cake my first bite was just butter flavor. i couldn't taste the chocolate at all. i was hoping that was just the butter used to grease the pan, so i gave it another try. the second bite had less butter flavor and some chocolate flavor. the texture was moist, and the density was lighter than a brownie but heavier than a sponge cake. tres leche this was the only item in my memory that had minimal butter taste, and was too sweet. i still haven't had a chance to try their bread, but it is on my list

Outside of Paris, Tartine is still my favorite croissant. ÊSweet or savory, they really hit the spot! ÊEven after consistently eating 2 or 3 per day for a few months, I could continue eating them daily if it weren't so bad for my waistline. Ê I am docking one star because I've tried a lot of their other pastries, breads and other menu items and I would really only wait in line for the croissants. ÊAlso only 4 stars because sometimes the croissants are overly burnt for my taste.

The line outside was quite daunting at first, but we had plenty of time to kill, so decided to give this place a try. The line moved very quickly and we were at the front before we knew it! The boyfriend and I ordered the croque monsieur with wild mushrooms and sun dried tomatoes, served with spicy pickled carrots on the side. The croque monsieur was magical .. the flavors blended so nicely and the bread itself was so soft and buttery. The spicy pickled carrots were .. interesting. Haha. Don't get me wrong, it was good! Within one bite, your taste buds were quickly shocked with flavors of tart and spiciness. It was madness I tell you! Everything else on display looked good as well. Unfortunately, they were out of the famous morning bun when we came ): I plan to come back for that as well as the bread pudding! There is both indoor and outdoor seating, so just be patient and you'll most likely be able to find a place to sit and eat!

Morning bun? Almond Frangipane? Banana Creme Tart? Spicy Turkey Sandwich? Yes Yes Yes and Yes. Tartine is located one block away from Dolores park. It can be seen from afar usually because there is a line to get inside (but living in San Francisco, we get used to waiting for food). The food is great! This is a great place to come and catch up with a friend or a great place to just eat and relax. Pretty much everything they make here tastes good. To get seats, you kind of have to scout out people that are about to leave while you're in line. It is best to come here with at least one other person so that they could save a seat while you are in line. The seating is limited but people are always coming and leaving. One thing to be aware about is the service here. Most of the time it is good but not always. It's a hit or miss when it comes to service here. But in the end it doesn't matter because the food keeps me coming back...

You know, there's something about organization that really makes a difference when you're talking about getting a bite to eat. ÊI feel like Tartine Bakery could use some of that. Ê When you get down to it, no matter how great the baked goods are, they may sour in your mouth after waiting in a line that moves slower than molasses, having people push you out of the way constantly to get to the coffee refill station (in the corner behind the line, really?) or to get to the espresso bar (in the back corner of the dining room). ÊNot to mention the fact that if you want a pastry, you won't be able to order one when someone behind the counter helps you because you can't even see the whole case at the beginning of the end! Ê Sigh. ÊAfter reading soooo many great reviews, I was super stoked to come here! ÊI saw the line around the corner and thought (yeeeeah this is gonna be good). ÊBut after waiting, waiting, waiting, waiting, and more waiting, all we felt like spending the little money we had left was on a decadent chocolate cake that was far too rich for me. Ê So this is my advice to yelpers looking to come here. Ê Read the menu online before you go. Ê Don't go at lunch time (say after 2:30 you should be good or go super duper early in the morning). Ê Know what you want, and ask if they have it when you are approached at the beginning of the pastry case. Ê If the croque monsieur comes out of the oven when you order, even after you order, get that shit. ÊIt's affordable and smaller than their other sandwiches, which may be the small bite you're looking for.

(See pics) Review #1024. I wish I liked this place more. Have been here a few times and had both the savory and sweet items. All the items were on the fairly rich, sugary and were heavy for my taste. Had frangipane croissant , chocolate slice, lemon meringue cake, quiche, bread pudding, etc. The coffee was too watery to balance the thicker taste. The chocolate souffl cake looked absolutely decadent, and was very very chocolaty, also was too much for me, though I can imagine people who crave loaded rich ingredients would enjoy Tartine Bakery more. BUT the brioche loaf was almost the best I have had, lightly sweetened with eggy flavor. AND the bread served at Bar Tartine was phenomenal too.

Wow. Not really sure what I can add to the reviews that hasn't already been said, but here goes. Bf and I went to Tartine at around 2 on a sunday. The line was out the door. We weren't in a hurry so we decided to wait, IM GLAD WE DID. 20 minutes later we ordered: 1) A slice of dulce de leche cake, 2) a slice of coconut passionfruit bavarian cake, 3) Plain croissant $14 and we are out the door. It was so busy and there was no seating so we decided to walk to Delores Park and eat there. The coconut bavarian was deeeelicious. The cake was super moist and the filling was tart and creamy. The Bf's dulce de leche was fine, not really my style but he loved it. My favorite of all was the croissant. It was heavenly. Buttery, crisp, crunchy, delectable, soft, moist, mmmmmmmmm. Literally the best croissant I've had (although I must admit thats not saying much, as my idea of a croissant is one from Costco) Anywho, great experience, will be back on another day when it wont be so busy! 4 stars.

I had a morning bun and a walnut chocolate drop around 3:00pm last Saturday. Both were good. No doubt about that. The morning bun definitely surpassed the chocolate drop. Good quality, but nothing special as far as cookies go. With regard to the morning bun - I loved the buttery, flakey exterior and the carmelized surgary (orangey?) interior. *BUT* Worth a (minimum) 15-minute just for take-away pastries? Nowhere to sit? Screaming children everywhere (no offense kids/parents, but it is a mood-killer)?? Definitely not worth it. AT 3PM! Isn't that supposed to be a "less crowded" hour? I'd go back to try their sandwiches (the open-face croque monsieur looked fab), but only at the crack of dawn or some time of day I'd be sure I wouldn't have to contend with the mob.

Line out the door, mayhem over food is oh so typical of the city's foodie culture. ÊUnfortunately, I did not understand the hype upon my visit to Tartine. Ordered three items: 1. Bread Pudding - I love bread pudding but that HAD to have been one of the worst ones I have ever tasted. ÊThe pudding that day had bananas and I'm cool with that. ÊBut the consistency of the bread pudding itself was nasty. ÊAll mush, kinda like baby food. ÊThere was such a strong presence of egg and I swear I was eating a mouthful of egg whites at one point. ÊBig thumbs down. Ê 2. Coconut Creme Tart - Only ordered this because they had already run out of the Banana Creme Tart for the day. Ê(Major disappointment) ÊThe tart barely had any coconut flavor. ÊPretty much the only thing coconut about it are the toasted coconut shavings on top. ÊThe crust itself was pretty good but hard because of the layer of chocolate on it. ÊWasn't really a fan of that part because I was trying to eat it with a fork and I found myself having trouble cutting it apart. ÊI will be less lady-like and stuff it in my mouth next time. 3. Lemon Bar - Probably the most decent thing I tried that day. ÊNotice the word "decent." ÊIt tasted like what I expect a lemon bar should taste like. ÊIt was pretty good, Expect a strong punch of tangy lemon to hit you. And that was my experience.

Talking about being "over-hyped", this place is it. The bakery here is good but it is not "orgasmic" or worth the wait. The bread here that everyone is drooling over is just basically fresh sourdough bread no better than other places.

Having planned ahead and stopped at Blue Bottle on the way, we arrived at Tartine with coffee in hand to hold us over during the wait. ÊIt was a Sunday morning, about brunch time, and sure enough the line was snaked out of the bakery, around the corner. ÊPeople were in good spirits, and the sun was shining. ÊTaking our place at the back of the line, we were treated to the tempting smells wafting from the kitchen window. ÊIt was neat to check out their cooking machinery and supplies while we waited. Ê The staff is efficient, helpful, and friendly, and the line moved along nicely. ÊIt took us about 30 minutes to reach the counter, where we ordered several different things. ÊMy friend and I split a "croque monsieur" ÊFor $9.75, you get: "Open face sandwich with bchamel, gruyere, thyme and pepper. Topped with either smoked Niman Ranch ham or seasonal vegetable." ÊVery delicious, but not quite enough when split. Ê One friend got a yummy latte and another had a cup of decaf coffee that tasted very off. ÊShe poured it in the gutter and replaced it with regular brew, and substituted the cream for the milk, not wanting to replicate any of the sour taste from the first cup. ÊPerhaps it was the cream, but the second cup was spot-on. ÊThe buttermilk scone got good reviews, and I bought a chocolate chip cookie and lemon cream tart to take home. ÊThe next night my husband and I enjoyed both of them -- so good! ÊThe lemon cream was divine, especially topped with the unsweetened cream, and allowed to chill for an hour in the fridge to firm it up after the car ride home (2.5 hours). Ê In short, I would go back (unless I were in a hurry), and I would order pretty much anything from the menu or pastry shelves, quite certain I'd be happy I did. ÊSo, why 4 rather than 5 stars? Ê1) Sour coffee is a nasty thing. Ê2) Seating is too limited. Ê3) The set-up with the line going out the door and the bathroom being in the kitchen area makes for awkward navigating of the establishment.

***I had a much better experience at Tartine on this visit and the two breakfast pastries I bought (double pain au chocolat, orange morning bun) were two of the best pastries I have ever had*** Tartine did not have the item (orange morning bun) I was looking for during my first visit and I had to settle for something I would typically never order. ÊI got there a little earlier this time and I had a much better selection to choose from and I opted for two breakfast pastries. The first item I had was their double pain au chocolat. ÊThis chocolate croissant had a great brown outside color and was incredibly flaky, crispy and rich. ÊThere was definitely a heavy amount of butter used in this croissant. ÊThere was also a good amount of chocolate and the chocolate had a great rich flavor. ÊThere are a lot of average and not fresh chocolate croissants out there (Panera) as well as a few good ones (Bouchon Bakery). ÊThe one at Tartine is exceptional. I also had the orange morning bun and this was very good and actually much more my style when it comes to a breakfast pastry. ÊThe orange morning bun was nicely sticky and had a great crisp outside as well as a soft inside. ÊThe pastry pulled apart very nicely. ÊIt was also evenly flavored with a good (but not too much) amount of sugar and cinnamon. ÊThe center also had a bright mix of sweet and tart with the use of sharp orange peel. ÊIt was the kind of perfect balance of crispy, soft, sticky, sweet, fresh, and tart that I will remember for a long time. Service was good and quick. ÊThe line was pretty long, but it moved quickly. ÊWhile the service was good, the packed nature of this place as well as the need to get people in and out might mean that (like Yountville's Bouchon Bakery) you might not get the very personable service you could get at a less-flocked-to local bakery. Prices are high at Tartine, but the prices are mostly similar to what I have seen at other high-end bakeries. ÊAt least the pastries here are generous portions. In terms of atmosphere, Tartine has a standard decor though the pastries are nicely and attractively displayed. I enjoyed Tartine a lot more on this visit. ÊTartine can put out some good breakfast pastries that can really stand out when compared to other bakeries (even good bakeries). ÊTartine is a must visit if you find yourself in San Francisco and you may just walk away having some of the best pastries you have ever had anywhere. Parking is very hard to find in this area since it is a busy area and paid lots seem to be almost non-existent. ÊYou can find parking on streets a little bit east of Tartine.

Not sure what all the fuss is about. ÊThere's a long line, everything's a little pricey, and parking is a b*tch! We had the coconut cream tart, lemon meringue cake, chocolate chip cookie, and croque monsieur. The coconut cream tart had chocolate in the crust, which was different, but the cream part was waaaaay too sweet - like eating pure sugar. ÊI almost felt sick after eating a few bites. ÊThe lemon meringue was pretty good - VERY lemony - so for those of you who like lemon get this! ÊThe cookie was not worth $2.50. ÊWhat is this a bake sale fundraiser?! ÊOutrageous for a thin cookie that tasted mediocre. Ê They ran out of bread on by noon on Tuesday so they couldn't make anymore sandwiches...? ÊCome on guys! ÊYou're a popular bakery and it's not even 1PM after the lunchtime rush yet. ÊTartine had a different take on the croque monsieur and instead of a sandwich, it was baked on top of the piece of bread. ÊIt wasn't bad, it just reminded me of Round Table Pizza's flat bread pizzas and I'm pretty sure it wasn't worth my $13 they charged for it even though the website says $9.75. I wanted to try Passion Fruit Lime Bavarian cake too, but it was $6 a slice! ÊOverall the food is decent and it's nice to grab coffee and a pastry to relax, but it's too overpriced for my wallet and the parking and long line factor doesn't help either. ÊMy experience wasn't horrible, I just don't see what the big deal is.

As if the ham and cheese croissant wasn't craveworthy enough, the gougere bun here really knocks it outta the park! Soft, airy pillows of gruyere just melt into a savory backdrop of pepper and herb. I think of this so often I've started putting on pounds.....

There's nothing more to be said for the pastries in this place. Absolutely amazing! Buy why did I give out four stars instead of five? Here's why: 1. Even though the pastries are terrific, they are pretty overpriced. 2. I asked the lady behind the counter which style of the scone it was, she responded by saying "of course French!". While amazed by scones existing in France, I found out the lady gave me a croissant instead. So I corrected her, and she gave me a grumpy look, which made her quite unique among all the smiling and friendly staff.

Tartine Bakery, I have been there about 5 times now and maybe I can write one or two things about it now! They have some delicious breads here. I got there at 8 am to try their morning buns and it was worth every step i took to get here! their dessert menu is simple yet nicely prepared and tastes great. their almond croissant was delicious as well; it had a bit of burnt taste which complimented really well with other flavors. I wish their layout were better so more people could sit down and enjoy the food but at the same time, it's not much of a place meant to have people sitted and stay there for long. I can't wait to try their other stuff.

As if Tartine needs my words of praise, but longing for another pain au chocolat prompts me to send a little thanks their way. ÊI really do not eat grain anymore, I promise, until I go here. ÊI tell myself that there is more butter and chocolate than flour in the pastry anyway. Ê The place is a mob scene on most days, but once you try it, you will know why.

OK - let me start off by saying that this place is a bit overpriced, however it is worth it! The line will usually be out the door on weekends and parking is epic, but i will do anything to get my hands on their mexican wedding cookies and chocolate crossaints. I would have to say that their chocolate crossaint is #2 in my list of favorite crossaints. A Paris crossaint comes in as #1. The crossaints are buttery, crunchy, and the chocolate is so decadent! yum, yum, yum. The mexican wedding cookies are good, however dont eat them in your car at night cause you will come out covered in white powder and look like a crack addict, like i did. a must stop if you are ever in the mission district!

SO delicious! ÊI went with two friends on a rainy Wednesday and it was pretty packed but we didn't have to wait long for seating at all; turnover is relatively fast. ÊWe each got the Croque Monsieurs. ÊThey were not traditional but simply open faced sandwiches with melted cheese; but they were AMAZING! ÊOurs had turkey, cheese and asparagus. ÊMy friends also got an assortment of pastries that were amazing, including the morning bun. ÊI got the lemon cream tart for the next day and even the next day it still tasted wonderful and creamy and very lemony.

I just don't get all the hype. Compared to Thorough Bread a couple of blocks away, Tartine was a disappointment. I didn't mind queuing or even being unable to get a table, but I do object to the server being downright rude. Because it was packed and the rock music rather loud, I had to ask her to repeat herself a few times and she was very huffy and kept rolling her eyes. As I was giving my order she kept walking off, so we didn't even get half the items we'd asked for. Also, we were told one of the pressed sandwiches we wanted would take 25 minutes! My husband enjoyed his croque Monsieur but I have definitely had better quiche - the pastry was over done, as was the gougere. I will definitely be sticking to Thorough Bread in future for its better selection of cakes, pastry and bread, and pleasant counter staff.

YUMMMMMM. I went here once a couple of weeks ago and I have been craving it lately..I didn't know what the bakery was called until I looked at my past pictures and took a picture of the sign. So happy I found it on here!! I don't really go to (American) bakeries often...I think this was one of my first ones. Since I don't really have much to compare this bakery with, I have to say that the food is SO good! The line was very long but went by very fast. And well worth the wait imo. I got the croque because it looked DELICIOUS. I was originally going to get a sandwich but when I saw this I was like whoooa. Gotta try a piece of THAT. And it was heavenly :))) Also got the banana cream pie which I didn't know it was known for... I just got it because it looked good. And it was delicious as well! I want to come here again soon! I remember looking at the display of food and I wanted to get absolutely everything. This will be my New Years Resolution :D Lastly, there's a park really near this bakery so we decided to eat there, and I suggest you do the same! It's a huge park with a ton of people that are also chilling outside and some random person had a boom box (haha.....) so there was music as well. Great atmosphere to eat such good food..! Oh yeah, some guy wanted to sell us some weed too...sorry buddy.

This is the High Temple of Baked Goodness. It's unquestionably one of the best bakeries in the U.S., and I'd argue the world. I tried to find a tastier croissant in Paris and it could not be done. Everything is amazing. Rich seasonal fruit bread pudding. Morning buns, flakey and soft with just a hint of citrus peel. Ham and cheese croissants. Pressed sandwiches with delightful little spicy carrot pickles on the side. Now that they are making coffee with Four Barrel beans instead of insipid Mr. Espresso, their coffee is excellent, too. I also recommend the two Tartine cookbooks - one on pastries and the other on bread. The books are beautiful and their instructions exacting - I found that following their guidance, I can recreate almost all of their baked goods exactly from home. But since I don't have two days to make and bake puff pastry every time I want a croissant, I am happy to let Tartine do the baking much of the time. :) I will say that, on occasion, I have been sold a bottom-burned pastry (usually weekday mornings, when I was rushing to the freeway for work; maybe it's something about the first batch of the day...). This is also, admittedly, the worst place in SF to be vegan. Their fresh bread is delicious and in most cases dairy-free, but the secret to all the tantalizing morning pastries is butter, butter, butter. (Yum, butter.)

Do not be discouraged by the line out the door, because it moves fast and the pastries here are worth it. I have tried the hazelnut/chocolate tart, fig tart, and the lemon bar (all were phenomenal). My 3-star rating is for the bread pudding. The day that I went, they must have overcooked it, because it had the texture of scrambled eggs and not bread pudding. It also did not look appetizing...but if it tasted good I could forgive its appearance. Unfortunately, it was bland and did not taste like bread pudding. I was even more sad that I paid $6+ dollars for it. Luckily, I had my other treats to stuff my face with...

Oh dear, the banana cream pie really is quite a treat - the flakiness of the crust plus the chocolate is divine. ÊI've only had it once because every other time I come it's been sold out! Ê:( ÊI've had to settle for the coconut cream pie, though that is delicious too - it's the same concept except the filling is different. ÊIt's a whopping $40 for the larger party version though. Ê The croissants are also flaky, buttery, all that you want in a great croissant. Ê Parking sucks of course. ÊAnd there's often a line around the corner. -_- ÊAnd you pay the price of an elite bakery.

Their stuff is good but, in my opinion, not worth the hype/wait. Almond frangipane and their cakes are the best. Croissants are OK. I was going through a bread phase a couple months back back, and decided I MUST try Tartine bread after reading all the hype. I got 3 half loaves, and they all kind of tasted like sourdough, which I found surprising since I don't think other reviews mention this. Good, but I didn't find it as amazing as others seemed to have.

As far as bakeries go, this one is by far one of the best I have ever been to. The line was out the door, but it moved surprisingly fast and was well worth the wait. The line was actually a blessing in disguise since it allowed time to attempt to narrow down what item(s) I wanted to try. The two items I narrowed it down to were the croissant croissant and veggie quiche. Both were absolutely amazing. I've heard from my other friends that they have yet to get something they don't like. I can't wait to go back and try something new! I did not try their lattes, but I look forward to next time I visit.

I have mixed feelings about this place. The bad - if you make a lot of money then it doesn't really matter, but this place is expensive. Additionally, their items are hit and miss in my opinion. The good - if you find something you like chances are, you'll really like it. I believe they have high quality, but I still question if it's worth the price points. The bonus - way better than something you can get from safeway, and you won't feel ashamed to bring something from here to a holiday party that's for sure. The example - pumpkin pie is $40. My mom almost fainted when I told her how much I paid. She said I should have given her the $40 and she would have made it herself haha. Overall I give it a 3-4 stars depending on your style. If you have a liking for the refined things in life, then this is a winner. If you're finances are somewhat impacted, I say check out other places.

If the people who work here seem smug or uptight, it's probably a wall they've had to put up to deal with the jerks they're serving. Example A. I have no problem waiting in line, ordering quickly, or paying their prices. I don't even have a problem with busing others' dirty dishes in order to clear a table to sit at. I do, however, have a problem when a group of people immediately sit down at the table I just cleared, leaving no room for me. Their response to my obvious look of disgust? "There's a seat over there," pointing across the cafe. I tried to stay put out of principle but eventually got sick of bumping elbows with the mom of the group and just took my food to go. Example B. When the line snakes out the door it can get a little tight as customers try to exit or refill coffee, but a simple solution is to leave a gap in the line for others to easily pass through. This, apparently, is expecting too much awareness from Tartine's customers. I tried to leave room in front of me for as long as possible, but as soon as I stepped ahead in line the ladies behind me shuffled up so close they were practically leaning on me. I watched in disgust as people, each balancing full coffees and plates, had to uncomfortably squeeze through in order to exit (saying "excuse me" got no response from these women). I let a gap develop in the line in front of me to give people a way through and what did these "grown women" do? They stepped right around me and filled the gap in the line. Is it really so hard to take other people into consideration that those in line at Tartine can't help but cut in line and block the only exit? Example C. Hey lady with the double stroller - are you planning on picking up that bicycle you just knocked over? No? Ok then, I'll do it. Unbelievable. Considering that this is probably just the tip of the iceberg, I'd say the folks that work at Tartine keep a pretty stellar attitude. And they make a damn fine morning bun as well.

Service is pretty bad, but that doesn't affect my review too much. They FORGOT our Croque Monsieur. Not cool, but we ordered way too many pastries so all is good. The bestie and I got: Frangipane Croissant Tomato and Bacon Quiche Morning Bun Lemon Cream Tart My favorite was def. the quiche! Okay, if you're Chinese, I'm positive that once upon your life, when you were probably little, you helped your mommy beat eggs. Mommy would then put the mixture into a tray and either steam it in the rice cooker or on the stove. Add some soy sauce on top and Wa-la! Steamed eggs! Well, quiche here basically tasted like Chinese steamed eggs without the soy sauce; the texture is light and fluffy! Bits of tomato and bacon on the top, but it was very, very eggy overall. Steamed eggs without the salty soy sauce but the same salty taste...YUM! My next favorite is the Frangipane Croissant. Chopped almonds throughout my croissant! YUMMY! The Morning Bun was whatever...I could have done without it, but it was the beastie favorite. The lemon tart was very light and fluffy! I felt like I was eating air...air that's filled with lemon and cream! YUMMERS! I thought there would be a problem with seating, but it wasn't too bad. If all else fails, Dolores Park is right around the corner. That and Bi-Rite...YUMMILICOIUS!

I love savory stuff more than sweets. But with Tartine Bakery, everything is awesome! They do have their savory sandwiches that I love, such as the Croq Monsieur. But I will forever be a devoted follower of Tartine because of their delectable sweet pastries! Must try: Chocolate Walnut Cookies, Orange-Currant Cookies and Brownies! PS, I have their cookbook already and its pretty accurate and easy to follow, but getting them from the bakery is still different. The best time to go there is during weekday afternoons when you can avoid the long lines and have the chance to find a parking spot in the neighborhood. :)

I FINALLY tried this place again for lunch, and honestly I loved it so much more! ÊI split a lot of things and was very happy to try them all. Ê:) banana cream tart - PERFECT for a hot day since the cream is cold. Êthe cream has a hint of vanilla and is light and not too sweet. Êthe crust tastes great and is flakey and covered inside with chocolate. Êi have sensitive sweet sensors, but this dessert wasn't too anything for me, except delicious. Êwe were most impressed with the dessert, and i think i'd want to try more of them. croque monseiur - with ham. Êit was good! the thyme they add to this really makes it. Êgreat taste overall. Êi think i prefer the mushroom over ham, but they were out. spicy turkey sandwich - includes broccoli pesto. Êexceptionally tasty and VERY rich with the generous helping of cheese and grilled bread. Êeverything tastes great. Êmildly spicy. proscuitto & provolone - mmm, this is tasty and very different from the turkey. Êthe proscuitto is great and tasty, and it includes some fresh spinach. Êoverall, it tasted very gamey (like steak), and i mean this in a good way. my friend also got the iced tea, which had a great layered taste and wasn't too sweet. delicious and rich french-style food all around, and i especially like the tiny, vinegar-drenched carrots. Ê:) the only complaint i have is that the bread is VERY hard after being grilled, so it hurts your mouth and is sometimes tough to eat on the crust. Êbut the proportions are big (you get 3 slices for the sandwich). Êthe bread tastes good in the middle. Mmm, definitely wouldn't mind coming by for lunch again, but not too often, since things tend to get pricey. OH! ÊAnd we also came here at 5pm on a Wed, and this is the first time I've ever seen this place not have a line or be jam-packed. ÊWe had our pickings of seating! Ê:)

Went here with my wife during one of our trips. Loved it so much we continued to come back every morning until we left San Fran. The quiches were so absolutely fantastic. About the closest you'll get to a food orgasm. I sometimes wonder if I could get away with flying out to San Fran going straight here, picking up some pastries and flying right back before anyone would know I was gone. Very tempting. Their selection is also very good as there are plenty of options to choose from. I understand why some people turn into "dear-in-headlights" at the counter but it is something to deal with as this place is popular and stays pretty busy. If you happen to be in San Francisco, then you have to treat yourself to this place at least once before you go. Personally I think that's torture as you'll have to wait until the next time you come back to savor their delicious treats but hey, if you're into that, se la vie.

Going to Tartine is like, getting all dressed up to go to a really fancy overpriced dinner where you get stuffed and then whoever paid for it expects you to put out and in reality all you want to do is sleep, take off your spanx, and watch tv for 3 hours while in a food coma. I don't want to date you anymore, Tartine. Its time to drop the facade. Lets just be casual friends, ok? Like once a year friends.

Family, friends, heck even casual acquaintances know that the quickest way to get me moaning like a cheap hooker is to stick a Banana Cream pie in front of me.

I don't understand anybody that gives Tartine less than five stars. Before we moved to the Mission from the East Village, Tartine was in our sights because that's all our foodie friends would talk about regarding our new 'hood. For real, they would get this insane look of longing in their eyes and drool would pool into the corners of their mouths as they described the treats and sandwiches. They painted a picture of Tartine thru 80% raw emotion and 20% gasps of want. Needless to say, we went the day we landed and were swept off our feet. The line was long but it moved rather quickly. Or rather, I was thoroughly entertained by starring at other people's desserts and feverishly debating internally what my first legendary meal would be. We had the eclair and the quiche while we waited for our sandwiches to arrive. That eclair tastes as beautiful as it looks, start with the powdered chocolate side! The vanilla creme inside is smooth and cool with tons of aromatic black specks. As for the quiche, well, let's just say after tasting it we bought the cookbook from Dog Eared Books and have now memorized the recipe. After eating those two treats we were full. However, that didn't mean we didn't gobble up that melty fontina, toasty bread, perfect sopressata with broccoli rabe pesto and the tangy carrot pickles that came on the side. We got our pastrami sandwich boxed and had it for dinner. The next time we came in I got the lemon creme tart and it was too sweet for my taste. Thankfully, I also had the bread pudding which was perfect--- the texture was of a custard made in heaven and I also had the chocolate tart. Ummm... I'm fat. The chocolate hazelnut tart was really intense--- perhaps too much chocolate in one sitting for a person who's also had a ton of other desserts. Finally, the most recent time we went there we got the banana creme tart which was fantastique. Shave chocolate, whipped creme, caramelized banana, chocolate coated flaky crust--- it's just everything you've ever wanted from a banana dessert but were afraid to ask. Their wines are really delicious at a great value. I love the rose. Usually when we get invited to dinner parties we bring a box full of eclairs. It's our ultimate dessert friend.

Thanks to Gigi Metz and her GU roommates for introducing me to this place at last year's John Carroll weekend in San Francisco. ÊI love this place, but beware the parking which is a nightmare to say the least. ÊThe lines all day are a good indicator. ÊI made it out in the late afternoon so missed the wonderful morning rolls, and egg sandwiches. ÊI had the banana cream and lemon cream tarts. ÊThey were both fresh and wonderful, but the lemon cream tarts were clearly the best! ÊI had some chocolate chip cookies with walnut and other nuts that gave it a wonderful taste--on my flights to Maui. ÊEverything about this place is worth the flight from New York or DC!

I may not know authentic or or even original, but I know high quality and what I like. ÊIn my humble opinion, Tartine is super special and I've fallen madly in love with it for a number of reasons: 1) There is no sign outside. ÊYou walk up on 18th and Guerrero and see a BOATLOAD of people patiently waiting, As the line snakes outside, you ask yourself, are they giving something away? ÊUpon further inspection my brother and I discovered that we'd stumbled upon awesomeness by accident. 2) The people watching is incredible, yes, but it's always nice to have a smart phone, reading book, or other diversion, because it does take some time in that line even if it is small such as when I joined it. 3) Listen to the people in front of you if and when they ask questions. ÊIt saved me a ton of time to learn about some of Tartine's offerings ahead of time. 4) Don't be ashamed to keep adding to your order. ÊMy original plan was to get (a) an eclair, (b) one of those chocolate hazelnut tortes that I kept seeing on people's plates during my wait in line, and (c) two macaroons. However, after I'd already ordered my pastries, I tacked on (d) a regular croissant, (e) a ham and cheese croissant, and the piece de resistance... 5) Get a Croque Monsieur. ÊDo it. ÊGet it to go so you don't have to arm wrestle for a table. ÊLike I said, I was in line, pastries in a bag, ready to go, when a FRESH PLATE of CMs was brought out. ÊI'm pretty sure a big dribble of drool managed to hit my shirt as I sputtered, "Um, can I get one of those to go also?" ÊI opted for the porcini mushroom variety. ÊAnd God said it was good. ÊAnd it was. 6) You may be ordering small pieces, but it doesn't come cheap. ÊI walked out of Tartine $33ish poorer. ÊI don't regret one cent of that spending at all. ÊBro and I devoured the CM on the way to the Palace of Fine Arts, and throughout the week I muscled through the other goods. ÊEverything was amazing. The hype is real. ÊThis isn't popular for the sake of being popular -- it's much loved because it is GOOD. ÊI've never been to France and I'm not a cafe kinda gal -- but I love this place. ÊI can't wait to get back in that long line! (Prudence and a little bit of money-saving prevented me from ordering more... Êbut don't let that stop YOU!)

When we first got there, there was a line out the door, but we didn't mind waiting since we just had donuts and coffee. When we got in, we decided to order a sandwich and some little desserts that they had. Everything we had was amazingly good, but I have to say that the sandwich was SUPER spicy. I didn't expect it at all, so it was a little unpleasant. It didn't say anything in the description about it being spicy, so I assumed it wasn't. It did say it had horseradish in it, but even after taking the horseradish out, it was spicy. I think they put some kind of spicy dijon mustard in it or something, but man... I couldn't take more than one bite without crying from the heat. Beware of the pastrami sandwich, non-spicy eaters! I could tell though that it was delicious, even though I couldn't eat much of it, and obviously that did not deter me from giving this place 5 stars! ÊThe bread was so fresh and crispy and the pastrami itself was delicious. We had quiche too, which was amazing! YUM! Gotta go back here for some more pastries.

Overpriced. The morning bun is just a flaky muffin covered in sugar crystals. Don't know if I got a bad one or if it's supposed to be like that, but I thought mine was dry and hard around the outside like it was overbaked. Also had the bread pudding, which was waaayyy too eggy except for a few bites around the outside. I thought it was a pudding at first. Still waiting for someone to make a bread pudding that can live up to HB in Chicago. This is DEFINITELY not it.

I'm sitting here at work enjoying the Morning Bun from Tartine.... ahhh what a perfect way to start work with a bun that screams "Morning". Delicious, flaky, just the right amount of sweetness and chew. I also got the lemon tart. Really wanted the Banana Cream Pie but the lady right in front of me ordered the last one *shake fist*. But the tart was good, not overly sweet or sour with a nice crust. If not for the long lines, I'd want this for breakfast at least 3 times a week.

I've seen the long, long line outside of Tartine once or twice. And I've always thought to myself, "What on Earth do they serve that's worth waiting for?" Two word answer comin' at ya: morning bun. It doesn't look that awesome at first glance - just an unassuming cinnamon bun looking baked good. The outside is a little dry and crispy, too. But as you work your way inside the swirl, a explosion of orange, cinnamon and vanilla titillates your taste buds. Also worth trying is the brioche bread pudding. Mine came with nectarines and raspberries on top. Delicious and unlike anything I've ever had before. Yes, I ate two breakfasts. So what? Here's another tip for you - go on a weekday right when they open. You won't have to wait at all AND you'll get your goodies fresh as they come. Without spending hours waiting.

First time here this past weekend and picked up a few pastries to take back home to the OC. ÊThe line was out the door - about a 15 minute wait before I was able to order. ÊDefinitely worth the wait. I got the lemon tart, chocolate croissant, bread pudding, and morning bun. ÊI got my items, headed to the airport and ate it that night. ÊThe first thing I ate was the lemon tart which kinda shifted on the plane, but you know what, it was so damn good. ÊIt was not overly sweet or tart, just perfect. ÊI ate the whole freaking thing in like 5 minutes...well worth it! The next morning, I popped the morning bun into the toaster oven on a low setting for about 10 minutes and it was nice and perfect. ÊThe orange glaze and the crunchiness was so yummy. ÊI had morning buns before but these were the best. Ê I had the bread pudding tonight, but I don't think it was as good if I ate it there or ate it yesterday. ÊI think the bread soaked up the sauce. ÊI popped it into the microwave and it tasted good, but could have been better. A definite place I would come back to even though the price was alittle pricier, but well worth it.

The last time we were up in the city visiting family, wifey's nephew and his wife volunteered to be our local fixer and met us on that one block stretch of 18th St. bound on each end by Bi-Rite Creamery and Tartine Bakery. ÊThe neighborhood reminds me of Disneyland; Êout of one line into another... When we arrived in front of the modest corner bakery, there was a line out the door which is typical even at around 530pm in the afternoon. ÊWe made our way soon inside, where we could start to see what all of the excitement was all about... A lot of the croissants these days are of the mass produced variety, Êmore cushiony cake like and filled with additives and preservatives that are designed to increase shelf life. ÊTartine croissants are the real deal and authentic, buttery, flaky and not cakey at all, Êthe product of layer upon layer of buttery pastry dough that is allowed to rise, brushed over with more butter, and baked to pillowy browned crispy flaky perfection. ÊI would come to Tartine just for these... Êhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_É The Gougere with gruyere cheese, black pepper, and fresh thyme is their take on a cheese bread -- pillowy bread rounds. ÊThe gruyere flavor isn't overpowering and the thyme is very subtle... Êhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_É The Morning Buns with orange cinnamon sugar are a popular favorite, one that was recommended to us by our fixer -- it was definitely sugary sweet, a definite contrast to the croissant and the Gougere, but delightful none-the-less. ÊBecause of its sweetness, I think I would have preferred to enjoy it slightly warmed over a morning cafe au lait... Êhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_É My favorite was the croissants, I have a weakness for really buttery flaky croissants. ÊI would rank these croissants up there with Bouchon Bakery, or Europane in Pasadena... Chew on this: ÊYou want to know more about Tartine Bakery? ÊCheck out the book "Tartine" by co-owners, pastry chef Elisabeth Prueitt and her husband master baker Chad Robertson. ÊIt's a must for any baker's collection... This was only a small sampling of the variety of goods that they carry, they even have some savory items on the menu. ÊI know that I will be back...

This is SERIOUS. Please stop the presses, BIG news that this place def has the BEST pastries EVER. If you love flaky you can definitely get flaky here. I have not yet tried pastries that offered something different besides the unique decor of the pastries, something besides those damn cupcakes everyone's obsessed about, and a place that also offers coffee along with the pastries. This place has it ALL and no wonder this place was featured on The Food Network. Funny story. Came close to closing (yes, took me a while to find parking since it's in the Dolores Park area) and I really, really wanted to try the famous Banana Creme Pie which was at least $7, I think. Of course they ran out, was told there was only the cake left for $40. The girl helping me put on her sympathetic face until I said "you know what, gimmie the whole thing!" She replied, "It's $40...." My face lit up and said "YEA! I'm taking it, I'll pay for it!" HAHAHA that's how desperately I wanted to try this damn, famous Banana Creme pie, and OMG it was so, so, flaky - my dream pastry, monstrous pastry. So I'll definitely be trying to feed my friends now with all this left over. Look at my pictures, I'll prove it to you - true story. Reference: http://www.foodnetwork.cÉ

Tartine has converted me to a liker of bread pudding. ÊI usually hate bread puddings and anything that is remotely close to soggy bread, but the bread pudding here is almost like flan. ÊThe large size is huge (we shared with 3 people and there were still left overs), so I'd recommend the smaller portion. What I love most about Tartine is that it reminds me of bakeries in Paris. Ê And, it has nice dog friendly outdoor seating. Yes sandwiches are still too greasy and huge, but whatever, come in for a pastry or quiche, skip the sandwiches.

This place is the best, a lot of people around here put it down trying to be too cool for school, but it is good. Tartine is tasteful and they do some things that an uninitiated person may not notice. Europeans like their breads very dark and carmelized and you can tell the owners have worked in Europe because their croissants are very brown on top, they are also made with butter v. shortening and they constantly rotate their offerings. Some fun and traditional items like a French bouche noel at Christmas time let me know they don't take themselves too seriously nor are they trying to reinvent the wheel. Don't hate Tartine because it is beautiful.

This place is ridiculous! Vincent and I came here on a Sunday morning around 11 am. We had to wait about 30 minutes before we got a chance to order. I admit, I'm a pretty impatient girl. But it smelled SO GOOD and everyone who was inside looked SO HAPPY eating their food. I knew it'd be worth the wait. By the time we got to the register it was 11:30 and they offered sandwiches. We split a Morning Bun which has an sweet orange flavor to it. As you make your way to the middle, it gets softer and softer! Then, Vincent got the ham, and I got the pastrami sandwich. I thought it was really expensive at first because it was about $15 for each sandwich. Dear Buddha was I wrong. This thing came out in 3 pieces! It could have been 2 sandwiches. I was so shocked at the size that I was initially scared to eat it. We only ate 1 piece each out of the 3. In our defense, we were saving room for our next food joint so we didn't want to be super full. That was probably one of the BEST pastrami sandwiches I have ever had. Yes the line is long. Yes the it's super crowded. But it was DELICIOUS and worth the wait!

For another snack (actually lunch after clinic one day *don't judge me*) I made my second "repeat" of the trip - this one to Tartine Bakery - a spot where I enjoyed breakfast almost two and a half years prior but vowed to return to in order to experience two items I passed on at that time. ÊWith parking nowhere to be found I did what any logical person would do and stowed my car in a delivery only spot before jogging across the street to thankfully find the line empty and the shelves full. ÊWith the smells of vanilla, cinnamon, and butter wafting into the streets my order was swiftly filled by a pleasant young woman and in less than 5 minutes I was back to my car en route for the SFMoMA where parking was admittedly more plentiful (and more expensive.) Shocked and surprised by the "Free Tuesday" sign at the MoMA I counted my blessings and collected my ticket before making my way to the caf where I unbagged and unboxed my bounty to enjoy - first the still warm and oft raved Bostock, an eggy brioche that resembles a portable bread pudding more than it does a simple dessert bread. ÊDense and moist with layers of complexity both in terms of flavor and in texture this was perhaps the best item I've tasted to date from Tartine and although I generally do not love citrus the boozy orange notes married perfectly with the smooth frangipane, sliced almonds, and powdered sugar to form a flavor that was at the same time rustic yet refined - the sort of thing that could be enjoyed with or without coffee, with or without preserves, and at any time of the day. Moving next to what may be Tartine's most famous dish; my second selection of the day was a small version of the Banana Cream Tart - a lovely amalgam of creamy banana pudding mixed with slices of whole banana resting in caramel soaked pastry shell and topped with curls of dark chocolate. ÊWhile certainly not the world's expert on banana cream pie (or banana pudding) I will simply say that this was the best I've had to date with the crust buttery and flaky (but impossible to cut with Tartine's eco-friendly knives,) the banana cream tempered in its sweetness, and the light hand whipped cream melding perfectly with the dark chocolate - a great selection from a stellar bakery...even if their cookbook remains nearly impossible to navigate in my small apartment kitchen.

ÊYes, it was good, but I wouldn't make a trip all the way down here just for that. ÊThe inside was fluffy, outside was crispy, and wasn't too sour. ÊIt was tasty, but ACME bread remains the winner when it comes to the best bread I've ever tasted in my life. Now onto what bumped up this review to 4 stars...THE BANANA CREAM PIE! Êomg, everything about this pie made it incredible! ÊThe crust was buttery and flaky...the banana cream was sweet and satisfying..the cream was so light and refreshing..and the bittersweet chocolate shavings just made it the best banana cream pie i have EVER tasted in my life!

I heard of Tartine Bakery via my food obsessed friend, but our resolve to make a trip to Tartine bakery was strengthened after a visit to the SF MOMA, where we spotted the Tartine Bread book in the museum store. It was a sign. On a side note, if you decide to venture to the area, stop by Bi-Rite Creamery, which is right down this yummy block. The BI-Rite Market is also bustling and cute, with a decent selection of chocolate! We approached from Bi-Rite Creamery towards the corner surrounded with rubble and orange cones, yet sandwiched between the building and orange cones were cute round tables with people sitting in them, eating pastries and drinking soup. There were dogs sitting under tables and books being read. Aha, it's a cafe or bakery! So we venture forth and our instincts have drawn us to the right destination - the famous Tartine Bakery. We pick our way past the rubble, and we are greeted on the left by a lovely row of pastries. Pie, tarts, macaroons. Further along are the bread - oh the bread! Morning bun, pumpkin bread, croissants! The service was great, and the pastries did not disappoint. The pumpkin bread was a bit oily, but the ham and cheese croissant was scrumptious. My friend had the morning bun, which, after tasting a bit, I can honestly say it was delicious. We walk out, and we're rewarded with a peek into their kitchen. Along the window we see cheese graters of all sizes and whisks ranging from the size of a watermelon to that of a tablespoon. If you see construction going on, don't hesitate to go in. It's well worth it. It's a little pricey, but still, I'm someone who will spend money on food.

Yes fellow Yelpers -- this place really is all it's hyped up to be. There's always a line out the door to get these delicious treats in your posession -- so you know it's gotta be good! I don't get to eat Tartine very often, but when I do, it's like a little slice of heaven. My boss came into work the other day and brought in a pretty little white box and a cute little sticker on it that read "Tartine Bakery". That's how I knew it was going to be a good day. But it was just an ordinary box from Tartine Bakery. Oh no -- inside this box was...FRESH Tartine Barkey. Right of the oven! The morning bun was still warm and was so sinfully delicious. And next to that we had a ham and cheese croissant -- my goodness. Now THAT is a one tasty savory pastry. And let's not forget my good friend, the almost croissant. Yum, yum, and yum.

I'm not going to lie, waiting out in the San Francisco cold with the smell of freshly baked bread and other goodies was torturous. The perfect-looking pastries sitting in the glass case seemed to be mocking us the whole time. There were so many things that we wanted to try--everything looked incredibly rich and tasty. The lemon tart and chocolate eclairs were amazing, but the ham quiche was just okay. They serve some pretty good coffee too. With so many people coming and going, seating is crowded (especially the table by the door). This isn't the kind of leisurely breakfast place/bakery that you can come to and relax, but the pastries are pretty damn good.

Everyone has reviewed this place, it's pretty damn good. ÊEveryone knows it. ÊBut it isn't PERFECT! The cookies - DELICIOUS Eclairs - DELICIOUS Croissants - DELICIOUS Sandwiches - MOSTLY DELICIOUS Croque Monsieur - Not really that good. ÊThis is one of my favorite French dishes, and this is really not how it should be made. ÊNot recommended. ÊAt all.

absolutely hands down the best ham/cheese croissant! Oohh mmm Geee Êit's so good! it's flakey and buttery, and then you indulge on the savory part of the ham/cheese. From the first bite to the last was either a "hhmmmm" or "yummm". the place fills up fast, so get it to go and enjoy your yummy treat at dolores park. i also had the morning bun and the croque monsieur which were good, but i can't stop thinking about the ham/cheese croissant!

Parking is crazy. Lines are always long. Food is a little expensive. So why do I like it so much here? I'm a sucker for baked goods, especially good ones! I visited the bakery around 11AM on a Sunday & had to wait for about 30 mins. By the time I reached the front of the line, I was greeted with a heavenly case of beautiful baked goods. I decided on the almond croissant ($3.95) & the croque monsieur with ham ($9.75), while the bf had the buttermilk scone ($3.75), Ham & Cheese croissant ($4.95), & some macaroons ($0.75 ea). Suddenly, we had a carbolicious, sugary, high fat feast on our hands. I really liked how the pastries were all very rich & substantial, not just tons of sugar & cheap dough tossed together. The bread on my open-faced croque monsieur was so thick & toasted to crunchy perfection. The croissants were both very good, how do they get it so crispy, flakey, buttery, & soft like that? Magic I tell you! And everything else was really nice as well. I also love how you can watch the chefs baking through the window while you wait in line. That's where the magic happens! So if you feel like treating yourself, set some time aside to grab a high quality pastry or two at Tartine!

A Sunday morning breakfast in the city is always a special thing, especially when it entails a slice of vegan carrot cake breakfast bread from Tartine. Very delicious baked sweets that range from giant chocolate chip cookies, to croissants, to walnut fudge brownies. The staff was a little pushy and they opened 15 minutes late, despite having a line of people 30 feet long. It can get cramped inside so take your delectable sugary sweets to the nearby Dolores Park for a picnic. Tasty place worth checking out.

Not a hater but grossly over-rated. Snobby service & obnoxious line for a $14 goat cheese sandwich on some "special bread" is not my idea of a great time. I came here out of necessity for a work related reason today, and I had a cup of bread pudding with fresh fruit for $3.50. It was interesting, pretty good. Could've been better with some kind of cream/ice cream on top. Seemed like a better value than the $4.75 chocolate croissant... other than that I haven't been here in years. Let people knock themselves out waiting in lines for hours, not my problem. But it is a problem when people act absolutely bored to be helping you out. I get that they're not exactly hurting for business so they can afford to be whatever, but please, get over yourself. I work at a coffee shop too and we are welcoming. And fyi, anyone who thinks this is authentic french is mistaken. Go to Bonjour Patisserie (formerly Patisserie Phillipe) on Townsend Street if you want real frenchie shit. Waaaaay better.

I really can't believe that I haven't reviewed this place yet! If you want flaky, buttery, melt in your mouth croissants and morning buns... this is your place.

Yes, the food is amazing (especially the bread), but I think Tartine is a little over-hyped. Everything is very expensive, and the line is ridiculous.

Maybe I came too late... maybe all the good pastries were gone... but I ordered the Tres Leche Cake, while my friends ordered the bread pudding and the morning bun. The Tres Leche Cake was the best out of the three, but it was very very sweet. I couldn't get myself to finish all of it. It wasn't delicious enough for me to continue adding to the sweetness overload in my mouth. The bread pudding was really whatever to me, but my roommate liked it. The morning bun was also nothing special. Disappointed... but I'm willing to give this place another try.

I can't stand trendy places and yet find myself lurking closer and closer to the dark side each day I spend in the city. Such was the case when I visited Tartine one Saturday night. I know I know why go at night when you can get their tres tres fresh morning buns in the morn right? Well because I live in NOT SF and sleep in on weekends. Anyway. The BF and I ventured here because the devil told us to go. He was chillin' at my house the night before and we kind of hit it off so we went along with his Saturday plans. How tricksy he was though because he convinced us to drive rather than BART to the mission and led us to believe we wouldn't find parking, and only at the moment of shear and utter defeat allowed us a spot. He then led us to a long butt-hole of a long line to a shanty-butt-hole corner bakery called Tartine (though you wouldn't know it lest you had fly eyes). You think he'd lead us to the front at least but alas the devil is a gentleman. We were so scared by the menu since it offered devil's food cake--kryptonite for devils. So we stayed away from that and ordered some blinged out treats: 1 croissant 1 frangipane tart 1 chocolate eclair 1 mex wedding cookie (and a surprise to me because the girl got my order wrong: 1 walnut choco cookie) Total bill: $18. Can I make any of these myself and want to eat it? Probs not. Will I make it now that I've had it? Probs not. The chocolate eclair was the one thing I really wanted since I had it before (I'm a cheater I've been to Tartine times before) along with the croissant (tres tres good) since its a patisserie and croissants are like pastry crack. I sampled other goods just for the heck of it. Frangipane was meh, wedding cookie was overcooked/not melty-in-my-mouthy, and the walnut choco cookie, well, I can definitely make that myself (just gimme some dutch-processed cocoa) so I gave it away to the devil. He burned with joy eating it. But the croissant MMMMMMMMM. The eclair OHHHYEAHHHH. Out of dumb luck my BF just happens to enjoy the caramelized crust of the croissant while I enjoy the succulent inner layers. Can you say match made in not(heaven)?! Anyway, the perfect way to eat a croissant is to peel off layers at a time. Don't be a dummy and bite into it like regular bread. It just tastes better when you tear at it naturally keeping the tender bread fibers in tact. The eclair was scrumptious. It is an unpopular option that this yelp review just made popular (just kidding, please trend-setters stay away). It's friggin amazing and vanilla-bean-ified. We left the dark side shortly after and ate outside since we found a table open with supreme access to fumes of gas from passing cars/motorcycles and onlooking strangers. The devil tried to make a pass at the waitress cleaning up the tables. What a dummy. Till next time, dark side, till next time. I'll get you a $9.50 quiche next time too. Tres tres what?

The last time I visited, I had their bread pudding (which I recommend), morning buns, and a few other treats. The quality was good, and they weren't too expensive. I feel like a typical Asian bakery (at least the ones in LA) can top this at half the price. However, for a non-Asian bakery, this was pretty good. The line was a bit long, and it's very difficult to find seating.

3000+ people reviewing can't be wrong, right? Nor can the hordes of them lining up down the street to get into the building. Really, you can't go wrong ordering from the delectable baking case, but here are a few of my favorites. I'm not a big croissant fan, but the crunchy, buttery delectable nature of Tartine's almond croissants has me practically foaming at the mouth. The frangipane cream makes the combination unbeatable. Bread pudding. Always features seasonal fruit, this bread pudding eats more like a custard than it does like a cake. If you're feeling bold, take it home (or down the street to Bi-Rite) and put a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. Lemon tart. It's amazingly "fresh." One might think I might mean this in the sense of fresh versus stale, but I actually mean, fresh like a piece of fruit you just got off the vine. (I certainly wish all quantities of butter left me feeling that refreshed.) Also to note is that you can keep this tart in the refrigerator for quite some time and the crust remains crunchy. I don't know how they do it but it's pretty freaking amazing. Something to be added is the incredible nature of the Tartine cookbook. I spend so much time talking about this place that a friend of mine gifted me the publication a couple of years ago. Every recipe is a TON of work (like, will take you and a friend an entire day) but the results are stupendous. The Frangipane Tart in particular has been a big hit.

DEFINITELY NOT OVERRATED. At least for some items at least. WHICH MEANS LINES. BOOOOO. +Chocolate eclair FREAKING GOOD. Disappeared so fast that I was more sad than glad. Glad for the minute I got to eat it. Sad for the long time after I wished I had more of them to eat. :( +Croissant Maybe I was just hungry for dinner, but this was GREAT. Crispy on the outside, fluffy layers on the inside. Buttery and delicious. Mexican Wedding Cookie was a giant MEH and the almond creation thing (that I don't remember the name of) was a borderline 3/4 star. But I don't care. That chocolate eclair will live on in my mind foreeeeeeverrr.

This place is a victim of "too much of a good thing." Yes, they have probably the best pastries and sandwiches money can buy, however this has created long lines for customers and a superiority complex among the staff.

You know when you have high expectations of a place because of its reputation and it turns out to be a major letdown? Tartine is that place. I think Tartine's ego has grown a bit too big for its britches. Their indifferent service shows it. No "hello". No welcoming smile. No "how can I help you". No "thanks for coming". Just a silent blank bored unwelcoming stare waiting for you to relay your order. Nice. That's just how I like my customer service. NOT. Tartine has also taught me that a long line doesn't mean shit. I guess nothing draws a crowd like a crowd. And who started the rumor that their morning buns were all that? Newsflash: They're not. Don't waste you're $3.75 on a dull orange-essence-y sugar-coated lead-weight dough blob. (Bovine Bakery takes the cake on morning buns. You might want to try crossing a bridge every now and then if you City folks are inclined to do so.) Also, their double pain au chocolat is nothing out of the norm. Tartine does not live up to the hype, and they did not have me at "hello" (or in their case, "silent blank bored unwelcoming stare waiting for you to relay your order").

First, this place is best for BREAKFAST! (not for brunch/lunch, hence the name, Tartine BAKERY) If you are pastry lover, this is a MUST GO in SF. I had no qualms gorging my heart out here, and I probably had enough carbs to earn myself a little muffin-top or a set of love-handles. Overall, this place was SO CLOSE TO BEING PERFECT...it's just so popular that the line was long and the place was too crowded! Even though I wanted to enjoy a nice, easy-going Sunday breakfast, I'd have to yell to have a conversation. People would stand around you like hawks waiting for you to leave the table, (it is self-seating). The place had more of a "bar" feel than an actual sit-down, casual breakfast. Ambiance: 2/5...bleh. However, I really can't complain about their food. Morning bun: 5/5!!! The perfect combination of crispy and flaky on the outside and soft and moist on the inside. I could definitely see why all the other yelpers have chosen this as their top pick. Mushroom quiche: 2/5. After tasting the morning bun, the quiche was a disappointment. Objectively, it's still a 3/5, but relative to the morning bun, it failed. I had always thought quiches were supposed to be somewhat warm, but WARNING, quiches at the Tartine Bakery are all served at room temperature. The crust was unfortunately thick, dense, and dry. I would stay away from eating the cardboard crust. Banana Creme tart: 4/5. Just by the smell of it, you'd instantly get sucked into eating it. The thinly shaved cocoa that tops it just melts in your mouth!! And true to its name, this dessert is filled with delicious banana and creme. The creme isn't too sweet that it's unbearable (like many desserts often are), unless you try to eat the entire thing yourself. (Yeah, yeah, my stomach felt pretty greasy and gross afterwards.) Sharing is caring, and this dessert so good, it is definitely MEANT to be shared. Presentation & display: 5/5...just by looking at their display, I wanted EVERYTHING. They do a very good job of appetizing and tempting you with fresh, delicious looking cakes. I was in pastry heaven :)

I've been to Tartine about 3 times now and that will be all folks. Maybe I ordered wrong? I should have gotten the croissants and bread pudding? Instead I tried the Banana tart, chocolate hazelnut tarte, eclair, geez what else- many of the pastries in the case... The crust and chocolate layer on the banana tart- is really HARD! ÊYour fork will need to STAB that sucker to get a chunk off! Took 2 bites of the chocolate hazelnut and it...well nothing, tossed it. Filling on the elair was bland. That was what was disappointing for me- nothing WOW-ed me.

I hate to admit it, but it took about a year after I moved into the neighboring hood to actually step into Tartine. I had heard rumors about Tartine, I had walked past it about a thousand times, a sometimes I stopped and contemplated actually walking in. But I never did... Until a friend visiting the City, who had read GOOP (oh jesus Goop) had dragged me in their because apparently it was an "IT" place to be/ I'm so glad I walked in. Tartine has the flakiest, most delicious pastries I have ever tasted, croissant that remind my of buying petit pains au chocolat before class when I lived in France; Êcroque monsieurs that blew me away.

Oh gentrified Mission, how I hate and love you! Definitely one of the best things to come out of this area in transition is this bakery. Hands down, my favorite bakery of all time. And I've been to a lot of bakeries. If I eat an almost croissant every morning with one of their giant mochas, I'd be a happy gal. I'd also probably be dying of clogged arteries but who can complain about that when you're eating yummy, buttery goodness? My favorites include the bread pudding (especially in the summer when they use seasonal fruit like berries), the quiche, the vanilla tarts, and the chocolate croissants. And their panini's are ridiculous too. I love everything about this place--the people, the food, the half a block wait just to get in. It's one of the few places that actually lived up to its reputation and that I'd be more than willing to wait for. I can't give it 5 stars though because parking is a b**** and it's hard to find a seat inside.

I spent a dreamy few days cycling through picturesque Provence - and, when I wasn't busy padding my thighs, butt and belly with petite (well, sort of) dejeuner noms and fresh, soft boulangerie goods, I was lamenting the dearth of decent patisseries in America. Then, I experienced Tartine.

I went with my sister and brother & law and my nephew. I went there because of the reviews here in Yelp. My overall experience was disappointing. there was a line, which I didn't mind. The order process was not streamlined. The blond girl with short hair that served the cakes was ok, but not paying much attention. The girl (long blond hair) was really snobby and got annoying by us wanting to divide the bill. We wanted everything separate but she said Êwith bitchy face, "you have to let me know if you want it separate" But with a mean face. So we paid together. Then, I asked for water and I was literally ignored and sent to the kitchen's glass shelve, Very confusing. We eat: Chocolate Devil Cake- My sister ate this cake and was really disappointed. She mentioned that the ones in Safeway were better. Chocolate Chip Cooke- Not even my nephew that loves cookies, wanted it. Very thin, crispy dried. Carrot Cake- My brother in law said was very dry. I ate Coconut Passion Cake- To be honest, it tasted goo but not the best cake that I have tried. In conclusion, I don't think that I would go back. Not really excited about the place.

I've been hovering between 3 and 4 stars. This is a solid bakery with a huge following and even bigger hype. ÊThe wait, prices, and service ultimately drew my solid 4 stars down to 3ish. ÊAfter adding back in some for the whole experience, I still couldn't bring myself to give this place 4 stars for all the wait and all the butter in the savory items... although this is a bakery. :] Things to try: + Coconut Passionfruit Bavarian cake with lime ($5.50/slice) + Croque with ham ($9.75) Things tried: + Banana cream tart (why is the crust so unforgiving that it required a solid knife cut and even then it was a bit too hard to eat? ÊI would have perhaps liked a croissant or puff pastry crust that was more napoleon-thin. ÊAlso, why is this just cream + fresh banana? Granted, there are lovely thin shavings of dark chocolate on top with powdered sugar... ) + Bread pudding (this was a bit mushy and not firm enough for my liking) Tips: Arrive at non-peak hours if you don't want to wait in line (i.e. after lunch or before dinner). ÊParking is a pain, but several surrounding streets always have spots. ÊGoing on a Saturday / Sunday means free all-day parking on those streets. ÊDo not expect service other than the taking of orders, rushing you through the line, and then having you wait about 15-20 minutes for your order to "warm". ÊHaving part of your party stake out seating is a positive however, if you can split up; this, saves a ton of wait time for a table. ÊAnd, there are napkins for those messy (flaky, creamy, and / or buttery) pastries --they're located above the non-disposable silverware at the coffee bar area to the right of the cash registers.

I guess I'm just not really into pastries as much as the 3000 people who reviewed this joint. I got the Banana Cream Tart and the Morning Bun. While both were good/tasty, they weren't something I'd ever crave or highly recommend to someone. I guess I'm just not the pastry kind of dude.

Don't get me wrong, I LOVE the food at Tartine. However, the people who work there can be so rude and arrogant at times. Yes, you might be a little more hip and a tad more cool than I am, but that doesn't mean you can treat me like you are annoyed by my presence. It wouldn't hurt to put a smile on your face and be grateful that customers are paying their hard earned money to eat there. Not to mention the guy with a beard and thick rimmed glasses who works there needs to wash his frickin hands. Yesterday he had enormous amounts of dirt underneath those finger nails. YUCK! ÊSame guys likes to be stingy on giving out a fair balance of fruit on top of the bread pudding. Come on man! What'sup with that? There is one person who works there. I don't know her name, but she is super sweet and friendly. She has long light hair with cat like eyes. She always gives a fair share of fruit on top of my bread pudding. While waiting in that LONG line, I pray that she is the one who helps me. So in short, Tartine, please train your staff on offering friendly customer service and make that guy wash his hands.

Same shit, different day. I keep coming back here specifically and ONLY for the food, since the customer service falls somewhere in the range of Shitty to Non-Existent. One attendant in particular is--to put it mildly--a MEGA-BITCH. She clearly hates her job and probably hates anyone that steps in the door, and does nothing but throw pastries in bags and gives 'tude. C'mon lady, you do realize where you work, right? Would it kill you to be just a little nice ? If this place weren't so damn buttery and delicious I would drop it out of my rotation much like that woman needs to get dropkicked on her ass.

I thought okay an eclair super easy... apparently not. It was burnt. I don't mean pretty dark european style it was freakin burnt. The filling was literally vanilla pudding, but they used real vanilla bean so I guess that helps justify charging $5 for the damn thing.

The morning buns live up to everything people say about it. I think they have one type of bread for all their sandwiches, a country bread, which is one of the best breads in anywhere. The sandwiches are rustic and delicious. The pastries are out of this world. Pieces are really huge though, which I guess is a good thing for most people, but kind of too hard to finish.

I don't write much reviews, but man this had to be done... I've been here more than 7 times an everytime I've had great great great food. The bread pudding has to be the best ever, but why you ask did I rate them 3 stars? The worst attitudes I have ever come across!!!! The people that work there never smile, are the snottiest, and just are generally angry. I'm sorry I'm not a hipster too, is this why I don't get an ounce of happiness or thanks out of you??? Just the service and the atmosphere is enough to lose my business, even though the food is beyond 8 stars...

What do an iPhone media event launch, a Harry Potter opening night and the Tartine Bakery have in common? People seem to line up for 'em. Whether you're not into smart-a** phones, not into hairy wizards or not into deliciously succulent, flaky, buttery items found in a patisserie, you have to admit that these attract or matter to people. What do I know, since I only know about antimatter. I have no clue what attracts people to things, but I do know that this bakery or the waft of organic produce, organic flour, sugar, and local eggs..the elements that make up pastries, cakes and tarts, are people magnet. We met here several months ago for a friend's b-day. Picture the Mission/Dolores area of San Francisco, on a weekend, a little before lunch. And you plan to have a surprise b-day brunch for about nine? Here? My friends must have elbowed, hip-checked and mud-wrestled people into submission or something, because when I got there, the queue/lineup wound around the foyer and out into the streets...my friends? They were all seated, enjoying French tarts and scones and coffee, that actually lived up to the hype. Worth the wait in line? Hell yes, since I didn't have to lineup. You can all read. You've all tasted good baked goodies before. Just read their fine menu. Just get here early (like before dawn) to find parking, and just remember two things: bread pudding and avoid the guy outside wearing nothing but tie-wraps.

Yes, the line is long. Yes, it's more expensive than your local panaderia or donut shop for a croissant. Yes, the employees are busy as hell and have to work in what is essentially a giant oven all day. ...get over it. ÊStop being a nancy. ÊJust stuff another buttery morsel into your pie hole and stop complaining. If there isn't something here that doesn't make your eyes roll back and your pants feel funny, then you must be missing some chromosomes or something.

Tartine, In the morning I get up whenever. ÊFor breakfast I munch dry Fruit Loops while padding about the small living room in my underwear. ÊI am a slow riser, and sometimes I shamefully take more time than necessary upon waking to finally be committed to stepping out of the house. ÊIt's sad but true, in that my mornings are shameful. Ê However, there is no shame in being guilty of countless mornings of waking up in a damp puddle of my own drool because thoughts of you happen to be my first penetrating thoughts of the day. ÊTypically on those days, my heart tends to skip a beat because I've subconsciously, yet somehow deliberately use your tantalizing aromas, savory richness, and polished perfection as an excuse to abandoning whatever I am doing at the moment to have a taste of you. Tartine, I'll admit at first I was a bit disappointed to seeing your doors propped ajar for so many waiting to get allupinthere. ÊBut every-time, you still somehow manage to make me feel like I am the only other person in the room when we are together. ÊYou send chills down my arm as I often find myself scraping my fork for every last spec of your painful pleasure. ÊI say painful, because a big girl such as myself; just wishes I had you to myself.. ÊBut I guess that would be too much of a good thing, and now I understand that all else doesn't matter because your love extends conditionally . ÊOn the condition that whoever is grazed by your pleasant olfactory sensations can't help by fall for you. I cannot eat another inferior confectionary mishap after this..

It's been a year and I thought I would note any changes. A year ago most customers were visitors like myself. I discovered this by talking to people at the communal table during lunch. We went twice this visit and I noticed two things. At midweek lunch the crush has turned into a more manageable flow. Along with this, everyone at the communal table was from the neighborhood both times we visited. Ê Unscientific as it is, it may suggest a small shift to a local cafe, at least during the lunch hour. Less emphasis on the sweet bakery items and more on lunch type fare. I was struck by the friendly, relaxed and open atmosphere which is sometimes lost in a trendy San Francisco eatery. We had grilled cheese sandwiches along with great Belgium beer. It was a simple and satisfying lunch served more quickly than I remember. I follow the Tartine recipe when I bake bread so that is an attraction for me but my friend enjoyed his sandwich too! Ê So the bread temple is maturing into a friendly neighborhood cafe, all to the better.

Before I begin, I saved this review for my 100th review. (the crowd goes wild.....yeah) This place will always have a special place in my heart and stomach. Why isn't this place 5 stars? Are you serious? ÊTartine and Yelp has strong significance to me because it is because of these two I discovered Yelp and Tartine. About 3 years ago I visited some family in San Francisco. They kept raving about Tartine, so I had to go on the internet and see what all the hype is all about. ÊI always like to research and find great places. Why go on a hunch when you can read reviews and see what other people are saying. That sounds like a great concept......awww yelp beat me to the punch. I'm not bitter because Yelp is the gateway to food heaven. Okay sorry I'm getting nostalgic. ÊI googled Tartine and tadaaaaa there was yelp a click away. ÊAfter reading I begged my family to take me to Tartine. (Okay I may have said TAKE ME NOW) First thing I must say is......you know you bad a** when you don't even have a big sign. ÊIts so d** good you gotta know where it is to find it. Ahaaaaa tourist can't find....wait I'm a tourist. Thank goodness I'm not driving. San Fran people know parking is always an issue, near Tartine that is an understatement. Breath relax find a parking spot because its all worth it. I walked in and the menu just looked amazing. I want this and I want that. ÊI just told my sister in law please order for us. We ordered savory and sweet. ÊI'll be honest since I didn't order I don't know what my sister in law ordered because it was all a blur. There was morning buns, bread pudding, something with ham and egg, something with chocolate, some coffee, something with fruits. ÊOkay I'm not going to go and on and on about what to order because honestly everything and I mean everything was pretty dam good. But Cy what if I had to order one thing. Well my answer to that is go find a ATM or bust out your credit card because if you can't go here on a regular basis you need to buy it all. (or at least attempt to). Let your senses be your guide and let Tartine take you to heaven. ÊYes expect a line but you need time to figure out what you want to order. And so my journey with yelp began. Thank you Tartine for guiding me to the light! Now look at me today, I have the opportunity to be part of this great experience of YELP.

The morning bun is listed as #8 on the 7x7 Big Eats list, but my faves are the Banana Cream Tarts or Tres Leches cakes. Although I don't follow the list, I agree with most of it, cause a lot of my faves are on there. I just completely disagree with the morning bun being a must try before you die. It's good, but not great. The Banana Cream Tart is one of the most popular items for a reason. Nice, flaky crust brushed with melted chocolate to prevent it from getting soggy. Yummy, creamy vanilla pastry cream and caramel. Fresh, sliced bananas topped with whipped cream and shaved chocolate. It's to die for! This bakery is just another reason why us SF'ers are absolutely spoiled! We can go and get Bi-rite down the street for their Salted Caramel (also on the 7x7 list), walk over and stand in line at Tartine's for their delicious treats.. while eating our ice cream ;)

Holy Heck! This place has a lot of reviews. I doubt I will add much then, but here goes. Came here for lunch on a Friday and the line was out the door as usual. Don't be intimidated though, these guys know what they're doing and it moves fairly quickly. I had the eclair and the Double Pain au Chocolat, which is amazing. Yes it is pricey, but worth every penny. Their seasonal tarts are so yummy and you can totally microwave it later and it tastes just as good! Parking is tough in this area, but I will be back and next time, it will be at 5pm for when they take the bread out of the oven.

Ohhhhhhhhkay. Let's talk about Tartine for a second. Let's talk about how Tartine makes all your baked goods-related dreams come true. Let's talk about how it doesn't even matter how long the line is, cuz at the end of it is always Tartine. Let's talk about how the morning bun is like sunshine and love rolled up into one perfectly crispy AND chewy carbohydrate with a hint of orange zestiness. Let's further marvel at the existence of a substance that is both perfectly crispy AND chewy, and also involves the word "zestiness." In addition to this said morning "sunshine/love" bun, I have also had the banana cream tart, the lemon tart, the almond croissant, the gougere (pronounced "googly-goo"), and the bread pudding. Everything was good. Everything. Let's talk about how you need to go to Tartine RIGHT NOW.

I tried the Croque Monsieur and a seasonal tart (chocolate hazelnut) here. ÊDidn't like it as much as I thought I would - everyone I knew gave me high reviews about Tartine, but the Croque Monsieur wasn't that spectacular and the chocolate hazelnut tart was a big drier than I would've liked. The chocolate was good though. I guess their lemon tart and the banana cream tart are the best items, since I see good Yelp reviews from people who tried those. I wish I could've tried more items here. Also, my professor brought morning buns from Tartine to class the other day, and I tried one. It was good, but it wasn't out-of-the-ordinary or anything. Still couldn't find out what the big deal is. Although I'm not very impressed with the items I tried, I'm still thinking of going back to try other things - mainly to find out what other people are so crazy about.

Wow there's already 2890 reviews. ÊI might as well put in my 2cents about the place. ÊI don't know if the place has super blown me away but I'm going to give it a solid 4 stars. Tartine received the James Beard award about 3 years ago for Outstanding Pastry Chef so by all means I really had to check this place out. I was in the neighborhood and FINALLY went last Saturday. ÊI had no idea how crazy ridiculous the line was going to be. ÊIt literally went out the door and around the corner. ÊI wasn't planning on leaving and was determined to order a bunch of stuff. So this is what I got: - coconut creme tart - tres leches - ham croissant - prosciutto & provolone panini sammich All were very good (I shared of course). ÊMy favorite out of the bunch definitely was the coconut creme tart. ÊIf you love coconut with chocolate your tastebuds will thank you. ÊIt was so fresh and coconutty. ÊThe tart part had a coating of chocolate that prevented the flour part from getting soft from the creme. ÊIt was like a barrier but an extremely yummy barrier if that makes any sense. Ê The tres leches was meh. ÊI've had better. ÊThe ham croissant was crunchy and flaky but soft inside. ÊAnd the panini sammich I ordered was surprisingly big in portions but I'm not sure if it was worth the 13.50 for prosciutto and provolone. It's worth sharing it with someone if you don't have a big appetite. ÊThe dressed arugula inside the sammich however really made all the ingredients mesh very well so it was very tasty. ÊBtw, I had to wait 20 minutes extra to wait for my hot sammich. The end result was satisfying but be prepared to wait and have patience due to the crowds. ÊI certainly would go back to try the other items. ÊNot exactly sure when is the best time of day to go due to its popularity but it's definitely worth checking out.

I tried like the plague to avoid waiting in the Tartine line. ÊI could never imagine that a bakery warranted a 45 minute wait. ÊAnd when I finally got a chance to wait around and see, it turns out I was right. ÊNot worth the wait. My wife got a morning bun which was a basic sticky rolls with a bit of citrus flavor. Decent but not world class. ÊI got a slice of lemon meringue cake - really good, but not worth the wait. Try, if you can, to get a seat outside. ÊSome terribly friendly tourists grabbed the chair away from my table while I was situating the dog. ÊIn order to avoid an international kerfuffle I let them have it and my wife and I shared the bench.

Walking into Tartine is like walking into the photos of a fancy cookbook. ÊThis place is really cute and enjoyable... if you can catch a seat. Otherwise, you have to grab your goodies to go. Ê The Trs Leches cake is more of a reinterpretation, so I wouldn't order it with preconceived ideas of how you like your Trs Leches. ÊThe bread pudding is good but not to die for... but to be politically correct, there shouldn't be any baked goodies one should die for. ÊAhh.. but yet we all live so dangerously. The prices are pretty high, but they are worthwhile if you can find a seat for decent people watching, while pretending that you are reading your book, while pretending that your conversation is enjoyable, while pretending that coffee really does take hours to finish. ÊYou know who you are!

This rating is for their morning bun. It's good, but not AMAZING. Some parts of my morning bun were pretty hard and almost to the point of being burnt. And, certainly not worth waiting in line for. I must say, though, the inside of the bun near the middle was really good. Thus, my average rating! I will come back... for the loaf of bread though. I really want to try it.

I still dream about that Lemon Tart. Came here on a whim, got what I expected and much more! It's a bit expensive for a bakery but you get what you pay for -NOM! Didn't feel like getting the much appraised Banana Cream Tart but will come back for it definitely. Instead we got the Lemon Tart and Bread Pudding. The pudding was nice and hot although it didn't look that great; but what can you expect from bread pudding? And that tart -sighhhh, so delicious I didn't want to eat it all. I felt so torn because part of me wanted to eat it and the other part wanted to save it so that I could build a shrine for it. But I figured the latter was a bit cray cray and ate it instead. YUM :) Atmosphere is really cute, but it's hard to get seats, thus -1 star. Parking is a beezy too but hey, what can you expect from that neighborhood? I NEED TO GET MY HANDS ON MORE OF THAT LEMON TART!!

I honestly don't know how anyone can get a loaf of bread here and not give this place 5 stars. I love bread, and I can't think of a loaf that even comes close to this one. This bread is a work of art. The browned crust is a crisp but slightly chewy wrapper around a beautifully airy and complex-flavored interior. Somehow it's sturdy and delicate at the same time - it doesn't collapse under the pressure of a bread knife but it's also not that dense. Jen, who generally uses bread as a butter-delivery mechanism, eats it plain. It freezes and reheats quite nicely as well. I hate waiting in lines for anything, but the bread is worth waiting for. So is the banana cream tart for anyone who is keeping track.

I understand that you're busy and there's a line but there is also a billion people working back there so come on, put a smile on! -_- Ugh. But the food and pastries there are really friggin' delicious. I hate that. I wish I could say, no, no. The service and food sucks. But no. Their bread is amazing. Their sandwiches are tasty as hell, and that banana cream tart is to die for. I would hug it until it got into a crumbly mess upon my shirt because I love it so.

I went in yesterday and stocked up on my baked goods since I haven't been in in a few months, I have been on a Tartine high since. I want to just live in their kitchen, I would be 700 lbs. but sooooo happy. Nothing bad ever comes out of the Tartine kitchen, literally. Phenomenal food, and I just can't get enough. My musts when I come in are the Shortbreads, Lemon Bar, and Croque Monsieur. But I obviously don't walk out with just those three, Grougere, Croissants, Chocolate Hazelnut Tart, Rocher, Macaroons, Mexican Wedding Cookies, Brownies are all good as well. I've tried a lot but still have so much more to try here. When I have been in before 90% of the employees have been complete a$$ holes, but yesterday I could not have asked for better customer service. Kind, helpful, sweet, and they even SMILED! Love it. The bakery is small. The line is long. The food is the best.

Not that expensive when you consider that everything is HUGE. And delicious. But the oversized portions are much more American than French, and you sacrifice refinement for value. I enjoyed the Morning Bun, a croissant-textured cinnamon roll with a faint orange taste and not too overloaded with sugar. It was extremely buttery though. Get lots of napkins! The Double Pain au Chocolat was gigantic (more than double the size of a normal one) and also very buttery. I don't want to think about how many sticks of butter I consumed with these pastries. The chocolate inside was rather meh, so I wouldn't get it again. If you're into buttery croissants, just get a plain croissant, which is also enormous here. I got the pecorino, almonds, olive oil, lemon, and sage pressed sandwich, which took 15 minutes to make. I got tired of chewing the bread, and it left my mouth really dry. The flavors were great, but it needed some meat or something to make it more substantial and less... just bread with a thin slice of cheese and the spread. I would give Tartine 3.5 stars, but I'm rounding down because it didn't quite justify the long line (15 minutes wait) and another 15 minute wait inside the crowded, touristy-feeling bakery.

Oh sweet Lemon Cream tart. You're still in my belly but I miss you already. Wow, talk about splurging on food! I met two friends here for breakfast, and I personally had never been to Tartine before, despite having passed it dozens of times on my way to Bi-Rite. SF rule: if you have to wait in line, you know it's worth it. Even if you don't know what the line is for. About 20-25 minutes in line was well worth the delicacies we got in return. Approx $40 for 3 people, here was our order: Croquet Monsieur - a HUGE crusty portion of bread with sun dried tomatoes, mushrooms and cheese melted atop. This was the only salty dish we ordered, and it seemed to be everyone's favorite. Buttermilk scone - crunchy and light, with raisins in the mix. Frangipane Croissant - Almond paste is my new favorite! The croissant is immense, with toasted almonds on top, only to reveal a rich and creamy center that melts on your tongue. Another unanimous favorite. Bread Pudding - a little more "liquidy" than I would have liked, but the strawberries added a sweet touch. Morning bun - a.k.a. glorified cinnamon bun. Lemon Cream Tart - I could have eaten 3 more. The edible pansy to finish off the look makes the tart resemble a storybook fairytale. Incredibly light, you feel forced to close your eyes to savor every bite. Chocolate Hazelnut Tart - A little dry for my taste, but the flavors are spot on. The tart fell apart quite easily, making it a bit messy.

Only been here once but do I wanna come back again! ÊBut I have yet to have time to go to SF since I live in the East Bay. Food: Things I tried? I shared a bread pudding, hazelnut torte and a yummy quiche with my friend. Let me tell you this, we got a small for the bread pudding and it was more than enough. It was warm and soft...just like how bread pudding should be! Now, for the hazelnut torte, as much as I love hazelnut, it wasn't my fav. It was good...but I def prefer the bread pudding. ÊNow, the quiche! Oh me oh my was that delicious! ÊI find myself itching to go back to SF just for it. ÊBut, as good as it is, I had to take small doses of it. I think I overate and i felt a bit disgusting cause it was kind of heavy but! def.l something one should try! Yum,yum,yum! Service: Very friendly and very fast (and of course they should be..seeing that there's a fatty line outside) While in line, there are SO many choices on the counter...I couldn't decide! I had to make quick decision for what I want because I didn't want to hold up the line! =] Ambiance: It was a bit tiny inside so therefore, not a lot of seating.My friend and I ended up sitting outside on a bench while a little dog sat underneath our bench. ÊIt was quite adorable! Note: Go early and not lunch time. I've heard from SF friends that aroud lunch time, the line goes along the walls of the building! We went around 10ish and the it was quite packed but, we made it in and got our food.

Everyone and their mama has written a review on this place, which has been a staple in my life the past 2 years. ÊI was so lucky to live a few blocks away from this treat, *and* have the option of visiting during off hours, thus successfully avoiding the long line. To be completely honest, this is the only cafe which is totally worth the wait in line. ÊI've tried so many things on their menu, and I can't complain about anything. ÊIn fact, everything is tip top! ÊI recently started a search for the best chocolate croissant in the bay area, and after frequenting and taste testing around several farmers markets, cafes, mom and pop grocery stores, Tartine wins hands down. ÊGranted, I don't know what many of their product names are (as some of them are in French), and I don't really care. ÊEverything is buttery, rich, and somehow tastes healthy. ÊOxymoron fo sho. Ê The next time you see the sun come out in the Mission (which is frequent), go here and get a choc or almond croissant, lemon tart and mocha, and head on over to Dolores Park. ÊSavor every finger licking rich indulgent bite of your delicacies, and you will come in pure delight.

Let me say it is worth the wait. I've been hearing review of tartine forever and I finally got to go myself. I went at 1:30ish in the afternoon on a Sunday expecting the worst for the infamous line that I have heard all about. It wasn't that bad at all! Only to the doorway and we got our food pretty darn fast. Yes it was later in the afternoon but still everyone always complains about the line. I got the morning bun and quiche. I've heard wonders about their bread pudding but I'm not a huge bread pudding kind of gal so we ordered differently. As I was walking up to the cash register I saw the bread pudding, just looking at it has changed my mind for next time I go. I looks so damn good I need to have a bite of that in my mouth. The morning bun was good, I wish it was warm though. Anybody know if they will warm it up for you? The quiche was also good and savory. I'm also not a huge quiche fan but I ate that up fast. The girl was really nice and said since the quiche slices were so small she would give us two. We opened the box when we sat down to eat and holy crap those pieces were not small! We also ordered just a regular coffee. I wouldn't typical review this but I was shocked. The coffee came out of those self-serve coffee containers. My experience with those is that the coffee is gross and luke warm. This coffee had a nice flavor and nice and hot still!

Yum, Tartine! I absolutely love this place. Whenever a friend comes in to town, this is where I take them. Off peak hours, of course, if you want a seat. I've had a vast array of items, but there are a few items that really stand out to me. The morning buns are delightful, sweet and filling without being too heavy. Come in the morning for these, you will not be disappointed. The frangipane tart is like an burst of almond in your mouth. If you're not a fan of almond though, you might not want to try this, as it's the predominant flavor. The almond cream filling is light without being too overwhelming, and the tart itself is love. The fruit tart is my favorite, hands down. It might be the light, flaky crust that leaves me desiring more. It might be the fresh vanilla bean cream that tastes like a slice of heaven. Or it might be the delectable fruits, crisp, light, and delicious! Either way, the fruit tart is a must! The hot pressed sandwiches are great, so fresh and delicious! But if it's your first time at Tartine and you have to make s choice between pastries or sandwiches, go for the pastries. Then get a sandwich on your subsequent visits. I really like the atmosphere of this place, but it can get very claustrophobic when you go during a busy time. Beware of the lines after lunch, before dinner, and during weekends. Service is fast, the people wo work there are very friendly. Price points are on the higher end of average, but not an exorbitant amount.

Tartine is as awesome as it gets. There's a special place in my heart for French patisseries. This one is cozy, cute, and everything I've had here has been DELICIOUS!! On my second visit to Tartine, I expanded my repertoire and I'm glad I did. Banana cream tart is still king at Tartine, but there are other good choices: Lemon cream tart: sooo beautiful and tasty. The tart is comprised of a tangy lemon custard in a shortbread crust with a quenelle of unsweetened cream and a single flower petal on top. It's balanced, not too sweet and not too tart. I would get this again. Hazelnut chocolate tart: This was good, but would probably be better if the chocolate filling was creamier. I did love how it had a generous portion of whole hazelnuts on it. They aren't skimping on ingredients! Double chocolate croissant: MMM I adore pain au chocolat. This is double the fun, with two chocolate centers in a ginormous flaky pastry. The croissant was light, flaky, and buttery, everything a croissant should be. Banana cream tart: This is a MUST at Tartine. There are tons of whole banana slices, banana cream, and whipped cream atop a flaky pastry crust. I think the crust has gotten a lot better recently! It's not as difficult to break into pieces and it tastes flakier and lighter. My favorite from Tartine! If you are in the Mission Dolores area, you must come to Tartine! It's a great experience and totally worth the wait.

I would have never though that this neighborhood bakery would have such a long line of people coming in to buy these wonderful pastries. Ê The best croissant I've ever had. ÊThe super-buttery, see every layer in the size of your open hand pastry before it disintegrates with every bite you take shows the labor of love the bakers put into their blockbuster product. ÊEverything else I had here was also excellent, including the croissant au jamon, pain de raisin, lemon bar, and chocolate tea cake. ÊI was especially impressed with the chocolate tea cake since this decadently rich pound cake looking baked good was perfectly chocolate-y and not at all sickeningly sweet or fatty. ÊI gobbled the whole slice like there was no tomorrow. The long lines coming in is a true testament to the quality of the product this neighborhood bakery offers. ÊI highly recommend stopping by here and putting your time into the line to pick up some baked goods and desserts.

Let me be clear - Tartine's baked goods are as close to perfect as you can get and still be edible objets d'art. Their lines are long (depending on the time of day you go) and their coffee is not the best, but you should do yourself a favor and eat some of their bread, pastries or snacks if you ever have the chance. Trust me, it's worth it. This review and the single star that I am bestowing upon them is entirely due to their awful counter staff, and specifically, one incredibly rude, myopic and unpleasant woman who closed the shop on the night of Wednesday May 4 2011. There is attitude, and there is poor customer service. Attitude, I have no problem with, but being intentionally obnoxious to a customer is unacceptable. Here's a reality check for you, harpy who closed up the bakery that night - you're not really doing your company or yourself any favors by insulting and alienating customers who wander in as you're closing at 7pm and ask you what a good time is to come back for bread. The correct response in that situation is to politely point out that you're closed and to suggest some good times that I can come back the next day. The incorrect response is to say something like "Oh fuck off, I'm too tired and don't have time for this, we're closed, why don't you take your stupid little dog with you and get out." I'm pointing this out because you may have missed a few classes in high school and are probably struggling to make ends meet while feeding your all consuming meth habit and spending what is left on your delightfully mismatched tattoo collection. All of these things contribute to the person you are, so I'll try to say this in the most constructive way possible: you are the most unhelpful person that I have dealt with in a restaurant in San Francisco in five years of living here. Hands down. You win the prize for fucking up any semblance of a reputation that Tartine staff had for me. The best thing you can do for Tartine, yourself and the restaurant industry in general is to get a job where you will have minimal interactions with other humans and can work on becoming a less tired, less obnoxious, and less customer-repelling kind of human being. I suggest you start today. And yes, I will be back for the bread.

There's no better indulgence than a crispy, flaky, hot-out-of-the-oven double pain au chocolate croissant from Tartine -- melts in the mouth, especially if you dunk a corner into their house made chai! ÊActually, maybe a toasted slice of their sesame bread with jam or Nutella may be a close runner up. ÊOr, one of their many other pastries or savories made to perfection. Ê I'm hooked on this place and have been on a mission to try one of everything - with no disappointments. ÊProduct quality is a major plus. ÊHere's my overall assessment: Pluses: - Items freshly baked continuously throughout the day - Excellent value ($3.50 world class baked goods) - Warm, social atmosphere - Hip, friendly staff Minuses: - Long lines & wait (during peak times)

I really wish they had food when I went here. ÊThey were out of pretty much everything I wanted to try. ÊPretty big downer after waiting in line for a while. However, what I did try was excellent. ÊTheir Lemon tart was very good with a very fresh lemon taste and light fluffy whipped cream on top. ÊTheir cheese bread ball thing was also awesome. ÊI really hope to come back here and find stuff actually available though because I was definitely disappointed with the menu being effectively halved in the early afternoon.

Disclaimer: I'm a snooty raised in France, Frenchman that has only tried the morning buns, the croissants, and the croque monsieur here. Seeing as the French national pastime is criticism -- I will commence. Unless you actually live in the city, finding parking here is close to impossible. Chances are though, if you're reading this review and plan to go to Tartine anyways -- you probably need the exercise anyways. Get your walking shoes fattie! The line is long, really long. If I were a local I probably would have known not to stop by here at noon. That was a mistake, I waited almost 45 minutes. Don't plan on eating inside if you're ordered a sandwich. The eating area, line, and waiting to grab a table area are all mixed together crowded and chaotic. I can overlook all of the above for a single star rating because in the end -- its really all about the food right? Well I'm sorry to have to say that the food I have had here is just mediocre at best. The quality here is equivalent to just about any boring, common bakery in France. The only difference is the items here are huge. Enough to fill a "healthy" American appetite. You also pay for the increase in portion size with your wallet.

I heard so much about this place and even when discussing while in line at a store, one of the locals ease dropping decided to chime in on how great it is. After that I had to visit this place. When we got there (~10am) the line was out the door and we waited about 20 minutes before it was our turn. The seating is first come first serve, so when you get inside and you are not alone, have your friend(s) grab any open space and you order for everyone. This is what we got and out thoughts Banana Cream Tart - Very good banana flavor, very flaky crust, but I didn't care for the chocolate the covered the bottom of the crust with. I don't like how it created a hard shell on top of the already crispy crust. I think that makes it harder to eat since I have to really stab the tart really hard to break through the chocolate and crust. Frangipane Croissant - The almond filling was very good, but I think I would have liked the Tart a bit more since there would be more almond flavored cream. Morning Bun - Very airy and flaky, not too sweet. Very well prepared. Croque Monsieur - This open faced sandwich with bechamel, gruyere, thyme and pepper topped with ham and asparagus was phenomenal! I would come here just for this. I wish I had not order the other stuff, so I could order another one of these. I think this place is a very solid breakfast place to go. The atmosphere is nice. Their pastries are good, but not spectacular in my opinion. Where they shine is in their usage of their baked goods. The open faced sandwich was great and I Êlost count of how many hot pressed and panini style sandwiches I was drooling over as the server walked by with them. I will be coming back here for their sandwiches and maybe a pastry, but definitely for their sandwiches.

The baked goods are good and the coffee decent, but can't help but feel the 'celebrity' status of this place has gone to it's head a little as the service was pretty poor - no one was too happy to see us and the separate coffee serving section didn't seem to make much sense given we had to wait a while for the same server to move over from the baking counter to the coffee section to finish our order. Flavours are good though (I thought the pastry in the banana cream was too hard and not delicate enough but maybe I came on a bad day). Just a shame I came away not quite feeling the same love so many others have found for this place.

this place is smart. i just don't think i'm the right person for it. brunch on a weekend usually comes with a wait, however this place was just too long for me. it gave me flashbacks of the club from the night before. the line scaffolded the front, it ran out the door and wrapped around the inside perimeter of the place. all you need is a velvet rope. brave that patience challenge and you shall be rewarded. the display case of freshly baked tasty pastries and the smell of made to order sandwiches brews in the air along with the scent of mochas and espressos. i had the pastrami sandwich. buyer beware- it packs a punch. the horse raddish spread on it wakes you up! it cleared up my stuffy nose better than any tea could. i was surprised by the first bite. it was however pretty good, i just wish i had a heads up. it was served on bread so big it was cut into thirds. i thought i was served in three halves. so i saved one to go for Dolores Park. i don't really have much of a sweet tooth but their morning bun was also delicious. soft fluffy inside, flaky outside, with enough sugar to be sweet along with your morning coffee. -back to smart- i think this place is smart because 1) the line manages itself- no need to sign up, just get in line. 2) people grab a seat after they order. they somehow timed it to work accordingly. 3) the signs they give people while waiting for their order says "thank you for bussing your table" people clean up after themselves BRILLIANT! until next time cheers!

Walking in and being greeted with the sweet bakery smell, you must exercise great restraint from ordering every thing you see (or is that just me?). I love the Double Pan au Chocolat and the Morning Buns. ÊThe Pan au Chocolat is flaky on the outside, soft & moist on the inside, and is filled with rich valrohna chocolate. It's better to come early on a weekday as it gets super busy on the weekends. ÊBut if you want to try one of their loaves of bread, come after 5pm and NOT on a Monday.

My friend raves about this bakery. ÊThe boyfriend and I stopped by this bakery for breakfast and the lines were out the door and I got lucky with parking. If you don't know what you want, don't worry because you have time to decide. While waiting in line, we could see all these pretty little sweets in the display windows. ÊI was in the mood for something savory so I decided to go with the quiche. ÊBut I seriously contemplated the morning bun - especially since the line was so long. The quiche was really good (ham and leeks) and there was a subtle hint of an herb that went really well with the ham. Another savory item we tried was the croque monsier. ÊThey are a bakery so the bread that the sandwich was on really good. ÊIt came with a pickled carrot on the side -yum! The downside - its pricey (not sure its worth it) Long lines the girl working the register doesn't care to give good customer service. Not being regulars, they told us the croque monsier will take 20 min to come out - so we asked if it was worth the wait. Her response: if you feel like waiting. ÊSo is that a yes or no? We waited. ÊIt was good. ÊI think I would have gotten a pastry while we were waiting for the sandwich if the line wasn't so long.

Teased by my first plain croissant at tartine, I decided to come back again because I wanted to try kinds of croissants. And then I found myself coming back again. And then yet again! So truth be told, Tartine, as much as I wasn't in love with your morning bun, your croissants keep me coming back. Recently, I finally was able to try their double chocolat pain. OMG! It was love at first taste. It was so buttery, huge, flaky. Hands down this is better than the first chocolate croissant I had at Bouchon. The more I come here, the more I believe their croissants are superior to Bouchon's. Yumm! I also had the Frangipane which was equally good and some Gougere. The Gougere, I thought would be heavy and thick. But it was light and similar a pastry puff. Unfilled but interior crusted with cheese and thime. It was delicious! The numerous times that I have been, I've never had trouble with the line when I go during off the busy hours. I usually go early morning or late in afternoon. For more options, I'd go early morning to get more options.

I decided to wake up early the day of my birthday, take a morning stroll in the MIssion and end up at Tartine all by myself to do some reflecting and devour what could possibly be the best morning birthday treat ever, which is the pain au chocolat. I had been waiting for some time to try this fine piece of flaky, buttery and chocolately goodness so you can only imagine all my senses being heightened.

I came here upon a friend's recommendation and although I was WAY too full from Ike's and Bi-Rite, I seemed to have had a third stomach for delicious pastries. My friends and I managed to squeeze into the bustling bakery and get in line (that eventually snaked outside the store). ÊUnfortunately, when we got there, they had run out of their most coveted morning bun. What I got, instead, was their Frangipane Tart, Lemon Cream Tart, and Citron Green Tea. Frangipane Tart: flaky + subtle almond cream = delicious. The sliced almonds on top provided just the right amount of crunch to their flaky pastry. The almond cream in the center of the pastry had the perfect consistency and complemented the bread so well. Lemon Cream Tart: let's just say that I am usually not a fan of lemon cream tart... but Tartine's was DELICIOUS. It is easily the best lemon cream tart I've ever tasted. The tartiness of their lemon cream was excellent and subtle. The zest complemented the slight sweetness of the bread really well. Great combination. Citron Tea: mildly sweetened--not my usual--but it was definitely refreshing and... honest. I don't know how else to explain it! Perfectly crisp. I love the ambiance and the natural lighting. Tartine is encased by large windows that allow for sunlight (and the sunset) to peer through. ÊThe large wooden tables give Tartine a serene, homey feel... which I love. For now, I'd give Tartine four stars even though I want to give them five. I'll have to wait to try their morning buns to decide! :)

We have just returned from France and I missed the sesame bread from Tartine. I did not find the quality in France that I had experienced 10 years ago, even with the croissants. The hot from the oven sesame bread has continued to delight us for years and its hard to imagine anyone could do better. Thank you Tartine for giving the Bay Area authentic great breads.

The last 2 times I've been, I had the most APPALLING customer service. ÊOnce I went close to closing time and when I stepped inside to ask if the cash register was still open, the chick behind the counter bellows at me: "LOOK AT THE SIGN AT THE DOOR. ÊWE'RE CLOSED." ÊShe didn't see my horrified expression because she promptly turned to continue chit-chatting with her coworker. ÊTotally uncalled for. I used to not mind the long lines or the waiting for a seat. ÊNow I'm happy to go down the street to a joint where the employees aren't antagonistic. P.S. I'm giving you 1 star because your giant chocolate croissant is so goddamn delicious and you deserve that much...

I finally had the chance to visit this establishment! I just can't believe I waited as long as I did. This is literally the crown jewel of french pastry in San Francisco!! After standing in a 30-minute line on a Friday morning (which is relatively a short wait from what I hear), I left with the following goodies: - morning bun - chocolate croissant - chocolate chip cookie - bread pudding Every single item was so damn good! The bread pudding was the only item that I've actually tasted better versions of (mine included), but the others were simply delectable -- top notch!! I highly recommend this place for ANY pastry craving and/or need you many have. I also saw full-size cakes and mini desserts in their cases, so they definitely have quite a selection! P.S. Grab the goods and head to Dolores Park just up the street to grub. The establishment is fairly tiny and uber crowded, so dining within is bound to be a frenzied experience.

WOW. I am so glad my friend took me here because I absolutely loved Tartine! We came early enough so that the line wasn't too long and we ordered the most amazing things. We had the morning bun, the bread pudding, the lemon bar, the almond lemon poppyseed cake, and muesli. I would say the best thing out of our breakfast items was the morning bun. It was warm and covered in sugar and delectable. I want one, or 7, right now. The bread pudding was yummy, the lemon bar had a brown butter crust and it was perfectly tart and sweet, the almond lemon poppyseed cake was delicious, but I wish it had a tiny bit more almond taste to it, and the muesli was ok but I've never been a fan so I can't fairly judge it. My orange juice was absolutely out of this world. It was the best fresh orange juice with the right amount of pulp and was really sweet too. It almost resembled tangerine juice, which I love even more. Overall, this place is a winner and I'm excited to go back and order everything else they have.

So, I went back this place numerous times after I wrote the review. Why? Because the food is so good and it doesn't matter how rude their staffs are at that point. Yes, they're still rude and incompetent (geez, that does sound pretty harsh, doesn't it?), but their pastries are amazing enough to compensate that. Their pastries are so good that I can give them 5 stars and completely ignore their attitude (I still do value customer's service in general though). Just as my friend said, their clair is AMAZING. The best I've ever had in the states for sure. I can say the same thing for their croissants. Lemon Cream Tart is my favorite and Banana Cream Tart is very good, too. I personally don't think they're at all expensive because the portion of their pastries are quite large. I now admit, this is probably one of the best quality pastries you can ever get in the United States. I've had amazing pastries in Paris and Tokyo, and this place definitely can complete them as San Francisco style French pastries. Tip when visiting Tartine: Avoid visiting on weekends if possible. Visit mid-morning time during the weekdays to avoid large crowds and cranky staffs, better parking during that time, too. Know what you want to order before it's your turn - again this is to avoid unpleasing experience with their cranky staffs.

Wow, can't believe this place is almost hitting 3000 reviews. Well, they're particularly know for their Banana Cream Pie and I think it's definitely one of a kind. It hits the foodgasmic level. The banana cream pie has so surprises and I'll give props if you can finish it without making a mess of yourself. Another dessert I'd recommend is the bread pudding, which is absolutely amazing! Besides the bread pudding I had at Flour in Cambridge, this is the 2nd best bread pudding I've ever had. It's super moist, except if you leave it for too long, all the juice could get messy. Overall, it definitely has the wow factor and is worth a try.

Tartine bakery is within walking distance from Dolores Park. There seems to be always a line in front of this place. They must be doing something right if people are willing to wait. The croissant was perfect! I never had one sooo good. The chocolate croissant was good, but the chocolate in it tasted weird in my opinion. The brownie was probably one of the tastiest I've ever had. I could not stop eating it until I finished the whole brownie. I thought the prices were reasonable for some of the most delicious pastries you'll ever have. The bakery is always packed, which I didn't like. good luck finding a seat! I would recommend getting take out, and having breakfast or lunch at the park.

I don't know if this place is worth the wait. The first time, we ordered in under 5 mins (a little after 1:00 PM). The second time, we waited in line for over 50 mins. I don't know if any pastry is worth an hour wait. That being said, I really liked the lemon cream tart, which was the only thing I tried. I thought it was awesome. Lemon desserts are my favorite, and I always get them when we go to $$$ restaurants, and Tartine makes a unique, light, mellow, and tasty tart.

Oh chocolate eclair, you have eluded me too many times. How many times have I been to Tartine and the eclair has been sold out. The one that my foodie mentor (it is true. I was not always the foodie I am today) has recommended to me from the start. Well on Friday, the day came at last. There sat the eclair, pristine and covered in a rich layer or chocolate. After all the hype, I thought back to all the eclairs I'd eaten in my life and thought, "Actually - what could be so great about an eclair? Maybe I should get the frangipane that I love.. or try something else that at least looks impressive." Plus this was my first time here around lunch time and the smell of savory sandwiches that hit me when I walked in was a new but surprisingly pleasant experience. I was tempted by these as well. But I gave in and decided to listen to my mentor. Chocolate eclair it was: * Chocolate eclair - Who knew an eclair - the simplest of bakery desserts, could be SO FREAKING AMAZING. The chocolate was intense, dark, smooth, and rich. The dough perfect and soft. The filling creamy and rich. Everything just came together perfectly. I did not know it was humanely possible to make an eclair of this quality. Tartine Bakery (and unnamed mentor - you know who you are): thank you.

Ê Ê Complaint: While the coffee and goodies are top-notch, I don't think that they're worth the (often) 1+ hour wait, especially when you consider that a) it'll probably be raining out, b) once you place your order, there will be no place to sit, c) if there is a place to sit, be prepared to race and deal with snide remarks, and d) don't expect to get any sympathy from the staff because they're not too friendly.

Yes, there will probably be a line you will have to stand in when you get there. Fear not, it moves quickly, and at Tartine, incredibly good things come to those who wait. The vegetarian croque monsieur I had today was wonderful. I split it with my friend and half was the perfect size. Almost $10 for an open faced sandwich is a little high, but a) it is the city and b) the ingredients are honest which makes for a more expensive item. Seating is tricky and somewhat uncomfortable, but hell I ate standing up and it didn't change the lovely soft-cheesy croque monsieur one bit. The crust of the bread was crisp with a great chew; it's inner part soft and warm... simply perfect. It's pricey, and you may have to stand (heaven forbid), but the quality of the food, and the flavor, is worth the extra cost.

Love the freshly baked bread, whole reason why we placed an order! We got 2 half loafs. Walnut and country loaf! For both loafs it was around $9. Yes more expensive then bread you can buy at the store but the bread is made from local organic products. We picked our order up right as they were bringing it out of the oven! Read all the hype about this place and am a believer! This is not the type of place to spontaneously stop in and pick up bread. When we went to go pick it up there was a line out the door. If you order ahead of time you can bypass the line. Since we Êwere coming from Anaheim, I wanted to make sure that we wouldn't waste our time waiting in line so I ordered ahead. Their website includes very specific instructions about how to order. You must place your order 3 days in advanced, must call in to speak with a manager, get confirmation of your order and pay in advance. But saves you the time when you get into the city and check out all the sites (if you are a tourist). We decided to pair our bread with some goat cheese from Cowgirl Creamery! Best pairing EVER!! Must give it a try. We didn't get a chance to check out the dessert or food from Tartine! Maybe next time

ÊFeeling a little bit full from the donut I just ate, I let my friend Kevin do all the ordering while I just ordered a chocolate croissant.

ÊSo, we find a table outside with a few rude and unsanitary occupants....pigeons! ÊMy friend shoo-ed them away from the table, pulled up a couple chairs, and we were finally able to indulge. I was a bit annoyed that it was super busy inside that we couldn't find a table and then even more annoyed that we had to sit outside with these overly aggressive pigeons, but all those feelings were swept under the table as soon as I took a bite out of my chocolate croissant. ÊButtery, flaky, warm pastry dough filled with dispersed globs of rich, bittersweet chocolate. ÊI then tried Kevin's banana creme tart, which in all my life, never liked banana creme, but from that moment on, I became a fan. ÊLastly, I forked a piece of the croque monsieur and felt like I've opened the gates of heaven. ÊMy taste buds and I were in a state of bliss. ÊI loved everything I tried.

What I ate: Banana cream tart Visit date: June 7, 2011 First time? Yes and would definitely go again! The banana cream tart was beautiful and delicious. The crust was thick and flaky, inlaid with a thin chocolate layer, followed by caramel that flowed out with each spoonful. Drooling yet? There's more. The cream is so light and not too sweet. The bananas -- fresh, sweet, and cool. As if it couldn't get any better, they serve their banana cream with hardy pieces of chocolate shavings. Mmm... My friend had the chocolate hazelnut tart. I'm not a big fan of orange in my chocolate, but Tartine did a good job of it and I actually liked this dessert. I look forward to trying their savory items.

I stayed in SF with a friend and she was so adamant that I try the croissants from Tartine that she walked 15 minutes to the bakery, waited an hour for the goods, and walked another 15 minutes back to her apartment, just so I could try Tartine's famous pastries. She's an awesome friend. Verdict: In my friend's words, "The croissants are to die for". The croissants are seriously the best, buttery, flaky croissants I have ever consumed.

Delicious bread. Staff with big attitude. Yes, the bread is delicious. It's expensive but you'll be hard pressed to find much better loaves of sourdough bread short of baking it by yourself. And their quality is consistent, just as the 30 minutes queueing ritual from 4:30 to 5 pm to get your hands on one of these tasty loaves. Alas, some of their staff could well do with some attitude adjustment. We queued up, waited for our turn, just to be told that we couldn't order the bread since they were processing earlier orders (mind you, it was 4:55pm) and had no clue whether there was enough bread left. The random hipster of the day refused to take an order and told me to check back every five minutes and claimed that 'he was doing me a favor' rather than asking me to queue up again until it was my turn again to get some bread ... Fortunately another employee had some more good sense and when checking back 5 minutes later she happily took my order and I got the loaves once they were ready. Overall, great bread, overpriced pastries, and staff that should probably remember that they aren't handing out favors for which the customers need to be grateful but are actually selling things. ÊOne star less for that.

Tartine came up at least 5 times in the last month in conversations. 4 of those 5 have to do with croissants, where I passionately argued that no one should be able to charge $4.00 for a croissant. The best croissants in NYC are about $3. The croissants fresh from patisseries in Parisien streets cost less than $3 in Euro equivalence. So Tartine has no right to be the most expensive croissant in the world - no matter how flakey, buttery, light, and wonderfully delicious. I stand by this! Which is why I will always scowl at the price tag while ordering one (or two, or more). And then I'll proceed straight to completely losing myself in its soft, creamy, and heavenly creaminess.

I don't particularly enjoy going to Tartine for brunch per se, but I think I'd do anything for one of their banana cream tarts. So. GOOD. Being the gluttons that we are, my boyfriend and I started off brunch with dessert first. He had the banana cream and I had the lemon cream tart. Needless to say, I forced him to share with me. Too good to resist. I don't know if it's because we started at such a high point for our meal, but the croque monsieurs that came afterwards were a bit underwhelming. A tad too greasy and therefore too heavy after inhaling dessert. I'd definitely go to Tartine again...but probably just for the bakery goods...and maybe a stop to bi-rite afterwards!

It's been 5 months since I've last written a review... Damn, I've got a lot of catching up to do. I came here yesterday with Mr. Face for one of our first stops of our SF trip on his recommendation. We luckily found some street parking fairly quickly across the street. I was really surprised about how packed it was because I've never been to Tartine, but I'm glad we stopped there. When I was able to take a look at the display case, some of the items looked really good, while the others... so so. I instantly decided that I was going to have something with lemon, and went with the lemon cream tart with a masala chai latte. Sir Face got the gougere with a latte. Found a table with no trouble at all. We were very impressed with our pastry items. The gougere was excellent, and the lemon cream tart was almost perfect. I think that if the butter was a little more prominent in the crust, I would have enjoyed it more. the texture of the lemon curd was quite different; with the cream, it reminded me of the texture of laughing cow cheese. The dollop of whip tasted just right, and the ripe raspberry was like the perfect accompaniment to the tart - too bad we only had one =( As for my latte, I think it was super light.... More like steamed milk with a hint of chai. Had me wishing that I had gotten a soy vanilla latte instead. Man, I could really go for another lemon cream tart... I'm not sure if I can actually say it's worth the $6, but Mr. Face paid so I guess I can't complain haha. I would say my rating is mainly because of that...

This review is based on four visits. Despite the roaring hype, I found the pastries here to be unsatisfactory. ÊThe cakes, including the devil's food and tres leches, have textures that underwhelm; the devil's food cake was dense and dry, while the tres leches was too soggy. ÊThe scones were disappointingly hard and parched; I was hoping for a more traditional refinement seen in European scones. Tartine shines, however, when it comes to their bread and perfectly textured and proofed croissants, which seem to trump even Bouchon. ÊTheir baguettes have a perfect golden crust which easily breaks away to reveal a soft pillowy center. ÊThe croissants here, though very large, remind me of my time in Paris: the crust flakes and the folded layers form a beautiful concentric pattern. The service here is no-nonsense: quick and efficient. Like most busy spots, you should know what you want when it is your turn to order. ÊThus, I recommend browsing the showcase ahead of time. ÊEat the pastries here if you must, but don't leave without taking home a couple loaves of bread.

When I come to SF, I have a strict don't eat at the same place twice policy. ÊThere are so many great places, and new ones opening up every day. ÊHowever, Tartine is one place I can't live without. ÊGet there early on the weekend so you have plenty of delicious items to choose from (and so you don't have to wait forever in the line, although it is worth it). ÊSeating can also get tough so it's best to visit with only a good friend or two. Ê Now on to the reason why I can't live without this place. ÊBaked goods. ÊEverything I have tried has been delicious, but their bread pudding and croque monsieur stand out as some of the tastiest items I've ever had. ÊTheir bread pudding with whatever seasonal fruit they have is so moist and flavorful and the croque monsieur is a nice savory contrast to the meal. ÊGiant lattes served in a white ceramic bowl adorned with foamy art make the perfect accompaniment for all their delicious treats. ÊIt's hard not to be a glutton when I come here.

Tartine Bakery is one of those bakeries that make you feel like you're in one of those perfect towns from the movies. It just looks old school and everything around you makes you happy there. I had the lemon tart and the banana cream tart. Both were just absolutely delicious. Mouth watering. I'm craving them as I write right now. The lemon tart was perfectly tangy. Crust wasn't too thick or thin and it balanced the tanginess so well. Pricey for what you get though. It was about $6 or $6.50 for that. This is the one that did it for me. The amazing banana cream tart. It looked elegant and tasted even better. The whipped cream on top was light. Bananas were fresh and thick. Banana ream was flavorful. Crust was flaky. All normal for a banana cream pie right? This was different. It had caramel on the bottom of the crust and had a hardened layer of dark chocolate. That really amazed me. Foodgasm in my mouth. For the size, I think almost $7 is a bit high, but you're paying for the good ingredients. I'd love to come here again, but might have to wait till I generate more money in my wallet. This place is a must if you're in the area and want to drop some money for good pastries. Still need to try the morning bun and fresh loaf whenever I have the chance.

Crazy line even at 9:30am on a friday. However, don't be intimidated by it at all. They've got it down!! We only waited for about 10 minutes. I don't like sweet for breakfast, so I looked at the quiche options, and it was super!! I also enjoyed a latte from the full service coffee bar that serves Four Barrel. I'd go back later in the day for something sweet - like one of the beautiful cakes. Or the buns...something. Because, they got it figured out here. And I am sure the hearth breads are the best.

Everyone mentioned how much they loved the bread pudding here so I decided to give it a whirl. I was a bit disappointed at their bread pudding as it was all crumpled up and smashed into pieces. Not much of a bread pudding but perhaps maybe that's how they make the bread pudding out here in San Francisco. I still love Chicago's bread pudding.

How wonderful is Tartine? So so wonderful that even the menu itself has a delicious, lyrical quality: Double pain au chocolat Pain au jambon Frangipane tart with seasonal fruit Bottomless FourBarrel coffee A steaming bowl of cafe au lait, another of muesli Fluffy brioche bread pudding with warm sugared peaches Perhaps it's hypocritical of me to excuse my distaste of glorified foreign menus (ie: it's not a haricot vert, it's a green bean) but in Tartine's case, it really isn't a chocolate croissant- it's a "pain au chocolat." It's not a ham & cheese croissant- it's a "pain au jambon." Thus ends my grail-like search for the best croissant outside France-- and I am no Francophile; the croissants were just that good. But so are the ones at Tartine. In fact, they're basically one and the same, except that Tartine's flaky, buttery, velvety-rich wonders are also quintessentially American... in that they're about as big as your face. (And you will appreciate this. And you will order extras.) So to avoid seeming like a fatass in front of the hoards of people waiting outside in line (as wafts of heady, bready fragrance waft torturously from the kitchen) bring a few friends with whom you can guiltlessly order extra pastries to share as you wolf down your first frisbee-sized pastry. :) Bottom Line: 14 hours after devouring my first Tartine pastry (and 2 hours after polishing off my leftover frangipane tart) I was back in Berkeley, seriously considering a drive back to SF so that I could park my car in front of the kitchen and wait 'til sunrise promised a new batch of freshly-baked croissants.

I will start out with the good and when I say good I mean it. ÊOut of this world bread pudding and the bread of the day is heavenly if you get it still warm out of the oven ( it had better be for almost nine dollars a loaf) I always like lots of outside seating, too bad it's such a dingy area with far too many trendier than thou hipsters. ÊBut that is through no fault of Tartine. ÊI was a native of almost 50 years and finally had to bail as the Mission became too cool for me. ÊIn my eyes if you run counter to the norm you are an individual and that is pretty cool in my book. ÊMasses covered in body art and skinny jeans has become a uniform. ÊPeople should try being original and I don't mean by getting some ironic tat on your lower back, but I digress. ÊThe minuses have me looking elsewhere for an optimal cafe/ bakery experience like say, Rustic Bakery or La Boulange in the North Bay or Acme in the East Bay. First of all Tartines' prices are ridiculous, just read these reviews management, and a slight adjustment is all that it would take. ÊA four dollar half-assed Cap was a waste and if you are gonna charge that much make sure your barista knows what the hell she is doing. ÊI had one with the lamest foam I have experienced outside of Seattles Own ( to be expected at a bookstore chain and for $2.50) and the coffee that I've had has been unsatisfactory to say the least (bring your own from any of a bunch in the vicinity and get quality at half the price). ÊThe open-faced sandwiches looked delightful, a work of art even, but for those prices you may want to frame one and hang it on your wall. ÊThe fact is they have all the trendy, exotic, unheard-of natural organic ingredients that I applaud, minus the Niman Ranch DEAD PIG but I have had sandwiches with more taste at ultra untrendy Mays or even at Safeway (horrors!!) and I wasn't stuffed to the gills with $13 worth of bread. ÊAlso their lemon tart needs an infusion of the essence of lemon as my mother in law insisted on getting one for a recent party and it was truly uninspiring. ÊApparently citrus is not their specialty. ÊRegardless I have had a quite a few items on the menu having gone with groups and have come away pretty unimpressed. ÊThe fact that it is usually too crowded and I must trek up to Dog Crap Park makes the Tartine experience that much more unappealing. So in conclusion while I cannot dismiss Tartine entirely I would suggest that you move to a nicer spot, like the Outer Richmond or out of SF for that matter, lower your prices so that people who actually scrutinize their purchases will patronize your establishment (everyone in SF isn't a young urban idiot with little more to worry about than rent and what new place of the moment to get sucked into, and skinny jeans and yoga pants of course). ÊFind a few counter people who dropped out of Peets University and who don't take themselves too seriously, remember you guys are selling fancified donuts so you aren't all that. ÊOtherwise just be happy that you aren't in the North or East Bay where there are some nice alternatives and they aren't out to gouge you for every crumb you have. PEACE. PS ÊVeggy Yelpies, truly mad props should be reserved for restaurants that stick true to the ideals of vegetarianism. ÊA dead animal is a dead animal no matter if they are "free range", "grass fed" or forced to live their whole life pumped with hormones, force fed and living in their own waste. ÊJust sayin, I hope you didn't choke on your five dollar croissant.

There is a horrible quality in me when it comes to food: If i see a restaurant with a line out the door, the only thing that I can think about is joining that line asap. Why do we do this? Its easy to assume that because it has a line, that it MUST be worth waiting for... and so we join the line.... and then someone else comes along, sees the same thing and also joins the line. Simple mind games, but oh so effective. This is how Tartine works. Based on the 3000+ reviews, you can already tell its kind of a SF landmark, but.. is it worth the buzz? I say yes, but only partially. Don't get me wrong, the smell of butter and the size of the pastries make me end any diet in a heartbeat, but its not the end of the world if you don't get to come here, really. Unless you come here for the staff. Yes they are hot, everyone knows it. Damn you Tartine, your eye-candy strategy is freaking smart. Might as well look at something pretty while you wait in line, right? ;) After a long (but somewhat speedy line), we ordered the double pain au chocolat, spicy turkey sandwich, chai latte and cappuccino. The best item was definitely the pain au chocolate: giant, extremely flaky, warm and drowning in bittersweet chocolate filling. Oh calories, you taste soooo good. The spicy turkey (not actually spicy, btw) comes with turkey, provolone and broccoli rabe pesto on a toasted brioche bread. Helpful tip, tell them to switch the provolone cheese for GOAT and your sandwich will taste drastically tastier. The sandwich ($12) Êis cut into 3 large pieces which is perfect to share (if you're not an overzealous eater like me) and it comes with 2 small carrots that have been marinating in a spicy vinegar. I know the carrots are just a garnish, but seriously, it was the best thing on that menu. Not a 5 star experience mostly due to the fact that we waited over 30mins for our sandwiches and that my chai latte lacked creaminess, spice and overall flavor. For the prices at that store, I don't think they should have the "bus your own table approach" but since they constantly have a line out the door, I don't think they care. Definitely worth coming, but stick to baked goods and pastries for a speedy and delicious trip that is worth your queuing time.

For pure excellence of execution in the category of baked goods, Tartine is off the charts. ÊIt's astonishing that it took me so long to get here given it is less than 2 miles from home, and I'm never more than 2 minutes from craving desserts. Ê I went two consecutive days to maximize the number of different items I tried, and still found myself seriously compromised. ÊThe exquisite Tres Leches Cake was the runaway overall winner - moist, rich, abundantly flavorful, and devilishly decadent. ÊWhenever you want to momentarily suspend all dietary concerns, I can imagine no better indulgence. Not everything at Tartine is a-ok. ÊThe staff is, by-and-large, indifferent, aloof and impatient. ÊThere's no attempt made to keep the seating area organized or turned over efficiently, and the curious table-signs instruct patrons to clean up after themselves. ÊFor such a small place, having a roving staff person policing the handful of tables wouldn't be a heavy lift, and the tubs of used dishes are hidden behind the line. A major upside of Tartine is the excellent live music performed every other Thursday night from 6 to 8 pm by the local band Gaucho (http://www.myspace.com/gÉ), a "gypsy jazz" quartet (at least here, in the rather small space) with smooth, mellow melodies and enough of a friendly disposition to (almost) make up for the cranky staff.

I went today to get many tarts and pastries but the two I am going to have to review are the 1) Banana creme tart 2) Fresh fruit tart. Fresh Fruit tart; 3 stars I thought the crust was good. Easy to eat but still crunchy. The creme went well with the crust, not too sweet and not too overwhelming but smooth and went down nice. However, for the price I paid for the tart, I was hoping to have sweeter fruits on it. It was sooo sour that it was hard to eat, even with the creme. I was a bit disappointed. Banana Creme Tart: 4 stars I can't say it's the best 'Banana creme' tart/pie I've ever had, but the extremely thin chocolate flakes that melted to your touch was amazing! The chocolate layer inside the tart evened out the sweetness of the banana and creme. I loved that! However, the crust was so hard it broke my plastic fork. I had to use real silverware and I literally had to stab at it to get it to break. After awhile I gave up, I threw it against the table and it was still in one piece. My brother however came by and ate it like a cookie after I had finished all the filling. If the crust hadn't been so hard, this would've been a 5 star. Overall I give the atmosphere, price, and quality of the good a 4 stars. I definitely would recommend my friends to come and try it at least once :)

I LOVE their baked goods, whih are among the best I've had at a bakery in the US, but I hate their insanely high prices and rude, oblivious, patronizing service. Just because hipsters look cool doesn't mean they'll be good employees. Don't bother to ask the typical counterstaff here for anything like ingredients or math beyond making change, badly, because they'll make you feel like an idiot when they clearly don't know the most basic details about their products. I think I know more than most of them do by this point.

Don't turn around... the line is worth the wait! Tartine is one of my favorite places in San Francisco and I was lucky enough to live a J line ride away from it for a year. You can't go wrong here. Everything is so amazing that I always find it hard to choose. My absolute favorite thing is the ham and cheese croissant; the ham and cheese is baked inside of a super flaky and moist croissant. Next on my list of favorites would be their quiche and the croque monsieur. They also make amazing lattes and have fresh squeezed juices. Tables go quickly but If you are able to score an outside table do it. I always say that a nice day in SF is better than a gorgeous day anywhere else. Sitting outside of Tartine is the perfect place to experience that.

There is good reason why this bakery is rated so highly by so many. We tried several different treats: their famous pain chocolate, chocolate clairs, and a black currant and almond tart (I forget the exact name!). We also had three different pressed grill sandwiches: the tapenade and mozzarella, the pastrami, and the ham and cheese. The treats were great and the chocolate dark and real. The sandwiches had perfect bread, crisped and moist at the same time. How can a crust be so right? The beauty thing is, if you are getting the goodies for take-out, there is a small organic grocery down the street to fill out the meal with fresh fruit, drinks, etc. AND, the bakery uses all recycled packaging for each well packaged item. Yeah!

I ate at Tartine Bakery while visiting San Francisco. We were visiting a friend in the Mission area and one of my buddy's suggested we try Tartine Bakery. We had just finished eating brunch, but that has never stopped me before. I am always down for good food no matter how stuffed I am. When we arrived there was a decent size line. It took about 15 minutes to get to the counter. But it was worth the wait. The pastries look so delicious. We ended up ordering a coconut cream tart, a lemon cream tart, and a Prosciutto and Provolone Grilled Sandwich. The Prosciutto sandwich was topped with arugula and provolone, served with a pickled carrot. Very Tasty! The tarts were also awesome! Tartine is a great place if you feel like a light meal or you feel like some yummy pastries! Plus, it's walking distance to Bi-Rite Creamery (http://www.yelp.com/biz/É).

I gave in to the tourist pressure and went to Tartine to try supposedly the best bakery in SF. Well I haven't tried all bakeries in SF but I have to say Tartine is at least in my top three. Last time there I had the Coconut Bavarian Cake and an excellently executed cappuccino. I'm always pleasantly surprised that their cakes are moist and with light icing/filling that's not overly sugary but rather a bit tart and well flavored. I will come back even if that means waiting in line for a bit.

I've been here 4-5 times; the wait is crazy around 9-10am on weekdays and weekends but in the afternoon you can just walk in. I mostly dislike this place because it's expensive (like breakfast for 2 for $25... theft!), and the food is not that interesting flavor-wise. What's really going for it is the massive amounts of butter. Seriously, it's coma-inducing--things are tasty enough, but my visits here are generally followed by an involuntary nap, so I'm going to have to stop soon. If you're a decent cook, their cookbook is quite straightforward and can replicate the bakery results. I've made better lemon tarts; I've definitely made better bread pudding. (Theirs is practically like sweetened scrambled eggs, yuck. Why the hype, yelp?) The service is decent, sometimes not very good -- I came in once and the server seemed bored and slow--every question made her freeze like she was incapable of both handing me a croissant and answering a basic question like 'what time do you serve bread?' Sucks because I bet working at Tartine is like the best job in America. They should be able to pick and choose people! And instead they choose. these guys?? anyhow. Speaking of which, the bread: not very good. Their olive bread has like, 3 olives per pound. It's bizarre how they serve it still warm. It hasn't even finished cooking. I did try it when it cooled down--not very flavorful or interesting, just tastes like plain artisan bread, and a bit rough. And huge. And, expensive. And oddly, rich--like it could be dinner by itself. My favorite things here are the lemon pound cake, almond croissant, and gougeres (though I wish they served them warm). Bread pudding is terrible, other croissants are 3/4 butter by weight and will knock you out, brownies way too rich, and it makes me feel like a tool to pay $7 for a fruit tart so can't review that, etc.

I wanted to give this place a higher rating, I really did! When you stand in line , you can smell the nice buttery aroma, almost like it's teasing you.. you can smell the butter, the almonds, the cheese, the pastries being baked it just smells like it's the best pastries in the world! and if you have to wait in the long line like I did, just by the smell it seemed like it was well worth the wait! Êso just from the heavenly smell while in line I thought 5 stars! Ê so yes it was finally my turn to order! I I see everyone who was eating in with a Banana Cream Tart, so DUH I order one too! its obviously good since everyone is stuffing their faces with them! Êand Since I was taking my pastries home which was atleast 40miles away I order 2 Banana cream tarts, ( incase it was super heavenly, my husband would get his own, because I dont like to share! lol) BANANA CREAM TART-SMALL Ê$7 - good but not , I'll drive all the way back stand in line great! ham and cheese( gruyere ) croissants $5.50 it was big!

Line moves pretty quickly and a gal from behind the counter asks me for my order. I started with the oatmeal chocolate chip cookie then she disappears in the back. Um...hello? Another gal asks me if I've been helped and I told her yes but I don't know where she went. So I'm reading off my order and the lady was looking irritated that I kept rambling off my orders to her. For one, it's not my fault you can't hear because I'm speaking pretty loud and two, ask me if I'm done ordering before walking away! I wait until you're done taking out what I want from the case and then giving you the next order so it's not like I'm saying it all at once. Anyways, they ran out of eclairs--super bummer. The croissant was the best croissants I've had. Big, flaky on the outside and fluffy on the outside. Just buttered exactly the way I like it. The ham and cheese quiche was a bit disappointing. Not as flavorful as I expected and I think the ones from Costco are better... The lemon cream tart was pretty decent. Tarty but nothing I'm craving. The morning bun was very sticky and I should have eaten it right away. Instead I waiting until the next day, microwaved it and it was ruined.... Customer service--minus 1 star. Hoping it was just a busy day and the rain has got them all moody. I'll give it another try in the future but right now, there's nothing I'm craving from that place but the croissants. I think it's just the hype that made me want to check it out. Maybe if they had some eclairs my review would have been different.

Yeah...this place has really good stuff- but it is waaaayyyy too rich for my taste. I think people gain 10 pounds walking past it. All the pastries seem to be full of a bucket of European butter. I think if you are looking for a rich and heavy treat- you can't go wrong here. Decadence...

I finally found something I love more than Leonardo DiCaprio. Tartine is such a wonderful bakery. I don't mind waiting 20 mins in the pouring rain for the baked goods and sandwiches. The banana cream tart is just divine and I don't even like fruits in my dessert. The sandwiches are wonderful, the bread is thick, crusty and chewy. All the ingredients are fresh and organic. My favorite sandwiches there are the Niman Ranch ham croque monsieur and the spicy turkey. The croque monsieur is the best I've ever had, and trust me I've eaten a bunch in my lifetime and none compares to Tartine's. This is the kind of place everyone should visit at least once in their lifetime. Oh and if you have out of towners coming to visit, this is a great place to WOW them.

Solid bakery that I'd say is a little overhyped. Tried various items from the menu -- croissant, banana cream pie, turkey pesto sandwich, and bread pudding, and all were delicious but not so heavenly that they'll be showing up in my dreams any time soon...if ever. The croissant is ENORMOUS. The texture is probably a little too dry for me, but it's a beautiful looking croissant, and very impressive on the eyes. Banana cream pie/tart was one of my favorite items from the trip. Very smooth consistency, and I liked the chocolate shavings in the cream. Turkey pesto sandwich was nothing special, though the bread was quite flavorful -- doused in olive oil. Bread pudding was delicious. When I visited, the flavor was raspberries and blackberries, so it was rather tart. After a few bites however, I thought the pudding was a bit too custardy. Would have preferred a chewier, breadier texture. Ê 3.5 stars.

TAR-TINE! THIS BAKERY IS SO GOOD THE ENTIRE REVIEW SHOULD BE IN CAPS. I waited in line for a hot, miserable two hours to see the Sistine Chapel. I would have waited twice that for Tartine. I had read about it in a few places before visiting San Francisco (high-five, guys, blowing up all over the country!), and my dear friend immediately recommended it upon my arrival, so, of course- we made the pilgrimage. For a baker, this is effing Mecca. You want a perfect croissant? They've got it. So much butter that the croissant gets overwhelmed and turns into a soft, pillowy, breathless song of TRIUMPH. It doesn't even taste like a croissant anymore, it tastes like friggin innocence. I lost my mind a little in this place, and spent money like a boss. I picked FIVE: pain au chocolat, a plain croissant, an almond croissant, a morning bun, and a buttermilk currant scone. I also bought one of their canvass bags in the spirit of a groupie who simply will not leave the concert without a T-shirt. My friends each got two pastries (including a pepper cheese popover thing), and we paraded our boxes over to Dolores Park to eat them in the sun. Tartine makes baked goods like Ansel Adams takes pictures, like Stephen King creates characters, like Gershwin makes music. Their goods are just uncommonly fine. Every detail is perfect, from the zing of orange in the morning bun, to the eggy pull of the popover, to the type of cheese they use in their ham & cheese croissant. They simply do not compromise, and I'm so thrilled to have experienced such outstanding quality.

The panini was soo greasy! French like butter, I understand, but a heart attack?! GeeZ.. The pastries were good and large. The wait wasn't worth it for me.

Now that the bread is available at 5pm, my sweetie and I get the 2# bread for dinner, then keep the leftovers for grilled cheese sandwiches or panade / some other bread-based dinner dish. I love a good loaf of ACME bread, but this stuff is a level beyond. The desserts are tasty, but lean heavily toward the walnuts. But seriously, go for the bread.

Let's get this straight. The bread pudding was FABULOUS AND BEYOND! "Cup or bowl?" "I'll have a bowl, please." (and yet I was the only one eating...) Yes, I will wait in line for just a bowl of bread pudding, some other great desserts, and a cup of coffee at this place any day. For the sandwiches -HELL NO. The sandwiches were far far far away from that standard. Ugh! I ordered the pastrami, and this is what I got: Oil-soaked slices of bread, and thick cheese back to back!! And out of nowhere, the sandwich had this awful, way too zingy and spicy mustard hidden somewhere underneath the horseradish. Oh man did that taste bad! It was criminal -CRIMINALLY BAD. My friend ordered the proscuitto and provolone and her's was much better, but more or less the same, with the greasy bread and thick cheese. I don't know about you, but judging on the reviews, I think I may have just ordered 'the wrong thing'. But that's two sandwiches out of 10 or something, so I don't know if there's much more room to impress. Don't go for the sandwiches, but you must definitely go for everything else!

Morning Bun. The infamous one. It was DAMN GOOD. I loved how crispy and flaky it was. The slight orangey taste made the pastry even better. NOMS. I'd wait in line for this any day. Frangipane Tart. Light Almond-Cream Filling in Flaky Pastry Shell with Blueberry. This was pretty good, but definitely not what I was expecting. I expected it to be more almond-y but what I got was a tart that tasted like a blueberry tart topped with almonds. Cocoa Nib Rocher. This was BOMB. An explosion of cocoa goodness in my mouth. It was made with meringue so it was rather light but still sweet and delicious. Service was much better this time. YAY no b!tch girl giving me attitude! 5 stars just for the morning bun and rocher! :) See photos of food, http://potbellypanda.tumÉ

Not that Tartine needs any more reviews (lest that perpetual line grow any longer), so I will keep it short. I, like many others, did the obligatory morning bun + coffee combo on a Sunday morning and took it to Dolores Park to enjoy. I was expecting more of a cinnamon roll, but it's really more like a glazed croissant. Not a bad breakfast, though I wished the moist center extended a little further. The hint of orange in the glaze was a nice touch though. I've also had their croissants, and they are flaky buttery mounds of goodness. The coffee is just meh, especially in a city with as many coffee snobs as San Francisco. Someday I'll be back to try their sandwiches and buy a whole loaf of bread for myself =)

Tartine is my own little bit of Paris in San Francisco. Stopped by on a romantic rainy afternoon. ÊRain not only allows for inward reflection but transforms cafs into perfect little sanctuaries to pass the time. The banana cream pie ($6.50) was perfectly made. ÊThe whipped cream was wispy, cloudlike, and delicate. ÊThe pie contained actual fresh slices of bananas. ÊThe shell was crispy and tantalizing. ÊAs a whole, the dessert was only slightly sweet. ÊA much welcomed surprise for a society that oversugars everything - including life. You'll be sure to see me another rainy afternoon!

I wonder if Tartine makes anything that isn't good. Pros: - Pastries - Bread - Sandwiches Cons: - Too many people go here so the line can be REALLY long - Ordering a loaf of bread is a bit of a pain as they only bake bread on certain days and you have to order a few days in advance. - Seating is limited

Tartine is the perfect bakery to go to for people who fancy pastries and cakes that aren't too sweet and heavy, not to mention, their bread is superb! Everyone says their morning bun is to die for, but you have to get there somewhat early before they run out because they do not make more Ê(I came at 4pm on a Saturday). I had a slice of their coconut passion fruit cake, the passion fruit cream was not sweet, it had the perfect amount of tart to it, the cake itself was spongy and light, and the whip cream was also light. The slice was around 5.50, some may find that a little pricey, but the portion was really quite big. My brother had their bread pudding which was just "okay" while my other friends had their pastries (forgot which ones), but they were AWESOME. I happened to buy a loaf of their sourdough wheat bread and let me tell you this is the best loaf of bread I have ever eaten in my entire life, whenever I am in the mission district I will definitely wait in their line to buy a loaf before I head back to South Bay.

One of my missions for my recent SF trip: TARTINE BAKERY! We finally stopped by Sunday during brunch time before heading to Napa. ÊParking was near impossible. Since it was pouring outside, my generous bf dropped me off so I could wait in line as he looked for parking. Ê20 minutes passed before he was able to join me in line. ÊAfter waiting another 20 minutes outside with just a raggedy ol' umbrella to shield us from the pouring rain (who needs a heavy duty umbrella in so-cal?) We finally ordered our food and waited like vultures for an open table. Ê To my dismay, I find out there is a SEPERATE line for beverages, which required more waiting. sigh.. After an hour upon arrival, the food&beverage finalllly arrives at our table. ÊIt was like seeing an oasis in a desert, I could finally relax and veg out. ÊHeres what we had: Ê ham croque monsieur banana cream tart lemon bar provolone & prosciutto sandwich latte The croque monsieur was AMAZING. Êalmost worth the 1 hour wait. Êalmost. ÊEverything else was great, but not mind blowing. I suspect if I were a local and could come during non-peak times and order to go, I would probably be here on a regular basis. ÊIt was just too much waiting and hassle to dine-in.

Tartine, why are you such a tease? With your display case full of scrumptious looking and tasting desserts followed by a line of 4 different kinds of croissants, tea bread selections, open faced sandwiches and more, you make me want to come and visit every single day! Hands down Tartine makes the best croissants (all of the flavors)! So buttery and flaky- not for the faint of heart. Call me a croissant snob but this is the only place I will get croissants (I always leave with a box full of them); other places can't even compare. Another savory treat worth trying is their Gougere's- cheesy peppery goodness with a hint of thyme. A trip to Tartine is never complete without a dessert! Frangipane tart, Tres Leches cake, pumpkin bread, lemon bar, lemon tart, and of course the infamous Banana Cream Tart are all amazing! I actually bought the Tartine cookbook before ever setting foot in the store and after receiving it, I've made the Banana Cream Tart quite and few times and they always came out delicious- all of my family and friends absolutely love it. But I knew the real one has to be even better. It was SO FLAKY (from all that butter in the tart dough) and not too sweet- PERFECTION! Seriously guys, GO GO GO!!! In the future, if I move into the city, I can't live too close to Tartine or else it's bye bye to my waist line...

Oh, how I love Tartine! The line is intimidating, but it moves fairly fast, so if it's out the door but hasn't yet passed the boundary of the Tartine kitchen window, the wait is usually less than 20 minutes... not bad! My favorite things -- The quiches are delicious, split one with a friend so you can try some other stuff. The bread pudding is also delicious... I always get the smaller serving because it's pretty heavy. In the baked goods department... Everything is good, but the almond croissants and morning buns stand out. The almond croissants are light, buttery but full of almondy goodness. Also, my friends tell me that they keep for at least three days (if you can wait that long!) And the morning buns? Delicious and interesting. I generally think morning buns are pretty boring -- but the Tartine ones have a hint of orange zest and a caramelly stickyness that add great complexity. If only I could eat twice as much...

GOD I HATE/LOVE WORKING IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOOOOD!!!! i had an early work meeting today so i got to go on a 45 minutes break at 9. of course.. i take a five minute drive down to tartine bakery to avoid their notoriously long lines. after i find parking and walk down... it was roughly 9:12, and there was already a mini line out the door!!! (WTEFFFFF) so this is my first time here and i was all excited and whatnot. shit.. i wanted to try EVERYTHING! but..of course that wasn't practical. ='[ so after a 12 minute wait, i got to order 3 double pain au chocolats (they were for my bf and co-worker! i only had half i swear!) a lemon tart (that was mine, allll mine!) and a hazelnut tart for my bf as well. the pain au chocolat was amazzzzing! flaky and buttery on the outside, warm and soft on the inside... with the perfect amount of chocolatey goodness in the center. OMG! i dont even LIKE croissants! how did this happen?! the lemon tart i saved for after dinner to eat so it was no longer warm, but i swear i had an foodgasm after the first fucking bite. PERFECT PEEEEEERFECT blend of lemon and sugar, the middle was so soft and fluffy, not all thick and gel-like at all. and the outside crust was sweet and not too crumbly. sigh..... BLISS! i had to scrape a lot of the cream on top off but still used a little of it to compliment the tangy taste of the tart, but thats just me... i dont like too much of that cream stuff. man.. i cant get over how MOUTHWATERINGLY GOOOOD that lemon tart was! i love lemon/lime pastries and that was by far the best i've ever had! i really wanted to try the banana creme tart as well but they sadly didnt have it that early in the morning. ='''''''''[ but i guess that means i'll be back....

This place was not worth the hype. It was overcrowded and loud. The service was short and not very good. before I could finish my order our server was on to something else and did not get the rest of what I wanted. The prices were a bit much for the baked goods.

I loooooooooooove their frangipane croissant, morning bun, cardamom bun, and frangipane tart!! (I have had an almond croissant that is better than their's, but as of this moment it is no longer or not yet available...). Their coconut passion fruit cake is pretty good too! However, their banana cream pie is sub-par. Crust is too hard and too thick, too much whipped cream, too much chocolate on the crust and it tastes shitty. There is not enough pastry cream or bananas. I still have to try so many things here 'cause they all look and sound so tasty! Hopefully they don't turn out like the banana cream pie...big disappointment. Make sure you go quite early in the day otherwise they run out of all the good stuff ESPECIALLY the frangipane croissant. Those four things I listed in my first sentence have the best value (of what I've seen anyway). Everything else seems kinda small and expensive... A note of caution. Do not go expecting an excellent cup of coffee to go along with your pastry. On two separate occasions, I have had two terrible cups of coffee. They had a hint of burnt and a strong taste of sour. It is disappointing that an excellent bakery has such poor coffee. Regardless, the pastry manages to shine above the bad coffee.

After almost a month, I'm almost caught up with my SF reviews. Next up is Tartine Bakery! After utterly delicious sandwiches in Ike's, we decided to walk a few blocks over to Tartine's. Ok, we didn't make that decision. I forced my cousins to go with me. On my way over to SFO, I was watching discovery channel (was too early for bowl games) on the plane (continental, BTW). There was this show about top 10 bakeries in the US. I enjoyed the show as the freshly baked cookies were served (now that's delicious, every airline should be serving freshly baked cookies!!) Even with the cookies in my mouth, my undivided attention was immediately diverted to the screen when it reached #2, Tartine. The croissants looks so flaky and delicious. The tres leches cake immediately mesmerized me. I had instantly decided that I must visit Tartine's. It wasn't really as easy as getting there. I got there on my 3rd attempt. As we walked down the streets of what seemed to be a pretty dead residential area, I suddenly see a cloud in front of me. It turned out to be Tartine's 2 blocks away. The cloud was formed by the vapor coming out of everyone's mouth, and there were a lot of people on the street. The line was 40 minutes long (mostly outside) and it was worth it! So, no, I can't wait 2 hours or even 40 minutes for the world's best sandwich from Ike, but I can wait 40 minutes for my tres leches cake. It's simple. When I need a sandwich, I'm hungry. I can't wait 2 hours. The best meal in the world isn't worth the hunger. On the other hand, waiting 40 minutes to indulge myself isn't that much of a problem at all:-D Unfortunately there was no baking goods by the time I got there at 4pm. (thanks Ike's) That means no croissant for me:( Luckily, there were 3 slices of Tres Leches cake left. I bought them all. I split one with my cousins and brought the other 2 back for other cousins. Damn, I'm a good cousin;) This may not be a "pastry" shop, but the tres leches cake was every bit as advertized. The repeating layers of 3 different creamy milky "stuff" melts in my mouth in flavors I can't describe. I have had tres leches cakes before, mostly in central american countries, but this one has a refined taste to go with an unbelieveable texture. The only thing it lacked was presentation. It was one ugly cake. That did not matter to me though. Pretty isn't editble. (unless it's Heidi Klum) Overall, we split a few pieces of pastry and they were excellent. They are definitely a solid 4 star in my book. However, whether they are top 10 in the country is arguable. But I know for a fact that I will be glad to line up for 40 minutes to get the tres leches cake again next time I'm in town.

After seeing a picture on yelp of the pastrami sandwich at Tartine, I knew what I was having for lunch that day. I have been warned that the line can get crazy, but apparently we timed it right because it wasnt out the door yet! Finding seating was a little tricky, but after a few minutes of wandering around, we grabbed a table that someone just got up from. That is the only slightly eh thing about this spot..more seating would be awesome, but then again, that would take away from the cozy-ness...sooo just be prepared to eye out a spot as soon as you walk in, even though you will be completely distracted by the bakery case... So, the pastrami sandwich.... Pastrami, Gruyere, Horseraddish, and mustard- all in between two toasty pieces of bread. I want it again. 13 dollars, 3 good sized triangles, totally enough to share..and then you can have room for a treat! That was my mistake..I saved one triangle of the sandwich, and was still too full to try any of the desserts that visit. I was eyeing the lemon tart, and those mexican wedding cookies though..and knew it wouldnt be long before I returned to those babies. Truth be told, I was back within a week, and tried both. Do yourself a favor....go in, get yourself a cup of coffee- FYI CASH only for the coffee bar, and a lemon tart...and expeience true love. Mexican wedding cookies must be good because I overheard a gentleman tring to buy them all up. However, the pretty girl behind the counter broke his sweet heart, and told him she could sell him 12 max. That way she had some for other customers throughout the day. I liked that. I got one, and some kind of chocolate drop cookie to go. Ummmm, I understand why that man wanted alllllll the mexican wedding cookies!!!!!! Even a 12 max limit could get a little danergous... Êthe other cookie was yumyum as well. Tartine, you and me are like a match made in heaven.

If I lived a block away, I would go to this bakery. But since I live an ocean away and we made a stop at the Mission to see this, I felt like this was not extraordinary. Ordered the banana cream tart, morning bun, and coffee. I would consider going back for the morning bun but with the 15 minute line at the bakery's opening time (on a Tuesday for God's sake, don't people in SF work?), I'd probably go elsewhere. The banana cream tart was okay, pricey. I don't recommend their coffee, maybe I just got a bad batch. Staff seemed really stressed out. Probably the worst service I got while in SF. But I guess if I had to wake up early in the morning to bake then serve people on a Tuesday morning, I probably wouldn't be too pleasant either.

OMG this place is heaven! You must try the ham and cheese croissant but warning they tend to all go by noontime. The latte they made also complimented it perfectly. I dont want to downgrade the rating because the food is so good, but the only two minuses are the coffee is a bit expensive and too many seats taken up by bozos who just sit there all day reading Botswana land use reports from a NGO on their mac while listening to john legend. Get out I need to sit down!

I am absolutely enamored with Tartine. I'd make it here every weekend if my grumpy boyfriend didn't refuse to wake up and come at the most opportune time: as early as possible. It is without wonder that there is a cascade of people at any hour of the day, on any given day. I don't know how they make their croissants so flaky and crispy on the outside, and their inside so soft, moist, and meaty, but their Pain au chocolate was the best I've ever consumed. The cappuccino and espresso I tasted were strong and went down smoothly. The lemon cream tart was like promised, AMAZING. And I'm not even a fan of biscotti, but I had a nibble of my sister's and it was pleasantly nutty and buttery, not like stale bread at all. I suppose there is well made biscotti out there. Tartine, I will be dreaming about you. I promise.

Tartine the Bakery! It should be known as "The Bakery" because everything there is so damn good. We went for brunch on a weekday, and to our surprise, we got in line and got a seat really easily. The double pain au chocolat is a miracle itself. It came to me warm, crispy, flakey, and the chocolate inside was rich, creamy, and nicely melted. Every bite of the chocolate croissant was worth it. It was crispy without being too greasy; it was nice and warm without being soggy. and check this out HOT PRESSED SANDWICHES Spicy Turkey Ê$13 Peppered turkey breast, provolone, broccoli rabe pesto How can you read that and not be drooling? The sandwich was better than Ike's in my opinion, but to be fair, they're not exactly the same thing. Let's just say they're tied, but I would choose this over Ike's any given day. The flavor of the sandwich was overwhelming; the spiced turkey breast, the nicely melted provolone, cheese, and the pesto paste was phenomenal. We also got a latte and a hot chocolate; they're so frothy and creamy it's unreal. Avoid rush hours if you can, and you'll definitely have a great time!

There are currently over 2600+ reviews about Tartine! ÊAs if they need another!! ÊI will humor them anyway... Ê So my girlfriends and I love to do SF food tours. ÊI grew up here but there are always new restaurants to try. ÊEvery few months we visit the latest & greatest. ÊThere is no better way to spend quality time with friends than over a shared meal. ÊWell, in our case, it was 10 in one day!! ÊTartine has been consistently at the top of everyone's list so this was our 1st stop of our food tour. The morning bun is their specialty but I actually find it a little too dry for my taste. ÊI've been here a few times, each time hoping it will be a little more moist but it just not that kinda pastry. Ê Definitely need a cup of joe to wash it down with. ÊI've also tried their croissants- plain & chocolate, grougere, & lemon tarts which are all delectable.

I've heard so much about how wonderful this little bakery is. ÊSan Francisco cafes have great ambiance, but sometimes lack the food quality that other cities might have. ÊI really miss Almondine and Levain Bakery in New York. ÊI was hoping for a taste of that with Tartine. ÊOnce I got to the front door, I could already feel the trendy vibe. ÊThe lines were long, and many of the items did look appealing. ÊIt didn't help that there weren't enough workers or that flies were making these baked goods look a whole lot less delicious. Ê I heard that the large chocolate chip cookie at Tartine might be one of the best in the entire city. ÊMy friend was so excited about the crispy exterior and gooey interior. ÊIt was important that I didn't come late because oftentimes the cookies don't taste fresh, so we wouldn't be giving them a fair chance. ÊThe problem with this cookie is that it doesn't matter if you're a soft or hard kind of cookie lover. ÊThis 28 year-old kitchen tile with chips inside of it was one of the worst "sweets" my friend has ever had. ÊIt's unbelievable that people would rate such a disgusting cookie as one of the best because it is large. ÊThe dirty tile was so thin that the width didn't seem to matter. ÊYour teeth would fall out after the first bite. ÊDon't intentionally make your cookies stale just to be trendy! ÊThe ingredients apparently did not taste fresh either. ÊUnfortunately, the service was not that efficient or welcoming to make up for it. The only reason this place gets two stars is because the cafe looks like a fun spot to people watch, and some of the other items might be better. ÊI'm not sure if I really want the fly hand-me-downs though. ÊTry Specialty's or Mr. and Mrs. Miscellaneous...

Tartine is pricey, but I can guarantee every penny you spend goes towards amazing baked goods. I highly recommend the lemon poppyseed pound cake - it may not look like much, but when I took my first bite I actually gasped in surprise - there is a thin layer of crunchy sweetness on the outside! The cake itself is surprisingly light, perfectly balanced by the fresh lemon flavor. The frangipane croissant is also wonderful, once you make your way through the crunchy outer layers there's a layer of smooth almond filling blended with the fluffy inside...mm!! ÊAnd I don't even like croissants! Tartine has officially converted me. As others have said, expect a huge line and nowhere to sit. But I really don't care if I have to take it to go - as long as I get to savor Tartine's delicious goods I'll be happy.

I've gone back a few times and need to increase my "overall" rating from 3-stars to 4-stars. I have a new favorite Chocolat Croissant and it's from Tartine. My benchmark is always going to be Almond (Frangipane), but Tartine's Valrhona Chocolate Croissant satisfies me. Everytime.

Did I just wait 20 minutes in line for a $6.25 banana cream tart??? Let alone on a Sunday morning?? Yup!! That's right! 20 minutes for the best tasting banana cream tart your lips will ever taste! ÊIs it worth it? Heck yeah! While everyone else was ordering espresso that morning, I ordered the banana cream tart and it was so creamy. The taste of the banana was intense with the most elegant whipped cream and flaky, buttery crust. I've heard this was Julia Child's "go to" bakeries when she was in town. Without a doubt the BEST banana cream tart you'll ever taste!!

Tartine was everything it was cracked up to be. A long line of morning goers awaiting bakery heaven. A delicious morning bun that was in turns flaky, moist, and chewy with hints of orange and cinnamon. A croque monsieur with thick bread covered in Gruyere. And a quick walk to Dolores park to enjoy it all in the sunshine.

Whenever I get back to San Francisco, this is my first and last stop. ÊI've been a fan since I ate at Tartine years ago. The vibe of this place is top notch. ÊHuge loaves of crusty bread everywhere, mixed in with fruity, sweet treats, and a staff that's running around like crazy but oh so nice. ÊIt's a pretty small location but all the natural light and open windows/doors makes it seem more airy. I usually get the pressed Turkey sandwich and iced coffee. ÊIf I'm feeling extra naughty, I'll go for the bread pudding too! Please excuse me as I go to the back room to lick my lips and reminisce.

Ugh. Tartine. You can smell butter from around the building, and as you get closer into the bakery (you should expect a Ê~25 minute wait), it's like being enveloped into a croissant-y, buttery, fatty, decadent, sweet, savory heaven. Here's the deal. Bread pudding. Quiche (ham & leek). Pain au chocolat. MEXICAN WEDDING COOKIES. Sandwiches... Okay let me stop there, because just about everything from Tartine will be sure to please. I think my favorite were the wedding cookies. Powdered sugar is SO fine, and just adds the perfect amount of sweetness to the almond-y, buttery, crumbly inside. Just. The. Best. The bread pudding is like none I've ever had. It's covered in caramelized apples, and the budding is super decadent & creamy. Chocolate croissant (pain au chocolat) - super flaky and the chocolate is semi-sweet so it's not too overwhelming. EVERYTHING ELSE. Come back, often. Try everything. Tartine is just a quality bakery, something very hard to find in California, or anywhere for that matter. *atmosphere - very quaint. They have fresh flowers in vases, and there is very limited seating. Loved their long wood table. Simple & elegant. *prices are kind of steep, but definitely worth it *long wait any time and any day of the week *don't expect the full selection past 5 PM

The Double Pain au Chocolat was sooo freaking good, the best chocolate croissant I've tasted so far, definitely lived up to the hype of Dave Meyers on the food network Êshow "Best thing I Ever Ate." An employee suggested I try the Ham & Cheese Croissant, though I had one bite of it, that bite contained lots of good flavor. The one thing I was really upset about was the well crafted artsy cappuccino, it was super sour I don't know what that was about.

What's for breakfast? Fresh coffee, sweet breakfast pastries and yummy quiches! Small and super packed this bakery is located on the corner of Guerrero St. My hunny ordered the morning bun - warm, crispy, flaky pastry with an orange glaze....i'm not super fond of orange glaze but I have to admit it's pretty good.

Came here for a banana cream tart, but came home with a coconut cream tart. It was a lot yummier than expected. But aside from that, the price of one tart is a little costly. I also wish their fruit tart was a fruit tart, not a raspberry tart. They offer a small variety of cookies and pastries. Coffee, tea, and sandwiches. Really small place that is super packed. Not the best place to catch up over a cup of coffee with a friend...but definitely come to grab a tart for dessert later. Quiche is good too!

A nice little bakery in a popular area! This place always has a long line, even during the weekdays. For starters, the Morning Buns (coated with some kind of orange cinnamon sugar) are awesome, and they make great food gifts for your friends and/or co-workers. I have not met a single person that doesn't like the Morning Buns. I also tried the Banana Cream Tart and it is excellent. Nice consistency and the pieces of banana go really well with the chocolate embedded crust. As expected, parking in and around this area is horrendous. If you do manage to find parking, remember to take the time to enjoy your newly found parking spot and make sure to visit Pizza Delfina and Bi-Rite Creamery after picking up some baked goods from Tartine Bakery.

If I see another bakery in America try to be an 'authentic' French boulangerie, I'm going to puke in my mouth. While the treats and breads are good for those with nothing to compare them to, if you have ever been to France (or are an expatriate!) and tasted real viennoisserie or pain/baguette, then don't go here looking for your fix.

Do I bother writing a review, since the 3000+ above mine say it all? But I must add my own because Tartine needs to know they are loved and respected. My husband and I got there 20 minutes after they opened on a Sunday, and alas- line out the door and no room inside. BUT the line went fast, and after seeing the croque monsieurs, I knew I would wait forever if I had too. BUT, sigh- they ran out and we had to wait 15 minutes for a new batch. We had a long day of touristing, so we just got the almond croissant, gougere, chocolate and jambon and got out of there. They looked and smelled sooooo amazing, we stopped on the street, ducked under a cover and ate them standing up, in the RAIN! All were great, but the jambon - ham and cheese (swiss? gruyere?) I don't know and don't care, but I DREAM ABOUT THEM!! We're going back to SF in a couple of months, and I know we'll be back in line!

Friends of ours were in town from New Zealand, and Wifey and I wanted to show them some home cooking. ÊA short trip to BiRite yeilded the few missing ingredients for Wifey's famous pasta. ÊAs I walked up to pay, I passed by BiRite's refrigerator case, glanced at the various cakes, pies, and delictable baked goods housed therein, and said to myself "no, I'll buy dessert at Tartine." ÊI had just walked past Tartine, and the place was full of people. ÊNo worries. ÊI paid, and walked the half-block to Tartine. As I entered, I surveyed the scene. ÊSeveral tables full of people nibbling on this and sipping on that, talking, laughing. ÊYou know: what people do in restaurants. ÊI walked up to the bakery case and started thinking through my options. ÊNice lemon merrangue there, decent looking chocolate something over there, what size do I need. ÊYou know: what people do when thinking about buying dessert. At about this point, a youngish man appeared behind the case. ÊI looked up at him and said something like "I'd like..." ÊI never got to finish. ÊHe looked at me said "we're closed" and then existed through the door behind the bakery case into the kitchen. ÊBaffled, I turned around, looked at all the diners still enjoying their nibbles, and then looked at my watch: it was 7:02. ÊOn my way out, I checked their hours: they close at 7:00. Now, businesses GET to close. ÊThey GET to have hours. ÊFar be it from me to try to be the jerk who wanders into a restaurant at five minutes to closing and tries to get a table and order the Baked Alaska (which takes a long time to make). BUT. ÊOh, it's a huge but. ÊIn this particular case, the restaurant had 10+ other customers in it. ÊI was attempting to consumate a counter purchase that would take 2 minutes. ÊAnd the employee who I delt with almost could not have been ruder to me. I have seen this before. ÊIt's called Fatal Restaurant Success Syndrome. ÊIt occurs when a place, by virtue of having decent food, becomes popular enough that the people who work there fall under the impression that they can just treat customers like shit. ÊI can safely say that, in my 6 or so encounters with Tartine, I've never really been treated well. ÊBut it's been acceptable (for SF, at least). ÊWhat restaurants seem to forget is that there are A LOT of places that have decent food. ÊIn Tartine's case, I would suggest that there are a NUMBER of bakeries in SF that are at least as good as Tartine. ÊAcme, for one. ÊAnd there are two others who frequently appear at the Ferry Building Farmers' Market whose names slip my mind. ÊBut I will grow much more familiar with them in the future, because I will be frequenting them, not Tartine. The choice, fellow consumers, is yours (ours). ÊEver wonder why the service industry in SF is industry minus service? ÊService without the smile, you might say? ÊHere's why: they're used to getting away with it. ÊThey're used to you coming back. ÊThey believe there are no consequences to treating customers like the scum of the earth. ÊIf you think this is appropriate behavior worthy of reward, please: continue to frequent Tartine. ÊIf you believe that, as a customer, you are entitled to a modicum of courtesy and common decency, or if you believe that a business should WANT your business, then you'll join me in never buying anything from Tartine again.

In the Mission district of San Francisco lays one of the City's most delectable treasures: Tartine Bakery. The cakes, pastries, and tarts are a serious must-have for the ultimate chocolatier and sugar-addict. The bakery is foremost known for its breakfast pastries (morning buns & double pain au chocolat). These pastries alone have become so popular that they run out by noon. Make sure to get there extra early to experience a breakfast treat of the Gods! ... But if you're more like me and can't get yourself out of bed before noon, let alone to San Francisco that early, try the following items for a just-as-heavenly experience. Banana Cream Pie: Flaky crust, covered in dark chocolate with a hint of caramel. The custard has the right balance of cream and bananas. There really is nothing not to like about this dish. My favorite! Tres Leches Cake: Tartine puts its own spin on the classic mexican dish by adding sweet coconut milk, cajeta, and crema. Definitely worth trying and getting if they run out of the Banana Cream Pie. Devil's Food Cake: THE cake for my chocoholics. The Devil's food cake is made with dark chocolate and layered with caramel and chocolate ganache. I'm not crazy for chocolate cake, but this moist treat is full of chocolaty decadence with layers of love. Passion Fruit Lime Bavarian Rectangle: The lime flavored cake is topped with sweet cream and coconut. It's a nice fluffy cake and a great, tropical alternative to chocolate. A little insider tip: Try to at least get to Tartine by at least 2 PM, otherwise you will miss out on their best selections.

LOVE their sweets and tea selection. Wish there was less of a wait sometimes. At times it's just not worth it. But I do have to say that even with the line, and all the hype, they tend to move, and turn people over pretty fast!

THANKS FOR VOTING, FELLOW YELPERS!! The photo I shot of Tartine's awesome banana cream pie is their main default picture! ANYWAYS I had to do an update on Tartine Bakery because I am thoroughly impressed with their selection of foods. From tarts to cakes to croissants to PRESSED SANDWICHES. CHYYEAAHHH. PRESSED SANDWICHES. While standing in line one rainy San Francisco afternoon, a server walked by with a pippin' hot pesto looking sandwich, trying to find the table that ordered it. My jaw dropped. I thought to myself, I MUST HAVE THAT! So with that thought, I ordered their "Sopressata, Fontina, Broccoli Rabe Pesto Pressed Sandwich" OMG. TO. DIE. FOR. It runs you in at $13 but what isn't expensive at Tartine? The bread they use is super long so in the end, you actually get 3 sandwiches, not just 2 halves. I happidly ate this on a rainy day. I stopped in the middle and thought about how I just paid $13 for a sandwich but I kept eating knowing that I would order this again. What recession? Yeah, no there still is one but MANNN...I am a sucker for a good sandwich. Mmm.

My apologies to the Tartine regulars but quite frankly I don't see the appeal of this place at all. I've been here 3 times; introduced to it by plugs given to it on programs on the Food Network. My hopes and anticipation ran high since I search out anything French, mostly baked goods this side of the pond. Much to my dismay Tartine was more about the bread than the patisseries. In fact, there were only a few tarts and quiches each of the times I was there. A few words about the bread; why is it only available after 5:00 p.m. When nothing beats having bread for breakfast and/or lunch. Other starches are preferable for dinner. I suggest baking your breads earlier so that your loyal patrons (of which you have many - judging from the multitude of reviews) can enjoy them throughout the day. The reason for my negative review does not stem from the lack of variety of les gateaus et les viennoiseries; it's the unenthusiastic, aloof, bordering on rude staff. These employees acted like they were put out to help the customers, really... I've had better service at Louis Vuitton than Tartine; the salespeople at LV were way friendlier. What's up with the arrogance, it's just bread, and there are many many choices of bakeries out there. On one of my visits, the staff were openly sarcastic with customers with one of Tartine's owners standing nearby tacitly condoning this behavior which in my opinion is a sad reflection on much he values his customers. No matter how good the products are, I will never return to this crowded, poorly laid out bakery where parking is virtually impossible to find only to be mistreated by staff. Politeness and good service matters and until Tartine's owners realize this, I will continue to steer clear of this place.

Oh Tartine, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul. No seriously. As much as it is hipster-hyped, beneath it all, Tartine is the pastry and baked good cotillion. Yes, only the most elite, gorgeous, rich and tasty morsels are presented here. I've tried tarts, bread, croissants (filled and unfilled), open-faced sandwiches, buns, even the bread pudding. Not a single complaint. About the food, anyway. The lines are a different story. Don't come hungry - you'll wait about half an hour before you even get a taste.

You can't hate on a place like Tartine! If you're lucky enough to snag a morning bun or loaf of bread straight from the oven, then you know that Tartine is worth the wait. Don't let the line snaking out the door scare you away- it moves pretty quick. Service is polite and efficient. The only negative is that they run out of items (especially the morning bun and the bread), so placing an order in advance is key if you're not up for purusing the available goods.

BEST Banana Cream Tart EVERRRR! Starting from the top, dark chocolate shavings rest on a pillow of lightly whipped cream. As your fork sinks in, smooth custard-y pastry cream and fresh slices of Êbanana await. With each bite, there is rich creamy caramel sauce and just when you think you've reached heaven, dark chocolate coats the perfectly flake-y crust. MMmmmm, my mouth waters just thinking about it. There are days when we wait 20 minutes in line, just to find out the banana cream tarts are sold out. So sad. Thankfully, there are lots of other delicious treats waiting behind the glass display that protects the pastries from sweets-monsters like me from reaching in and shoveling everything into my mouth. I've had the eclair, lemon tart, coconut cream tart (definitely rivals the banana one), chocolate pot de creme--EVERYTHING IS GOOD IN THE HOOD. I've also had the freshly baked country and olive bread loaves (ready at 5pm Tues-Sun), so fresh that steam escapes when you break through the crust and the meat of the bread is almost chewy (which I actually prefer). The loaves are surprisingly heavy when you hold them, but that's because they are so dense. Bottom-line, Tartine is always worth the wait.

I'm wondering how come I'm giving them 3 stars, myself. Well, I've been hearing so much about this bakery that I was really excited when I tried it for the first time last year. After not having a great cupcake at Baked, I really wanted a good one. Tartine didn't have any the day I went so I went with a Mexican wedding cookie and a lemon tart. The cookie was way too dry. I liked my tart just fine though. My friend loved her nectarine and berry pudding. After all the hype, I felt kind of disappointed. True, it was better than Baked but my sweet tooth wasn't satisfied and around the corner I went to Bi-Rite. Note, the place is super busy, has a long line and it can be a pain to wait for a table.

Dislike: Waited 45 minutes in line to place order and then another 20 minutes for a hot pressed pastrami sandwich which itself was a waste of time and money. Bread was too thick and too toasty. The horseradish sauce was overpowering. I'm sorry but it really can't measure up to some other deli joints. For instance, Carnegie Deli in NYC is the real deal where they give you like a pound of meat at a similar price and you can taste the pastrami. Like: Lemon cream tart: rich and creamy. ÊTasty and tangy lemon but the whipped topping tasted like plastic. ÊWe scraped it off and enjoyed the middle. ÊCrumble top berry muffin: ÊThis had a raspberry middle that was a good combination with the crumble. ÊGood

My dear friend who lives in SF brought me here because she knows I love good pastries. ÊShe assured me the it was worth the wait outside in the rain. ÊLuckily, we had rain gear; plus, the rain helped scare away other people, making our wait shorter than usual for a Sunday morning. My friend got the morning bun, which was delicious. ÊI got a croissant, which may seem plain, but a good croissant is a rare and beautiful thing. ÊI also got a cappuccino. ÊThe wait to get inside was long, and after we got our food the wait for cappuccino was even longer. Ê I don't think there is a time when this place isn't packed. ÊWith the bad weather, folks were really jammed inside. Sitting at a table looked like a bad idea, with folks crammed in and being bumped by those of us standing over them waiting for our orders. ÊI would probably get my food to go (and not order a cappuccino or a food item that needs to be eaten while hot). ÊFind a nice bench nearby, or take it home to savor it in private. I'd say it was definitely worth the wait. ÊMy croissant was buttery, flaky, and wonderful. ÊMy cappuccino was quite good as well. The other pastries looked divine. ÊI can't wait to go back.

I finally tried Tartine Bakery the other day, and it did not disappoint! I ordered the croissant and banana cream tart. When deciding on what to order at first, I was a little surprised by the prices...like really $3.50 for a croissant? But when I finally saw the pastries I knew why: they are MASSIVE. One 4" banana cream tart can count as a meal. Anyways, the croissant was perfect. It was warm and fresh. The top was crunchy and the inside soft and buttery. You can really taste how much butter was added to the dough. Delicious. The banana cream tart was also quite good. In particular, I loved the whipped cream on top and the banana cream. The chunks of actual banana inside were a pleasant surprise. The tart crust itself was very crunchy, and while I liked the dark chocolate covering the bottom of the tart, the caramel that was also there made it a little too sweet for me. That's pretty much my only quibble. Servers there were nice and the wait wasn't as bad as I expected. We came at around 9:30 though, and the line exploded a half hour later, so get there early? There are many more things I want to try at Tartine (eclair! morning bun!) so I'll definitely return.

I picked up a passionfruit cake for my mom's birthday here on Thursday night! I decided to reserve the cake beforehand by calling so that I was sure it would be there at the end of the night.

I researched numerous SF bakeries to find the perfect Tres Leches cake for a special occasion. ÊTartine won my business for 3 reasons: 1. Extended business hours - I couldn't pick up the cake until well after 6pm, when Shubert's and other local faves were already closed. 2. Fabulous website - You can tell a lot about a business by how they present themselves online. ÊI wanted the absolute best and Tartine's elegant yet professional website convinced me they could produce it. Ê 3. Accommodating staff - I spoke with a woman on the phone who agreed to box and set aside a cake for me, on just my word that I would be there soon. ÊWhen I arrived, the cake was chilled and a staff member gave me helpful advice on how to serve it. ... The cake was... perfect. Gorgeous presentation, fresh ingredients and a thin, very special crust.

Okay, there are many things on this earth that defy explanation. However, very few of those things are man made, agreed? Tartine Bakery is an example of this anomaly. To use another astronomical term, it's a singularity, a singularity of deliciousness. If I sound hyperbolic it's because SO ARE THE FLAVORS IN THIS PLACE, and I know what I'm talking about. I think people in SF take genius for granted because there is so much of it in this town. From computer programming to journalism to cuisine, there are just some extraordinary people in this city.

While price points are higher here than at other bakeries in the city, there's a reason why Tartine has a near-cult following and has earned a very high 4.5-star average among 2600+ reviewers: everything looks and tastes amazing... from the tarts and paninis to the croissants and quiches. Arriving at around 3:30PM on a weekday, I came too late for their famous morning buns (available until sold out), and too early for any bread loaves (ready after 5pm). Bummer! Still, everything behind the glass cases made my salivary glands go haywire, and my brain crazy in having to decide what to get... The bread pudding with seasonal fruit (this time, pear) was sublime. $3.50 for a small portion was perfect as a midday pick-me-upper for two. The gougre ($3.50) with gruyere, black pepper and thyme turned my skeptical BF into a raving fan. The lightly crisp crust sheltered an incredibly airy, spectacularly cheesy, magnificently moist center. Both gone in 60 seconds. During my short stay, the line waxed and waned, from zero to 7+ people... I can only imagine how intimidating the wait can get during peak times, especially with limited indoor space and seating available. Makes sense that there's no wi-fi available!

YUM. The morning buns are worth the wait. The downside is the hard to find parking, especially on a sunny weekend. Also, at $3.75 it's really expensive for one morning bun. You can almost get two semifreddi's morning buns for the same price. BUT the Tartine morning bun just might be twice as delicious. Definitely worth it's spot on the 7x7 list of things to eat before you die.

Tartine specializes in selling pastries like a crack dealer specializes in selling drugs (although without the turf wars). We're talking fluffy, flaky, chocolately, flavorful awesomeness. The counter staff are helpful at providing advice and fast service on the pastry selection, and the lines (while long) move pretty fast. Additionally, I had a (very rich) mocha, that was absolutely awesome. Quick tip -- apparently they must pre-mix their mocha concoction as I was not able to order a non-fat version on this case, so if you are looking for something a bit lighter you'll want to order a different beverage.

BEST MORNING BUN EVER. hands down! you need to go get one now... every morning bun should taste like this! PERFECT texture...perfectly crispy/crunchy on the outside but amazingly soft and chewy on the inside. DELICIOUS! seriously... i'm not easily impressed, and I don't even normally like these types of pastries or getting things where I see sugar crusted on the top... but this morning bun blew me away! there's nothing at all that could be better about it... the crusted/caramelized sugar spread throughout the morning bun gives it the best, most irresistible texture. Every 2 seconds I couldn't stop raving about how incredibly delicious it was! i literally thought to myself, "If France has better morning buns than this, I might have to move there." haha! also have amazing paninis (love the spicy turkey!) with thick, chewy, indulgent bread and fresh pesto. banana creme tarts, lemon tarts, coconut creme tarts... are heaven! wish i lived closer to here so i could get my morning bun and four barrel coffee everyday!

After sammiches at Ike's and Bi-Rite ice cream, Ciara G led Amy B and me to Tartine, just down the block. Ê I stared - transfixed by the sight of their gorgeous Croque Monsieurs, and was tempted to take one home on the plane a few hours later. But instead, I got: Morning Bun ($3.75) - orange cinnamon sugar dusted the outside and added a crispy crunchy element to the top and bottom. ÊThe inside was moist layers of cinnamony goodness and a light orange flavor. Frangipane Croissant ($4.25) - sliced almond-topped, almond custard baked in, crispy-flaky outside, moist with a good chew inside, buttery all over! Spiced Nuts ($6.50) - a cellophane bag of savory spiced (rosemary, thyme, cayenne, sea salt) nuts for my dad.

I love this place because the desserts and pastries are just perfect, not over the top with sugar and sweetness, or lite on the butter and richness. This place smells amazing. You can't help but want to get everything here.

Who would've thunk over 2.5 yrs ago when I wrote my original review that I would actually end up eating something out of Tartine's garbage? ÊWell technically it hadn't made it into the garbage bin yet, but was on its way in when my homeboy rode by and questioned what the employee was doing throwing out so many olive and walnut loaves. The large loaves with slightly browned tops didn't pass QC so homey was able to tuck 2 "less than perfect" loaves into his hoodie and ride down the street to my house where my roommies and I devoured them without hesitation. Unfortunately I don't live down the street anymore but when I make the trip nowadays, surprisingly more than anything, i crave their breads. Their ginormous bread book came out recently but realistically I wouldn't cook anything out of it (2 weeks for the starter to be viable? what does that even mean?). But now that I know how much labor and time goes into making the bread, I get why it's pricier than Acme and the like. Ê Just the thought of Tartine makes me salivate. There's really nothing there I haven't loved from their pastries in the morning to their croques for brunch to fancy cakes for special occasions. But nothing beats their bread (fresh from the oven at 5pm) with some good old fashioned butter...

I love bread and Tartine is my match maker. Went today at 5pm (right when the bread comes out of the oven) trying the Country Loaf for the first time and it was amazing. ÊCrusty, chewy exterior & hot, robust, tender body the experience was whimsy. The bakers love/passion for good bread translates quite clearly. The entire loaf (its HUGE) was $7 but staff gladly sliced it in half and put it in separate bags for my friend and I. The place ALWAYS has a line but don't be dissuaded it moves quickly and trust me its well worth the wait! Bread is a must have but watch out soon enough you'll be coming back for the desserts as well! Cheers, Alex

EDIT: ÊEnded up at Tartine again with friends who wanted to go have a coffee and pastry. Ordered coffees and was moved aside to wait with four other people dying for coffee. 5min passed and my boyfriend said, "We're waiting here, but no one is working the espresso bar." ÊWe looked around and I was like what's the deal... It's a Saturday morning and there is a small crowd waiting for coffee and no one at the bar, yet staff are moving about freely. I took action by pointing out to the woman at the register, the same woman who had shuffled us all over by the bar to wait for our coffee, that no one was working at the bar. She then visually confirmed what I said, slowly had an "oooh yeah, you're right" moment. ÊThen passed the message along to someone else, who also passed it along to someone else. Eventually someone lackadaisically appeared to make the coffee. Sigh, oh Tartine, why? ---- I've been to Tartine numerous times and have always enjoyed myself, the espresso, and the goods behind the counter. That said, I brought an out of town friend here and everything was swell until I brought our plates and cups in from outside. I couldn't remember if we were supposed to bus our own table. To be safe about it, I brought our dishes inside to look for a tub which I didn't see. So I politely asked the woman behind the counter where I could put our dishes AND... ...She paused from what she was doing, rolled her eyes at me ... in a big way, scoffed, then told me in what was certainly not a friendly tone, to look behind the register... I couldn't believe it. My guest gasped (seriously lol). I just don't understand where the attitude came from. I have been to Tartine plenty of times and no one has ever been rude. If they are burdened by my business, I will take it elsewhere. ÊI was a fan, but now I think they are tres pretentious.

A pretty solid bakery with a lot of hype. If you're willing to wait in line and order the right thing, you will probably think it's worth it in the end. PROS: + Great bread on the sandwiches. + Lots of different desserts to try. CONS: - Ridiculously long lines that go out the door. They tend to move pretty fast, but it can still be quite long. - A bit pricey. NEUTRAL: - Given the number of people that eat here, it's difficult to rate the service because you are generally serving yourself (bus your own table, get your own water and utensils). FOOD: + Banana Cream Tart: I ordered this based on the Yelp! reviews and must say that while it was overall good (fresh banana, very nice cream texture and flavor), it wasn't all that it was hyped up to be. The crust of the tart was very crisp and required me to use a knife at full force just to cut through it. I was hoping for a flakier and softer crust that I could easily eat. To be fair, I may have come at an off time of day. + Pastrami sandwich with horseradish and gruyere cheese: this was a great sandwich. The bread was fantastic, though my friend claimed it cut the roof of her mouth (I had no issues). My only complaint is that there was an overabundance of horseradish that overpowered certain bites. If you're a fan of spicy horseradish, then this is the sandwich for you. = I really want to try the Chocolate Souffle Cake the next time I come here.

This place has earned the reputation of having the best bread in SF, so I was intrigued. It was close to 6pm Saturday night and still a line out the door. Price are a little steep here, but so good! I'm glad I don't pass by it everyday or I'd go broke and gain lots of weight. Is it really the BEST bread in SF? I can't really say. The bread is really good, esp since we got it right out the oven :) It's crispy on the outside but chewy on the inside...but a glutinous chewy, which sets it apart from most other breads I've had. Depending on personal preference, people either like it or not care for the texture. Lemon meringue cake looked too good to pass up. The slice was big enough to share, so I was grateful for that. Normally, I don't care for meringue, but this was really good! It was toasted perfectly that it tasted like creme brulee with moist lemon cake!! It was hard not to eat it all myself. The sandwiches looked really good too, I shall come back to try.

Granted, I stand in a 45-minute line with no guarantee that I'll even have a table to enjoy drinking my coffee & eating the bread pudding, tea cake, & croissant (Yes, you want to order more than 1 thing).....I'm willing to take the short-term anxiety. Yes, it's that amazing. You have to mentally prepare yourself to search for parking and wait in an awfully long line. Once you order and hopefully sit, you'll experience heaven in your mouth.

The rating for this review is very complicated, it takes into consideration all the hits and miss of this place. Let's start with the service - slow as hell. Tartine owners - you know there is a line on weekends, why not put another cashier? and another server? why one of the workers is sometimes at the achier and sometimes serving people? Would it cost that much to add another employee - or you have to see the line? Because of this behavior of the owner I have to worn you: STAY AWAY DURING THE WEEKEND. This place is right in my neighborhood - and I would never stand for 40 minutes to get anything baked, unless it is world war II all over again and like my grandfather I live in Leningrad during the siege. Ê Now if you decided coming during the week - NOT AROUND LUNCHTIME!!! (12:00-2:00). If you enjoy standing in line for almost an hour - please do. But it is my opinion that the owner/manager of this place should do more to cut the lines (and he can, trust me, there is nothing holding the line except for the fact they are always one employee short). I think it is rude and shows that he doesn't respect his clients. Now let's go to the food review. They have some good baked stuff. Best are the chocolate tea cake and the almond-lemon teacake - don't miss it. Their eclair is also very good. And on the weekends (remember I told you to stay away during the weekend? Friday's afternoon is an exception) they have canales which are also very good. All the rest? Mediocre at it best. Croissant Ê- heavy as hell, yes they are big, yes they look pretty, but if you ever been to paris and tasted a french croissant, you will immediately recognize that this place knows NOTHING about french patisserie and they should stay away from it. Same goes to their pain au chocolat - STAY AWAY! I also don't like their huge choco-ship and oatmeal cookie, and the lemon pie is simply disgusting - way too much egg yolks in the curd - feels like eating raw eggs. Sandwiches - also stay away, unless you like huge sandwiches - full of cheese and fat. I don't like it at all. BUT the carrot on the side is amazing and their side salad is also very simple and refreshing. So why do I keep on coming back to this horrible place? Because their tea cakes are amazing. Pretty expensive at 3.75$ per piece - but oh-so-good that I simply cannot resist!!! Go for the american baked goods - stay away from everything with a french name (except eclair) because they know Sh$%^ about it!

I'll be honest...when I heard about how long people typically line up for this place, I was skeptical. Luckily on the day I visited, the wait time was only about five minutes so I really had nothing to lose but another notch on the belt. While in line, I wanted to throw myself at some of the dishes that were being served to other customers - the open faced sandwiches are a work of art, the regular sandwiches look big enough to serve a party of three, and the bread pudding made me believe in the love between a man and his carbs. We ordered a slice of chocolate cake, their signature morning bun, and the gougre. What you need to know first is that everything tastes even better than it looks. What you think is going to be dry is beyond rich, and what looks rather plain is actually going to blow your mouth-mind. The cake was fine...I mean, chocolate is chocolate to me even though that's going to be blasphemy to some of you. The signature morning bun was incredibly dynamic with softer outer rings and a crunchy and feisty orange glaze in the center. If you're going to share this one, go for the middle right out of the gates. But the one that I'm going to have dreams about? That is hands down the gougre. Soft, moist and other words that become creepy when applied to anything but baked goods, this bun was packed with the flavours of glorious Gruyere, black pepper that means business, and thyme. Let's just say that had I not been sharing it with great friends, I would have run away to Vegas with it and gotten married at a drive-thru chapel. The crowd is really artsy and the feel is definitely reflected by the bakery itself. You bus your own table after you're done which is kind of cool, and it's lovely to see the really community they've built around indulgence.

What's up with this bread? Unfortunately I am still trying to figure it out. The bread is out of the oven at 5:00 p.m., I got to Tartine Bakery around 5:20 and started waiting in line which was already had about 30 people in it. ÊBy the time I got to the counter at 5:45pm, they were sold out of bread and taking reservations for bread at 7:00pm. Reservations for bread?! What kind of bread is this? Why do I need it so bad? I want this bread. So, after waiting 25 minutes - I wasn't satisfied leaving empty handed. I ordered two morning buns, a slice of pumpkin pie and ham croque monsieur sandwich. ÊI thoroughly enjoyed the morning bun and pumpkin pie desserts, to make up for the sadness and no bread. I'm not giving up, that bread will be MINE!

Well, that was quite an adventure-- trying to find this bakery! ÊParking is nearly impossible to find, but I was not going to miss out on a chance to try a place that has been deemed by "foodies" as THE PLACE to go, in San Francisco. ÊLucky us, we scored a parking spot and picked the ONE day that a crew was jackhammering outside the bakery. ÊUnless I'm blind, there is NO SIGNAGE saying that this is Tartine Bakery! ÊIt was mid-week, about 9am when we arrived. Ê We made our way in, and I was expecting a snooty staff, since so many reviews said that this is the case. ÊNope, didn't happen. Amidst the ear-splitting jackhammering, I told the young man I was a Tartine Virgin, and he patiently told me to take my time. ÊI zeroed in on the Orange Morning Muffin, then got a slice of ham and leek quiche and a coffee. ÊThe cashier was super friendly, and apologized for the noise. ÊWe scored a small table. Ê Let me tell you-- that morning muffin was worth the parking hassle. ÊIt was warm, tender, crunchy, chewy, with a perfect blend of orange and cinnamon. Heaven! We had to get a second one. The coffee was perfect. ÊThe quiche-- well, that wasn't my favorite. ÊThe custard was light and airy but had a strange "bitter" flavor to it. ÊIs this the best bakery I've EVER been to? No. But, if I could get my hands on that morning muffin recipe, I'd love to make some at home. ÊI'm glad I got a chance to come here. If I was in the neighborhood, I'd have my husband circle around, while I snag some more morning muffins. ÊOh, I took photos of the cakes, which looked beautiful.

After eating the amazing pastries in France and Italy, I didn't think I could find great pastries again. This place has crazy queues, but luckily I am blessed with great roommates who woke up early to surprise me with their great morning buns (so tender...melted in my mouth), almond crossants (tasted like the ones I had in France), and an assortment of pastries.

To all who enjoy a fancy sandwich and a delectable tart, why are you munching on that pre-packaged sandwich from the grocery store? You need to get a delicious sandwich from Tartine. As usual my friend Nikki and I ordered waaay too much food, but it was worth it. We shared a a spicy turkey open-faced sandwich and pastrami sandwich, while angry people waited for us to leave (not a lot of seating). The spicy turkey was very flavorful although I wish they had heated it up. The pastrami sandwich had a delicious spread and could have been shared among three people. Both sandwiches came with a pickled carrot that also had a nice kick to it. Unfortunately we ate too much and had no room for any pastries but I feel like I tasted them through my eyes. I'm definitely getting a lemon tart and a Mexican wedding cookie next time

I was fearful when I found out we were coming before 11:30 (the time when sandwiches are served). I'm not a big pastry eater so my breakfast breads are limited. Yet when I took my first bite of that fluffy, buttered croissant? Yeah, total convert. It was expensive, sure, but I didn't feel like I paid $4 for a crappy croissant. I was treated to a delicious breakfast that also included a piece of ham and cheese quiche. Again, not too eggy, cheesey, or full of ham... perfect blend. So glad we waited in line for this because it was GOOD. We went on a Sunday and arrived around 9:30am and the line was out the door, but I hear that weekdays it's a lot less frantic and you can easily snag the infamous morning buns. I was too stuffed from my own food to taste them, but my boyfriend noshed on those like it was his last meal on earth. Must be good in that case...!

3.5 stars. we stopped by here after seeing marvelous reviews. waited in line for 20 min like everyone else.... finally got to order: Ê Ê+ Ê orange morning bun -- apparently the must have is pretty good.. slightly crispy with sprinkling of sugar on top. liked the citrus-y flavor. it keeps pretty well for the whole day, too. =) perfect cuz we were walking around a lot & needed the calories. Ê Ê+ Ê Êpain au chocolat -- this thing is HUGE!! but unfortunately, it's dry and does not keep well. it also takes forever to get to the chocolate portion of the croissant. i prefer smaller croissants and while we did try to finish it.. it was just so dry that it ended up a quarter finished before being tossed. perhaps i had a bad one? Ê Ê+ Ê organic museli w/ strauss strained yogurt -- not memorable. museli texture & flavors got lost in the strained yogurt. yogurt texture was watery and thin. i liked that it's all organic .. but as a whole... it was okay (gave it to my portable trash can (hubby =P) who ate it all haha) Ê Ê+ Ê fresh bread pudding topped w/ sliced seasonal peaches -- this was the best thing cuz they were scooping out bread pudding fresh out of the kitchen. so that was a must have. it was actually really good with lots of egg texture and flavor, peaches and light glaze provided a subtle sweetness. (it looks more impressive as a dine in vs. take out). they serve four barrel coffee here too, just like proof bakery! parking is scarce ... but you if you snag one on the weekends, you're set (no limit on time)... which you'll need if you dine in cuz there is a LONG wait. dine-in is fairly crowded / noisy.. and the line to order is quite long (probably 15 minutes to get into the door). overall, pretty good... but i still like proof bakery (in atwater village) better. will there be a next time? maybe.. there are just too many yummy places to eat at in SF!

Spent the night in San Francisco with the goal of heading to Tartine's for their much hyped up Morning Bun. Ê Receipt: Cookie Bag - 8.50 (Ouch - I remember the cookies tasting better) Morning Buns - 5 @ 3.75 = 18.75 (Expected much more. ÊMy coworkers were happy about them though.) 4 " Banana Cream Tart - 6.50 (It's actually really good! Big though...try sharing) Spiced Turkey Dorado - 13.50 (Edges were a bit dry, but a good sandwich that I would have again. ÊYou can toast it up again and it won't be soggy like other sandwiches if you have any leftovers.) Total: 48.53 - Quite steep for my taste. Ê Self service for water. Not sure if I would return.

Been to Tartine many times and they have never disappointed. The lines are usually out the door but they are efficient at trying to get it moving, they can't do much more than that so I appreciate the effort. As far as the food, I would recommend the cakes first, as those always impress - specifically the bavarian coconut cream is amazing. The cookies are very good and have their own twist if you want to go simple. Pastries are solid, and their morning bun and croissants are definitely good but not their best point. The sandwiches are amazing and what converted me to Tartine from the beginning - definitely try them. The place is a bakery cafe so expecting much on service when they're always pretty busy isn't recommended. They take your order with a smile and get your food to you as fast as they can, I'm happy with that. Tables are bussed by customers and the place has a charming simple feel to it. Grab some sweets or food with a nice coffee/espresso and find a seat, you won't regret it.

This has to be the most popular corner in San Francisco (that doesnt involve trannies at least). I was there for 3 hours and I don't think I ever saw a break in the line that was out the door. Don't let that derail you though, the line moves pretty fast and it's worth the wait. I've been told to go back early to get the sticky buns which tend to run out by the afternoon. However, they have an amazing selection of cheese sandwiches (as well as meat filled, but i stopped looking after I saw cheese) and freshly baked treats. You really can't go wrong with any choice. The coffee is just as good and the barista is quick with the cups. Note that if you want just a regular coffee though, you get it yourself from a dispenser.... The place is super small, cozy and has that neighborhood vibe that just makes you want to say CHEERS. It's easy access right off the 16th street Bart station and if it's a nice day, take your treats to Dolores park!

One word - delicious. ÊMy wife had been here several times and I always wanted to check it out (especially after seeing the cover of their book with the incredible looking bread on it). ÊWe came early on a Sunday morning and there was a line outside but it didn't take them too long to get through it. ÊThere was so much activity going on that it was hard to take it all in. ÊYou could get a sneak peek into what they were making in the back. When we got to the counter I pretty much wanted everything that they had to offer but since we were having lunch relatively soon after I just got a chocolate croissant and a hot chocolate. ÊThe croissant didn't look like it had any chocolate in it but boy was I wrong after I bit into it. ÊThe bread was soft and flaky and the chocolate was delicious. ÊI can't wait to come back and have more since they have such a variety.

I made it a mission to not leave San Fran with stopping here after reading all the reviews. I am so thankful I did. The chocolate croissant was amazing!!! Just the croissant itself was delicious. The crust was so crispy, flakey and the bread inside was so fresh, soft. The chocolate filling was heavenly. It was a rich semi-sweet chocolate. Make sure you ask them to toast it. It tastes sooo much better when its warm. We also got a few other treats, the eclair was decadent. The friand, mexican wedding cookies, and latte were just okay. There was a bit of a wait on a wednesday morning-but it was totally worth it. There are a few tables inside and outside to enjoy your pastries.

I was running late to meet up with my friends for an all-out foodie adventure. They had gotten to Tartine already and so I had my friend pick up a morning bun for me. The morning bun was so delicious. Flaky, sugary goodness. Even hours later when I brought it to my boyfriend to try, it was just as well. It has a hint of orange or ginger or something that makes it delicious! I also go to try the banana cream tart which is really hard to eat because the tart itself is a bit hard, but man, the cream is delicious. The bananas were good. The bottom of the tart has this chocolate caramel mix and that's good as well. I'll definitely have to come here sometime with the bf and try even more desserts.

How is it that I never wrote a review? I love this place so much! ÊI hate driving Êand parking in SF, but I'll be sure to make a huge detour and circle for 15 min to find parking, just to come to Tartine. ÊI always pick up a Banana Cream Tart and a Lemon Tart. Ê Be sure to stop by Bi-rite for their salted caramel ice cream after you buy your pastries. BANANA CREAM TART ($6.50) : Most amazing tart ever! It's a huge flaky pastry lined with chocolate and filled with fresh bananas, banana cream, and whipped cream, and topped with some beautiful chocolate shavings. I really love their cream filling. I also like how the inside is lined with chocolate because it prevents the pastry from getting soggy. ÊIt's a little messy to eat, but who cares when it's so delicious. If there's only one thing you order from Tartine, make sure it's the Banana Cream tart. LEMON TART ($6.25) : As much as I like Bouchon Bakery's Lemon tart, I actually like Tartine's even more. ÊPerfect amount of tartness, with a delicious thin shortbread crust. They put a nice dollap of whipped cream on the top too. BREAD PUDDING ($3.50) : Pretty good bread pudding served in a cute little cup. ÊOne of the better bread puddings I've ever had, but in general I'm not a huge fan of bread pudding. LEMON MERINGUE CAKE : Genoise cake soaked in lemon juice and filled with lemon cream. I like the torched meringue on the outside, but I didn't like the cake itself very much. I wouldn't recommend this. Ê CROQUE MONSIEUR ($9.75) : I've only had this once, so I don't know if I happened to have a poorly made one. ÊEven though it's good, I found it a bit dry, and have definitely had better Croque Monsieur's else where.

So lots and lots of folks on Yelp have mentioned the customer service issues at Tartine. ÊHere's my latest: I go in on a Monday for a loaf of bread. ÊThe line to order baked goods is at least 8 deep. ÊI just want a loaf of bread, and if they are sold out then I don't want anything else. ÊOnce I finally get to the front of the line, I am told "we don't make bread on Mondays, sorry".

Wednesday, I go in for a loaf of bread. ÊThe line to order baked goods is at least 12 deep. ÊI just want a loaf of bread, and if they are sold out then I don't want anything else. ÊTen minutes later I finally get to the front of the line, I am told "we are sold out of bread, sorry". ÊSo I turn around and go (and watch a guy pull 2 dozen loaves out in a wagon). Would it really KILL the counter staff to every once in a while say "Just an FYI for the people in line, we are sold out of bread!" ÊBetter yet, let's get some six sigma going in this joint and have a little sign on the front door that says "All out of bread" that could simply be flipped around as soon as the final loaf is sold! Turns out you need to call and reserve a loaf in advance- I'm not kidding. ÊBut of course the counter person didn't mention that, either. ÊTwo stars instead of one because of the 5 star pastries.

Look: Tartine is good. The presentation is excellent and the pastries, cakes, and cookies all look mouth-wateringly delicious. I've have eaten a morning bun (or two), pain au chocolat, and a hazelnut tart. Really, they're tasty. But... I can't help but feel like the reviews are way overblown. I have to subtract a star because the line is normally so long as to not be worth it. Getting a table inside or out seems so close to impossible that I've never even wanted to try. And while the staff is friendly and helpful, I feel like there is some kind of haughty vibe coming from the whole cafe. "We are Tartine and we are better than you. End of story." It's good...but maybe not as life-changing as one might expect it to be. Still, I'll eat a Tartine morning bun any day and won't say no to a good pastry, regardless of where it comes from.

Pros: Croque Monsier (with ham, as it was originally intended), morning buns, and any of the tarts (banana, almond, strawberry?) Cons:.... the lines are long and seating is very limited. So if you come with a group of friends, don't sit down saving seats while your other friends are waiting in line ordering because well..... the people who have actually received their food are hovering over you giving you dirty looks lol! Trust that by the time you receive your food, you'll have found seating and everyones a happy camper! Or... just don't come here with a group!

This is an awesome bakery located on the corner of Guerrero and 18th St in the Mission District. I love coffee and pastries and this place is an absolute gem! Started in 2002 by husband and wife Chad Robertson and Elisabeth Prueitt, Tartine resumed the pair's success from their acclaimed Bay Village Bakery and has since grown to be an insanely popular stop for locals and tourists alike. The couple won the nationally prestigious James Beard Foundation Award in 2008 for Outstanding Pastry Chef. My favorites here are the bread, cookies, cream tarts, and croissants. The bread here is legendary and probably considered one of the pinnacles of the artisan bread movement. Available after 5 PM every day except Mondays in full or half loaves, the naturally leavened bread tastes sweet and airy and is perfect to take home for dinner. The beloved popularity of the bread indeed spawned their best-selling book "Tartine Bread." The dark chocolate cookies were a decent size and extremely crunchy. I didn't know it was possible for cookies to have this texture and taste without being overly sweet. The banana cream tart is arguably their most famous pastry: "flaky pastry coated in dark chocolate with caramel, pastry cream, and lightly sweetened cream." An extraordinary creation! The exquisite croissants were extremely delicate, buttery and tasty. Not quite like the croissants at my favorite bakery, Amandine Patisserie, down in west LA, but right up there on par. I've also tried their clairs, scones, and quiches. All pretty good. Maybe next time I'll try their hot pressed sandwiches. I must admit the prices are on the higher side, but the quality of the bread and pastries here is just phenomenal! Every single visit has been a pleasant experience with above average service, despite the bad parking and long lines. Just be smart about picking when to visit and plan to stay here for awhile. All in all, this bakery is a must-visit in SF and definitely worth your while with Bi-Rite Creamery, Delfina/Pizzeria Delfina, and Dolores Park all on the same block!

There are a crap ton of people in here, and the reason for that is the tastiness of their pastries and bread. ÊMy friends and I waited in a long ass line, with no hopes of finding a seat, for about 45 minutes. ÊI garnered myself a morning bun, a frangipane tart, and a masala chai. ÊAll was good, especially the morning bun. ÊIt had tasty orange/cinnamon sprinkled all over it with love, and I could taste the love. I meant to order the bread pudding that I saw several people order across the restaurant, but after passing by the pastry case I had completely forgotten. ÊMaybe next time...

Oh Tartine... As though there weren't enough praises being sung. ÊIn some ways I wish you didn't exist lest my waistline disappear forever. Seeing as it's labor day weekend and an opportune time to buy pastries galore with the assumption that there will be multiple other mouths to feed, I decided to acquire a shopping list of items from Tartine today. ÊOf those that I purchased and tried, from favorite to least favorite: Chocolate eclair: I'm not usually an eclair person but by some stroke of heavenly luck, a friend of mine is. ÊThe first thing that comes to mind upon a bite is "goodness GRACIOUS that is some amazing chocolate." As noted on numerous signs, Tartine uses Valrhona in what seems to be all things chocolate there, and they certainly aren't shy about it. A thick, 1-2mm layer of dark chocolate blankets the top of each eclair and perfectly compliments the soft, smooth, pure vanilla bean cream that is fresh enough to still feel the very very slight crunch of the eclair pastry shell. This one pretty much blew me away. Lemon cream tart: Second chart-topper was the lemon cream tart. I've always had an affinity for these so it wasn't too surprising that I loved it. The lemon was bright and tart, the tart shell thin and sightly crunchy. Simple splendor. Plain croissant: HUMONGOUS and flakey beyond belief, this item was so good I finished it all in probably 10min max. ÊI devoured it so quickly I felt slightly sick. Considering that it's borderline dangerous I probably won't buy this one again. Chocolate chip cookie: the first time I had it, the cookie was so light and crisp it almost didn't seem like a cookie, but I found it powerfully addictive. ÊIt's thin as two stacked saltine crackers and has random pieces of dark chocolate throughout, as well as bits of oatmeal and walnut. I didn't like the walnut so much but the cookie was still great - just need to watch when you get it because it seems to get stale pretty quickly (considering it's thinness). My second taste of the cookie was a bit stale, too much chew in the place of crisp. Morning bun: surprisingly enough, the morning bun Tartine is supposed to be known for was my least favorite of them all. It reminded a bit of a churro with orange zest at the center, which I didn't like much. The bun is light ad flakey as the making/baking process is probably similar to their croissant technique, but again, the flavoring was off for me. The orange was almost sickening, too syrupy and pronounced. That being said, I had my doubts whether I'd like a pastry like that, so if you're generally a fan of morning buns I can see that one being dream-worthy. Pounds heavier as I write this, I still must grudgingly admit: All. Completely. Worth it.

It's been over 3 years since I last reviewed Tartine and I still love it as much as the first day I went there. And perhaps I love it more because of their amazing baked bread! For those of you who haven't had it, definitely try to get there when they're serving it fresh out of the oven every Wednesday through Sunday, after 5:00 pm, in full or half loaves. They're pretty large so if you're only buying for yourself, I would strongly suggest the half loaf. The olive is my favorite but I hear the sesame is also very delicious. And another addition to my review...after passing it by several times, I finally tried their Bread Pudding. Delicious! Best I've ever had and you should definitely try it, even if you're not usually a fan of Bread Pudding. I'm thankful I don't live closer to Tartine only because I prefer my clothes to fit...but it is a truly amazing place. :-)

This morning bun is amazing! It's like two very good things put in one: crossaint and cinnamon bun! Not too sweet and very crispy. Just the right kick. This is totally making my morning start of the week... I am lucky though - no need to wait in line - someone brought them into the office for me...

So much more than caffeine at Tartine! Step out of the Mission and into Pa-ree! I have heard about Tartine for years but never made it in until now. ÊWe dropped in after a heavy morning of vintage-store shopping on Valencia street. Ê I immediately spied someone eating an open-faced sandwich and announced "THAT's what I'M having..."until I looked at the menu. ÊAnd then began the delicious torture of choosing. ÊThere were basically three "savory" options: ÊCroque Monsieur (open face sandwich with bechamel (white sauce) ham, cheese and asparagus; pressed sandwiches; and quiche. ÊAll looked amazing. We were told that we could have the Croque "right away" but we'd have to wait 15-20 for the pressed sandwiches. ÊWe decided to wait because we didn't have a table anyway and they looked so yummy. We finally got a table (I am giving 4 stars only because of the great difficulty we had to get a table) and our food arrived shortly thereafter. ÊI do love me a good exaggeration but I do believe it was the BEST pressed sandwich I ever ate. All three sandwiches were served on Tartine's own thick crusted bread and I think there was some cheese baked right into the bread. ÊMy sandwich had chopped almonds, cheese, sage, lemon and olive oil and it was sublime. ÊMy daughter had a three cheese sampler and I think hers was actually the best. ÊThe husband had ham and cheese and it was wonderful too. The portions are huge huge huge. ÊWe could easily have done with two sandwiches for the three of us and trust me, we are NOT light eaters. ÊBut we happily got "to go" boxes." We also tried a coconut and passionfruit cake that looked more amazing than it tasted. ÊBut I'm sure there are tons of good desserts. ÊThe coffee was great and there is plenty of water too. ÊDefinitely on my "gotta get back there soon" list.

It took me a while until I actually went in, despite having walked by numerous times, but my roomie had been talking about it forever and we wanted to grab something to eat - so hello tartine. the space is pretty small and it can be tough to get a table/seat, but the food is delicious and just walking in and soaking up the delicious smell makes you want to buy everything. They have amazing and creative options, so everyone will find something and once you've tasted tartine you will go back for more. this bakery is divine!

Still a 5 star in my book. I've since tried their PLAIN and ALMOND CROISSANT, MORNING BUN, and FRESH FRUIT ALMOND CAKE. ÊThese were all great, I'd reorder them all. Ê I must mention that good almond croissants are hard to come by. ÊSome places just cannot make these without the artificial flavor and thick gross filling. ÊThis is not the case at Tartine. ÊThere were no artificial flavoring at all or the gross thick paste. ÊBeware, their croissants are a decent size and are highly addicting. NOTE: Line do form before the place even opens on the weekends...trust me, I know from personal experience. ÊTake that and image the traffic this place has during the weekends.

Being new to San Francisco, I wasn't actually aware of Tartine until I heard the hullabaloo around Chad Robertson's Tartine Bread cookbook. ÊAnd truth be told, I bought that darn cookbook within 1 viewing of the promo video(http://www.tartinebread.É) and made a mental note to get my ass to that bakery ASAP. Following the Tartine method of making bread has made me x1million more appreciative of delicious, delicious bread. ÊAnd when we finally made plans to go try some, saying that I was excited is an understatement. ÊBut Mr. Robertson, I've gotta tell you - they are absolutely RUINING your bread in the pressed sandwiches by making them transparent with grease. I get that you've gotta grease up the ol' panini grill to get the sammie on and off in a timely fashion, and I get that greasy things inside of sandwiches (I'm lookin' at you, cheese) will seep out to the bread. ÊBut holy jeebus the greasy bread on my sandwich proved to be an insurmountable barrier. ÊI ate 1/3 of my $12 sandwich and boxed up the rest to go. Flash forward to right now - I've reheated my remaining 2/3 in the oven, and when I picked it up from the baking sheet it left a pool of grease behind. ÊI set it on a folded napkin as though it was a dripping slice of bacon. ÊAgain, I was only able to stomach another 1/3 before throwing in the towel. ÊLe sigh. The conclusion for us is, unsurprisingly, that next time we go to Tartine, we'll take a loaf home and make our own sandwiches. Despite the disappointing sandwich experience, the pastries blew us away (and are what took this review from 3 to 4 stars). ÊI'll readily add my 5 stars to the pile for the morning bun (the orange is such a surprising and welcome zing!) and the eclair was just as decadent. ÊEverything in the window looks to-die-for (and I'll bet it is). So in conclusion: Tartine Bread book, 5 stars. ÊTartine pastries, 5 stars. ÊTartine sandwiches? Ê3 stars, unless they take a good hard look at their recipes and cut the grease by a significant amount. ÊWill definitely be back!

So glad I live nowhere near here, otherwise I'd easily take off 10 years of my life from overeating. 20 minutes was completely worth the wait, even though they ran out of their 3 most popular items - the banana tart, morning bun, and almond croissant. All the other options were gorgeous, so it wasn't hard to find other great options and the staff are super friendly, so you forget you had been waiting forever. The bread pudding is light, with texture between a fluffy quiche and a flan. I never thought fruit topping would go with this, but it was the best part. We got a quiche and Tres Leches cake to go, but couldn't help ourselves and none of it made it out of store. The ham quiche crust was flaky and buttery, it was a perfect textbook quiche. The tres leches cake was not very milky but so moist, perfectly layered, and yummy. Their coffee is pretty good too to boot! In order to make up for all the damage I'm going to do next time, I'll have to walk the two miles there and back, but it will be so worth it. ***UPDATE*** That be some fiiiiine almond croissant. Decent lemon bar but nothing special. Coconut cream pie = crack cocaine.

I know Tartine, you have 3045 reviews...but this was a great intro to misty micro-climate SF and you served up some delectable coffee and pastries...so I'll be review #3046. Croque Monsieur...bonjour...ca va? Ca va bien! Chocolate croissant...yes please... It looked like it was going to be a standing room only situation but the ebb and flow of this place worked.

So obvi this place is legit. ÊI didn't give it 5 stars because the last time I went, they gave me a lemon tart instead of a lemon meringue slice and I didn't enjoy the lemon tart at all (the only thing thus far from Tartine that I've disliked). If you come here for brunch on Sat/Sun, you're going to wait so just get over it. ÊIf you're driving here, I suggest coming with at least another person - one of you waits in line while the other finds parking - team work! My faves: - frangipane croissant - banana cream pie - the crust is so flaky, it's unbelievable - fresh coffee - good tasting plain coffee is hard to come by - shiitake mushroom croque moniseur - any of their quiches - morning bun! Êi always get 2 so i can eat the other one the next day, such a treat! Good, but will prob not get again due to my faves list: - chocolate croissant - plain croissant - tres leches cake - frangipane tart - bread pudding - chocolate chip oatmeal cookie

Duh! What should you expect when you get to Tartine? Long lines, crowded tables, and expensive food. You better decide what you want to get before you make it to the counter. Everyone in the world is waiting behind you! This will be an expensive treat. What's good here? Everything! From the incredible pastries, croissants, cakes, and cookies with the perfect texture and crumb, to the sandwiches and quiches with interesting and delicious ingredients (sandwiches can take 15 minutes to make, so beware!). The best savory thing I've had at Tartine has to be the croque monsieur with mushrooms (rather than ham). The best sweet thing I've had at Tartine has to be the lemon bar. This is the quintessential bakery. A must.

I went here this morning at 9:30 AM and the line was pretty huge already! ÊAnyways, despite living in the Bay Area for a long time, this was my first time visiting it and though the line was intimidating, I'd say it moved pretty quickly. Anyways, my friends and I ordered a bunch of things, but mine specifically were the Morning Bun, Rocher w/ Cocoa Nibs, Frangipane Croissant, and Banana Cream Tart (to save for later). ÊThey were all really great, but the stand out things to me were the Morning Bun and Banana Cream Tart. ÊMorning Bun was soft, crunchy, and flaky--I thought it lived up to its promise. ÊThe Banana Cream Tart was also really good, not too sweet and the pastry wasn't as Êhard as some of the reviews I read claimed it to be. I can see why it might be hard to cut with a plastic utensil, but I think it shouldn't be a problem with metal utensils. I tried some of my friend's orders and their Bread Pudding is really good as well with the seasonal fruits on top. ÊAnother one I really liked was the Gougere, but it might've been because I was loaded up on sugar and needed something savory to balance it out. Still, I thought it was pretty great and I'd love to get that again when I get the chance to venture out here. Service was alright, I didn't get any of the infamous 'tude that I've been reading about here, but maybe that's because I went in the morning and they're just getting started. Anyways, it lived up to my expectations and that's 4-stars for me.

I'm a big fan of the 7x7 100 things to eat before you die list, and I noticed early on that Tartine was the only place with TWO items on the list. ÊThe first time I went, I had the morning bun, the quiche, and the airy gruyere roll thing (I can't remember the name, though). ÊEverything was great, especially the morning bun. ÊHad just a little bit of a hint of orange, but the texture was perfect, the bun was flaky, and the cinnamon flavor stuck with me for a long time. ÊI also loved that gruyere roll and the quiche too. ÊI've been back a number of times since, having those same three things almost everytime, as well as the eclair (awesome as well), bread pudding with apples (very good), and cookies (mostly good). Ê However, recently my wife and I decided to go wait in line for the fresh loaf of bread so I could check something else off the 7x7 list. ÊWe found out from a friend that the bread is ready at 5 pm, so we showed up one day at 4:55, only to see a line of 30+ people, which ran outside the restaurant. ÊUh oh. ÊIt was a bit hectic out there, since I guess one line is for pre-orders and the other is for everyone else. ÊThe people out there were quite restless, as the line moved a bit slowly. ÊWhen we finally got to the front, we were told that we were the lucky winners of the LAST half-loaf of sesame seed bread. ÊThe bread was warm, light and crispy on the outside, and soft and yummy on the inside. ÊWe finished half of the bread before we even got home, and had to fight the urge to eat it all in the car! Ê Now I understand why Tartine gets two items on the list! ÊI can't wait to go back to get more bread, but next time I'll call ahead. ÊI advise you all do the same as well (unless of course you want to eat all of the other baked goodies, in which case you'll have to wait in line anyway).

Between the three of us, we ordered a vegetarian quiche, the bread pudding, and the seasonal fruit tart.

Parking was horrible and there's always a line when you know it's a good place to get pastries! It was so packed inside we had to get our food to go and we got the morning roll which was delicious! It was nice and crunch and it had a orange twist, yum! I didn't like the bread pudding. It was my first time trying and probably my last. I guess it had to do with the texture and also the fruit was really chewy and you get it in a cup, but since we got it to go we had to get it in a box and the presentation didn't look very appealing =( Lastly, the popular banana cream tart had a lot of whip cream on top and I wish it had more of that yummy pudding. It was a nice personalize size, but I shared with the bf and it had a good amount of banana and was really tasty. I just wish the tart wasn't so hard and easier to eat, but other than that I liked it and also the fresh shaved chocolate on top :)

Tartine, I really really wanted to like you. I did. But... you are way wayyy overhyped. Came here with the boy, while we were in the area, because we'd walked past it a few times in the past, and the aromas are mmm mmm delicious. It was a gorgeouss day in San Francisco, so we weren't too surprised that the line was long - way out the door. Parking sucks around here, so we just parked in one of the 10min spots in front of the bakery, while we stood in line. But.. .the line did NOT take 10 minutes to go through. Luckily, we didn't get ticketed, but honestly, I don't know why the line took so long. With the amount of people working behind the counter, I feel like they need to figure out a better system. I ordered a quiche and lemon tart, while the boy ordered bread pudding. They had a mix-up, because they didn't know that we ordered separately, which was alright, I suppose. My total for two items was $11 [I forgot how much his was]. We waited for them to heat up the quiche, which was nice of them. [Oh, and the packaging is pretty cute too] However, because there was no space, we just stood near the cash register. The boy leaned against one of the pillars, and jumped. We looked up, and saw that the pillar had definitely moved at least a foot [you could see where the top of the pillar was supposed to be, and where it moved to]. He hit it again lightly, and it went back into place. Um. We got out of there as fast as we could. I don't know how old the building is, but it definitely needs to be examined. We ate everything when we got home [well, I ate the quiche in the car, because I couldn't resist.]. The lemon tart was delicious, the quiche was good, and the bread pudding was... average. So.. in short: Ambiance? Alright. Hipsters galore. Building itself? Scary. Food? Not bad. Worth the money? Probably not.

As recommended by my San Fran cousin Paul, me and my BF stopped into Tartine on a cold and kinda damp Monday around 11:00am. I thought we would beat any lunch crowd but the place was packed and fortunately, we were able to snag an outside table. So many choices...we decided on the brioche bread pudding served with berries, a plain croissant and two hot mochas. The mochas were HUGE! Like a bowl of mocha soup really but I ain't complaining as it helped fuel a long walk later. The bread pudding was outstanding, I could have eaten large amounts of it and still would want more. The plain croissant was delicious - flaky and buttery but not the best I've ever had. We loved this place so much that we are planning on a quick stop on our drive back to Colorado as a much needed sugar/caffeine boost for the 20 hour trip.

I called one of my good friends JK and I told her about a dream I had. In the dream JK said "when you have a morning bun you have to make a wish before you eat it". So she secretly planned a SF tour for me. This was one of the stops. All I can say was that dreams do come true we split the morning bun and made a wish...

Ham and cheese giant croissant o' love, why are you so bad for me but taste so so good??? This is one of those bakeries that just screams San Francisco the moment you step into it. The close knit quarters, the fresh smell of all of the baked goods, the hipster crowd waiting in line for what you know is the highest of quality and locality in all of the ingredients they serve. And for that you will spend a pretty penny here being local and eating at one of the more famous bakeries in the SF area. That ham and cheese croissant that literally will melt in your mouth costs $5. Definitely pricey for one pastry, even though it is a pretty large one. We also got their famous cinnamon swirl roll thing which was good, but as tasty as that ham and cheese item which I know was packed with butter, but hey that's what makes pastries taste so good in the first place, right? I just wish everything was a little bit cheaper here is all!

Finally we braved the line to scratch off the morning buns off the 7x7 list AND the double pain au chocolat off "The Best Thing I Ever Ate" list. ÊWas it worth circling around continuously for parking (though we finally ended up w/a spot right in front) & waiting for 20-25 minutes in on/off again rain (luckily it didn't start til I got my pastries & was on my way out)? ÊNot really. Ê *Morning bun ($3.75): Liked the orange cinnamon flavor and the slight stickiness, but mine was a little harder than his. ÊMine may have been out of the oven for a little longer than his, but I think for the hefty price tag, it should be pretty perfect. ÊIn all honesty though, I think this is the first morning bun I've ever tried. Ê *Double Pain Au Chocolat ($4.25): Super flakey and lots of rich chocolate. ÊOne of the better chocolate croissants I've had, though I think it's a little too decadent for the morning. Ê Three morning buns & a double pain au chocolat = $15.50. ÊGood lord....that could buy me hella tacos in the Mission! ÊI don't know if I'd go back, but, hey at least I said I've been there & done that!

Is writing a review of Tartine Bakery required for Yelp membership? It seems like it. I've never had anything here I didn't like. That qualifies for as good as it gets, right? Granted, it's well nigh impossible to find parking around here and the seating situation is a every man for himself ordeal, but that shouldn't take away from the awesome baked goods they pump out here. I guess the great thing about Tartine is that you're meant to take it with you, and you can head over to Dolores Park and eat it there if it's sunny. Otherwise just roll up with someone else driving and do a hit-and-run Tartine run. The croissants are tres bien. The almond croissants are also tres bien. The chocolate croissants, while also being excellent, could do with a little more chocolate inside. It's not like I'm expecting a whole chocolate bar wrapped in buttery, flaky dough, but more than a few morsels would be great. The banana cream tarts here are fantastic. I'd fight a wolverine if it came near me while I was eating one. The gougeres are almost incomparable. The pressed sandwiches will not disappoint. If you're reading this, you're not really deciding whether or not to come here, so what's the dealbreaker? You don't like the Mission? You feel like the feng shui of this bakery is wrong? OK, I don't want to hype up this place too much if this happens to be the only review you read on this place, so my overall evaluation is, "yeah, if you're in the area, go ahead and drop in."

Not really being a sweets type of guy, I hardly ever look forward to desserts (with the exceptions being Mango Go-Go at 37degrees and Kings Hawaiian Paradise Cake). ÊI must admit that Tartine has made some awesome creations over the years! Tonight: I had the Passion Fruit cake with dried coconut crust. It was very interesting, the cake was fluffy: the texture was divine! The actual cake was tart yet the natural sweetness was just enough to make it the perfect shade of deliciousness. I love coconut. In fact, when I'm in Hawaii i normally go to that vendor guy who machettes the top for me, like twice a day during my vacations. ÊSome how dried coconut is a mere shadow of the real thing! ÊI know it's probably not feasible to have fresh young coconut topping, but that would be SO much better than the dried stuff.... The wait: not so bad tonight The cake: not sweet at all, yet the perfect dessert My tummy: satisfied as usual, thanks Tartine!

Why take the bus on a beautify day from downtown when I can walk there. ÊIt's only a few blocks right? ÊMy mistake, city blocks, yeah, after walking, what felt like 4.5 miles, I took the bus the remaining way. ÊWell, now I worked up an appetite. ÊJust as many yelpers described, there was a line to the door, but it moves quickly. ÊI had enough time to drool all over their showcase. I decided on two croissants, the almond (it's a must) and the chocolate (also a must). ÊThe almond one was huge, flaky, covered in powdered sugar, and sliced toasted almonds on top with almost paste in the middle. Ê I will admit that it looked better than tasted. ÊIt taste was good, just not great. ÊThe component that was disappointing was that there was too much powdered sugar. ÊIt masks the flavor the beautiful almond paste in side, the main attraction. The chocolate croissant was also a base-hit, but not a home-run. ÊIt also had the same characteristics, large, golden brown, flaky, but when it came to the chocolate, there just wasn't enough. All in all, the inside is very neat and I could see myself eating, reading a paper or book, eating again, sipping some coffee, etc... ÊI would certainly be willing to try it again, but this time I would take the bus the whole way, it wasn't worth walking. ÊEnjoy!

How could you go wrong with 4.5 stars out of 2.7k reviews?! Being as I was on a mission to try as much of the 7x7 big eat SF list within a few hours, I knew this had to be my first breakfast spot! The morning buns were delightful! It was everything every reviewer said it would be, the perfect hybrid between a flaky croissant and a sweet cinnamon roll. The orange zest is a perfect complement! I also tried the lemon cream tart which was very tart of course. It was tasty, but the morning bun stole the limelight! I need to try their espresso next time! Be sure to try to grab a table as soon as you see someone getting ready to leave! It gets crowded.

This place actually lives up to the hype. ÊIf you haven't already tried this place, go now. Go today b/c it actually is that good. ÊI'm a bit of a baker myself so I feel I can review this place from that perspective. ÊAs you may Êknow, their morning bun is listed as one of the foods to eat before you die. ÊI whole-heartedly agree - outstanding!! ÊThe bread was perfect consistency, light and doughy (even in the late afternoon when not fresh out of the oven). ÊThere is s slight citrus taste that was spot-on - not too sweet or overpowering. Ê We also ordered 2 sandwiches and got to taste their bread first hand. ÊYep, perfection. ÊWe had a croque monsieur, which wasn't typical, but wonderful anyway. ÊIt was huge and served panini style with oven dried tomatoes. ÊWe also had a smoked cheese sandwich w/ quince jam that I had to wrap up and take home b/c we were stuffed from the other sandwich. The only thing that wasn't perfect was the service. ÊWe had this dingy girl who was absolutely clueless who waited on us at the counter. ÊNot only was she slow, but she forgot to put in our 2nd sandwich order all together and I had to remind her twice. ÊReally poor service and they weren't that swamped at the time. ÊBut the other servers seemed just fine. Great atmosphere and consistently busy. ÊWe sat next to a couple who drove 2 hours to get there and ordered 10 loaves of bread the day before. ÊYeah, now that's dedication! Ê I can't wait to head back for my next round of goodies at this gem.

I've never really ventured into the Mission until this past year and I should be ashamed of myself for missing out on places like Tartine Bakery for so long. We got to the Tartine Bakery at about 7:50PM and they closed at 8PM, so instead of trying to find parking, we just stopped at the street corner while I raced in to try to pick something up. Even though they were closing up in 10 minutes, the place was still packed (that's how popular they are). I was immediately attended but had no idea what to get. The server recommended the bread pudding (as it is one of their most popular desserts), so I got a cup ($3.50). After she packed the box with bread pudding, I annoyingly asked if she could separate it into two separate boxes (for two people) and she willingly obliged. Not only did she separate the pudding into two boxes, but she actually added a bit more to each box to make it more "full." End price: $3.50. WOW! The bread pudding itself was pretty good (even though I'm not the biggest fan of apples). It was rather cold but I'm assuming that's how it's made. I must update this review because I know I will be back again to try their other wonderful desserts. I also wish they would be open a bit later as it would a perfect place to catch desserts after a nice meal in the Mission.

Heavenly. Thats really the only word to describe their country bread right out of the oven. ÊCrisp, sweet crust with caramelized flavors. Delicous hearty, almost gooey center. The aroma is intoxicating. Other tasty things: -tea breads: Rich, sweet chocolate. Citrus, sweet almond lemon poppy seed. ÊAnd banana bread, just the right amount of nuts and good banana. -hazelnut torte: The chocolate is rich and creamy. Crust is buttery and falls apart. Wonderful. -Shortbread: Its so crumbly, sweet, and buttery. Basically, the best bakery I've ever been to. Its that good.

A friend of mine recommended this place. The place wasn't hard to find despite the lack of signage. It was a loud morning because of the drilling of the construction workers just outside Tartine that day. I said "NO" to myself right away until I had a bite of their morning bun. It was heaven! I brought a lot of the morning bun to the east coast and didn't share a piece with anyone! That's how greedy it'll make you when you try it. My husband and son had the ham quiche and I would say I would stick to the morning bun. This is definitely going to be one of my to go place when I visit SF again.

What more can I add to the 3,135 reviews before me? It's amazing what these guys can do with the right combination of the humble flour, yeast, butter and water. ÊEven the simple loaf of bread was good enough to make it to the 7X7 list (http://www.foodspotting.É). ÊAs is the morning bun, which people would line up more than 30 minutes at 9AM on Saturdays for. Ê I personally am a bigger fan of their light and crusty butter croissant than I am their morning bun, and for that, I really don't have to get there until the line for the morning bun dies down (and the morning buns run out) at around 3PM. The cherry on top was the espresso bar serving the neighborhood's other most famous export, Four Barrel coffee.

Perfectly executed baked goods. This is inspite of the whopping volume they produce. I only wish I could get a decent cup of brewed coffee. They use Four Barrel coffee, which is perfection. ÊProblem is the ratio of coffee to water, not enough coffee, and the brewing and thermal pots. What you get is a weak cup of lukewarm coffee.

Not that Tartine needs another review! We had the Pecorino & Almond and Prosciutto & Provolone Hot Pressed Sandwich (aka gourmet grilled cheese). YES they were delicious. The sandwiches are a lot more substantial that you would think (especially for $12-13). They make their own super hearty bread and use quality ingredients. Two people could easily share one sandwich and a pastry. We also had the chocolate hazelnut tart and slice of chocolate souffle cake. Once again, pretty price but a good size. The tart crust and chocolate cake was just ordinary. The heart poured out in the foam of the cappuccino was a nice touch. Love their effort to be more sustainable. The employees were not the friendliest. This could be the result of the high volume of people they deal with or just the attitude you acquire from being such a popular place. They have signs posted asking people to clear their own tables. All I wanted to know was where to place our dishes and our recyclables. It was like pulling teeth trying to get an answer from the three employees inches from me.

I'm seriously mad at anyone who gives this place anything less than the five stars it very clearly deserves (just kidding, but mostly serious). But I mean, come on... HAVE YOU SEEN THE PICTURES OF THE CHOCOLATE CROISSANTS?! ÊHAVE YOU TASTED THE MORNING BUN?! (*insert lewd and corny joke about morning buns*) I came here with my friend on a thursday morning at 9am, and there was already a line out the door. ÊWe smelled the rich aroma of freshly baked buttery sugary pastries from a block away, and walked towards tartine with our noses leading the way. Ê We split a chocolate croissant and a morning bun (kind of like a mix between a cinnamon roll and a donut), both of which had just come out of the oven. ÊThe outsides were crispy, flaky, sugary, delicioius, and the insides were creamy and flaky at the same time (i mean, how is that even possible??). Ê We looked so ecstatic that the people next to us offered to take a picture of us with the pastries. ÊThe two girls who were ahead of us in line got two pastries EACH. ÊI salute them. Ê One more thing that's awesome about this place, all of the bread art!

Finally! I've heard about Tartine Bakery since forever. And I have attempted 2 times to have the Tartine experience, but have always come short. Attempt #1: Rainy day. Coffee and pastries at 2pm? Let's go! Treck to the Mission from NOPA. Arrive at Tartine, line is OUT the door. Finally reach counter to find that there isn't much left. Decide to go to Bi-Rite for ice cream and had the Bi-Rite experience instead. Attempt #2: Rainy day again.. Friend with car says "Tartine?" I say yes, lets go! I think I don't have a car in the city because the parking gods hate me! Took FOREVER to finally find a spot - albeit, illegally, with hazard lights on and one of us stayed with car (sigh, me.) to make sure a ticket/tow free adventure. Already, what a pain. I just sat in the car listening to the radio for what seemed like eternity when my friend came back with a morning bun, a regular croissant, and a latte for him and regular coffee for me. Everything was good - especially that morning bun, but I think the circumstances strained my ability to fully appreciate the Tartine experience. Attempt #3: On the mark! Took an out of town friend to Tartine per her request. Line was short, weather was nice, and tables outside were open. Ordered a lemon bar (per Allison M.'s recommendation), the double pan au chocolate, morning bun, and the croque monsier with seasonal vegetables. Delicious, delicious, delicious. The open face sandwich was delicious with the perfect amount of ooey gooey cheese goodness, sun dried tomatos and great flavors. Excited to try one of those hot pressed sandwiches in the near future! The lemon bar was delicious, but after 3 bites, I was done. The best part is the crust which I think has pine nuts or something crushed into it. So, I'm happy with my Tartine experience and hope circumstances (and patience) will help you along the way too!

I've been wanting to go to Tartine since I came to Cal. Finally got a chance on a beautiful sunny day in SF. Took BART to 16th & Mission and walked a few blocks up. First impression: very hipster-y, the environment & crowd. First, they don't have a sign (really..?) but you know its Tartine from the line streaming down the block. Waited a good 20 minutes before I got my order taken. Their decor is very rustic & bread-oriented; pictures, portraits, sculptures made of and out of bread. Its a tiny and with not much space. Luckily there's a high table turnover so I managed to snag a seat at the communal table, which was really nice because I got to chat with some great people! The food: let's just say they know their bread and other gluten-based derivatives. Their display case is overflowing with HUGE cakes, pies, tarts, cookies, pastries, buns, etc. I ordered a sopressata, fontina & broccoli rabe pesto pressed sandwich, a morning bun, and a double pain au chocolat. I paid $20 for all of the above, which I thought was pretty pricey, but to be honest their portions were huge and I couldn't finish it all in one sitting. The flavors & textures were all there: the morning bun was flaky yet chewy with caramelized edges with a hint of orange zest. The sandwich was very rich: salty sopressata, nutty fontina, and bright & zesty pesto, but the thick sliced buttery bread was the star of the show, like it should be in a bakery. And what else can be said about the pain au chocolat that hasn't already been said? It was heaven. Bottom line: Really great bakery that lives up to all its hype, not really a place to linger, expect to wait in line if you go on the weekends.

The 5 stars are for the BANANA CREAM TART only! Because there really is something to be said about this amazing little pastry if: - it's the only thing I remember about this bakery, hence this review. - I had it more than two years ago and I still crave it from time to time. - I ask my friends to bring one back for me whenever they go to SF (I'm from San Diego). - I get sad when they don't follow through (which is always!). Next time I fly into the city, I'm taking a cab straight to Tartine and making up for lost time.

It's Saturday morning and we're up for breakfast early. The bread pudding is on my mind at Tartine. Once inside we can't wait to order just about one of everything, the smells coming out of the kitchen are making my mouth water. We begin by ordering two bread puddings covered in fresh cooked apples, chocolate croissant, almond croissant, scone, savory warm puffy bread with cheese, toasted bread covered with mushrooms, cheese, tomato. Everything from the baked goods to the soy cappuccino's were spectacular. I'm looking forward to my next trip to SF for another round of the best baked goods I've ever had.

Came here with a friend who proclaimed it as one of the only places to get real French pastries outside of France. I wasn't sure what that meant until I experienced the luxuriant richness of their goodies. Coconut creme tart: one of those times you'd really prefer a private enclosed room in which to enjoy it fully, as it moves you to make passionate "MmMMMmmmmm" sounds while eating that aren't quite appropriate in public. Thank goodness its loud and full of conversation. Don't forget to clean up your crumbs!

Warning Warning! Sometimes the line here is a bit of a pain in the arse :T... But if you can get over that and want yummy tarts and cakes this is the place to come. Sad little story is that every time I want a almond croissant from TB, they run out or they look burnt... hmm I won-der. FOOD: * Lemon Tart - is perfect with whipped cream that's on top. The whipped cream cuts the tartness of the lemon curd. * Banana Cream Tart - is perfect again with its simple creamy custard smothering the slices of banana, and whipped cream smothering the entire top! * Devils Food Cake - bland * Berries with Bavarian Cream - was like a parfait AND it was to-die-for! (dramatic much... lol) DRINKS: * Latte - was smooth, just wish it was stronger. Almost bland. If you want tarts, cakes, and pastries that's not too rich/sweet Tartine Bakery is the place to go.

Alright, I MADE IT here FINALLY! Beat most of the line on a Friday morning luckily and ordered almost everything on the menu. Here's the break down: Banana cream pie: DELISH! Absolutely LOVED the huge chunks of bananas and banana cream with the lovely flaky pastry crust. Although, I could have done without whatever that hard stuff on the bottom inside of the puff was. Chocolate croissant: HUGE and Oozing with melted chocolate in a soft, warm and flaky crust. Coconut passion fruit Bavarian creme: LOVED the passion fruit filling and cake part but could have done without the coconut shavings (which kept getting stuck in my teeth and were kinda hard to chew) The crocet monserier: Delicious thick crusty bread but didn't like my shitaki toppings due to the stem still being attached and awfully difficult to chew. Also kinda pricey. Overall, the bakes goods (and bread I hear) are totally worth coming in for. My advice is pick a weekday morning to get a shorter line (though I don't believe you'll ever have NO line.) and split a few different things with a friend or significant other. I mean that! The portions are HUGE!! Overall, despite being $45 bucks broker, I'd swear I struck gold! ;)

I've been to Tartine several times over the years and without fail, I always get the bread pudding (if you had told me as a kid that one of my favorite desserts would end up being soggy, sweet bread piled with fruit and soaked in its juices, I would probably have thrown up .. and then scoffed at you). ÊThat is how good this place is (that it would make something that seemed so gross in my mind end up causing me to salivate everytime I think bread pudding). Anyways, the reason for this particular review is not even the bread pudding. ÊAfter YEARS of wanting to stop by for a fresh loaf of bread, I finally did it! ÊIt's not easy to find myself in the Mission around 5pm but I had a half day at work and at around 4:30pm, I booked it over to Tartine. Ê Strangely, there was hardly any line but I struck up a conversation with the lady in front of me (who apparently drives up from the peninsula regularly to pick up bread here) and she gave me the scoop and what to get. ÊBy the time we got the front, it was 4:50pm but the loaves were out of the oven and ready for the taking. ÊI got a loaf of country bread (and yes, a cup of raspberry bread pudding too) and immediately started ripping off strips (caution: I burned my finger the inside was so hot - be careful!) The crust is hard and thick but the inside is so airy and hot and makes for a perfect snack. ÊI quickly went over to Bi-Rite, picked up some camembert and had a delicious cheese sandwich over at Dolores Park. Ê Another experience to cross of the bucket list. ÊYay!

I've been coming to Tartine for years now, and I thought I knew it, but last weekend I was surprised again by this fantastic bakery. ÊI had the **spicy turkey sandwich**, and it was out of this world delicious. ÊI had always shied away from paying $12 for a Tartine sandwich, figuring I'd let them specialize in just pastries for me, and get my actual sustenance elsewhere. ÊI guess I'm just an economist at heart, specialization for the win. What a mistake, because Tartine has definitely got a comparative advantage in sandwiches! ;) ÊThe sandwich was so enormous that they cut it into *three* sections. ÊIt ended up being lunch and dinner. ÊThe bread is delicious, thick, and toasted, the turkey is top quality, and the cheese and spicy goodness is a religious experience. Here's a photo of that religious experience if you want to see what I mean: http://www.yelp.com/biz_É ÊAnd I almost forgot -- that little carrot there was also REALLY delicious. ÊA carrot! ÊI know! ÊIt had been pickled maybe? ÊOr just soaked in something spicy? ÊIt was really, really fresh and good, and I was not the only one to comment on it. Aside from the sandwich, as always I got two pastries because it's impossible to just choose one here. ÊMy thoughts: -- Pain au chocolat -- this is the most delicious pain au chocolat. ÊIt's made with Valhrona chocolate, and it's buttery, flaky delicious. ÊThe chocolate is usually still halfway-melted when you bite into it. ÊOh me oh my. -- Regular croissant -- Same as the pain au chocolat, but no chocolate... still, less can be more. ÊIn fact, Charlie Sheen might call it bi-winning. ÊThis croissant can shine even with its simplicity. -- Almond croissant -- Most almond croissants go overboard on the sugar and don't emphasize the almond enough, but Tartine strikes a much better balance. ÊIt's not a marzipan croissant, it's an almond croissant, and I love it. -- Morning bun -- it's so moist, and with the typical cinnamon-sugar combo going on, but also a hint of orange zest. ÊMmm! -- Bread pudding -- it will always be topped with a seasonal fruit, with chunks of bread that has so many wonderful textures, it's not even funny. ÊIf the fruit is one you enjoy, this is the perfect breakfast, best accompanied by a bowl of *caf au lait*. :)

Completely overrated. I'm concerned for the people of San Francisco if they think this place is an amazing bakery. It's definitely good but by no means an amazing, wait 30-45 minutes in line, bakery. Boston has better places almost everywhere you turn. Okay, okay, to be fair we didn't actually try the bread...which they are known for...but what we did try wasn't special, at all, and MUCH better can be found almost anywhere here in Boston....so I stand by my comment of "overrated"...sorry San Fran...I dig your city but you guys need better taste in pastry and food.

From what I've read, Tartine is the brainchild of a husband and wife pastry chef team and it's as solid as bakeries get in the city! I've been here twice and have had good experiences each time. Their pastries are awesome and so are the quiches. Light and fluffy just the way I like them. Some say that Tartine has become overrated over the years and I don't necessarily disagree. Although I must say that Tartine isn't at all a trend, the quality and effort that goes into all their goodies can be seen and tasted. With their upcoming restaurant expansion, Tartine will be around for a while and possibly become a household name. They worked hard for it! I'm excited to see what the new restaurant has to offers, read their book, and try out Bar Tartine one of these days!

Ever since my company got me Tartine on my first day of work, i fell in love with it. I guess the only problem is the line is always too long when you can smell the deliciousness of the pastries but can't have them right away. I love their almond croissant, the crispiness of the outside and the soft sweet filling is just a perfect combination, although a few times I have been there they ran out of it. The bread pudding is also a must-have for me. Their change the seasonal fruit on top from time to time. It would be more to my taste though if it was less egg-y. Have also tried their banana cream tart, morning bun, quiche, chocolate eclair, apply puff and so on, all very good. It is a bit pricey and you have to wait for a bit long, but for pastry-lovers it is a worthwhile experience.

Ohoho Tartine you are two blocks away from me, and I've been looking over the Tartine cookbook for some time now, and they are finally doing some of their seasonal stuff. I finally went in on a day when they had the Tres Leches cake available. Just go get it. You'll thank me later. Seasonal bread pudding is always something to look forward to. THEY HAVE CRANBERRIES AND PEARS IN IT RIGHT NOW! Living near Tartine kind of spoils me.

With European flair and a fresh baked smell, Tartine is a lovely place to have brunch. ÊThe vegetable croque monsieur open faced sandwich had a nice peppery taste with shiitake mushrooms and sun-dried tomatoes. ÊWash it down with a fantastically French cappuccino.

If you don't like hassle going in here? Fall in line before they open in the morning. It gets pack easily I mean this place is always packed. Come on it's one of the best bakery in town! You must try this: Morning buns Banana cream tart Bread pudding Croissants Lemon tart Buttermilk scone I never like eating my goodies inside this establishment. Small, all tables and chairs are so close to each other that you can't just stand up and move around. So, drop by and go somewhere quiet... And ahhh! Slowly bite your goodies... I once tried their coffee here and Nah! I don't like their coffee... :( That's the only negative in the menu. Tartine is a winner...

Had I only ordered the Bread Pudding this would be a 5 star review. Had I only ordered the Three Cheese Panini it would have been a one star review. So three seems the way to go (for now). I hesitated to give three stars to a bakery that is probably full of all 5 star desserts and pastries but the sandwiches are on the menu and I ordered one so I feel compelled to include it. The pudding was light, warm and delicious with perfectly ripe fresh fruit scattered across the top. The whole pan behind the counter was really a thing of beauty. I had the cup size which was a generous portion for the price and I will definitely order it again in the future. The panini was not good. The bread was too thick and rather tough to bite through because the pieces were so thick. The cheese looked beautiful, thick and melted, oozing out when the plate was brought to the table. One bite and I was disappointed. While rich, nothing about the cheese really stood out. It was just hot, melted, oozing cheese. A one cheese sandwich with a flavorful extra sharp cheddar on bread half as thick would have made me a happy camper. And the sandwich was expensive. I'm sure I will raise this rating star by star after sampling a few more desserts at Tartine but for now, it is what it is.

The gougere and croque monsieur are both delightful. ÊWe also bought a friend a devil's food round cake (sweet, but maybe that's because I don't have a sweet tooth). ÊThe almond croissant is also sweet. ÊThis place has a lot of good stuff, but the wait is horrendous on weekends. ÊSometimes I don't mind waiting (and it seems like a lot of reviewers don't either) but it's not just waiting. ÊIt's packed both inside the cafe as well as on the streets in the Mission so you really have nowhere to go but get swarmed by a ton of people. Maybe it just bothers me because I don't have much of a sweet tooth and hate crowded places.

When I was in college, I would drive all the way from Davis to SF at 8am on a Saturday morning just to revel in breakfast at Tartine. I had to fight for parking and wait in a long line outside in the cold.. yet it was worth it. And because the drive to and from Tartine was so long, I would hoard boxes of goodies to last me throughout the week.. until I came back the following Saturday to stock up again! I would start my morning with a cafe aux lait and some quiche, and then pile up on all the different bakery goods -- a frangipane tart, a banana creme tart, croissants, tea cakes, bread pudding.. and just whatever they had that looked good, I would buy it and take it back with me in sheer delight. Ahh, Tartine was and still is a little slice of heaven. Even in a city full of options, there is a reason why this place is considered an establishment and why years and years later, I continue to flock back for more.

Came here for some after lunch dessert; unfortunately, I wasn't impressed. It was 3 in the afternoon and the morning bun already tasted "old." It wasn't soft nor flakey. In fact, it was difficult to cut with a fork. The bread pudding was also something that left me wanting more. It wasn't warm at all and the tartness of the cranberries overpowered the bread/pudding part. I haven't tried any of their other desserts yet, but maybe I'll return to give it another go.

I have fond memories of Tartine - especially the chocolate pudding - but after living in New England for four years I have to say that I was underwhelmed upon returning last Sunday. ÊThe line moved pretty fast but it took about 40 minutes for me to order something for a party I was attending in the South Bay. I settled on the frangipane tart (although I really wanted the coconut cream tart but the large has such creamy height that it didn't look like it would survive the car ride intact), but even after reheating folks weren't so impressed and were surprised it came from Tartine. I would say stick to the chocolate goods, and go for a break with friends when you're all working from home or something. ÊOtherwise, you might leave wondering whether the lightness in your wallet was worth it.

After viewing more than thousands of good reviews about this place,I was looking for a dessertgasm from this bakery.what a disappointment! Actually I am a bit worried if this is what people in SF think as the top bakery!? None of the dessert/tea I tried was bad,but I definitely had better ones,many times before!

I had heard from so many ppl that I had to try this place. The first time I went I got a tart.. it was delicious. However the real experience lies in the bread. The sandwiches are amazing. Their panini skills deserve some type of gold medal in foods. My boyfriend and I were talking about it the rest of the day. But 13 bucks for a sandwich is rough. $$$$$ Also, I recommend on Sunday getting a group of friends together, chill at Dolores park and then at 5:00pm heading over the Tartine. There will be a line so be prepared. But getting a loaf of bread is worth it. AMAZING! It was gone within 12 hours... ENJOY! -JF

Damn their eclairs are good. When I first bit into one of these babies a few years ago, I had determined it was my favorite... even more than the many I've had in Paris (whoops...). However, I feel like they've consistently been out the last few times I've been. The parking sucks. A few years ago it pretty much sucked, now it's super suckage.

To enter Tartine is a test of human will power. Just looking at that glass case filled with sweets that would kill a diabetic and to restrain yourself from trying them all is something you have to fight yourself to achieve. The offerings... on any given day are going to be huge. Slices of cakes that probably amount to your whole week's worth of calorie intake. Cookies and breads that will scratch any sweet tooth itch you'll ever have. I kept reading about a long wait time in this place. I don't know if I was just lucky or missed it, but when I came here I faced very little wait and was helped quickly. In fact, the longest wait was for the preparation of the sandwich. Now the sandwiches are worth twice the price of admission. You are not going to be hungry for long after, even if you tackle half of the sandwich, it's still going to be beyond fulfilling. The sandwich is cut into three wedges that each wedge itself could be considered a meal. Cheese melting off the sides and since there's a variety to choose from, you really can't go wrong with any you choose. It would be wise to take your pastry/dessert to go as you will not be eating it soon after lunch. This place is so good I came back/tried it twice in one days time. I'm sure my waist didn't appreciate that.

Lured by the hundreds of good reviews, I drove an hour to SF on an early Saturday morning. ÊBy 9.30am, the line was wrapped around the corner and extended beyond the two long benches. ÊSeems like waiting is part of the dining ritual, nobody complained and everyone in line seemed excited or just focused at the menu. Inside the bakery, there are four or five wooden tables for shared use. ÊBesides ordering, everything else is self service, including geting water and putting the plates away. Ê By the time it was our turn, it was around 10.30am, which was too early for their sandwich (not available till 11am) and too late for a hot out of the oven morning bun. ÊBut we ordered anyways. -Eclair: This took us by surprise. ÊHubby wanted to order the chocolate pudding next to it but the pointing angle was probably off. ÊI wasn't in the mood of eating this ugly and too sweet looking worm shape pastry but I gave it a bite anyhow and OMG was I wrong! ÊThe creme filling inside was so light and chilly that it meallowed down the chocolate covering by a ton and the end result was a tasty well balanced not too sweet delight! ÊWe finished it in no time. -Breadpudding: i love how much fruits were on the top, although a bit sweet at the end, it was delicious! -Hazelnut chocolate tart: Huge hazelnuts on top and very dark rich chocolate filling in the middle. ÊIn fact, the chocolate was a bit too hard and overpowering for me. ÊIt's not a good combination with the other three items we ordered, but I could imagine it tasted powerful on its own. -Morning bun: I don't get it. ÊMaybe it is heavenly when it is warm, but in cold room temperature, it's just an orangle flavor sweet sugar glazed big bun that I actually felt bored eating. Not much service at the counter and the line setup made it ineffective for people who want to see everything from the display before ordering. ÊWe ended up call back a waiter to get us the last order before paying.

You can't really say much about this place that hasn't been said. It's a regular place I bring out-of-town visitors to. Yes, that's us crowding up your line, locals. But then again, I'm local, too, so... there... I hate me, too? Anyway, I think a story to help you understand how great this place is can be illustrated by what I consider one of the highest compliments. My boyfriend and I brought a friend of mine from France to Tartine. She's not one of those Parisienne types, though she's been there often. She's from a small village in the Loire Valley. This hearkens to mind the opening scenes from Disney's Beauty and the Beast. I picture a boulangerie run by the same family for generations, with the baker buying butter from the farmer down the road and using the same recipe his family perfected since before the revolution. She's no naif. She's lived in the UK and Spain and traveled around the world. I take her to Tartine and she takes a bite of croissant and her eyes begin to brim with tears. "What's wrong?" I ask as I prepare mentally to run away if she's dropped off the emotional deep-end. It's quiet for a moment. "This is just like France. I miss France so much because of this." A French person saying that a not-in-France bakery is just like France??? That's one hell of a compliment. Note: We ordered the Croque Monsieur, bread pudding, banana cream pudding, morning bun, croissant, olive bread (not that great), coconut cake and something else I can't remember. (we had a few other people there, too, that day. Okay, one other person. But we ate it all. It was delicious.)

You know this place is amazing when there's a huge line snaking outside at 3pm on an overcast and fricking COLD day! First off, location location location. Next to Dolores Park, right next door to Delfinos, and right across the street from Bi-Rite. This street is the perfect recipe for disastrous obesity. Long line, but it moves fairly quickly. Ordered their famous croissant and almond-lemon pound cake and sat outside to munch and chat. CROISSANT. Huge. Crispy outer shell. Moist and FLUFFY inside. I felt like I was eating clouds. A delicious, buttery cloud. Wow. Best croissant I've ever had. Definitely tried to eat this as slowly as possible to savor the amazing flavors and texture. ALMOND-LEMON POUND CAKE. Moist, almond-y lemon-y goodness. The majority of the cake was almond, with the lemon flavoring concentrated in the top layer. The sweet and sour flavors really complimented one another. Finished this in two shakes of a lamb's tail. Must come back soon to try everything else in the bakery!

Heaven. I believe the coconut cream tart at Tartine is what Heaven is made of. It's just not fair. Not fair that I have to travel to the West Coast to find absolute perfection in a dessert. I came to Tartine right when I got to San Francisco- and it was one of the best travel Êfoodie decision I've made in that city thus far. A small, corner bakery offering crispy, flavorgasmic paninis and crumbly, decadent breads, puddings and desserts, I feasted my eyes on the tarts, and, being the coconut loving lush that I am, ordered my dessert with the same dreamy-eyed expression Êmost 12 year old girls get for Justin Bieber. The Tart came to me like a gift, this perfect crust holding together coconut, cream, Êwith dark chocolate and coconut shaving smothering the top. When I dipped my spoon Êin to cut through the tart, I noticed the whirls of dulce de leche and more coconut weaving through the cream. I almost slapped the tart right then and there, what right did it have to be so damn good? I had every intent of sharing this with my aunt, claiming it was "way too much" for me- yet somehow, the spoonfuls of Heaven on Earth kept finding their way into my mouth. We also ordered a prosciutto and brie panini that was absolutely delicious. If I hadnt been so focused on the tart, I wouldve enjoyed it more. Please, Tartine, come to Miami.

One of the few places I've been that lives up to the hype. ÊYou can tell this by how crowded the place is. My friends ordered the bread pudding, the passionfruit cake, and other delicious goodies, which I unfortunately didn't get a chance to try. ÊLet me tell you, though, the Banana Cream Tart is out of this world.

How early do I have to go to get a morning bun!!! If they run out all the time, why don't they crank more out? Sadly I resorted to a plain croissant and a chocolate croissant. I think the reason why I wasn't a fan to either was because I heated them up a little in the microwave, about 20 seconds, and it made it all chewy inside of flaky. Note to self, heat up in oven next time. I felt that the croissants were too thick, and what I mean are the layers inside. But maybe that's cause of the microwave. Will try again next time, and hopefully will get the morning bun.

We came here on a rainy early Sunday afternoon. The line was out the door but we didn't wait that long. We got the following desserts and everything was De-Licious - Banana cream tart, coconut cream tart, Frangipane, and the bread pudding. The banana and coconut cream tarts were my favorite. The shell of the tart was light and flaky; the inside of the shell was coated with chocolate which added a nice crunch to it. The cream filling was light. So why not 5 stars? The cashier was extremely rude to one of our friends. He only wanted to use his first initial for his drink order and she did not like that. She asked him again what his name is and she said, can't you use a fake name? She did explain that it's easier for them to call out a name instead of an initial, but then she did her little huff and puff and rang him up. Who cares if it's an initial, we have to stand by the bar to wait for our drink anyways. Also, the seating is not the greatest. You just wait and hoover over people in the small space after you order to get a seat. So you can potentially be standing with a very yummy dessert but without a seat to eat it...

Given that I only had a morning to spend in San Francisco before heading down for a drive down the coastal highway, I decided to make a quick trip to Tartine Bakery on the back of the review of its chocolate croissants on 'The Best Thing I Ever Ate'. As usual, parking was a pain to find in the Mission; I ended up having to park 15 minutes and one large hill away. Although it was late Saturday morning, the line didn't end up being as bad as I thought it might be - it was only about 15-20 minute wait or so before it was my turn to order. As luck had it, I scored the last double pain au chocolat, along with a regular croissant to snack on. No, they weren't kidding about how good the chocolate croissant is on TV. Most of the time, the chocolate is already solidified when I've had them from other places, but they manage to keep it warm and gooey inside. The bread is also much richer and more buttery than virtually any croissant I've had before. It's extremely flaky, so make sure to have napkins handy or you'll be making a mess everywhere. All in all, it was worth the trek (and the $4 or so the pain au chocolat cost) to have a very tasty midday treat. Seating will be an issue - there aren't many seats - so it's probably best to grab your food and go somewhere else to enjoy it. But I'll definitely make my way back down here in the future...with Bi-Rite right down the block, it's hard to find a better place to load up on sweets...

As soon as you walk in your greeted by delicious pastries on display and a more than happy staff ready to take your order.

Been there plenty of times and never wrote a review yet, so here it is. Tartine is a great place with a variety of pastries and delicacies. When you come here either be ready to wait in a line that goes out the door or hope you get lucky and walk right into the shop. if you're with someone make sure to try to cop some seats before you finish ordering or else be prepared to stalk the next party you think is leaving because the place is pretty packed most of the time. The Êbest seats in the house I think are the outdoor ones. When I sit out there I feel like I'm in some place like Paris where you're enjoying your pastry while kicking back with the sun beaming down on you.. Anyways to the food.. the quiche's are awesome, their grilled sandwiches are yummy, and the espresso is so good, but my favorite thing when I go there is the bread pudding. It has a creamy smooth texture that tastes delicious and has a number of fruits that give it a delicate sweet and tart taste. I always order that every time I'm there. Tartine rocks!

I want to say that the disclaimer is that this place is pricey depending on what you order. Some sandwiches are $14 + tax and if you buy drinks, for two you are looking at almost a $40 tab. With a few pastries, you're now at $50 for lunch which is what I ended up spending. However, on the flip side, this place was good. I mean I can see why there is 2300+ reviews. The sandwiches are abundant and filling, the spicy turkey had special house-made pesto. HOMYGOSH house-made pesto love. The wait is a bit tedious, its hot inside on a warm day and there is crazyness with table sharing and community space but the numbers don't lie. I tried about half of their pastries and the walnut breads and banana breads are incredibly moist and flavorful. Just the perfect amount of sweet and savoring ingredients. I personally was a huge fan of their butter scone with currants but the bf thought it was a bit bland. I liked it because of its rich butteryness and how it was dry but moist unlike most scones which are just baked hard to flake off in crumbles. Parking here is epic. and I mean epic. But in the end, a worth while visit. Now where are my cheap eats!! haha

OK, I fell for the yelp-hype for this bakery and stopped there for a few takeout pastries and a cappuccino. The pastries: the croissant derivatives were excellent. We tried the plain, ham&cheese and the famous gougre - all were buttery, fresh, crispy in the right places and made us feel like we were back in Paris. If we had just bought these, Tartine would've gotten 5 stars. It was the other two pastries we tried that caused me to rate this only 3 stars. The quiche was boring with a burnt puff pastry crust that should have been a pate brise. The filling had almost no spinach but rather egg and cream only. The scone was, well, let's just say that it serves me right for ordering a British pastry in a French bakery. It was tough and dare I say, not really fresh. Go for the French pastries, they are superb! Oh, and skip the cappuccino, it was terrible.

Having stuffed myself to the gills (if I had gills) with Peking duck and fried rice, I was out on the prowl for some mouthwatering desserts that didn't rely on ice-cream or chocolate to compensate for their lack of baking skills. On our way to Schubert's Bakery it occurred to me that I had never once been to the oft-talked-about Tartine Bakery (next door to my favourite pizzeria - Delfina's). So off we headed towards Tartine just a block or two short of parking in front of Schubert's. As seems to be a San Francisco tradition, the line was snaking out the door on to the footpath from the innards of a seemingly hallowed establishment that is obviously too small to accommodate the boisterous belligerent (ok, I kid!) crowd of eager-beavers waiting to sink their enormous incisors into one (or more, if you will) of the baked goodies that await their fate amidst the grind of unforgiving masticators. To cut a meandering story short and just "beat the bush itself" (my Sarah Palin wordsmith moment --- in case you didn't notice), the pastries were not really what I was expecting. They are definitely the coffee-pastry goodies but not the petit-fours / swiss-confectionery type I was hungering for. Oh well ! *shrugs* I went for an Almond Frangipane and a cup of cappuccino. The Frangipane was quite tasty and went very well with the cappuccino, which, while it was really good was not as good as the cuppa I had at Cibo in Sausalito just the weekend prior. I also had a bite of the coconut cream tart from my friend and I found that pretty good too. I'd come back here for a pastry based breakfast, or an evening tea/coffee with friends, but Schubert's is still my go-to for that perfect dessert and petit-fours highs.

They only get four stars because it is amazing but it is also annoying that I would have to wait sooo long to get something from the coffee shop closest to my house. croissants get them preferably the almond. brioche another winner. the mexican wedding cookie, chocolate tea cake and the eclair no thanks. skip em. I repeat croissant. the coffee is great but it is from Four Barrel and if in the area you can always go to straight to the source a few blocks away.

Morning Bun (toasted, a must - thanks, S, for the tip!)? ÊHeavenly. Banana Cream Tart? ÊUltimate bliss. Coconut Tart? ÊHeavenly, divine, ultimate bliss. Frangipane Croissant? ÊMeh, just so so. The next time I visit Tartine Bakery, I'm only going to bring with me $6.50, so I don't go crazy and end up spending over $20 on four pastry items (true story; easier than you'd think it'd be). ÊNot that the pastries aren't worth it - they totally are - well, most of them - but I need to cut back on the spending and, yes, *sigh* the calories. Service is fine - quick (visit on a weekday mid-morning to avoid the line!), but lacking a bit in emotion and enthusiasm (perhaps suffering from a sugar hangover?). ÊIndoor seating is a bit cramped, but outdoor tables and benches are available and make for great people watching on breezy SF days.

I had the bread pudding, and it's not like my momma made. Sorry momma, I know you are 19 years gone, but this bread pudding at Tartine is simply the best. They say it is seasonal, which means the fruit they stuff it with is fresh at the time of baking. Today's stuffing was pears and cranberries. Yeow and wowie. Very filling. There must be some gas in the air that makes you eat way way too much at Tartine, and that is exactly what I did today. I will be back for more, please.

This place was suggested to me by a coworker who gave it high ratings. I was having an all out girl day with my best friend who was visiting from out of town so, upon suggestion from my coworker I decided to take her here for lunch and dessert. It was VERY busy on a Monday afternoon around 1PM, but standing in line gave us time to look over the menu. We grabbed two chairs at a long table and settled in enjoying our Lemon Tart while waiting for our Sandwich. This lemon tart was amazing. It was a rich creaminess that was so silky on the tongue and I loved the fact that the whipped cream was not sweetened, it added a nice balance. Sandwich(s) were both amazing, and HUGE, I highly recommend the Mozzarella w/ Tapanade. Yummy. Ê The decor and general atmosphere was great. The service from the staff at the counter was friendly, warm and welcome evening in the hustle and busy of crunch time. Ê I would recommend this place to anyone visiting the area.

One of the best handcrafted-pastry shop in the city. I think their croissants are hands-down the best I've tried so far. The chocolate croissant is excellent! I like some of their cookies too, like the Mexican Wedding cookies and Rochers, for example. Once in a lucky while, they'll have a vegetarian croque monsieur with mix seasonal mushrooms, which is really tasty. Sometimes I like their bread pudding (although I find it to be a little bit on the overly sweet side, otherwise, it's really generous, fresh and moist, just how a bread pudding should be!) Their Banana cream pie and Frangipane Tart are also the duo that no one should miss! Everything here is almost perfect, just prepare yourself to join the parade of people in line to get their dolci or to wait for tables. So, stop reading these reviews, get your ass moving! Tartine is waiting!

Had never been here until a couple of weeks ago...glad I finally got to experience it. Got the Ham croque monsieur, chocolate croissant, Êmorning bun, and a coffee. (don't worry, I shared) Everything, including the coffee, was great. I NEED to go back and try the ham/cheese croissant.

Always, always good. Got another two paninis to share- ham and the prosciutto. Also, a chocolate croissant for my bro for later and a berry bread pudding. We ALWAYS get the bread pudding thinking we'll like it, but don't... I think I like my bread pudding more bready and dry and less eggy tasting. The sandwiches as always came through- hearty, salty, crispy, and delicious. The salty, sour, spicy, pickled carrots on the side help to cut the richness and I'd buy a jar of those on their own to eat. The croissant would have been better eaten at the bakery I believe, since it wasn't as crispy, more soggy, four hours later at home. But you can't have everything ;D More return trips to come- I will try everything! ALSO, stand in line for the restroom sometime. You get to watch the bakers work the gigantic ovens- pretty fantastic.

I give this place 4 stars only because of the wait. Which is annoying, particularly when it's cold and/or rainy. And because it's pretty expensive (I paid over $50 for a cake that was not very large). HOWEVER. Yum. The smell alone is probably enough to entice you from the street to wait in the long line of crazy people to get in for some wonderful baked goods. Need a cake or desserts to bring somewhere? Come here. I honesty have only been once now and only bought a cake and had to run, but everything looked and smelled so wonderful I can't imagine I will fee differently about their other baked goods. I will be back and will update my review.

My bf's fav chocolate croissant ... They open at 9AM on Sunday, which I thought was a little late for a bakery and apparently everyone else did too and wished they were open earlier because when we arrived at 8:30AM there was already a line about 15-20 people deep. ÊStanding in line and being tortured by the smells of sugar and butter was just cruel so by the time we made it inside we were ready to order everything! We even endured an awkward moment when we ordered the remaining 4 chocolate croissants and everyone behind us in line suddenly became not so friendly =) -Double pain au chocolat $4.25 ... the best thing and a must get ... perfectly flaky and copious amounts of butter! -Banana cream tart $6.50 ... you have to get this also because the banana tart was probably the best I've had ... it's delicious! -Hazelnut tart $?? .... good but if you have to choose go for the banana cream tart. -Lemon cream tart $?? ... also good and an alternative if you're not a chocolate kind of person. Ê -Chocolate chip cookie $?? ... meh ... it's a thin crunchy kind of cookie, which is not what I prefer so it was my least favorite. Ê By the time we left with our goodies in hand the line was SOOO LONG ... down the block ... must of been 40 people deep! The line seemed to move quickly so if you've never been I'd still highly recommend suffering through the wait.

First, if you plan to park, bring a passenger to stake a place in line. I have been here several times after 10 am and it's always a 20 minute line. So if you drop someone off, it works out well...assumIng you find parking. But a consistently long line is always an indication of how good the grub is. ÊWhether morning pastries, lunch pressed sandwiches, or afternoon sweets, they are all incredible. ÊPersonal favorites are the double pan au chocolate, daily fruit bread pudding and the spiced turkey Croque Monsieur. Get there really early to get the double pan (by 10 at the latest).

First time I visited their was a line out the door. When there's a line out the door at a bakery your instincts tells you that it's worth the wait and boy oh boy was it worth the wait! I came here for lunch and decided to order their Croque-monsieur with a berry tort. How can I describe the Croque-Monsieur? The bread crunchy, moist and baked to perfection. Served with warm ham and cheese this open faced sandwich was one of the best sandwiches I've ever had, very comparable to the croque-monsieur I had during my last visit to France (which says a lot). The berry tort was also delicious. The berries were plentiful and the cake was baked just right! Moist, juicy and berriful with every single bite. Just a pleasant Tartine experience and I can't wait until my next!

Saturday morning. Long line wrapped around the corner. Earful of neighboring complaints later, inside the warmer bakery, the much coveted, much raved, ever-beloved treats of Tartine are embraced. 3 morning buns 1 bread pudding 1 chocolate croissant 1 banana cream pie 3 cups of hot blue bottle coffee Lack of seating doesn't deter any loyal patrons away from this popular spot. Quaint decor with seating well bombarding the lines of personal space, the window bar was the only vacant spot for 3. Lucky for us, it gave more space to share the carbohydrate indulgence, bad for the salivary glands waiting in line watching us feast.

You know you've got a winner when you come at 6pm, pick one of the lesser desired cakes (the "left over rejects"), and still get an amazing dessert! The lemon meringue cake was light and not overly sweet with just enough tart. Pretty much the perfect cake. It cost ~$5, but it was most definitely worth it. I'm hoping to come back again, but hopefully I'll get more choices to choose from!

I finally made it here!! Came here yesterday with my bf, despite the heavy rain. Actually, with the rain, the line was definitely shorter than we had both anticipated. =) By the time we got there, they were obviously out of their morning buns-- will have to hit this place up again for that...however we had the banana creme tart and it was really light and yummy!!! I normally don't like banana flavored sweets (I like my banana in their original form), but I knew I had to try because of the reviews. Boy, I'm glad we did because it was delicious! We also shared their Spicy Turkey Pesto sandwich. ÊI love hot/panini style sandwiches and this was not a disappointment either. ÊIt was a huge portion, so grateful that we shared it! My bf also ordered their chocolate croissant. I had a bite of it this morning and it was still good! He loved it and said it was one of the best ones he's ever had. That speaks pretty highly since he's tried so many different kinds. He also got the chocolate hazalnut tart-- which we have yet to try. It looks good though! So glad we finally came here, definitely will come back whenever I can.

They don't have cupcakes. I was bribing J to drive me to my car (hello, Saturday night bender) in SOMA and did so by saying "Ride to car? I buy you cupcakes." That was enough to make him wake from a near comatose state to "Be there in 30." So, you see, we REALLY wanted cupcakes. And thus, all of you rabid Tartine fans should not hiss and spit for the 3-star review, because I REALLY wanted cupcakes last Sunday. It's not hard to spot Tartine Bakery - there's a line out the door (not be confused with Bi-Rite's line out the door). Maybe they do this on purpose though, as you shuffle in line past the glass windows of a veritable cornucopia of baked goods you're practically salivating by the time it's your turn and it makes you want to promptly order everything in sight. We settled for four items and definitely ate them all in one go at Dolores Park. Coconut macaroon - I personally hate coconut, this was purchased for my driver who requested it. I hated it, he loved it. Go figure. Shortbread cookie - I'm a chocolate chip cookie girl, foiled again by second-guessing myself. Frangipane tart - flaky crust, sweet filling, what's not to love? Croissant - OMFG. GINORMOUS, FLAKY, BUTTERY. HEAVEN. Side-note: That evening a girlfriend actually baked the apple crisp from Tartine's cookbook for dessert and it was utterly fabulous. I'll be back to try their sandwiches and quiche.

I've heard a lot of good raves about Tartine and was finally able to make a visit a few weeks ago and since then I've gone twice. First time experience: Went there at 3PM on a Thursday, no line and plenty of seats. Ordered two hot pressed sandwiches: I had the Prosciutto & Provolone - San Daniele Prosciutto with dressed arugula and my sister had the Spicy Turkey - Peppered turkey breast, provolone, broccoli rabe pesto. Both were delicious, very nice crunch to it, finger licking good. My almost 2-year old daughter couldn't get enough of it! We also ordered two Banana cream tart to go since all three of us were stuffed. Once we got home we dug into the tarts and was delish. Perfect amount of cream and banana. Ê Second experience: Went there on a Saturday around noon. There were four of us plus my daughter. When we passed by, there was a line out the door but we were starving so we decided to suck it up. Found parking after 5 minutes and waited in line for about 15 minutes. We were able to share one small table with four chairs plus my daughter on my lap. We ordered: the Prosciutto & Provolone, Jambon Royale & Gruyre - Niman Ranch cured and smoked ham with Dijon on country bread, bread pudding, Coconut cream tart and a slice of the Tres Leches cake. Finished the hot pressed sandwiches and the bread pudding at the shop plus two hot mochas and took the desserts home. Even though the place was packed and we had to wait awhile, it wasn't bad as I thought it was going to be. The food and drinks didn't disappoint us at all. I am definitely a fan!! Now if I'm such a big fan, why not give it 5 stars you say?! Well it's because the first time we went there, I found a small piece of metal/plastic in my sandwich. I told the waitress about it and she apologized and said that it's from their sponge. Now I wasn't trying to make a big deal about it so I told her to just tell her associates to please be careful with whatever they are doing since I'm over here feeding their food to my little girl. I still ate the sandwich and it obviously didn't stop me from going back there. Now I am just extra careful and comb through whatever I feed the little one.

Aw man, just thinking about my visit here makes me a bit sad. WHY? Because they were out of Morning Buns & the Banana Cream Tart by the time I arrived :( BUT, I was lucky enough to score a couple of the last Double Pain Au Chocolates left and mmhmm, it was amazing. Perfectly flakey & filled with chocolate, it totally cheered me up. We also ordered the house iced tea which was interesting, it had a note of ginger in it which was unexpected. I love Tartine's location-sitting outside on a Sunday afternoon was a perfect midday break. And I have totally learned my lesson, although I'll have to brave the lines, I'm willing to come early in the morning just to have a taste of the coveted Morning Buns. Don't wait til the afternoon to get your Tartine fix or else you might miss out on the best items! Major bummmer...

Food and baked goods are great. The low rating is for the egregious lines and wait time. It seems to be one of the least efficient establishments I have ever seen, which contributes to the long lines that don't move. I love the place, which is why I put up with the frustrating wait, but enough is enough. I beg the owner to come up with a way to expedite the wait time. You'll have more customers, and we (customers) will be much happier.

I had originally wanted to come here for the Double Pain au Chocolat. I knew I had to get here early otherwise they would run out of it. The line moved pretty briskly and we were able to order after about 10-15 minutes. Figuring that I don't go to San Francisco that often, I decided to be a fatty. - 2x Double Pain au Chocolat - 2x Pain au Jambon - Morning Buns The best Pain au Jambon aka Ham and Cheese Croissant I have ever had. EVER. The saltiness of the ham (Niman Ranch I believe) and the gooey, meltedness of the cheese just meld perfectly together with the flaky, buttery croissant. Just goes to show you that quality ingredients make for a quality product. And of course a couple pounds of butter. I did not have the pain au chocolat or morning buns the day of, but they were still mighty delicious. You could tell the morning buns were baked with orange zest and favorite part of them was definitely the caramelized edges of it. I reheated the pain au chocolat in the oven, so I could recreate the nice flakiness it had at the bakery. Definitely quality, rich Guittard chocolate.

It's not a place I would go to sit. And I actually don't like that it has gotten so popular (we're talking 3000+ reviews here on Yelp) that you have to wait in line into the street and they get away with mediocre service. However, none of the above can really matter. But before I explain why, let me first introduce myself: I consider myself quite a bit of a croissant connoisseur and I've eaten croissants around Europe, including but not limited to Denmark (very strong fresh bread culture in general) and Paris (which should be the Mekka for croissants) and of course in New York where I live, both in real french and other frankophile bakeries. I generally appreciate almost all croissants. Even the mediocre croissant is ok with me. I'm not a hater! Doing a good croissant is after all an extremely difficult thing, and all effort counts in my book. Three factors make a croissant: the ingredients (primarily butter. No substitutes!!), the way they are made (kneading, folding, cutting) and how fresh they are baked. The first one is easy: it's merely a choice of using real butter. The second is difficult to learn and very time consuming, but if the other two factors are met, even a beginner will be able to do a mind blowing croissant. The third factor is usually the hardest. After they are done they have such a limited shelf life. My comprehensive and life long (although non-scientific) research shows that croissants are best within the first 30 minutes after they leave the oven. If we consider that an index 100, then between 30 minutes and two hours they drop to around 80. At four hours most croissants are well below 60. Most places here in New York get them fresh every morning but at 11am it has already been at least 4 hours since they came out of the oven. This indicates that it is virtually impossible to get above index 80 unless you bake your own croissants on the premises throughout the day. This, of course is exactly what they do at Tartine. And since the other two factors: proper ingredients and baking technique are impeccable, the croissants at Tartine are exactly the way they should be. Even if you have never tried a croissant in your life, I am absolutely sure that your body will instinctively know that this is it. This is the croissant that the men in Plato's cave saw. You'll realize that there can be no other way. Buddha, Jehova, Allah, Thor, Zeus, the Jewish and Christian God and any other Gods you might believe in will probably disagree on many things. However, the Croissants at Tartine is not one of them. They were most likely the result of the first intra-religious joint-venture. No sadness and no pain will survive a confrontation with the divine. This is the pure Form of the Good.

I love this place, but really the lines are just ridiculous! Came here on a Saturday morning (I know right...my own fault), and stood in line for almost an hour just to get my morning fix. You litearly move like two spots every ten minutes, which is not a lot. But onto the good news. The food here is worth the long wait. Had a morning bun, an amazing macchiato, and the open faced sandwhich with ham. It did suck a bit to get to the counter and order, only to have them tell me I'd have to wait another ten minutes at a table for the sandwhich to arrive as it was still coming out of the oven. The morning bun is going to be my returning favorite though. Not too heavy, Ênot overly sweet, with an amazing pastry dough, crisp on the outside, soft and fluffy inside. The open faced sandwhich was amazing too, with this small pickled carrot on the side which adds a lot of depth and flavor to everything. My advice, if you plan on comming here on the weekend, either arrive early, or arrive later so they serve their actual pressed sandwhiches (after 11:30am only!).

When I lived in San Francisco Tartine was part of my daily routine. A slice of lemon poppy seed cake and a cup of coffee became an addiction. On days when I was trying to be healthy I'd replace the cake with their fresh muesli.

Hello there! Some things you should know about me: I don't like lines, or waiting in general when I am hungry. I loathe crowds, especially annoying/clueless/smelly ones with a few/many children sprinkled in them. I do however, adore a good neighborhood bakery and Tartine is so great that I actually stopped half a block away and picked up a real estate information sheet for a house that was on the market. Seriously though, if you lived this close to Tartine (AND Delfina... AND Bi-Rite) why would you ever want to move away? I can't say much about all the beautiful sugary tarts and cakes I ogled in the window, except they looked stunning and I would probably have died from a sugar overload if I had even tried to finish one. Next time Passion Fruit Lime Bavarian, I promise. Same goes for you Banana Cream Tart. I will say, that ever since I was a tiny, I have been eating croissants for breakfast. Fresh from the bakery in Belgium for a couple of years, and fresh from the bakery in Hong Kong (courtesy of a father who liked to wake the household up too early) on Sunday mornings... Once in a while here too, mostly in ham&cheese form from Bennison's. So, I would like to think I know a thing or two about them. My verdict on croissant I sampled at Tartine? Fabulous! A nice flaky outside with soft, buttery, doughy layered inside. Even better than this? The double pain au chocolate, essentially the same dough in a different shape with Valrhona chocolate inside. Can you say NOMGASM? The only downside, is that I'm not the only person who thinks this a great bakery. Locals and tourists alike flock to this small space. During the week, there is a line out the door. Most of the tables are occupied too. The line also doesn't function at its best. You'll be asked for what items you like before you even have a chance to see all things on display. This resulted in me not spying the ham/cheese croissant OR the Gougere (cheese bread with thyme and black pepper) until it was too late. That's okay though, because now I know, and now YOU know too! Definitely on my list of places that I will return to should I ever find myself vacationing in (or moving to?!) San Francisco. Lovingly, Croissant Crazed Yanyao.

[Featured: ÊBest Thing I Ever Ate (Food Network) - Sweet Tooth Episode] Breakfast at Tartine is an experience that stimulates all five senses. ÊDon't worry about finding the sign of this place (they don't have one), the aroma of fresh baked pastries will likely find you from a block away. ÊGive it a whiff and take it all in. ÊThen there's a warm feeling as you walk in, just before you take sight of the the terrific display case filled with an assortment of beautifully presented cookies, tarts, and pastries. Ê Too bad I was too early for the Banana Cream Tart. ÊI read Rodney's review and was eager to sink my teeth into one. ÊOh well, something to look forward to for next time. ÊI ended up with the fruit bread pudding, with a side of morning bun and a cup of coffee. ÊThe bread pudding was delicious! ÊIt just melted in my mouth, plus it had perfect texture and the not-too-sweet taste complemented the fresh tart taste of the fruits quite nicely. ÊCoffee was excellent too. Ê I'm falling short of five stars because I was not as impressed with the morning bun (7 x 7 list, #8) as I expected to be. ÊIt was very sugary indeed, but it was hard and not too warm. ÊIt was good though, but not great. Ê Though I'm not calling Tartine my favorite pastry shop, I was impressed enough to know that I will come back. ÊThey have way too many awesome goodness to ignore. ÊA solid 4 stars for me.

Tartine, how I love thee food, which makes living so far away from Bouchon almost bearable. ÊBut your lines are so . . . inefficient! ÊI can think of at least ten ways you could improve your queuing system. 1. hire fewer hippies 2. make an iphone/android app for ordering 3. make an iphone/android app for paying 4. hire fewer hippies! 5. clone that one guy who was really fast at checking us out 6. get rid of the hippies altogether? 7. stop making the frangipane tart, it isn't yummy 8. make more goddamn pumpkin pie! ÊI stopped by three times for a slice of pie only to be told no slices were left, so finally, I had to just buy an entire goddamn pie so I could have the one slice - forever. Ê 9. don't make people wait 30 minutes so the pie can cool down enough to cut. ÊI really could care less what my slice of pie looks like. ÊIt all ends up mushy and delicious in my tummy. 10. hire someone to take orders from people who know what they want halfway down the line when it is winding out the door. ÊThe eye candy when we finally reach the front is too distracting. Calling ahead to reserve bread is cool, and has been 75% successful. ÊOne time, you made my fiance wait for no one in a line that did not exist for about 30 minutes, while the hippie behind the register snickered.

With a place as highly rated and hyped as Tartine, we decided we had to give it another try. We went back on a Sunday morning and unfortunately, it just confirmed my hunch that this place is wayyyy overrated. We waited patiently in line (and the rain) for 25 minutes. When we finally arrived at the counter we ordered their signature bread pudding ($6) - it was disgusting - we didn't even finish it. It was watery and soggy and did not even remotely resemble bread pudding. The pain au chocolate ($4.25) had barely any chocolate in it and it was also dark chocolate. I've had better pain au chocolates at airports (at a fraction of the price and wait). Finally, the scone ($3.25) was ok, nothing special, basically it was on par with Starbucks. Bottom line, there are too many great bakeries in SF to justify fighting for parking, waiting in line, and paying inflated prices for the mediocre pastries at Tartine.

I get foodgasms just thinking about this place. I was so happy with everything I ordered, I won't go into any explanations. Get: - A parking spot on Church Street (No meters! Woo hoo!) and walk to the bakery - A latte and drink it from the bowl-sized cups. With both hands. (Their lattes are very good) - A chocolate croissant. Don't forget to pretend you're in Paris. - A croque monseiur - A mozzarella and tapenade - A bunch of friends to share these with Leave: - With a very happy stomach and plans to lie down in the park.

ah, Tartine. I love your pastries. one time, on my way out of town for a wedding, I rented a car and I got a $60 parking ticket for being 3 inches into someone's driveway-they must have been a pretty bad driver to have that stop them from exiting-and I didn't even mind. but lately I have absolutely HAD IT with the staff's attitude. I tip, generously, EVERY TIME, and I'm still not worth a smile? maybe next time I won't....

They say distance makes the heart grow fonder and this is especially true of baked goods. As I search high and low for a morning bun in LA that measures up to Tartine's masterpieces, i long for the days when I can go back to visit and load up on their treats. What I tend to forget, however, is how atrocious the line can be, even years after this place has opened, even on a MONDAY MORNING. So in my love-filled haze, I suggested it as a brunch meetup spot on my last day in SF recently. For some reason I thought we'd sail right in and sit right down on one of the sidewalk tables, but instead, I stood in line for about half an hour, frantically taking orders from everyone else on my cell phone while the others stood outside like creepers waiting to poach a table. No doubt about it, the food was and always will be worth it. The morning bun was as crispy on the outside and soft on the inside as ever with that amazing orange zesty flavor, the frangipane croissant was chock full of sweet almonds, the bread pudding was positively transcendent. But when I go to brunch I like to relax, not worry about where I'm going to sit and how long I have to stand in line. Nevertheless, the crowds at Tartine are a testament to their amazing food and great atmosphere. So until everyone else moves onto the Next Big Thing, I'll just have to wait in line with all of its other adoring fans.

Destination: Tartine 400 Miles ETA 6 hours! Go! It was more like 24 hours, as we took the scenic route (they closed by the time we got into the city!) and i patiently waited until the next day to hit my top destination for SF! I originally wanted to go with SF's "Dessert Girl" Patty P.'s plan of doing a triple hit of the Big Eats SF 7X7 List. Ê5pm fresh bread day 1 (paired with another 7X7 item Brillat Savarian cheese from Bi rite market) , and Êmorning bun day 2. Patty and Janice C: Your obsession with this Big Eats List has rubbed off on me! ÊHowever, i was only able to try the morning bun- which was a delicious treat of sugary orangy cinnamony goodness! I was a little sad i couldn't get there earlier when it would be a bit warmer and softer. The Double Pain Au Chocolate- (recently featured on my fave show The Best Thing I Ever Ate) was super buttery and flaky and luckily not burnt. You definitely get a good amount of bitter sweet chocolate in each bite! I enjoyed it, but i think i would have preferred a less bitter chocolate, even tho i love dark chocolate. Raved about by Daniel L, Diana I and Patty P, i also got the Banana Cream Tart. It was bigger than i imagined and soooo good! The cream and the fresh bananas were perfectly paired with the huge shaved chocolate layers on top. The only thing was the chocolate laden crust was superhard and was difficult to eat on the road. :( Mission Accomplished! A personality test recently told me i love making lists and love crossing them off (verrry true!). This was definitely on the top of my list and will always be a spot to be crossed off every future SF visit!

This place already has 3080 reviews, well, I'll make it 3081! Came here today for the first time with a friend at about 11am, and definitely braced ourselves with having to wait. As we drove by, we didn't even look for the "Tartine Bakery" sign, as the buttery aroma in the air led us to this gem! Turned the corner and got parking less than half a block away! What luck! When we got there, we weren't exactly sure if we were at the correct place, as there was absolutely NO line. Looked at the glass and saw a bunch of morning buns! We were definitely at the right place! The girl that placed my order and worked at the register were nice, no complaints! What I Ordered: -- Double pain au chocolat: called double for a reason. 2 semi-melted chocolate panels in the croissant, providing chocolatey goodness in every bite. The croissant was extremely buttery and flakey. Warning! Don't order this if you're on a date Êand are trying to be presentable, the flakiness of the croissant will get ALL over the place, and stuck in your teeth! If you don't, proceed and don't worry, everyone elses is exactly the same! Best croissant I've ever had, seriously. -- Morning bun (x2): The outside is hard and reminds me of a palmier cookie, possibly because its essentially the same concept, and crossed with a cinnamon bun which you'll see more of as you spiral and reach the middle. It had a very light taste of orange zest, and I think it would've been better with more of it. -- Rocher with cocoa nib: It was fun while it lasted. Meringue with cocoa pieces. Don't think I'd get it again, though. -- House iced-tea: Tasted like an iced chai tea, minus the milkiness. YUM! I anticipated to eat all of this during our sitting, with the exception of 1 of the morning buns purchased for someone else. Let's just say, I overestimated myself and ended up boxing all but 1 of the items, oops! ÊI'm definitely a sweets kind of girl, but will try something savory during my next visit! :)

When I was little, I stuck a bean up my nose. ÊIt was a pinto bean, and it was beige with speckles. See? ÊThere's something that the other 1212 reviews didn't tell you. Tartine's food is awesome and comforting and delicious. ÊThe staff's customer service is questionable at times, but they are all very pretty... I guess it's a trade-off? I love their quiche and their morning buns. ÊFind a bench outside and share your food. ÊMake sure to grab some napkins and a fork. ÊIn fact, keep that fork, because walking through the Mission, you might need it to protect you.

After 1377 reviews, THIS ONE is clearly the one that is going to shed some new light on Tartine. I feel like this is the kind of place that should have a movie or sitcom done about it. Have you ever seen Fried Green Tomatoes? You know how the cafe is so stylized? This is the same. The way the people dress is just so perfect, always walking around in rolled up, flour-covered overalls or frilly shirts with flowers pins in their hair. I wish they would just start a food fight. The freshly baked items are crazy delicious - most are even better than many of the ones I've had in Paris. You need to know and love the almond croissants, the morning buns, and the open face croque monsieurs. They definitely deserve all the awards they've received. However, I'm always slightly disappointed with the items in the glass case - a bit pricey for something not that amazing (with the exception of the lemon bars and frangipane berry tarts). Even though they look seductive, I'd stick to the other choices. And, oh my god the bread. Oh. My. God. I get close to tears of joy whenever I think of a loaf of walnut bread. It's crazy crowded but whatever, good things come to people who wait.

The last time I was here, I was disappointed because everything I wanted was gone. I decided to come in the morning and to my surprise, all baked goods were available and the line wasn't out the door. I ended up trying the morning bun and the pain au chocolate. The morning buns are no joke. The first bite is like a fresh churro, crispy edges, and soft and warm in the inside. I was pretty overloaded with sugar after the morning bun, but I had to take a bite off the pain au chocolate while it's still fresh. It was so flaky and buttery, and oozing with chocolate. Amazing!!! ÊPain au chocolate has to be my favorite pastry and I think I found the best ever at Tartine's.

Remember that colorful food pyramid on the back of Cheerio's boxes? I really wish it wasn't proven to be a load of rubbish touted by the cereal industry to sell more of their products not fit to be livestock feed no matter how much its fortified... /end rant (for interwebz throwback sake) ... so I could justify eating copious amounts of toe-curlingly awesome carbpackages from Tartine. First, I'd start with a simple meringue to warm up the palate - terrifically whipped egg whites and pleasant amounts of sugar with a satisfying crunch, and no flour filler. Then we'd move onto the two-bite Friands, valrhona chocolate tarts topped with ganache - rich and delicately bitter. Next up, breakfast! The Frangipane croissant, flaky and buttery studded with shaved almonds outside and almond paste in, I wish I had a lifetime supply of these. And for dessert, my current sweet obsession: banana cream pie. I've gotta say, this one was a bummer - dense, hard crust that had to be cut with a knife, a meager portion of bananas and pudding - the best part was the chocolate shavings on top. But no need to end on a bitter note, the vitrine is brimming with delights that are well worth a gander and munch. For best results, skip the interminable weekend queue by playing hooky or popping over for lunch, then snag some goodies for a Dolores Park picnic!

Such terrible service my friend and I have never experienced! I went in there 2 minutes after they closed and asked if I could buy one of the remaining 5 cakes. This blond woman said no in the rudest way, that I pretty much wrote her off as a horrible person. Then I thought about the fact that I made a special trip there to get a cake for someone from out of town. So I asked someone else working the counter. Who though agreed made me feel guilty about it. Her exact words whine, "Okay, but I have a lot of work to do." Like I was asking her to smuggle drugs. Then the very rude blond woman made a dash back to bitch me out for asking again for a cake. She works in a bakery and she's bitching me out for spending $40 on a cake. Blond woman's name is Leslie. I've never been one to try to use Yelp as a forum to ask for a business to be out of business but in this case lets seriously consider it. Minus the fact that I went out of my way to go there, lets just say I went into a bakery and wanted to buy a cake and I get assaulted for it. Does their management really having nothing to do with this. Could they have not hired at least (1) person that at the very least can do a transaction without a back story. Let alone be vile without doing the transaction. Twice? All signs seem to point that these people are just cashing in on their name and they do not appreciate those that patron them. Your money is better spent elsewhere. Please save yourself the trouble of having your day& night absolutely ruined. You buy sweets to celebrate something small to big and they try really hard to be mean and dash that from you. Update: I called them Tartine to tell them what happened and left a msg. No one has bothered to call me back to just apologize.

WARNING! ÊThere is a mean woman working the cash register at Tartine Bakery who is akin to the Soup Nazi on Seinfeld. ÊShe actually had the gall to try and intimidate my friend and I out of buying the additional gougres and croissants that we had ever so politely asked for. ÊGood thing we didn't stand for this nonsense and walked out of there with what we asked and paid for because stuff this good doesn't come cheap! That being said, I'm not sure why the Soup Nazi woman would be so mean and unhappy in a place like Tartine Bakery, where they're literally in the business of making people fat and happy. ÊPeople go bananas over these near perfect French pastries, and rightfully so. ÊAt $3.25 each, their near perfect butter croissants are massive, flaky and when devoured, will make a perfectly flaky mess all over you. ÊAnd at an additional $3.25 each, their wonderfully light and cheesy gougres are the best kind of airy popover, so much, that you'll be able to eat about 10. Ê But at $6.35 each, the Banana Cream Tart is what paid critics (not me) would call ... "A REVELATION..." ÊYou absolutely positively MUST get one of these to share (or not to share), and never you mind that you don't eat anything "banana." ÊDeceptively non-sweet, this fresh cream topped tart covers several thin layers of banana, a hint of caramel, a thin layer of chocolate, all encased inside the sturdiest, most flaky tart shell you could ever imagine. ÊThis tart is the PRIME example of how something like this doesn't have to be sickeningly sweet, showcasing Tartine Bakery's excellent use of sugar. ÊIn fact, the tart ends up being refreshing - the perfect little thing to eat outside while watching dogs walk their owners around Delores Park. Overall, like any SF landmark eatery, the lines sometimes stretch down the block. Ê Tag teaming with a friend is definitely appropriate - you wait in line at Tartine Bakery, and your friend holds your spot down the street at Bi Rite Creamery. ÊEnjoy everything while sitting outside at the Delores Park Caf while sipping on an espresso. ÊPerfect afternoon!

Ok. I'm going to say it. And you're not going to like it. But I don't like the bread pudding. ....waits for gasp of disapproval... I love bread pudding. I like warm, bready pudding though. I don't really like cold, eggy bread pudding. And that's what I got! It's a shame... I had such high hopes.

I'm a night owl, so waking up early is excruciating for me. The last time I was at Tartine in the late afternoon, they didn't have the ever popular morning bun, which makes sense, since who in their right mind would come here that late and come looking for a morning bun? (only I of course!) So, one REALLY early Monday morning, I somehow managed to sleepwalk to Tartine. There was a short line when I arrived, but I was in and out in 15 minutes. Of course, EVERYTHING looked wonderful (but really pricey) so I had to restrain myself. My goodie bag included: - 2 morning buns - damn you 7 x 7 Magazine! I sacrificed my beauty sleep just so I can cross off #8 on the Big Eats SF list. Boy, these were a thousand times better than Starbuck's version: huge, soft buns topped with a orange-cinnamon sugar, it was a little sticky to the touch but perfect mouthfeel. - Gougere - light pastry dough filled with melted Gruyere. Seasoned with black-pepper and thyme. Gruyere is a cheese I really like and I really, really like this version. - Pain au chocolat - a disappointment. The underside of my croissant was burnt! Not the one to waste any type of pastry, I peeled the burnt part off and enjoyed the rest of the buttery crust. - Frangipane tart - this was sensational. ÊThe light almond cream filling shines, topped with blueberry jam and lots of sliced almonds. An absolute must try, especially for almond lovers. I don't remember if I ate everything in one sitting as all of it was one big carbohydrate blur. I do want to say that after gorging yourself on yummy pastries, operating heavy machinery is not advised.

Luckily, the line wasn't too long when I arrived at Tartine. Small and quaint. One thing I didnt like was that people in line were jumping for any open seat by putting their belongings down on tables. Oh, the croissants sont parfaits! Buttery, crispy, chewy... We got the chocolate chip croissant and the ham and cheese. They were both perfect, especially with coffee. I enjoy biting into perfect croissants and feeling/hearing the crunch! We also got the banana cream tart. The caramel inside is what made me go mmm. I got a muesli, and realized that I am not a fan of muesli. I like the crunch of American granola with my yogurt. The Morning Bun was my favorite! Not too sweet, very chewy, with what I thought was a tinge of citrus(?). Anyway, i want one now. I miss it, too bad it's a 6 hour drive...

I came up with another grand scheme for a friend and I to cross two more items off of the Big Eat SF List (I'm so glad I found a fellow unemployed Type A personality who will go through this list like it's our job with me). Since Tartine has not one, but TWO items on the list, we planned to go in the morning for the first item (morning bun), then lounge in Dolores Park for a few hours and return for the second (loaf of bread warm from the oven, slathered in cheese from Bi-Rite Market). Yes, my self-appointed "job" is a tough one, but someone's got to do it. The first part of the plan went smoothly, but I failed to realize that Tartine's bread does not come out of the oven until 5 pm, so part two has been postponed for another day. After a strenuous afternoon of lying in the sun, it was important I get home and rest. So now, onto the report. And while I freely admit to being a complete glutton, I promise that the following was not all consumed in just this one breakfast trip... - BIg Eat SF item #17: Morning Bun from Tartine. Buttery, flaky, delicious. The center of a morning bun is always the best part -- gooey and soft, and this one had an amazing caramelized top. I would have liked if some nut topping were involved as well, but no such luck. - Pumpkin Bread: For me, this bread epitomizes the taste of Fall. Spiced, flavorful, baked to perfection. We don't get four full-blown seasons here in San Francisco, and a bite of this pumpkin bread may be the closest you'll get to a "real" Fall. - ÊZucchini Bread: Very tasty, but not quite up to par with the pumpkin. I liked the bits of walnut in the bread, but something like this has to be pretty darn amazing for me to choose it over a more gluttonous morning pastry. - Ham Quiche: This one was my friend's pick. I won't say it was bad because I highly doubt it was, but quiche just isn't my thing. Too eggy and cheesy for me. The crust was perfectly flaky and nicely browned. - Gougre: Another savory item, and predictably, not my fave. A giant bun filled with cheese. A must for cheese lovers, a pass for me. - Banana Cream Tart: Ok now we are getting into the real deal. Tarts like this don't just come along every day. Flakey pastry coated in dark chocolate with caramel, pastry cream, and lightly sweetened cream. Chocolate + caramel + banana = WOW. - Tres Leches Cake: This one must have been a seasonal item, as I don't see it on the online menu. My memory is failing me, though I do recall this wasn't your traditional tres leches cake and every time I put my fork down and said "I'm done", I was back within seconds for just one last bite. Ê - Passion Fruit Lime Bavarian: Always save the best for last. Lime-moistened genoise with passion fruit Bavarian. ÊTopped with sweetened cream and coconut. I'm about to make a bold statement....I think, that this just may be, the best slice of cake I have ever had. And I don't even particularly care for lime or coconut. There have been more than a few occasions when I've found myself lying in bed late at night thinking about this cake. Like right now. And thus concludes my lengthy review of a place with nearly 2,000 other reviews, and I think I gained about 40 lbs just writing about so many delicious pastries. I am officially exhausted, and in desperate need of more cake.

Who are those crazy people lined up at Tartine Bakery at 8am on a Saturday? A friend who drove across down so his out of town guests could experience the best bakery in the City. A mom who brought her baby girl who knew the word "Tartine" almost as well as she knew the word "Mommy." A guy who was first in line that said, "I am here because my girlfriend LOVES Tartine."*** Ê IT IS. THAT. GOOD.

Tartine Bakery.....at 1935 reviews, do you think that's going to stop me from throwing in my 2 cents? Heccccccck NO! *Just* got over there for the 1st time ever - cause let's face it, sometimes I can be slow on the uptake. Even though it was 9:30 am Good Friday, the line was manageable so I hopped in Smells coming from their ovens are outrageously amazing so I thought I'd be in for a real treat. The line moved pretty quickly to boot so props for great service! Got a smattering.....Brioche Bread Pudding & Buttermilk Scone for me; Morning Bun & Almond Lemon Tea Cake for Sis Scone was dense yet fluffy, moist & buttermilky & had good ratio of currants - took it home & paired it w/ some jam & we were golden! ÊIt was a good scone but didn't blow my socks off As for the Bread Pudding, in my humble opinion, I've had better. I was expecting something sweeter yet this was bland & tasted like soggy bread w/ cooked apples on top - and those were pretty bland too. Now I *know* bread pudding's main ingredient IS soggy bread but it usually doesn't taste like it. ÊI'm used to something packed down & dense w/ lots of vanilla, cinnamon or *something* to give it a flavorful, cakey texture. Ê I have to say I much prefer the Bread Pudding from Cafe XO to this bread pudding Sis' assessment: Morning Bun - awesomely delicious! As she was eating it, she was having a flashback to New Orleans Bread Pudding - which is our ultimate pinnacle of Bread Puddings. The top was crispy-chewy texture b/c of the caramelized sugar; the middle has a rich uber-buttery croissant like texture....and only the slightest hint of orange (Too bad I'll never get to try - the orange ruins it for me as I *hate* citrus in my baked goods) Almond Lemon Tea Cake - too sweet for Sis. Seemed to be soaked in a simple syrup which made it wet (as opposed to moist) & a sweet lemonny flavor (as opposed to a tart lemon). Would not get again So overall we think Tartine is A-OK & we'd swing by if we were passing & there was no line, but we wouldn't make a special trip

I usually order the morning bun, fruit bread pudding, some kind of cheese with bread, quiche or almond croissant. ÊThey're all pretty good but for some reason the last few times I ordered the almond croissant it was very burnt on the top and the last time I went there I actually checked before ordering the croissant and every single one of them were burnt on the top! I don't know why...... maybe they should check their oven. all in all this place is still pretty damn good but it is also pretty damn expensive

While I was galloping to Dolores Park, I had to pause to look over at why this little corner shop was so crowded. I looked through the window and saw..desserts? Yes, I have a sweet tooth, I stood in line and waited..for at most 10 minutes and picked out a chocolate croissant for myself. I continued my gallop to Dolores eating my croissant. Just kidding, galloping in San Francisco is not possible. And why did no one tell me I had chocolate all over my face?!

Have you been somewhere surreal only to relive it again? It was again another delicious meeting with Yelper Maybelline C, her husband Marc, and friend Eric. Similar to the previous visit, the line was still out the door for the usual half an hour wait, the venue was still super crowded with no place to sit, and their cakes and pastries were as sexy looking as ever. Thanks to May, our table was flooded with two open face sandwiches that came with buttery semi-firm baguettes where each were separately staked with ham and shitake and savory melted cheese on top. Next, we took it a step further by taking turns to enjoy a lemon meringue tart, banana crme pie, tres leches cake, and two dark chocolate clairs. I thought the taste of the lemon meringue was off and not as good as the one I had at Emil's. Otherwise, the banana crme pie was absolutely delicious with fresh bananas and soft cream filling bounded by a layer of dark chocolate underneath around the sugary crust for an added dimension to its flavor. The tres leches cake had super intense moisture from the exterior to the core; and the two clairs were filled with creamy custard to complement the rich semi-bitter chocolate and soft doughy texture from its outer shell. Thank goodness my mama wasn't there to see it. We were so sugary stuffed that left on the table was a coconut crme pie which Eric had to take home. I would love to try their morning bun, pumpkin pie and bread pudding for my future visits. In short, my second visit was filled with many bright spots, but the glaring shortcomings were their messy tables as they did not have anyone to clean them once they became available. Additionally, I thought their espresso drinks and lemon meringue were an aberration at best. Otherwise the opportunity to hang out with everyone in the morning really made it pleasant for me the rest of the day. Thanks to May, 4.5 stars for the overall experience. PS: As a suggestion for the owner, I hope you'll consider making a red velvet cake. I would love to try it.

As a pastry lover, I had to check or Tartine when I was in SF after reading the reviews. Ê I actually tried a bunch of stuff: morning bun, daily bread pudding, fragipane croissant, pain au chocolate, and the creme pie. ÊI've got to say, some of the best pastries I've ever had. ÊYou can tell everything is fresh, but good God, this stuff is just awesome. ÊI will say that the bread pudding that I had was my least favorite of the bunch, but I'll give them a pass on that as I freakin' died when I tried the pastries. Ê If I lived in San Fran, I'd probably gain 20 lbs by eating here all the time, but it might just be worth it. Anyhow, a definite breakfast spot you must try if you're in the area, but be warned that the lines are long during the breakfast hours, but you don't want to to wait to late before going else the pastries aren't as fresh... dilemma dilemma .... [Update - April 11, 2011] Came here the second time, and to my disappointment they didn't have the chocolate croissant or fragipane croissant. Instead, I tried their cookies, the fragapine tart and the some fruit cake/tart. ÊIt wasn't as enjoyable as my first experience, both pastries weren't as good as the pastries I tried the first time, though the cookie had a nice texture and crunch to it.

I have never had such RUDE service anywhere in the neighborhood. The staff and owners at nearby Bi-rite and Faye's have always treated me as a friend and appreciated my business over the years. Not so at Tartine's where apparently customer requests seem to be an interruption for the sometimes well-meaning, but distracted and sometimes simply outright insulting staff. I refuse to go in Tartine again. Workers raking in money for an owner who doesn't care to hold them to any service standard makes them a non-option for me. I now go to Faye's for coffee and ANYWHERE ELSE for food. NO CROISSANT IS WORTH waiting half an hour to have someone roll their eyes because you are bothering them with your order. May the ghost of Carl's Bakery spirit you away. You don't have to go home, but you all need to get the hell up outta here. serious FAIL. Begone!

Remember that beautiful girl in school that you always dreamed about. The one that you worshiped. The one every guy wanted to go out with. There were lines around the block to ask her out. She was the most beautiful girl in the world. And she smelled ohh so delicious. She was gorgeous inside and out...she had a pretty face and a heart of gold. Harps would play when she walked by. She was THE ONE. You remember her, don't you? Of course you do! One day the stars aligned and luck smiled down on you and you finally got her to go out with you. I know you remember when that special day came and you consummated your relationship. At long last, you made love... And she was a cold fish. Tartine is that girl...

Q: ÊHow do I avoid the super long lines that I always hear about??? A: ÊTake a day off and go when everyone else is at work! Our plan worked! ÊWe arrived around 10:30 am on a Wednesday morning, and there was just a short line inside the bakery. ÊThat gave me just enough time to figure out what I wanted to order. ÊThere were so many things that I wanted to order, but I only ended up with the ham & cheese croissant( http://static1.px.yelp.cÉ ) and the ham quiche( http://static3.px.yelp.cÉ ). Ê I placed my order and sipped on my macchiato( http://static4.px.yelp.cÉ ) while I waited for my breakfast to be heated up. ÊMy croissant came out first, and it was HUGE! ÊIt was nice and flaky and oh so yummy. ÊThe quiche came out, and WOW.....I knew I had to share it or else I would've had to be rolled out of there. Ê I also ordered and extra ham & cheese croissant to go, but I should've ordered more! ÊI saw a lot of people order the bread pudding. ÊAnd the desserts looked so damn good!

As many of you know I have to eat a lot for my job. Ê To give you a small picture window -- Yesterday I was asked to try meatball sliders, onion dip, green chili enchiladas, grilled chicken and short ribs. To top it off I also was asked to go to some of San Francisco's beloved bakeries to see what's new and hot in the world of baked fat pills. On the drive over I practiced my "Just Say No" to carbs and butter and cream and cheese speech in my head. "No thank you. ÊI am fat-intolerant." Well, that went out the goddamn window when we got to Tartine, because have you seen their bakery display? ÊI was just like a former fat kid in a pastry store. ÊWell, I wasn't like that. ÊI was exactly that. After ordering a slice of apple tart covered in nougatine streusel, a ramekin of vahlrona chocolate pudding, a cocoa nib rocher and a huckleberry frangopine tart, my partner in fat on fat crime and I decided that would do quite nicely for a mid-afternoon snack. Until we saw the croissants. ÊGod help me. ÊI can't resist flaky, golden deliciousness. As we "researched", the noises coming from deep within me were out of a horror film. ÊIt was like Jabba the Hutt with a tapeworm. ÊI was slurping down pudding and chasing it with fluffy bits of croissant and huge bites of apple tart. ÊOne of our other dining companions reached for the rocher. ÊI growled while I slapped their hand away. Oh, the horror. Such is Tartine. Ê They say nothing tastes as good as being skinny. ÊWell guess what, I'm here to tell you that they're full of shit. Being fat at Tartine tastes amazing.

One day, I was going to Carl's to get a birthday cake and someone had painted it black and turned my nice hometown bakery into a snooty croissant shop. ÊAnd I was ripshit. ÊThis city needed another place to buy $5 pastries like we needed more dirty sleeping bags. ÊAnd so my personal boycott began. ÊYou can keep your lines and your pensive-looking, fancy-pants croissant shop! ÊI said GOOD DAY. Today -- many years later-- the Mr. took me here for the first time for my birthday (no gifts, please). ÊAfter well over a thousand glowing reviews, I had to try it. ÊHere's what I learned: 1) It's not black, but a very dark shade of green. Ê 2) They serve sandwiches. ÊAll of which are decadent, several of which are veggie, one of which is a grilled sandwich of pecorino cheese and almonds. ÊI would eat pecorino and almonds between two odor eaters, but luckily this sandwich uses two buttered and grilled pieces of homemade sourdough bread instead. ÊAnd they add lemon zest and sage. ÊAnd it was bigger than my head. 3) That freaky little carrot on your plate is actually really tasty. ÊIt's a spicy pickled thing that they just for some reason decided not to trim the little hairs off. 4) Worst feng-shui EVER. ÊThe proximity of the line to the tables creates lots of butts-touching-shoulders awkward encounters. The water is self service, but it's behind the cash register. ÊAnd don't order the sandwiches from the girl behind the counter, she's only taking pastry and coffee orders... ÊAnd the staff is clean worn out from answering all these stupid questions about the non-intuitive layout and rules. ÊAnd the guy who took my order had not said howdy to his shampoo in many moons. ÊSo it was indeed a lot like Paris in there. ÊBut not always in a good way. Ê 5) They left the Carl's logo on the entry way, which is very cool. ÊRIP, Carl's.

Did I not get the right pastry or what? I purchased the banana cream tart and the crust was awfully hard. I did not enjoy it as much as I imagined.

After returning from Prague, I lusted after a bakery Êthat presented coffee and pastries in the traditional European form. I even considered learning how to bake just so I could open my very own bakery in San Francisco. Little did I know, we already had such an establishment right here in San Francisco. Though not at Prague prices, Tartine satisfies my yearnings for delicious pastries and good coffee (no, I am not saying their coffee is comparable to Czech coffee...no how, no way). I will never complain about the line at Tartine. It is worth it.... every time.

MY GOD! How do I ever live without having more Tartine? Think I'm kidding? I'm not. I was just on their site trying to figure out how to get Tartine shipped to Miami. Looking over a variety of pastries I was immediately drawn to the croissants and yet somehow a sticky looking bun kept catching my eye. I saw Miriam W excitedly exclaim "Tartine! Tartine! and make a beeline, so I knew these were no ordinary pastries. Miriam W doesn't express glee for anything less than stellar and life altering. I decided to ask for an expert opinion and thankfully Nicole G was nearby and available for guidance she told me everything was amazing but that the sticky, slice of indulgence I had been scoping was perhaps the best known and most loved of all. She also told me its real name 'morning bun'. Little did I know this would be my new 'rosebud', I might be uttering the words 'morning bun' decades from now. Morning Bun, Morning Bun. I looked for a weigh to slice it and found nothing, a little disappointed I took this little confection and thought "Ok, well I'll eat half." Little did I know that there is no 'only eat half' when it comes to Tartine goods. There is only crave and devour. I took one bite and thought to myself "Perfect!" and every next bite just kept cementing Perfect in my mind. Oh, I now understood Nicole and Miriam's joy. I now understood the power, the magnitude of Tartine. However, let me say that although there is a feeling of love at first bite it is not until hours have passed and the craving begins that you understand that first bite has changed you. Now there will always be that longing to satiate the Tartine hunger. Oh believe me it is a blessing and a curse, but one I live with gladly having experienced the sweet, life-altering experience that is Tartine.

Thousands of four- and five-star reviews don't lie. Tartine definitely lives up to all of the hype. I love (almost) everything about this place: the location (it's right next to Dolores Park, Bi-Rite, and Delfina!), the atmosphere (which is bright, cozy, and casual), and of course, the pastries! My favorites are the bread pudding, the shortbread, and the banana cream tart. The morning bun--Tartine's signature--is also very tasty, but definitely not my favorite item on the menu. The strawberry shortcake and double chocolate brownies are also worth a try. You can tell Tartine uses only the freshest ingredients for all of their menu items. No other pastry shop I've been to in SF even comes close. Although the pastries at Tartine are incredible, the sandwiches are less stellar (although still pretty delicious). I tried the Croque Monsieur and the Prosciutto & Provolone. Both were huge and quite satisfying, if not a tad too greasy and salty for my taste. The selection of teas, coffees and other drinks also seemed to be lacking. Regardless, Tartine is your best bet for the highest-quality pastries in the city. I'm definitely a fan and cannot wait to try everything on their pastry menu! Note: Lines get ridiculous between 10-1 on a typical sunny weekend, but don't worry, it's worth the wait.

All I have to say is: What.A.Pain.In.My.Ass I work for an uber cool company -- we like to do cool, thoughtful things for our clients -- because, my company is cool and our clients are even cooler. ÊThis involves creative gift giving. ÊWhich I love doing... because, the only thing which is better than getting a cool, creative gift is giving one. Our whole team is into this, too. ÊWe are a bunch of sassy-ass, creative gift giving ladies. ANYHOW: We happen to have this client. ÊThis uber cool, lovely, fun, amazing client... who loves Tartine pastries. ÊAnd, recently we have had the occasion to give this client a gift. ÊSo one of the sassy-ass ladies on my team says, "Hey! ÊDoesn't Blah-blah client just LOVE LOVE Tartine pastries?" And, the rest of us are all like "Yeah - that's RIGHT! ÊBlah-blah client DOES love love Tartine pastries! ÊLet's order them some!!" This is a mission of critical proportion -- it's massively important. ÊWe love to show the love around here... so, we kinda take our gift giving seriously, you know? I am proud that the task falls to me. ÊProud. ÊI LOVE LOVE buying people gifts. Ê(I think I already might have said that, but it's a point which bears repeating.) Further, I am not a stupid grrl. ÊI know how things work in this town and I know that Tartine is a little bit of a hoity-toity difficult-to-get-good-service-from-because-they-?are-so-damn-popular-restaurant... I mean, have you SEEN the line around the block for that beeotch on a Sunday morning? So, I go online and do my research. ÊI discover that they need three to five days for a pre-order. ÊI look at their menu and consult with the sassy-ass lady sitting across the wall from me to determine which pastry would be a suitable gift for our kick-ass client. ÊWe agree on a yummy-yummy and I place an order via voicemail (which is their POLICY - they don't answer their friggin' phone)... I do this last FRIDAY. I get a call back yesterday stating that the item that I wanted to order is "not in season." ÊSo, I ask them if I can just stop in Tartine and pick up something out of their bakery case & I am told "it depends on what you want." So, I go into panic mode - as this is a mission of utmost importance to my team - and, start creating backup plans, etc... where to get a "Tartine-esque" pastry for my kick-ass client... what to do if there is nothing in the bakery case worthy of the magnitude of coolness which this client epitomizes... I consult with two sassy-ass ladies on my team this morning about the contingency plan which I've created... and, they agree that the whole point was to order from Tartine and that we should just stop by to see what's there... and, that I should call them back and be like "Yo, Tartine peeps, have X amount of pastries ready at X time..." etc. However: TARTINE DOESN'T ANSWER THEIR FRIGGIN' PHONE!!! And, they are uber, uber, UBER slow about returning phone calls - even though it says that they will return a call w/in 24 hours of when you leave a message. I don't care HOW amazing your damn pastries are, people -- there is something which is crucial to having a successful business and it's called CUSTOMER SERVICE. Learn it, live it. Because, you know what? ÊI'm not the only person who's had this kind of negative experience with Tartine... which says a lot. Your food may be amazing, but your customer service sucks.

Long Story short: cute little bakery with a variety of delectable eats at pretty good prices Long story long: In continuation of my food crawl in and around SF, I had hopped on the BART down to the 16th St and Mission station to check out a few places in that neighborhood. ÊThis place is next to Pizzeria Delfina, which, me being there at 10 AM, was unfortunately not open yet. This place was simplistic and had a little more of a contemporary feel than your run of the mill bakery/coffee shop kind of place. ÊThe tables did seem kind of cramped up together, so you could inadvertently evesdrop on your neighbor. ÊNot that I would ever do that, I'm just saying. I got in line and within a couple of minutes, I had someone come to help me. ÊI looked at all of their offerings: breakfast pastries, cookies, small confections, cakes, desserts. ÊIt was so hard to choose. ÊI eventually got a black currant scone, a morning bun, and a couple of cookies. ÊI forget exactly how much it came out to, but it wasn't super cheap or terribly expensive either. I walked out and busted out the scone. ÊIt was more on the flaky side, almost like a danish or croissant, but it was really good. ÊI probably could have had 2 or 3 of these. ÊI saved my morning bun until later that morning and that was really good as well. ÊProbably better than the morning bun I had at Crema in Portland. ÊI had the cookies later that day and they were ok. ÊNothing to really write home about. I would definitely come back to try other things. ÊI can't wait to go back to SF =(

I imagine Tartine Bakery on a Sunday afternoon is just as scary. Low blood sugar, pissed off because it has already taken them 30 minutes just to find parking, ready to wrestle someone to the ground for the last brownie, crazed sugar fiends file out the door waiting to get their order taken and scarf down their goodies. Thank God Almighty for Andy though, because if not for him, I would have never known what Heaven truly tastes like. As his hot wife sat in the double-parked car with the engine running, Andy walked right to the front of the line and it was a miracle that he got out of the bakery with the goods completely unharmed. What a bad ass, right?! What he transported safely: 1.) Banana Cream Tart -- a flaky pastry crust coated in dark chocolate and caramel and filled with pastry cream and bananas, and then topped with lightly sweetened cream and shaved chocolate. 2.) Coconut Cream Tart -- a flaky pastry coated in dark chocolate and caramel and filled with coconut cream. Topped with lightly sweetened cream and toasted coconut. The best freakin' coconut cream tart I have ever tasted. 3.) Really Rich Scharffen Berger Brownie with walnuts If anyone's able to complete a Mission Impossible task, Andy is your man.

Like many bakery junkies Tartine has always been on my list and near the top spot as It's pretty much an icon. Out of all my trips to SF I just never made the time to make a stop. Maybe bc I am not a morning person at all and the best time to go to a bakery is well, in the morning. So since that early morning visit will probably never happen, i made a late afternoon stop for whatever treats were left. We arrived after 3:00pm and the cases were still full! This was a huge surprise and a bit of a distraction as I had more choices than I thought I was going to have. Of course I wanted a Morning Bun and of course they didn't have it. Since we were still full from lunch at Ike's and our Bi-Rite ice creams I saved the amazing looking mini pies and fruit tarts for next time. I settled for 2 Mexican Wedding Cookies and was on my way. I didn't even eat one right away bc I was that full. I actually ate in the next morning for breakfast (don't judge) and they were Fantastic! The place is small and cramped and I can see how the line and ordering system could be outrageous and annoying. It is lame to have to order your goods before actually seeing them but they have plenty of pics on yelp and you can browse their menu so if you did a little research before hand you would know what to expect. Mission Morning Buns next time. Can't wait.

I was compelled to update my review and degrade my rating based on an experience this morning (5/13). The doors to Tartine were open and we walked in eager for a chocolate croissant since there was no line. As I walked in, I heard "we're not open" and I said "what time do you open?" the barely audible response from the 2 girls not paying any attention was "8". "What time is it?" I asked - and got the response "not 8". I asked again what the time was, and got no response. They may have been nominated for Êa James Beard Award for best pastry chefs (they didn't win), but they certainly didn't get nominated, NO EVER WILL, for Best Service. I don't care how good your product is, if your service and attitude SUCKS like it does at Tartine, you'll never get another penny from me. If you read my original review, from Day 1 they have had efficiency problems and the service just compounds the negative impression of Tartine. It is too bad because the product is good, but it doesn't matter - the service is a complete turn off. These girls just put stuff in bags and ring it up - this is not brain surgery and I certainly don't see them gracing the covers of Bon Appetit or 7x7 Magazine. Get over yourselves and get a job where no one has to interact with you - ever. ------ORIGINAL REVIEW-------- My biggest issue is the efficiency of Tartine - it doesn't exist. Why can't they streamline the ordering and payment processes? The layout does not work, and the pace is painfully slow. They need some serious business automation and process re-engineering. Maybe then the line wouldn't be so long for so long!

As a bakery, *****. The tarts are among the best anywhere, with a perfect crust that is neither doughy or crumbly. The cakes are pricey, but still really good a week later (don't ask). I have to remind myself that it's a bakery, not really a cafe. As a cafe, **. Most descriptions of the space and clientele are apt. Fortunately, Biff and Muffy left us a couple seats when their blackberry went off and we got to sit down with our sammitches. Cuties' pressed pastrami was terriffic. My croque monsieur, while tasty, ate a bit too much like a french bread pizza, with the thick slab of country bread underneath. The cafe is more for the "see and be seen" types.

God made a bakery, and it was called Tartine. Ê The banana cream tarte and the croque monsier are TO DIE FOR. ÊLike sex in your mouth... only not. ÊWho the EF cares what the food is Êmade of or how much fat it has, or if the people that work there are surly and condescending and seem irritated with you? ÊNothing gets in between me and my favorite baked goods on the freakin' planet! ÊOh yeah, the quiche is flippin' wonderful, too! Also note: In my humble opinion, the morning buns are really no big deal and the bread pudding is good in its own right, if you're into the juicy, fruity kind of bread pudding. ÊMe--I like my bread pudding to be ALL bread, and I laud the praises of Pacific Whey Cafe in Newport as the purveyors of the BEST bread pudding ever.

Let me sum this review up in one word: crack. For those with ADD you can stop reading here and move on to skimming another review. For everyone else... When it comes to pastry, the words "morning bun" aren't exactly inspirational, but let me just say, I had the pleasure of practically inhaling one of these beauties and it was quite nearly a religious experience. Note: Once you know that I'm not all that big on sweets (hell, I don't even really like chocolate) you really understand the gravity of that statement. The morning bun was just the perfect bit of sweet wearing a crowning glory of crispy caramelized sugar sweet and just the right bit of savory Êyeasty dough and the whole thing is rounded out with a hint of citrus that builds to a crescendo as you reach the center and get bits of zest in each bite. I had every intention of being good and eating half but I easily could have put away two they were so divine. If you live in the Bay Area or happen to know someone close enough to bribe, save yourself the flight to Paris and find your way to Tartine.

It's official: I am now Tartine's bitch. I told myself I wasn't going to be Tartine's bitch. I told myself the gougere was not to my liking and that the bread pudding was amazing but not worth the world. But then I tried the almond croissant and the jambon and gruyere croissant. I tried the morning bun and a cup of the strawberry huckleberry bread pudding since those fruits are now in season. After trying so many of the items in the shop and making the Lemon Chiffon tarts more times than I can count (yay for the Tartine cookbook) I can safely say that I am more than willing to be Tartine's bitch. Whether its in the shop or in Dolores Park, it feels so good to be so bad with their rich, buttery pastries.

Well, the Scharffen-Berger (Sharfenburger? ÊScharf-effing-burger?) chocolate pudding made me its bitch yesterday. ÊIf Bill Cosby ever tasted this he'd tell Jell-O (Jello? ÊGel-Oh?) to go F---- itself with a pudding pop stick. IQ also had some outrageous brioche (bree-oash? brio-shhhh?) bread pudding which I thought was delicious but lacked a sauce to take it over the goal line to sublime (sub-lime? Êsuh-blime?). So why only three stars? ÊA) I saw BURNT croissants. ÊA whole big stack of them. ÊThey not only looked burnt they smelt burnt from the customer side of the counter. ÊI never saw a burnt croissant in Paris. ÊThose French bakers would throw themselves into their own ovens before they would put a burnt croissant out where the public could see it (much less purchase and eat it). Ê And B) despite the sublime tastes here, which I will go back for, the experience itself is depressing. ÊFood this good deserves time and space to be savored. ÊThe line, the passive aggressive people sitting and reading a paper over the long-since-finished remains of their vittles, the pushy people with no concept of patience or personal space, all detract from the food and take the whole experience of Tartine down two pegs, at least. ÊThey need to find a bigger space that is more appropriately designed to handle the crowds.

What the heck, I just started Yelp with 2 reviews containing the name Baker (Baker's Chem-Dry Green Carpet Cleaning and Baker Beach), so I thought real hard to come up with a kick-ass baker name, and Tartine Bakery had to be the one. You cannot go wrong with the cookies and croissants, but I adore the bread pudding. And I buy the morning buns and take them home for heating and eating. What a scrumptious way to spend a Sunday morning, a bit of home brewed coffee and a morning bun from Tartine. Mmmmm. extra good.

Tartine is delicious for a bakery in the city! ÊI ordered the lemon meringue, which i may add the slices are huge! I wanted to try the bread pudding also but that will be for my next visit! ÊThe lemon meringue cake was moist and not too sour or sweet... I liked the marshmelloey exterior around the cake slice.. it adds a good different texture to the cake! ÊMultiple layers to make it a fat slice for moi! Ê There was a line going out of the bakery.. boy this place sure makes business! ÊTheir panini sandwiches looked delicious also from what i saw on the tables next to me! ÊI wanted to try one since they looked so healthy! Ê Parking around the area can definitely be a pain.. but i managed to park 2 blocks down the street...It was a good walk back after devouring such sweets! ÊTables are available inside and outside also.. theres a bench to wait in line if you happen to be unlucky. don't worry, the line goes by pretty fast! Êthe only thing you would need to worry is if you can grab a table or else... dessert will be TO GO!!!!!

Wow, what a gorgeous little place, wow just another reason to love SF. I'm pretty sure the morning bun was on the Best Eats list for SF and obviously I'm going to have to try it! There was a line that went out the door, but I was told it'd be worth it. Yes everyone, the famous morning bun of legends was quite the treat! Coupled with a good cup of ol' joe it made for a fantastic morning. My other friends got two kinds of quiche of which I cannot remember but they were definitely delectable because there was barely any crumbs left afterwards. We had to sit in a big community-style table but that wasn't too bad. Not to mention the great and Êfriendly customer service here, I am in love. If you're in the area, hit this place up. You will not be disappointed.

SHUCKS!! I JUST now came out of my wow factor of bliss. I arrived at this glorious sweet house! This unbelievable Êplace called Tartine has sent me for a spin! Before I get to this place I see a long line that is forming outside of this cafe! ÊIn my head I was like hell no will I stand out side a place just to eat something! What do I find myself doing? I stand in line for about 20mins with some wonderful friends of mine the Wonderful Daniel, and Gorgeous Shannon. My nose fills with rich flavors, of sugar, cream, bread, and coffee bean stick to my nose hairs which stood on end! I maze my way through the crowded spot and find a gold mine of a spot to sit 3 people. If you don't get a place to sit down; there is always sitting outside. My friends show up with several platters of pastries, fresh baked open face sandwich, and the most beautiful bowls of latte I have ever seen. Upon all the raging excitement of eating tarts, tres leche cake, and with my intoxication of sweets I miss grabbing flying napkins and grab thigh! What a first impression I make.... Blame it on the sugarhol I guess. ÊTartine Bakery is one of the most enjoyable places to bring a group of friends, talk loud, enjoy wonderful food, look at all of the abstract art on the walls, and get high on sugar and bean! In all this place brings good fortune to those who meet here as I saw nothing, but smiling faces, heard laughter, smelled food, and was enjoy 2 wonderful people! Thanks Tartine! Ê=)

Never, Ênever, I repeat NEVER attempt to go here at 11:00 on a Sunday afternoon when Êyou have a 2:00 flight to catch. Ê We ordered: Morning Bun- 5 STARS Brioche bread pudding - 3.5 STARS Banana cream tart- Ê4 STARS Quiche - 3.5 STARS Jambon & Gruyere Sandwich: 4 STARS Prosciutto & Provolone Sandwich: 3.5 STARS =================================== Total: $40 Altogether, it was awesome sampling everything. ÊThe sandwiches (while the bread was too tough for my taste), the BF prefers his breads like that as many others would. ÊThe inside of the sandwich is amazing. ÊBut, I have to say that the only item on the menu that would drive me back here would be the Morning Bun. ÊThe orange zest flavor is really what won me over and stole the spotlight even with a fluffy pastry it sits on. Tips: If you go here alone, go early. Otherwise, have someone else drive you since you'll never find parking. Prepare for an 1 hr wait.

I always find myself stuck in a food rut, albeit delicious, but a food rut just the same. Even if a restaurant has a 50-page menu or showcases a variety of pretty pastries, I am drawn to the same thing over & over again, but today I felt like being adventurous & finally tried something new. My cousin has been telling me for almost a year that she has a gift certificate to Tartine & would I be her companion. I don't know what took me so long, but this morning, the best friend & I picked her up (she lives dangerously close to Tartine) & showed her just how good a pastry can be. They only serve pressed sandwiches after 12 noon, so we split a croque monsieur with ham (the BFF got it with turkey), I got a franglpane croissant (me & my almond paste, i swear, it's a match made in heaven) & my cousin had a double chocolate croissant. The three of us sat, laughed, caught up & enjoyed our carb-rich indulgences. Maybe I should try new things more often because I was very delighted by the new flavors, textures & ingredients today. But most of all, I was delighted by my company (everyone say "awwwww.")

This place is a block away from where I live and I've always seen a huge line just to get in so I've always avoided this place, till a friend brought to my attention that they have amazing croissants and Morning Buns... So I decided to make a stop in the early morning and check it out... The morning bun was freaking delicious and still warm in the center and my Mocha was just right, not too sweet! I will definitely go back.

I hate to hate on such an establishment but it really does baffle me why the line is so ridiculously long here. We arrived on a rainy Sunday at 11:30 and there was a line out the door. Not unreasonable but I expected it. I made the tartine bread pudding and it was really good but I really wanted to try the real deal. We ordered a cup of the bread pudding, the morning bun, the pain au chocolat, a quiche and the croque monsieur. We were given a separate plate for the morning bun, the p.a.c, the bread pudding and then our coffee order arrived. The problem is, there were no seats available. So we were balancing our plates when our quiche arrived too. I definitely got to practice my waitressing skills. Finally we found a table that was available and sat down although given there was a backlog of eat-in patrons, we felt compelled to eat quickly. The morning bun was... good. The pain au chocolat was delicious and flaky. I was really excited to try the bread pudding but after holding it for so long it was good but not as warm as it should have been. The quiche was artichoke and the crust was light and buttery. My favorite dish was the croque monsieur. It was freshly made and the gruyere and bechamel combination was heavenly. Their brioche is light and flaky. Yum... The people there are super friendly given the circumstances. I'm sure they're used to the weekend rush. In conclusion - if the weather's nice, take your food to go. Better yet, if you live in the neighborhood, take it home. However, I would probably not make another weekend pilgrimage back if I had to sit in the cafe.

It's typically crowded and hopping in this bakery, probably because everything here tastes fresh and delicious (buttery too). Ê Newbies be warned: ÊGoing through the fast-moving line can be intimidating if you don't know what you want. Chop-chop! Time's a-wasting! I love that they use organic and local ingredients, when possible. The chocolate is high quality, Scharffen Berger brownies and chocolate pudding. ÊWoo-hoo!

Everyone talks about this bakery is one of the best on the left coast, had to check it out. Luckily it was a weekday morning, so waited maybe 5 minutes before getting to the front to order. We got: - Croissant: Huge and so light, buttery, and flaky. Better than the one I had at Annisette. I think I can safely say the best croissant I've ever had. Also, the outside was so crispy, love crispy. I hate it when a croissant doesn't have any crisp. If it doesn't flake, doesn't belong in your face! - Morning bread: A wonderful orgy of croissant, cinnamon roll, and coffee cake. The texture is of a croissant but it's rolled like a cinnamon bun, and then has a sugar glaze, sugar, and just plain damn goodness. I think there's some orange essence in there. - Quiche: Got the ham and leek, so tasty. You get lots of ingredients, not just the egg. And then it's all about the flaky and wonderful crust. Big slice too for $4. - Gougere: Looked good in the case so decided to get it too. Initially you think it's this huge hunk of a cheese roll, but tear inside and it's hollow and the dough so tender. Like a perfect cheesy popover. The inside bread texture is like a creamy custard with a hint of cheese. Simply said, everything I got was so delicious, best pastries I've ever had. A little pricey, but well worth it. If Tartine was in LA/OC, I'd be such a fat kid..5 stars!

I love pastries. I love bakeries. Tartine was supposed to be the mother load of all things delicious. I was ready to stuff myself silly after seeing 1000+ reviews and a 4.5 star average. Why did the unthinkable have to happen? WHY ME?! I even came here twice since I thought maybe the first time something very rare and VERY wrong happened. But here's the sad truth: Banana Cream Tart - I usually love banana cream but the crust has to be good. I was looking for that flaky buttery pastry crust but it was nonexistent. Instead it was way too hard. I had trouble breaking off pieces with my fork kind of hard. Totally turned me off. Passion Fruit Lime Bavarian - It's supposed to be a lime moistened genoise with passion fruit Bavarian, topped with sweetened cream and coconut. Sweetened? I didn't think this dessert was sweet at all. The lime was actually pretty overpowering and I couldn't taste much of the cake or other flavors. The coconut topping didn't have that nutty creamy taste I expect from coconut. Instead it was bland and was no match for intense lime flavor. I didn't even finish it. Ê The second time I was more cautious and just got one thing: Chocolate Hazelnut Tart - The chocolate had a flavorless dull taste. The crust here was a problem too, not buttery at all and no flavor. The more I ate, the drier my mouth became. The hazelnuts were the best part but Tartine can take any credit for that. Pretty pricey for a mediocre, small tart. $6.51(including the tax) down the drain! I wanted to like it! I really did. I'm disappointed and sad but I'm not going to fake it. Let's just move on.

I love it when a place lives up to the hype. Yummy pastries, delicious coffee, and friendly service; you can't really go wrong with this place. There's so much to choose from that I don't know where to start. The quiche are my favorite now. The bread pudding and sandwiches are also good but the quiche is what I would go back for. It's no wonder this place is packed all the time. It's also easy to find since it's right on the corner of 18th and Guerrero street but parking is a pain on the weekends so be prepared to spend at least 10-15 min looking for parking. A suggestion? Order the pastries/coffee to go and walk over to Dolores Park and sit there to enjoy it. It really does make for a nice way to start off the day.

I am like everybody else. ÊLove the food, hate the wait, and that's the reason why I hardly frequent this place. However, this being the last stretch of the holiday shopping season, Arnold G, Christel and I inured ourselves to the crowds at Union Square by first going to lunch at Tartine. Ê I ordered a lovely fluffy slice of quiche with ham. ÊTasty, eggy of course, and a bargain at about $3.50 a slice. ÊIt's the perfect small main course since Tartine's desserts and pastries are large. ÊI had a piece of Arnold's hot panini prosciutto sandwiche. ÊNice gooeyness to the cheese, and good bread. ÊAs for the Croque Monsieur with Turkey (they were out of ham) that Christel ordered, I just disagree with an open Croque Monsieur sandwich. ÊI remember having the Croque Monsieur years ago here and just shaking my head: so wrong. ÊIt should be a closed sandwich with gooey bechemal sauce almost dripping from it, in my opinion. For dessert: there is so much to extol in a wonderful cup of Vahrlona chocolate pudding. ÊFirst, there is the immediate association of chocolate pudding with childhood memories. ÊAnd for me, there are many associations with North Carolina where I spent a couple of poverty stricken school years eating way too many cans of Dinty Moore stew and...cooking up jello pudding (so much better than the instant jello pudding). ÊTartine's pudding is rich, smooth, creamy...a sheer delight on the tongue. Yes, I should dock Tartine a star for the wait as well as something for that open faced Croque Monsieur (just to repeat: so wrong!). ÊHowever, their food is really quite good. ÊAnd their desserts are worth it. ÊSo, let it stand at 5 stars.

-Long long wait, without a view of the pastries even -Very hipster - think fringe bangs and willowy hair on the girls -Savory and sweet foods abound, all expensive My buy: a quiche and a cup of the brioche bread pudding. I considered the Croque Monsieur but it was...$10. Wha. My quiche was good--a bit too much crust in my opinion. The bread pudding, on the other hand...well; let's just say, I first gave some to my mom, a lover of sweets, who said: "Very interesting. I don't like it very much." And I agree. The best thing about this was the plump, red raspberries. I felt like I was eating sweetened sponges. Sooo spongy, squishy, and wet. Eek. Not my idea of dessert.

Today, i was looking for this place while following my GPS. then guess who called me on the phone? Crystal herself...to wish my happy birthday...and the first thing i told her was i'm looking for Tartine. she then tells me that the bakery doesn't have any sign. it is on the corner of 18th and Guerrero. it is green. gosh, if she didn't tell me that, i would be looking forever. since its my bday, the bf doesn't gripe at all about taking me there. i asked for money and he pulled all the cash out of his pocket, a total of $27 odd dollars. i can buy whatever i want. the sky is not the limit. i bought a banana cream tart, they have a large one for $36...now i'm regretting it. i should've gotten one for my friends to share. :( bought some rocher with cocoa nibs (the beans inside tasted burnt...should go well with a latte)...and a slice of coconut passion cake. i don't know why, i just had to have cake. i came late in the afternoon as there were not much of a selection to choose from. next time, i will try the lemon cream tart & lemon meringue cake. thanks Crystal. :)

I used to go to the Bay Area a couple of times a year and for various reasons, despite it being at the top of my list for breakfast, always missed out on hitting up Tartine. ÊI was bound and determined not to miss out this time even if we were being gluttons for punishment after hitting up Monk's Kettle. ÊMy boys and I opted to get everything to-go; even the next day our goodies were delicious. Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookies: ÊThin, crispy and delicious. ÊI'm usually picking the soft and thick variety of cookie but these were awesome. ÊMy friend, who always goes for oatmeal chocolate chip, proclaimed them to be the best oatmeal chocolate chip cookies he's had and the guys eats a lot of cookies so that's saying a lot. Banana Cream Tart: ÊThis shit is seriously BANANAS! We split this for breakfast the next morning and you couldn't even tell it was a day old. ÊCrust is a scrumptious puff pastry, not too much butter, with deliciously crunchy layers of thin pastry rising around the perimeter of the tart. ÊA thin coating of chocolate on the bottom of the puff pastry, a trick for any baker with their salt, kept the pastry from crumbling under the moisture of the cream filling. ÊThin slices of banana topped the chocolate and a delicious not-too-sweet custard completed the tart. ÊTopped off with a dollop of fresh whipped cream and fat shavings of chocolate....mmmmm what a way to start off the morning. Tartine is still on my hit list for the Bay, I feel robbed that I haven't been there for breakfast! ÊI hope to go there this year and experience their Croque Monsieur, which I hear is glorious; this time I'll make sure that I leave even more room for dessert and another star to update their review.

Writing a review about Tartine is like trying to put a dent in a Hummer with a toothpick. ÊThere are over 900 reviews for shit's sake. Nevertheless, Tartine has good food. ÊSure. ÊBut jesus, why don't they do something about the chaos? ÊI'm tired of the pompous excuse that they are "quaint" and shit. ÊAnd when they start messing up orders because they can't handle the madness, they should do something! Last time I was there, about halfway through the line, I (tried to) order one of those famous chocolate croissants. ÊThe nice lady who was helping me said I got the last one, pulled it out and put it on a plate. ÊOf course, you have to wait another 15 minutes to get to the cashier to pay and get your order. By the time I got there, a different (and very rude) girl told me I couldn't have ordered the croissant because they had been out for hours. Ê But... the other lady showed it to me! ÊThis went back and forth until the nice lady came over and agreed that there had been a mistake and the rude lady had given *my* croissant to someone else. Ê Nice lady told me I could get something else - on the house. ÊAt this point, I was overwhelmed by being pushed around by the crowd and stuttered that I wanted zucchini bread with my coffee. Ê I was charged anyway.

If there is 1 pastry you have to try in this lifetime, its the Almond croissant from Tartine's. They put this buttery, sweet Êcreme in the center, then embed it with toasted almonds which makes it completely addictive. I' ve been back there 3 days in a row now just to get this. Don't let the line intimidate you, it goes very fast and even if it took long, it is well worth the wait!

I sometimes feel so out of place coming to hotspots in Mission. ÊTartine Bakery, like Bi-Rite is a Mission institution (or so the line would suggest), and when I set foot inside it made me feel like an alien...I don't look like a skinny-jeans wearing Michael Cera clone, do not have his annoyingly quirky awkwardness, my conversations usually gravitate around sports and cars rather than the latest developments on prop 8 and how to take care of your dog, and I don't listen to Indie bands that are so Indie that they don't even want to be called musicians because that's too much of a label. Ê Enough about me and my lack of hipster-cool though. ÊI made a point to drag my sick, suburbanite self to this place after my wreck of a vday evening. ÊTrue to form there was a line and no available seating; wonderful for a sick person. Ê30 minutes later and $27 poorer, I got to sink my teeth into the most coveted of SF baked goods: a Tartine Morning Bun (amongst other things). Ê Here's the breakdown... Morning Bun - Okay, okay, it was pretty freakin good, but not nearly as good as 7x7 and everybody else would like you to think. ÊIt's kinda like an almond croissant mixed with a streudel, texture and taste-wise. ÊA little sticky, sweet, a little crunchy, yet still pliable somehow. ÊStill, it's definitely worth a try. Frangipane Tart - Topped with huckleberries, it looked and tasted like an almond croissant with huckleberries on top. ÊI thought it was too dry and crumbly, but pretty tasty otherwise. ÊMorning bun is still better though! Muesli - I should've looked in that damn serving bowl before I ordered it. ÊWorst decision ever. ÊIt was like runny fruit salad with nuts in it. ÊAnd I'm not talking plain fruit salad, I'm talking the nasty fruit salad that's made with canned mandarin oranges and sour cream. ÊI swear it said low-fat Greek style yogurt on the menu too...I've never seen a Greek yogurt that was that runny. ÊAVOID! Ham & Leek Quiche - Unfortunately the muesli combined with my flu to collectively kill my appetite so I only took a small taste of this. ÊIt was good, but it probably would've tasted better had I not been sick and bothered by the damn Muesli. ÊIt definitely had a strong dose of ham and egg which is always good. Ê Orange & Grapefruit juices - 100% pure-squeezed pulpy goodness. Ê So I'm going against the grain here and 3 star Tartine. ÊNothing about it was particularly attention grabbing or made me think, "OMGWTFBBQ I haz to get moar later!" ÊI know, I was sick, but I could still taste everything, and the tastes just weren't really doing a lot. ÊI felt like I could've gone to any other bakery and been just as satisfied with what they have on offer.

Oh my God! You know that lame 70's song Feels Like the First Time. Well that's how I feel about Tartine's banana cream pie. The first bite is killer. Every time I purchase one, when I take my first bite, I just want it to be my first bite all over again. When it comes to timing, they can fall back a bit on their pressed sandwiches. We waited for a good 40 minutes. Had bought a piece of their olive / ham bread to tide us over - it was kinda strange. Wouldn't get it again. I'll always be back for more pastry though!

Oooooh, are you in for a treat at Tartine Bakery! The smell from this place is very intoxicating.... Like something pretty tasty! I was told/read to try the Morning Bun. I did try and liked a lot. It is a refreshing twist on the usual bakery staple. At Tartine they have an orange-ish glaze in addition to the sugary/cinnamon-y goodness. I am a big coconut fan, so naturally I tried a coconut macaroon too. It might have been that I was famished from running around in Dolores Park or that it smelled so darn great, but I liked what I had and will come back for more. Beware of the line and crowded space. If you have a big group with you it will be tricky getting a seat at times. Otherwise, it moves quickly and is perfect for grabbing a bite on the go.

The presentation, sunny location and clientele at Tartine add the 'je ne sais quoi' to Tartine's success. All the food is cooked to perfection, and the cafe seating outside -nicely positioned for hip mission style people watching - has quickly made Tartine into a weekend hot-spot. Tartine doesn't need worth of mouth to entice pedestrians into its sweet lair - it's amazing delectables, easily do the talking for them. Whenever I have sugar cravings - it is usually Tartine's custard and banana tart that dance before me, as my stomach rumbles. ÊI am one, among many - who crave Tartine's sugar fixes. ÊTheir long lines easily attest to this. So yes, the lines and prices are something to consider before heading out to Tartine - but the desserts are just too incredible to pass up. ÊNote: Their bread pudding - is a fanstastic bargain; considering the big portions and fresh fruit.

Everyone knows that Tartine makes fantastic baked goods. ÊI actually read the cookbook from cover to cover last night and gained even more respect for the husband and wife team that created Tartine, who use the best ingredients and processes to ensure that their products are of the highest quality and have the most amazing flavor and texture. My only problem with this bakery is that it's too popular - purchasing a cookie should not be this stressful! ÊI would go more often if it weren't so crowded - as it is now, I leave feeling like I've run the gauntlet. ÊThe staff seems kind of stressed, too - and when we are talking about flour, sugar, and butter - I don't know, shouldn't we all be a little bit happier? Anyway, today I met my new favorite sweet treat from Tartine - the Almond Rocher with cocoa nibs. (Rocher means boulder, which is exactly what they look like). ÊWonderful crisp meringue with a chewy center and rich, bittersweet nibs to offset the sweetness of the sugary meringue - simply lovely, melts in the mouth. One day I'll get to sit at one of the big wooden tables with a cup of coffee and a slice of cake, but for now, it's a bi-annual pilgrimage to the counter to indulge my sweet tooth and admire the smoothness of the ganache and the layers and layers and layers of buttery pastry that Tartine does best - in the comfort of my home. ÊOh, who am I kidding, I mean, the comfort of my CAR *wiping crumbs off of coat* Ê (PS note to self to buy a container of milk before going to Tartine)

Seriously one of the reasons I want my own private jet is so I can peace out to San Francisco every now and then and binge eat baked goods from this place. Tell me, WHY was the eclair here so good? I mean, near perfection good? I couldn't even let what little of the cream that had escaped its beautiful chocolatey home sit at the bottom of the box untouched. And the bread pudding! And the chocolate cake! On top of the amazing food, the bakery also happens to be on a cute little street corner in beautiful San Francisco right near a park where you can take your baked goods to enjoy. The only downside is that there was quite a wait when I visited, but considering it was a Saturday morning -- totally made sense. WHY CAN'T I LIVE IN SAN FRANCISCO? Can't someone just throw millions of dollars my way so I can eat, drink, and travel and not have to worry about work, deadlines, and paychecks?

I know everyone raves about their morning buns, but alas I have not had a chance to try them because I am obsessed with their croissants that I never care to order anything else. ÊI've had both the regular and the almond and they are both excellent. ÊLight and flaky and so wonderfully buttery--they're so good...it hurts. ÊI know I need to branch out and try other things on the menu, but really, why mess with perfection? If I could have a Tartine croissant and a Four Barrel coffee (which they also serve) at least every week, I'd be a happy camper.

It's good. But based on the reviews, I thought it would be mind-altering. It wasn't. I thought it would transform me into a dessert-lovin', pastry-diggin' chic. It didn't. I anticipated a gain of an immediate five pounds just because I tried this place and could not stop eating to save my life. I didn't and I could stop eating. But, it was good. I admit, I don't have a sweet tooth. Ê(Thank the good Lord for that because goodness knows I eat plenty - - I'd be in trouble if I loved dessert, too!) ÊIf I have room for baked goods, I'd have another plate or bowl of whatever. Ê But once in awhile, desserts are SOOOOOOOOOO good that even *I* fall victim to it. ÊLike, at Acquerello. ÊOr Waterboy. ÊOr A16. ÊOr French Laundry. ÊOr.... okay, so I guess I like it often enough! At Tartine, though I only tried about 5 different things, nothing really blew me away or made me fall to my knees, praying to God for willpower. ÊTheir bread pudding was good - but bread pudding in itself is good, I'm not sure what made this better. ÊCoffee? ÊI love coffee, and their was alright.... ..but... but what makes it so special? It is a busy place, and it's located in what looked to be a charming neighborhood. FYI - - there are actually TWO Tartine bakeries in SF. ÊWho'd have thunk it? ÊWe went to the wrong one first, looked around and thought, "This can't POSSIBLY be what the Yelpers are raving about." ÊWe asked, and the girl told us that there is indeed one more. ÊEven we had more tact than to ask where it was, so we looked it up ourselves and headed to "THE REAL" one. ÊMUCH nicer, much bigger selection, and very good stuff here. ÊI do not know if the two are affiliated or not, but the selection at this one was MUCH better. ÊThe lines were here, not there. I give it a solid 3.5 stars. ÊThe half star is thrown in simply because with 700+ reviews, I figure I'm missing something... But to be honest, I am not entirely sure what kind of bakery would be deserving of 5-stars. ÊIf you know - - Êhook me up. Ê I'm looking to expand my horizons.

I give and I give and you never give back to me. ÊI'm sorry Tartine, this relationship just isn't working out. ÊI know it's a bit harsh to break up with you on Yelp, but such is life. Our first date was okay. ÊNot great, but I was willing to give you another try. ÊYour passion fruit lime barvarian cake was decent, but my former lover Citizen Cake does it way better than you do. ÊThe lemon bar you gave me was remarkably sweet and yet remarkably sour, just like your M.O., and it sorta rubbed me the wrong way. Our second date was really hit or miss. ÊThat lemon almond poppyseed cake/loaf was tasty, and I was excited to see you again, but the date really went downhill from there. ÊYour brownie was dark and bitter, like your soul, and your bread pudding was a mess of mush, just like your personality. ÊWhen you gave me that cardboard-esque chocolate chip cookie to munch on after our rendezvous it was like you were pushing me away, and I decided that I have had enough. I told myself that we were through and that I shouldn't see you anymore, but my friends told me to give you one last shot since you know, you're popular and cute and all. Last week's date where we shared that banana cream tart was alright, but not good enough. ÊWhen you surprised me with that caramel and chocolate in the bottom layer I was intrigued but after eating the whole thing I decided it fell a bit flat. So that's it! ÊI'm out! ÊAnd this time, I must say...it's you, not me. ÊPlease don't get jealous and make a scene if you see me hanging out with Bi-Rite; you had your chance. ÊJust let it be and move on.

Found this gem after searching for a place that has good almond croissants because it's my mom's favorite breakfast pastry and she's hard to please. We tried ÊLa boulange, but it failed in comparison; the almond croissants are the best of the best here. Just the perfect amount of almond filling and the oh so delicious and flakey crust! Even thought we came for just the croissant, waiting in the long line the first time Don't plan on coming here ordering one thing. I tried that and ended up with a bowl of bread pudding with fruit compote, two slices of quiche and some macaroons. ...and some pound cake/lemon loaf slice. Worth the wait in line. In fact, I've even come back many times after before opening time just to be first in line to order and most importantly.... get a table!

They may be known for their sandwiches but I was on a mission to try the morning bun. It's listed as #8 on the 100 Things to Eat or Drink in SF Before you Die by 7x7. The dough is tender for croissant dough and holds its twirl well. Its certainly helped along by a thick crust of superfine sugar with undertones of cinnamon, citrus, and more sugar. I yearned to try the bread (#25) but it doesn't make an appearance until 5.00 pm. Next time...

With the help of mommy, the kids are done with their homework. In reward, daddy has invited the kids to go to the East Bay for a quick errand, plus we wanted to start the day with a yummy breakfast at one of dad's bookmarked business. As always, with many people enjoying the weekend off, the line was long as expected. But parking our van is not a problem, because Matt found parking nearby. (You know not to come here on the weekends, do you understand?) We were stunned by the display of artful desserts for us to be pleased. For our drinks, Matt ordered the Double-shot of Latte in a 12oz cup. The kids each had a small hot cocoa. Although our drinks took forever to obtain from the barista, the crafty drinks were very enchanting. Also since our drinks were extremely hot, they also make great hand-warmers and manageable for the kids to hold, but not sip immediately. When the cooling process is upon us, we took a sip and the drinks waked us up with a smile on our faces. Matt ordered an Almond Croissant. The fresh pastry is baked frequently and is big in terms of size and taste. One bite of the brick-like pastry, a simple explosion forces Matt to indicate, that "this is a damn good and tasty Almond Croissant." And with the Latte, they make a good couple. The kids split an order of Bread Pudding. The warm Bread Pudding had raspberries for the topping over a ceramic cup. One bite of the Pudding, the kid's smile was huge and noticeable by other patrons dining at the time. Matt also bought a bag of mini Chocolate-chip cookies to snack for later on. The $8.00 bag contained 12 fresh and chewy cookies made with Scarffenberger Chocolate-Chips. Unfortunately, Matt doesn't know the price of each items individually, however he did lose and spend nearly $25.00, but gained a huge smile and love for this cornered bakery.

Like most, I'm willing to put up with the half-hour line in order to partake in Tartine's heavenly selection of top-notch pastries. It goes without saying that Tartine has delicious bread pudding, morning buns, quiche- and let's not forget the Mexican wedding cookies. Unfortunately, there is much room for improvement in its service department. I was helped by two employees- a tattooed-woman who became agitated whenever I spoke or showed the slightest hesitation, and an expressionless, shaggy-haired man who seemed far more interested in refilling his coffee cup than helping customers. I sympathize with anyone who must deal with a seemingly endless stream of indecisive customers. But being that this is their job, and keeping in mind that enthusiastic customers such as myself travel great distances to sample their famed goods, shouldn't they at least feign enthusiasm? How about a smile? I became fascinated with watching the shaggy-haired man's wooden face and vacant eyes as he answered customer's questions in a monotone voice. Between each forced response he would release the most subtle of sighs, then scan the counter for the location of his coffee cup. Occasionally, he would disappear for long periods into the back room in search of milk to refill his cherished beverage while customers waited patiently. Ê The noise level was so high that I had to yell my order, which only added to the tattooed-women's easily triggered frustration. Ordering food should be a stress-free, enjoyable experience. I felt unwanted. With that said, the pastries here are, hands-down, some of the best you'll ever have. For that reason alone I will return.

OMG. The BANANA CREAM TART is the best bakery item I've ever had in my entire life!!!! It was pastry perfection. In between bites, I couldn't stop saying "OMG. This is so good. OMG OMG..." The delicate chocolate shavings, creamy custard, fresh bananas, light whipped cream, and the perfect crunchy chocolate layered puff pastry crust. WOW. I was truly blown away. Bravo, Tartine! This pastry alone gives this place 5 stars! Brioche Bread Pudding - one of the most popular items of the bakery! This was also really good but the berries in it were pretty sour. I think this bread pudding would have been perfect if the fruits were sweeter. Maybe I came in the wrong season... Chocolate Hazelnut Tart - this was a little too rich for my taste, but still good! It had big pieces of real hazelnut on top which were delightfully crunchy. If you're a hazelnut fan, get this! I wish there was a Tartine in LA! ÊI'd come here practically everyday!

As everyone else and their mother has pointed out, the line here is ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous. The food is good, though. And the service is friendly. We had a bunch of stuff - chocolate croissants, ham and cheese croissants, bread pudding, pain au jambon - and it was all delicious. It ain't cheap, but they use quality ingredients and the prices reflect that. I have never tried the cakes, cookies, tarts or any other dessert type stuff, but I look forward to trying them - when I convince a friend to go pick some up for me so I don't have to wait in line. ***One big fat Fuck You to the asshole who got an attitude when we told him that we had actually been waiting quite some time for the table that he was trying to grab outside. We were standing right next to it, nibbling on our food and waiting for the people who were sitting there to get up. So no, you can't just walk up as soon as they walk away and try to claim the table for you and your friends who are still waiting in line to order. You can wait around like everyone else did. And your attitude when we politely explained that we had been waiting patiently for that table was completely uncalled for - you are so lucky that there were kids with us or you would've received a much larger earful than my simple "You know, you don't have to be such a jerk about this. We have been waiting, that's how lines work." Your parents must be horribly embarrassed by your lack of manners.

Their best baked goods (the orange-cinnamon morning bun and pain au chocolate -- when not burnt) are good, but not as good as ANY item I've tried (and that's nearly every item) in Crixa's case. Tartine once made my favorite mocha in all of the Bay, but Blue Bottle recently substituted Michael Recchiuti chocolate for Valrhona in their mochas.

Fourth stop on the 7x7 journey. Just a thought but I think they should have morning buns all day, it being on the 7x7 list and all. We asked the lady working there in the afternoon if we could try their morning buns to which she replied rather snippy, "no, it's not the morning." Still, we had been zooming around the city hitting up different locales and so we had to get something from here to check it off our list. After waiting in a line that moves pretty quickly, we ordered the coconut creme tart and a lemon bar too. The coconut creme tart was really good. It was the perfect amount of coconut shavings and creamy puff. It had a hidden chocolate base within the crust that made each bite come together in flavor and almost made me think that maybe I didn't have to have the morning bun, but based on some of the reviews here, I'll need to grab some buns next time. You'll need a steel fork for the tart and not the plastic kind that looks like metal (or, as I like to call them, the tuxedo print t-shirt of utensils) because the crust is some kind of tough. At $6.50, I'm not sure the tart merits the price tag entirely but it's still one of the better coconut pastries I've had and I don't even like coconut. Plus, you can eat it at the tables outside and people watch and then have random people come up and ask how the coconut tart is and you mumble something incoherent because your mouth is filled with tart. Nevertheless, I'll be back for those buns!

I do like Tartine but they go completely over the top. Tartine is very much Americanized French: quantity, quantity, quantity, butter, butter, cream, sweet, sweet, sugar coma. People are all "OMFG so decadent!! So powerful!! I've having a dessertgasm!!". Skillful, yes, but there is no delicacy to them, no crescendo.. they are full volume all the time. Tartine is the Beyonce of pastries. What I do enjoy immensely are their breads. I could dine on the table bread and butter at Bar Tartine alone. (It's supplied by the bakery.)

I will have to come back for the acclaimed Banana Cream Tart, as they were sold out of that and the sugar short bread cookies when we went. We did however, get to score some bread pudding. ÊIf you know me, you know I love me a good bread pudding. ÊHowever, I didn't think this was good bread pudding. Ê=( ÊDisclaimer: I did eat this the next day as we had dinner reservations and had dessert there... so maybe it wasn't fresh. ÊI just found it to be soggy and a let down.

After reading some of the best reviews on Yelp about Tartine Bakery, I recently made the pilgrimage to this great bakery. ÊThere's probably not much more that can be said that 1171 reviews didn't say already. ÊBut to relive the thrill, I have to tell you what I got. I ordered the Hazelnut Biscotti, Buttermilk Scone w/ currants and the Banana Creme Tart. ÊThe biscotti was small in size but large in flavor. ÊI expected the hazelnut to be sliced slivers, but they were more like a nut partially sliced. ÊCareful when you bite into it as a nut may fall out. ÊAlso, the biscotti was not teeth shattering crunchy, but softer in texture. The scone was also delicious. Ê I wasn't sure about the sugar sprinkles on top, but it was flaky and delicious. ÊThis is one of the larger scones I've had. I saved the Banana Creme Tart as a dessert after dinner. ÊThe creme on top was fluffy with the sliced bananas in a sweet compote. ÊThis made the inside of the tart light overall. ÊThe base (shell) of the tart had a flaky texture almost like a pie but the inside of the base was lined with dark chocolate. ÊA very nice surprise. ÊThis dessert was fantastic and even better (and lighter) than I expected! On my way out, I ordered a Mellow Chamomile Tea. ÊThis had me calm and relaxed for most of the day (very nice). ÊThank you Tartine Bakery for your out of this world selection!! ÊI'll be back very soon.

Is there room on this bandwagon? ÊI hope so because I'm jumping onboard! I'm a huge banana cream anything fan, and when I heard about the tart and saw the photos.... I was on a mission! ÊIt's right around the corner from pizzeria delfina and bi-rite, so you've got a lot of delicious places to hit up if you can get to the block. The line was down the street (one house down) and apparently that is "good".. after we finished at delfina it was only barely out the door = AMAZING. ÊWorth the wait, although now that I've been spoiled, it's going to be tough not to break down in tears if it's the usual 2 houses down line. YES, THE BANANA CREAM IS AS DELICIOUS AS THEY SAY... it's also just so fun much to walk in there and count the number of things you want to eventually get to trying. Can't wait to go back for the brioche bread budding and everything else. YAYUMMMM!

Their baked goods are wonderful, but their staff is so unbelievably snotty that it brings their 5-star food rating down to 1 star. (Yes, I know -- food and service are 2 completely different things, but one does affect the other when speaking of the dining experience.) In a town full of excellent bakeries, why give my money to a place that doesn't appreciate my business? I avoid Tartine like the plague.

Good god, I never knew it was possible to make pastries so flaky and buttery! ÊThere was a long line by the time we got there - around 10:30a - but it was well worth the wait. ÊThe coffee matched the quality of the baked goods. ÊIt was days before I recovered from my butter coma!

Copy and Paste...this is what it comes down to when writing a review for Tartine. ÊThe pastries are just out of this world. ÊI was on my foodie quest in the Mission District of San Francisco and I happened to stay right across the street from this place. ÊDespite my close distance to the bakery, I still ended up standing in that horrendous line, but it was worth it...those flaky chocolate croissants and that banana tart! ÊI'd stand in line for probably an hour for them....they're that amazing!

On Saturday morning, you will need to queue for 20 minutes while obnoxious losers cut in line by joining their doormat friends who were on line earlier. ÊYou know the scene: loudmouths who wish they would've been hipsters at some point, but now they just have babies that they accessorize. They will talk to the top of their lungs about this restaurant and that dish because they are FOODIES, don't you hear them??? Foodies are the next big thing, like Williamsburg. I am a peaceful woman, but I need to take a break from my Tartine Bakery routine because of this obnoxious scene and the fact that tartine is too busy for enough quality control these days. I won't even mention the giant lint/filth ball that was stuck to the sticky buns. ÊOr maybe I will. It had a bird feather in it. Join me in the vomitorium? Why 2 stars? ÊI have gratitude for any establishment that seems to repel hippies as well as Canadians with maple leafs displayed on their person.

The only thing I don't like about Tartine is the prices. ÊYou can pay upwards of $6 for a slice of cake. ÊIt'll probably be a damn tasty slice of cake, but that's no drop in the bucket. That said, if you come here for the occasional visit or rare splurge, there's still a lot to love. ÊThis past Friday, I came here with Susan P. around 8:00pm, and we got a lemon bar and banana tea bread, and then sat ourselves down at the communal table. ÊI should preface this by saying that I don't have a sweet tooth, but our little desserts delighted me beyond belief. ÊMy banana bread was perfectly moist, and though I thought that $3.75 was an outrageous price to pay for one slice of bread, it was worth it. ÊThe $4 lemon bar was superb too, with a mix of tart and sweet flavors, complete with soft lemon and munchybutterycrusty crust. ÊThat's how I like it. Ê And you're not just paying for the baked goods, you're also here to enjoy your company and the community. ÊI just discovered how much I love communal tables, and our experience that night further contributed to my fondness for them. ÊAs we were sitting there that night, eating our well-made and delicious desserts, we spent time talking with this husband-and-wife couple that we'd just met, who were also sitting at the table. Ê On that perfectly crisp and clear night in the Mission, we shared stories and bites of food with strangers who became great company. ÊThe Tartine staff let us sit there and chat, even though it was getting past closing time. ÊWe found out that we had a lot more in common than just our fondness for the desserts at Tartine. ÊThe world became just a little bit smaller, our food tasted that much sweeter, and my faith in people grew that much more. Ê Thanks, Tartine, for the sweet desserts, for your communal table, for being a gathering place for this community on a cold night. ÊLoves it.

I finally made my way back here again after a fabulous experience in November. Again, I OD'd on pastries. I mean how can I not? The morning buns were just as good as I remember them to be. I finally got to try the banana cream pie and I must say it is way better than the coconut cream pie. It's not as rich but lighter and creamier. =P Only con is that the line was way longer this time around...and it was raining....

"TARTINE" (French, from Old French, diminutive of "tarte") - a slice of bread, sometimes with butter, jam, etc. Appropriately eponymous in its beginnings as a bakery that specialized in breads baked in a wood-fire brick oven and elegant pastries, the husband + wife team of Chad Robertson and Elisabeth Prueitt opened Bay Village Bakery in Point Reyes Station, where it garnered rave reviews. ÊThey eventually moved their business to San Francisco's dynamic and eclectic neighborhood in the Mission, corner of 18th and Guerrero Streets in the summer of 2002. ÊThe bakery is small, inconspicuous, modest, bearing no signs nor emblems but a colored 18 x 24 copy of the famous Tartine cookbook and an antique white paper on an 8.5 x 11 wood panel sign posting the operating hours, perched by the storefront window, beside the entry door. ÊThe bakery; nonetheless, is mobbed by customers (locals & visitors), where they wait patiently in line for their turn to order impetuously delicious, heavenly baked goods. My favorites: - QUICHE (made w/ creme fraiche, Niman Ranch smoked ham, and organic produce). ÊI have never tasted such a delicate, yet flavorful quiche as this. ÊIt doesn't have a heavy cheesy tone as most quiches do, but rather light & airy from the creme fraiche, with hints of smokiness from the ham, freshness from the organic produce, & a subtle taste of nutmeg. ÊThe crust, all by itself, is a wonderful treat. ÊIt is slightly flaky but moist w/ a creamy buttery texture and taste. ÊThis quiche, was by far, the best I've ever had! - CROQUE MONSIEUR Ê (open faced sandwich made w/ their Country bread, bechamel, gruyere, thyme, pepper, and topped with either the smoked Niman Ranch ham or seasonal vegetables). ÊAgain, the best croque monsieur that ever graced my tastebuds!!! ÊThere is something about the pigs in Niman Ranch, in pork or ham form, that elevates the flavors of a certain dish. ÊAnd combined with bechamel sauce, melted gruyere cheese, and slices of yellow tomatoes, on top of a perfectly baked Country bread, will definitely put a smile on someone's face who woke-up on the wrong side of the bed! - CROISSANTS Buttery, flaky, but moist inside are the classical properties of a perfect croissant. ÊThese are as good, and perhaps even better than the ones I've had in France. - HOT PRESSED SANDWICHES * IDIAZABAL & MEMBRILLO (lightly smoked sheep cheese w/ quince jam). ÊA blissful marriage of savory & sweet, w/ a hint of smokiness! * PECORINO & ALMOND (sheep cheese & almonds crushed w/ olive oil, lemon and sage). ÊTalk about peculiar & inconceivable pairings of ingredients. ÊWho would've thought that their combination would result to a grandiose taste! ÊIncredible!!! * SOPRESSATA, FONTINA, BROCOLLI RABE & PESTO (spicy sopressata w/ Italian fontina and pesto). ÊIn a nutshell...oooooooh-r-g-a-s-m-i-c! Ê"Someone please light my cigarette!" These pressed sandwiches are delightful! ÊI might even be bold to say that they beat Campanile's grilled cheese sandwiches! ÊAnd Meltdown...definitely move over! - PASTRIES * LEMON CREAM TART (sweet pastry shell filled w/ rich lemon cream, topped w/ unsweetened cream) * CHOCOLATE TARTE W/ TOASTED HAZELNUT (sweet pastry shell filled w/ Scharffen Berger chocolate mousse & toasted hazelnuts) * SHORTBREAD * ROCHER (meringues w/ cocoa nib & toasted almonds) * FRIAND (Scharffen Berger chocolate bite topped w/ ganache) - SCHARFFEN BERGER CHOCOLATE PUDDING. ÊFreakishly decadent, luscious, and silky!!! Ê - BREAD PUDDING (housemade brioche, topped w/ caramel and fresh fruit, toppings change daily). Ê These desserts are wonderful, light, airy, flavorful, and not sugary. ÊThey imbue the true essence of French baking. Another plus is their COFFEE. ÊThe lattes and espressos are strong, robust & flavorful, fresh, and not bitter in taste. The only downside to Tartine is its size and lack of seating. ÊBe prepared to queue in line and fight for a table once you pay for your goods. ÊThey have a strict policy of purchasing before sitting. ÊBut then again, you can always get it to go!

I grew up in Germany, where you have to have a Masters degree in baking, just to open a bakery so my tastes are little refined. I will say most of the items here are very good, and some of the best I've had outside of Europe. I've tried most of the things on the menu, and the only thing I dislike about the goods are the Crossaints tend to be kind of bland, and their Country Loaf bread tends to be burnt. I understand it's made without preservatives and tends to be tougher in texture. I'm fine with that. German bread is even more dense and tougher, but this is literally black on the outside. I would expect more from a bakery charging these kind of prices. Another annoyance are the strange hours they have regarding certain items. I can understand baking is an arduous process that cannot be rushed, but they don't start serving Breakfast Rolls until 8:30am. That's too late for me to get before work. I think they should change the name to mid-morning rolls. In addition they don't serve bread on Mondays. I'm sure there is a reason for this, but I have no idea. Not to mention they only serve bread after 5pm. This is obnoxious, because in Europe I typically buy a loaf of bread in the morning, and eat it with lunch and dinner. I can't eat an entire loaf of bread from 5pm to bedtime, and it's of course bad the next day. With that said, I have yet to experience gruff service like some others spoke of. Just the usual disinterested, young, white, attractive, female dressed in homeless chic. I don't mean for this to be a bad review as I love their desserts, and I hope they continue to flourish as they have. I just think they have some room for improvement in other areas.

Tartine, tartine, tartine. I've held off on reviewing this place mainly because the mere thought gets me so worked up, and I get all sorts of all-caps-shouty. But I shall strive for objectivity, and plainly present the facts: Almost $4 for a croissant? Almost TEN for a Croque Monsieur? THIRTY-FOUR for a whole quiche? I will spend a lot of money on a lot of things, I'm the first to admit, but Tartine is simply not worth the money. Most places around Dolores Park incite my ire because they really don't have to put much effort in for people to eat/shop there. It's like buying snacks at the movie theater--you'd rather bring them yourself, but sometimes you just didn't plan well enough (Bi-Rite's entire empire is exempt from this critique). Tartine's heavy and overpriced, bottom line. They wouldn't have to charge $4 for a croissant if the thing didn't weigh as much as a small child. As Shepard Fairey wisely mused about art, perceived value at some point becomes real value. People see that ridiculous line on weekends and immediately want in. I can name a number of better bakeries, but alas, they are far from Dolores.

Somehow I managed to find myself in the neighborhood (read: drove all the way from North Beach post Mama's and Yogen Fruz), and decided to get some pastries for later since I've had it bookmarked for ages. I walk in and get the Banana Cream Pie and Fruit Cake thinking I'd save them for later. Riiiight, the second I close my car door, I'm eyeing the box of sweets and I decide to just take a closer look at the Banana Cream Pie. Less than 3 minutes later, someone catches a glimpse of me staring back like a deer in headlights, face covered in cream and pie crust. Dang it, why does this keep happening?? I was asking for it though, thinking that not taking a fork with me would actually prevent me from eating. HA. I don't need to convince anyone that Tartine is delicious with their thousands of positive reviews. Just remember, if you're gonna get something "to go", bring a fork.

So very, very good. Every time we go it is a SERIOUS struggle trying to decide on what we should get. We've tried the... morning bun - soft, sugary, with a hint of orange, caramelized at the bottom to add to the amazing goodness, in short: to-die-for croissant - good, standard croissant scones - we got two, and ate them on the car ride home banana cream tart - can I just say that ALL of their tarts are perfectly baked, crispy and deliciously hidden with chocolate? yes, this one is no exception frangipane tart - so yummy, would buy again lemon cream tart - love lemon-filled-anything, this is a definite must And we will be trying much more... The only thing we were a little disappointed about was the fact that we couldn't buy bread in the mornings (only after 5pm...). It also sucks that every time we go we get stuck in front of a really pushy, uptight customer who is waiting for his/her turn but you can tell they are FURIOUS that we are marveling over the delectable pastries. However, these downsides could never keep us away from the morning bun.

Sat at a table with two danish girls. Sitting twiddling my thumbs. I'm trying not to watch them eat, talk with their insatiable sense of seriousness. One tucks into her chocolate cake with great relish - a friend insists her burly figure implies tigerish instincts beneath the covers. I'm a doubter. I try. Eyes closed and fork gripped tight - nothing. My mind wanders to a pork shoulder... the way it's strung up, each loop digging into the flesh, digging deeper as it winds down. Eyes opened. Her tank top has me going kosher. The conversation stalls. I look up and recite some passage from a recent times article, "blow jobs are so yester-year. The new taboo is anal sex; you know?" A gay couple to our left splutter and spill little earl grey. He's wearing a wifebeater; I miss the irony. The first of our two danes screams something to her friend in a foreign tongue; we get the hint, commenting politely on the weather.

The coffee drinks and pastires are amazing and worth every penny. ÊDELICIOUS!! They get 5 stars. Ê The rest of the menu is lacking.

Judging by the 1500+ reviews, I am one of the last people in San Francisco to have visited Tartine. ÊAs a loyal Liberty Cafe (http://www.yelp.com/biz/É) customer, I had pretty high expectations for Tartine. ÊThat might have been its undoing. Ê We came to Tartine around 9 am on a sunny Friday morning, and the place was packed. ÊDon't you people work? ÊAll the tables were taken, except for two tiny tables inside. ÊThe line stretched from the cash register all the way to the door. ÊThe 15 or so people in line were blocking my view of the baked goodies on the shelves, but I couldn't help trying to see them. ÊEverything looked delicious, rich and extremely appetizing. Side note: for the people who hang out at a bakery on a Friday morning, the crowd seemed a bit edgy. ÊI was rudely interrupted with a terse and annoyed "excuse me" twice. ÊI really didn't mean to be in your way, really. ÊThe place is small, cramped and overcrowded, and I am pretty big. ÊSor-ry! We got to the registered an ordered a morning bun and a scone to share. ÊI also got a cup of coffee. ÊActually, I got a cup FOR coffee, since I had to get my own from a self serve station featuring a Thermos and your usual coffee staples. The coffee was very good (Organic Mr. Espresso), and the self serve station meant "have as much as you want." ÊIf I didn't have to go back to work, I would have had a fourth cup. The morning bun was very good, but not "life changing" as I heard some people describe it. ÊIt was a little bit too sweet, even for a sticky bun. ÊI liked the buttermilk scone a lot; it was flaky and light. ÊI heard good things about the bread pudding, one of my favorite things to order at a bakery, but I haven't tried it yet. ÊMaybe next time.

Ham-and-cheese croissant and morning bun earn the top tier spots for me, followed closely by the bread pudding with fruit, the wait-worthy paninis, and the completely shareable lemon pastries. Everything with chocolate (Valrhona chocolate!) is insanely good. The baristas make a killer foam, and a mostly friendly staff comprising entirely cute women doesn't hurt business one bit. If your mouth isn't watering already, I'm not sure you can be saved. The downside: -A looooong line and wait for a table, where, on any given morning, several pods of Êtable reconaissance will shark around innocent people who are still wiping their mouths and picking their teeth. -It can be a strange mix of both neighborhood snotty and touristy. Somewhere in between is ideal.

3.5 stars but between 3 and 3.5 .. well i'm not really sure :[ I had expectations of this place because of the reviews and rating. Maybe it was the day, after the Red Bull Soap Box Derby, they were SUPER BUSY and crowded or something... but my banana cream tart just wasn't that fabulous. the flaky tart crust was delicious, the flakiness was awesome i could just eat this by itself. the chocolate covering the inside shell was not TOO sweet, but fairly sweet. but the bottom layer of caramel just pushed it over to TOO sweet. the banana filling i really enjoyed! if it had banana filling and tart shell i would have been pleasantly surprised. then there was the whipped cream, gallops and gallops of it ... i started to feel gross after finishing the tart. maybe you're not suppose to eat an entire tart after a 2 hour standing event when you're super hungry. but isn't everything suppose to taste better when you're starving?

A lot of people see a review count like this and think "what's the point?" of writing a review. ÊPersonally, I enjoy the lack of pressure: I can take any little portion of the sweeping review-canvas and doodle in whatever comes to mind. And what comes to mind is that these guys definitely deserve their spot as 3rd-most Yelped business in SF (2nd if you don't count the meta-Yelp). ÊYes, the morning buns are amazing (the secret, I think, being the orange glaze), but the frangipane croissants are even more so, and the lemon-almond pound cake--well, it makes me weep to think of all those wasted years subsisting on the dry, crumbly stuff at Jamba Juice or Starbucks. ÊEverything is just colossally moist--even the hair of the people in line (which frequently goes around the corner but moves pretty fast) has that unmistakable Saturday-morning just-showered quality (complete with shampoo smell). I don't know what it takes to get a seat here, but I recommend just taking your goodies over to Philz to get a cup of coffee that's a worthy complement.

I've eaten at Tartine many times in several lengthy visits to San Francisco, and overall, I would say that there are extreme highs and extreme lows to the overall experience. ÊTheir croissants and morning buns are stellar. The banana cream pie has been ethereal (but on a second tasting, it had a leaden, tough pastry), and I've had a handful of other great items from the bakery. The bad: a meusli that clearly contained nuts that had gone off, a bread pudding that was overcooked and gummy, the fore-mentioned dense crust of a banana cream pie, an INCREDIBLY ungenerous slice of tres leches cake (which was otherwise delicious, but was perhaps an inch wide in a to go box), weak coffee, and, dare I say it, an improperly baked loaf of their famously coveted, difficult to acquire loaf of a rye boule. ÊI am a baker, and it was clear that they hadn't proofed the bread long enough, so it was flat, had no oven spring, and was a leaden brick both in weight and in taste. The worst: the STAFF! Holy cow, is this an entitled bunch! Some are pleasant enough, but seriously, if they could be bothered to work a little faster, it might be a bit less of a drag to be there for everyone. ÊThey seem to have no interest in being there, much less actually doing their jobs, and my lord they are irritating to watch as they slough to and fro. ÊSeriously, I know you work in a very popular place, but how about a little get up and go, girls? Ê Is Tartine a great neighborhood bakery? Yes it is. ÊBut I probably would tire of the staff, the prices, the lack of generosity and the bakery in general if we lived here. ÊVisit, but don't worship - it ain't all that.

Tartine is a mediocre combination of the best in French baking and the worst in French logistics. ÊI've managed to fight my way to the counter and eat a few times and everything I've had has been really good (especially the bread pudding). ÊBut hell, the line on weekend mornings, rain or shine, Êis 40+ people deep and doesn't seem to move, except when people give up and leave. I think part of the reason for this is that at Tartine, you lose 10 I.Q. points when you enter and gain 10 pounds by the time you leave. ÊBy the time they are up to order, customers seem to have forgotten why they are even there, and spend several minutes staring slack-jawed at $6 pastries. ÊThis is the only place I've ever seen where people go into a food coma BEFORE shoveling down 3 million calories. ÊI like relaxed European-style dining, but this place doesn't do it right. Also, the seating options here are essentially nil. ÊIf you eat inside, you have to wedge yourself into a chair and get battered by handbags and strollers as other customers roll through. ÊIn the really bad seats, you'll be eating about a foot from the nether regions of someone standing in line. ÊNo matter where you sit inside, people in line will be watching you as you eat, which I hate. If you sit outside, you will battle fearless pigeons nonstop, as there are always dirty dishes to feed on outside Tartine. I hear Godot really digs this place, but I do not. ÊI live two blocks from here and haven't been in three months. Ê ÊI've seen people waiting for the store to open 15+ minutes ahead of time, which is just ridiculous. ÊThis place is not worth waiting for.

love this place! Êbeing a pastry chef myself, I definitely want to open a place like this. ÊI love this that much I bought their book on the first month it came out. Ê:o) their banana cream tarts, open-face sandwiches and cookies were all good. ÊI also have to mention their croissants, bread pudding and choc cake were all great! okay, so they're a bit pricey but definitely worth it. I also told people who want to try this place to make sure they have a lot of time to spend... line is always long, parking is hard and place can be crowded... coz they're that good.

I got there late and picked what ever was left. And it was mighty tasty, but not spectacular. ÊI ordered some macaroons, which Mary Ann says there is a touch of almond in there. ÊI don't know about the almond, but there were good. ÊFerghal liked them too, as he stole one! ÊGood chocolate cookie, walnut butter cookie, good shortbread, and a really good hazelnut chocolate tart. ÊI really wanted some kind of chocolate bite size cake in the case, but they were out. I will try to head over there for some bread and better pickings, but I don't think the bread could be better than Acme or Raymond's.

I was pumped to finally go to Tartine with all its hype. I expected and was prepared to spend an ass load of money because I have a serious addiction to baked goods. And then I got to the display cases... Everything looked overdone. I mean everything. The morning buns, croissants, and every other bread item and pastry appeared to be burnt. I don't mean a lovely deep golden brown. I mean everything was black on top. Even the croque monsieurs I saw were completely black around the edges. I was looking around in disbelief like seriously? Every freaking thing is overdone? People are OK with this? I didn't want to pay for any of it. I refocused and instead decided just to order the Banana Cream Tart everyone raves about. Great concept but it was executed so poorly the day I purchased it. The tart crust was inedible. The pastry crust should have been the highlight and it was horrible. Not flaky and also overdone. It would not cut with a fork, I had to use a knife. It just tasted like bad, burnt, store bought pie crust. Horrible. The chocolate poured into the crust was too thick. Just a slab of overpowering chocolate at the bottom. There were just a few scant banana slices in a poor excuse of a cream pie filling. The caramel was a nice touch. I also ordered an iced coffee that was seriously the worst iced coffee I have ever had. I couldn't even drink it and threw it away after trying so hard to make myself like it. The employees just acted as if they could care less about anything. No smiles. No thank you. I really want to experience this wonderful Tartine everyone else seems to love. I'll give it one more chance but I still don't think I've found my bakery in CA. peace, love, and good booze ~ chase

The sandwiches seemed a bit pricey, but it is SF and everyone seemed to enjoy their sandwiches. So I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. I came mainly for sweets and tried the Lemon Cream Tart & Banana Cream Tart. I loved both, but the Banana Cream was especially amazing! Even hours later the crust was not soggy and I liked that. I can't wait to make another trip :]

Going against the grain here but the first (and only) hot panini sandwich I tried at Tartine last weekend was a huge disappointment. They were out of the roast beef which was what I really wanted so second runner up was the prosciutto, cheese and arugula... it was just plain nasty. The prosciutto was a strange shade of grey and the whole sandwich tasted like grease. Neither the hubby or myself could even finish it. Also ordered the banana tartlet and that was just mediocre. Kind of hard to eat without making a mess since the crust is covered with a chocolate shell... great concept but made the whole thing a bit tricky. My real complaint though is with the horrible paninis. I would not order one there again. Update 4/9/08: Okay, they got another chance with MUCH better results and a star addition from me. Had a really delicious Croque Monsieur, a bite of wonderful quiche and another bite of a perfect croissant. Actually, that visit gained them 2 stars back. I'm still staying far away from the paninis however!

I have never been to Tartine. ÊBut it is my favorite Bakery. ÊLast year my good friend Nakeisha started bringing me morning buns. ÊAfter one I was hooked, I crave them. ÊNakeisha who lives in SF but works in Marin stops by the bakery on a regular to pick up batches of goodies for my freezer. ÊThe morning buns are my favorite, but you can't go wrong with those amazing croissants especially the almond ones. This last November I received the Tartine cookbook for my birthday. ÊI have been baking like crazy this holiday season, and every recipe has been amazing. Ê One day I will journey to my Mecca, but I fear that the mystery of the place is part of the draw for me.

Boo! ÊA Tartine Bakery review when it's so so old news. ÊBelieve it or not, I just FINALLY, for the first time ever, ate a Tartine baked good. ÊI've been to the bakery for capuccino's but have never stood in the line for baked goods. ÊThere are already a handful of Êfine sweets establishments I have become a slave to my sweets addiction for - I thought if I don't eat anything from Tartine I won't know what I'm missing. . .until today. Ê As if two sides, no make that three sides (the third was a gift from the kitchen), a bottle of fizzy water, about 6 bread sticks, and a salsiccia pie weren't enough to put me and Dodo into a Pizzeria Delfina food coma. ÊSeriously we had to practically be scooped out of the restaurant. ÊThe only thing that would save me from my pain was a double espresso. ÊYeah sure let's go to Tartine Bakery for a double espresso only - sure. Ê Before I go on I have to say had there not been a bunch of empty tables inside and a short line, I probably would not have waited or ordered anything to eat. ÊSaturday around 6pm is the time to go. ÊUntil today, I've managed to avoid getting "hooked" on this place since opening. ÊEvery time I'm in the area, there's a line out the door and down the sidewalk. ÊI don't need to wait that long for a bigger butt. ÊI wait that long for things like discounted Eames furniture, Keihl's products, Madonna concert tickets, and a blessing from the Dalai Lama. Double espresso turned into seasonal bread pudding, macaroon, meringues, and some chocolate goodness round bite size ganache filled yummy. ÊHoly sugar high I'm in love. ÊIf I were a famous actress and I needed to gain a lot of weight for an upcoming movie role, I'd eat at Tartine Bakery every day. Yum yum for a fat bum bum! ÊAnd totally worth it!

An abusive, love-hate relationship is what this is. Why do I keep attracting this sort of girl/eatery?! Anyways. Great bread... ... but it can only be purchased during a 20 minute time interval, between 17:10 and 17:30, 4 days a week. Bakery, you say? Pretty good pastrami sandwiches... ... but there may be a half hour wait in line, and then a half hour wait for the sandwich. Brilliant lemon tart & chocolate pudding... ... but every other pastry is somewhere between "meh" and "suck". Good location ... ... but good luck parking, or getting a table. Nothing else here is all that great, sorry... .... and then there's are the high-ish prices, the terrible coffee, and the "bus your own tables and tip please" service. Gah! Gah! I hate you, Tartine "Bakery"... and yet, I keep coming back.

The morning bun was fantastic, and the almond croissant was great and about as big as my foot, even if it was little burned. The line was too long to go back, and I didn't want the drama to mention that it was a little overdone. I'll definitely give 'em another try though. Get there early. My only complaint would be that their opening (7:30 am) does not coincide with when I need to move my car for street sweeping (7 am), but they've gotta do what they've gotta do.

Okay. I've seen this line at Tartine's about 100 million times -- I'm always like YYABHL (Yet Another Boogaloos Hipster Line). ÊIt happens to be a weekend with my momma in town so we decide to part-take in the line. Well, I'm happy to report that the line goes quickly, it took a max of like 10-15 minutes. The game plan for future visits: You can shard your wait have 1 person go get coffee in the *coffee only line* and come back to the person waiting in the baked goods line! Brilliance! Yes I know. The bathroom: Seemed acceptable for a bakery.

My friend used to live near this place. I've decided to forgive her for never bringing me here during one of my visits, but ONLY because she brought one of our other friends once, who in turn decided to take me when we were in town. After emphatically suggesting Tartine for breakfast, she started to backpedal a bit. I'm not sure if she was nervous we wouldn't like Tartine, or just wanted to keep our expectations for breakfast in check, but she did her best not to overhype it. Well, from the second we walked in, there was nothing to worry about, we were drooling over all of the items we saw people eating. All of our sleepiness and hungover crankiness melted away as we carefully perused the offerings. We were so visually enamored with their items that we all went a bit crazy, ordering 3 items each. I went with the double pain au chocolat, a morning bun, and a chocolate chip cookie with oatmeal and nuts; I know it sounds gluttonous, but I was starving and everything looked so tasty! The pain au chocolat was a*FREAKING*mazing! The croissant itself was huge, warm, flaky and buttery. Definitely, not something you'd want if you're watching the calories/fat. It was obvious they had been pulled out of the oven recently because the chocolate was still melty. I ended up saving my other two items for later. My morning bun, a flaky pastry roll dusted with cinnamon and sugar and some orange zest, was quite good too. It didn't really compare to the croissant, but that's because it was slightly stale. The stale factor is 100% my fault, I ate it the following morning for breakfast and in my haste didn't wrap it well. Despite the slight staleness it worked wonders for hangover number two, in as many days, and was better than any overpriced, mediocre pastry I would've found in the airport. The cookie was good, but average compared to the other offerings. I liked that the cookie was thin and flavorful and not overly greasy. If you live in SF and have never been here, what are you waiting for? Seriously?! Put down the computer and get your ass over there. NOW!

I wish I could remember what all we ordered but I tried to wipe the experience from my memory. But this is what I *do* remember.. Croque Monsieur --- Mediocre at best. This is typically something I am all about but it was horribly lacking. Bland, blah. Quiche --- I love me some quiche --- but not theirs. The crust was sub-par and the filling a mere shrug. Banana Bread Pudding --- We took this dessert to a friend's house for dinner and to put it lightly we were embarrassed. The bananas were disgustingly over ripe and brown, the pudding was dry and the flavor - if there was any - was masked by the bananas (if you could call them that). I know we picked up a couple of other things but it is gone from my memory. I have no freaking idea why this place is ridiculously over-hyped. San Francisco, you are a food Mecca --- what gives? I am a foodie and I expect you to deliver. I have yet to find a bakery where I would be satisfied serving their desserts instead of making my own. If you can tell me the proper thing to order --- *perhaps* ÊI will consider giving it another shot because how can so many hundreds of San Franciscans just not know any better? Tartine - I suggest a throw down. Oh --- the pot of tea was lovely though.

I am almost positive that I had already written a review for Tartine, as it is my favorite bakery in all of San Francisco, but my review doesn't seem to exist anymore, so here we go again: I have tried many of the desserts from Tartine: -Bread Pudding w/ Seasonal Fruits -Lemon Bar -Lemon Cream Tart -Lemon Meringue Cake -Frangipane Tart -Passion Fruit Lime Bavarian -Chocolate Brownie -Chocolate Croissant -Chocolate Hazelnut Tart -Chocolate Souffle Cake -Devil's Food Cake -Scharffenberger Chocolate Mousse My favorite would probably have to be the Chocolate Souffle Cake. ÊWhen slices are not available, and there are more than a couple of us, we just buy the whole cake. ÊYes, it's that good. Also: I would happily wake up 30 minutes earlier just so I could take a detour to Tartine on my way to work. I did not cry when I accidentally sat on some dog poop in Dolores Park because I had Tartine pastries to distract me.

Laundry plan: Load it all and make a quick run for pastry and latte. Arrived at Tartine just before it opened on Saturday morning, and there was already 10 people in line. ÊMy mom and I tried the morning bun, croissant, and seasonal fruit torte. The morning bun and croissant were perfect, nice and flaky on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside. Ê The latte was delicious! The espresso to milk ratio was perfect. ÊI feel some people add too much milk and you can't really taste the espresso.

Our fourth stop in the Ang and Lily Happy Hour walkabout of the Mission. This place is supposed to be one of the tastiest bakeries in the city, and it didn't disappoint in that regard. I tried the coconut macaroons and got a monster chocolate chip and oatmeal cookie. Saved the cookie for later, ate the macaroon. It was toasty on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside. Yumma. Although I know we got there near closing time, we were both a tad disappointed that they were out of a few of their mainstay items. Also, for me, they close a tad early for summer, but that's on them, so whatevs. Final analysis, I'd go back... And my dog would too, since he was the one who ended up eating that big, monster cookie. Damn you, dog! I got one bite, he sneaked the rest (off the nightstand at the hotel). Loved by humans and dogs alike, this is a go...

The best bread in the world. Period. So why only two stars? MISSION ATTITUDE UP THE BUTT We need them more than they need us, and they treat their customers that way. I've never been treated so shabbily on such a consistent basis. A major part of this is the bread policy which is: 1) only available from Wed-Sun from 5-8 pm 2) unless they sell out first 3) but you can order ahead of time 4) but only in person since they don't answer the phone, which means waiting in that godawful line twice 5) none of this is written down, you just find out the hard way.

Don't let the long line fool you: this place sucks. I came in here a week ago, on a Saturday afternoon, and should've brought a book with me, because the wait was over 30 minutes (I wish I could see the look on a person's face when he gets closer to the door and realizes that the line continues, all the way to the registers in the front). But the question is: what is everyone waiting for? Expensive pastries that taste mediocre at best? Or the "holier than thou" attitude from the staff? I'll admit, I had a bit of sticker shock when I first saw how much stuff cost, so I just got a chocolate croissant. It was bland and dry, it resembled a meager-filled cookie. The cashier girl was condescending and rude (how do you say "chocolate croissant in French? Anyone..?) and it was a relief to walk out of there. Plus, if you're in line for the bathroom, be on the lookout for waitresses who will mow you down with trays of pastries and cookies, even though, really, there is no place to wait or form a line. Good job, Tartine. Bravo.

Perhaps not interesting or informative for me to give 5 stars to place that has almost 150 reviews so far, with many "BEST BAKERY" claims, but I needed to give them what they deserve. ÊEating their creations makes you realize how good things taste when made out of quality organic ingredients. ÊSitting outside sipping their excellent coffee and enjoying a croque monsieur on a weekend afternoon made me feel so glad to be in SF. Ê BRUNCH: While I could see how Tartine could be in discussion as one of the best bakery in town, I cannot say it's the best brunch place. ÊA brunch is a time I want to relax, sit back and enjoy my Sunday paper with caffeine in my hand (yes, caffeine is relaxing), so I prefer a full table service. ÊMy idea of relaxing is not waiting in a long line peaking through people's heads to see the menu, making a quick decision when it's your turn in line (not a good time to be asking questions when you know 30 people are waiting behind you), walking through a crowd of people while trying to find a table without spilling your coffee, and leaving fairly quickly because there is a bunch of people looking for an open table. ÊFurthermore, most of their dishes are pre-made, like most bakeries. ÊTherefore, they don't have more involved usual brunch dishes that takes time to cook. Ê Therefore, I am giving them 5 stars as a Bakery, but not as a brunch place. ÊOh, make sure you try their Eclairs -yum.

I think key to having an excellent experience at Tartine is to avoid it on the weekends. The line goes pretty quick on weekday afternoons, even right at noon when the sandwiches come out. The jambon royale & gruyere is tasty but the generous slathering of dijon tends to overpower the sandwich. Just request that they go light on the mustard. The pecorino & almond is perfect as is. Crunchy cheesy goodness! I think the only potential gripe with the sandwiches is that they tend to be a little greasy. But for $8.25 a piece, you get three huge hunks of sandwich and a bit of pickled veggies. Quite a deal. And you shouldn't miss the lemon cream tart as it is the perfect combination of sweet and tart. I don't think a better pastry shell exists. And you don't need a fork. Just shove the whole thing in your face! Or at least, that's what I do... So on a sunny day, take your sandwiches and tarts to the park and enjoy your lunch. Don't forget to grab extra napkins. ETA: I think the gals behind the counter are super sweet and accommodating. I've returned again and again for sandwiches and pastries and have yet to encounter any snobbishness. Another update...bread! Just call and reserve a loaf or two so you don't have to worry about showing up after 5 p.m. and have them run out. They use their country bread as the base and variations of it include walnut, sesame seed, olive, or dates and olives. I like the country best for sandwiches and walnut to eat by the slice. Also, freeze the leftovers! The ones with nuts and olives keep better as they keep moisture in. $6 for the plain country loaf and $6.50 for the others.

Half the city is under a blanket of fog and the other half is beaming with sunshine. Whenever I come here whether it be for lunch or weekend brunch the sun is always shinning around Tartine. The sandwiches served for lunch are yummy! The croque monsieur is my fav; thick hearty bread topped with gruyere and shitake mushrooms. The bread pudding is to die for! Seasonal fruit with brioche bread made fresh daily (we got here at Ê1pm and there was only 2 servings left in the pan). The chocolate pudding and brownies are made with Valrhona dark chocolate. The shelves and counters are lined with fresh made bread, croissants, cakes, tarts and cookies galore. There's chairs inside with wide windows to look outside or you can eat outside and take in the beautiful day. Service is friendly with a smile. After hours the places turns into a bar scene with dinner service. Ill be sure to write my review on that soon.

Remember when you were a kid, and some adult would always ask, Ê"Which is your favorite: vanilla, strawberry or chocolate?" Ê Now that I'm old, I realize what an impossible question that is; Ê There was always that kid who would answer Neopolitan, thinking they were foiling everyone. ÊNo, you're just a pig!

Ê Neopolitan aside, Tartine Bakery is the place where you can find vanilla, strawberry and chocolate in all it's forms plus more. ÊI bring glass locking tupperware here when I'm flying somewhere, or having a party and have them pack it with their bread pudding with strawberries and rhubarb. ÊIt's a good hostess gift that's uniquely San Francisco. ÊSo far airport security hasn't stopped me... Ê Ê Their chocolate pot de creme is delicious, I don't care what anybody says. ÊYeah, restaurants have been known to make it better, but for takeaway in a plastic container, Tartine's can't be beat. Ê The cakes are great for when you have a tea party, as they're so pretty and Mary Poppin-esque. ÊTruthfully I only order to-go as the ambience is a bit too cafeteria-ish... albeit perhaps a French cafeteria? ÊBut a bustling cafeteria is preferable to when it was a black void in the building's previous incarnation as Carl's Bakery. ÊCarl's Bakery, san the kitsch sign, looked more like a leather bar and not very bakery-ish. ÊNow if only they would open one in New York...

Oh Croque Monsieur! Ê Only you can steal away the love of my husband from me. ÊLucky for you, I love you also. ÊSo warm and buttery. ÊSo tasty and tantalizing. ÊWe can't get enough. We were just in SF for a week and had breakfast there four times. ÊThe croissants are to die for. ÊThe chocolate one is the best i've tasted. Ê The place is tiny. ÊEating there isn't too comfy for a bigger group so we just ordered to go. ÊThe line moved fast everyday. ÊIn four days, we tried the quiche, fruit tart, shortbread cookie, shitake Croque Monsieur, ham Croque Monsieur, croissant, chocolate croissant, and morning roll. ÊThe only thing did like was the morning roll. ÊOur fav was definitely the Croque Monsieur and croissant. Ê Skip on the coffee. ÊWe just went to Peets. Sure wish they had one here in Honolulu.

I can't sleep at night. I can't focus. I keep whining. I cry sometimes in my head. I bite or pinch myself until I almost start bleeding. I (try to) force myself to not eat sweets: no ice cream, gelato, candy, etc. What does this have to do with Tartine? Let me set the scene. I woke up today at 6 pm and curled up into a ball because of the sharp pains in my root-canal-needed-molar. I finally get up to go back to my apartment and finally buy toothache medication along the way because I've taken 30 advils the past three days and surely there are better remedies. Throughout the night I've been applying Eugenol (it's hella nasty) to stop the pain in my tooth as I wait all night to make sure I'm awake when it turns 8 am so that I can make an appointment. I'm tired. I smell like cloves. And I still have a ever present pain in my tooth. Then I realize that my friend left one last tart from Tartine's from my Saturday potluck brunch. I remembered how good the strawberry and lemon tarts were but debated in my mind for awhile if I should eat the coconut cream tart (or something like that.) It looks good. My tooth screams no. I dab my finger in the cream and eat a little bit. Mmm. Damn it. I start walking away because I know the risk involved. Even just that little bit was enough. I cut myself a quarter slice. I start eating it and hot, freaking, damn. Not only is the cream impeccable, but there are bananas at the bottom. And THEN I find out there's carmel AND a chocolate layer. All packaged with perhaps the best crust I've ever tasted. I know that in 20 minutes I'll start screaming inside my head with the agony from my tooth being exposed to the sugar. But on the outside I'll be smiling. Because I just ate the best f---ing tart I've ever had.

Bottom Line Up Front: Go. Eat. Enjoy Its that simple Pros: Best pastries/bread I have had this side of the Atlantic Cons: Busy. So so very busy. Like all the time busy. Prose: Like many other reviewers, I find it difficult to describe what is happening here. I suppose I could wax poetics, go into how the Morning Bun could slap the Existentialism right out of Kierkegaard. But no one, including myself wants to hear that. So I will just say this- Do yourself a favor, indulge everyday in the wonder that is Tartine Bakery. Because there are those of us not in San Francisco who wake with envious hearts, and unsatisfied carbohydrate full stomachs, who would sell their thumbs for a freaking morning bun!

I think that there are too many reviews for this place. So, all I want to say is that if you haven't been there before, then get ready for the long line, the crowds and the limited seating. We ordered the morning bun, bread pudding and the croissant with jambon and cheese when we went. It was a good start to a morning, and they also have good coffee. I must say that I think the bread pudding was the best I've ever had and was my favorite of all the stuff we ordered. Custardy and vanilla-y. But definitely too crowded, so that's the reason for the 4 stars. I think next time we go, we'll order and take it away. Overall, a good experience. Next week we're off to the Boulangerie on Pine Street for a battle of the bakeries!

This is a local favorite for pretty much everyone. Their pastries are always phenomenally good and smell fantastic. I highly recommend the chocolate croissant along with the ham and cheese croissant. The only drawback to the place is that there is typically a long line to get in. I once showed up 20 minutes before they opened and was still 8th in line. By the time they opened, the line was about 1/3 of the way down the block. Also, seating is a bit scarce in there. But it's always worth the wait.

I thought I had been to the best bakery when I went to Bouchon in Yountville. ÊThen I went to Tartine, and everything changed. Tartine had the most mouthwatering and awesome-looking pastries I've ever seen. ÊThe cup of chocolate pudding with the perfectly-shaped dollop of whipped cream on top looked like heaven.

The rocher with almonds was very tasty, and quite gooey on the inside. The coconut macaroon was wonderful, but perhaps a tad salty? ÊAll I know is that it could have been sweeter. The best thing I bought was the fragipane croissant. ÊIt was much better than the almond croissant at Bouchon, and was super buttery and flaky. Ê My friend had ordered some bread, and when she asked if it was ready, the lady at the counter told her it was just being taken out of the oven! ÊTalk about fresh! ÊAnd it was like 3:00 P.M.!

As you might guess from my previous review, I don't go to Tartine. I can't support the mass delusion that seems rampant in SF that it's a "great" bakery. It's not ... it's just okay. That said, a co-worker brought in a box of Tartine pastries the other day. Here's the deal: - the croissants at safeway are actually more "parisianne" than tartine's, which was dense and greasy. Croissants are supposed to have almost no mass and a sweet crunch on the outside. Julia Child is rolling in her grave - the muffins at Starbucks are better than the bit of one that I had ... greasy was a theme on this day at tartine. My takeaway: Southpark was right ... people in San Francisco have their heads up their butts. Either that, or they have never been to France.

Breads are not usually in my breakfast repertoire, but I had to go to Tartine Bakery for popularity's sake. ÊAs a Yelper, how could I not go to a place with 2500 reviews? I would usually only go to a bakery for a very savory breakfast item, but in this case, they only sold some pastries and other baked goods. ÊMight as well eat what they do best. Oh man, the gougere was out of this world. ÊAccording to some research that I did, a gougere is a French choux-style pastry with cheese mixed in. ÊIt was flaky, rich in Gruyere flavor, peppery, and light. ÊIt was the perfect piece of baked flour, butter, and eggs. The quiche was pretty good. ÊIt was flavorful, moist, and the crust was flaky and rich. ÊIt did not have the typical quiche denseness, as it was a bit more refined. The bread pudding was alright. ÊIt was very moist and sweet and had some fresh pears and blueberries, but it was sort of plain. ÊThe syrup was nothing special, and the brioche was somewhat boring. If you come here, expect a line or no place to sit, but the pastries are worth the wait here. ÊThey bake bread here, and bread you shall eat.

I must say. THIS IS NOW MY ALL TIME FAVORITE BAKERY! We got here around 10am so the crowd was not too bad. a few people in line but it did not go out the store. There were still fresh goods to try! We had: Croissant: "To Die For!" it was crispy on the outside and so soft and moist on the inside! I am usually very picky with my croissants but this is the best. My cousin who went with me never usually even eats croissants but we munched on this like it was the last piece of food on earth! :D Chocolate filled Croissant: again, awesome! the chocolate was the right sweetness/bitterness. some other ones that I eat..the chocolate is just in a straight line down the middle, but this one was scattered throughout the middle. delish! Open Face Sandwich (spice turkey): unfornately we came for the paninis but they were not taking orders for lunch until 11:30. but its okay cuz the open face sandwich was very good as well! they toasted it for us so it was hot and good. It had a few thick slices of turkey, a tomato and provolone cheese melted on top. yum Macaroons: SO GOOD! it had a hit on lemon so it had alittle tart to it so the coconut was not "too much" best macaroons we had ever! it was small compared to other stores but I think it was big enough for a light snack after all the pastries and sandwiches. Lemon Tart: We were so full from the pastries that we did not get a chance to try it yet.. its still in the bag and ready to be eaten later. but this one was on SF 7x7 magazine top 50 desserts!! so it MUST BE GOOD! It was Êabout $27 for everything, alittle pricey but SOOOO WORTH IT!! :D

Tartine is a fantastic little shop. If you are lucky enough to get a table at Tartine, make sure you take advantage of it and stick around for dessert and coffee. The grilled sandwiches are fantastic, especially the Pain au Jambon, but the dessert is great too. I split the hazelnut tart and the chocolate mousse with my father and boyfriend. At the beginning I thought that the hazelnut tart was better, but the chocolate mousse is so light and fluffy that it really grew on me. You can only eat a couple of bites of the tart, which is delicious in its own right, but its one of those things that you can't have too much of. The chocolate mousse is the way to go.

Hands down one of my favorite Bakeries in the CITY. Coming from a baker's POV they do all their stuff just right! I've gotten the lemon tart, hazelnut tart, devil's chocolate cake, morning bun, ham and cheese croissant, banana cream pie, and the chocolate chip cookie with oatmeal. Their morning buns are too die for! Crispy on the outside and soft and warm in the middle! Yumm! This must be eaten the same day, its not good the next day. The banana cream pie is soo good, with slices of banana in the pie and a flaky pie crust. Cannot go wrong with that. If you get anything chocolate at their place, it's going to be rich and decadent. It's more of a dark chocolate taste vs. milk chocolate. Get here early, they tend to run out of things quick and their is always a line! Been here many many times when going to the city!

I don't know why people love Tartine so much. ÊI do know why people go there -- it's the only standalone bakery in the neighborhood I can think of with its range of offerings. ÊBut somehow that got extrapolated from "only one" to "the very best." Well, it's not. ÊIt's really just a decent neighborhood bakery. ÊNone of the pastries are made with much precision. ÊThere's no sophistication ... you won't find much more than big lumps of crust (usually harder than it should be, and cracking in the case), lots of filler (usually butter and sugar) ... the bread pudding is good, but it's really one-note and a gut bomb. ÊIt is bread pudding, after all. Ê It's OK for a bakery to be kind of homey and inelegant. ÊThey kinda serve the pastry your grandmother-you-don't-have made in your fantasy childhood.

I LOVE Tartine. Only if it wasn't so packed all the time, I would be here every weekend! During my first visit, I fell in love with the croissant. Plain or chocolate. It's so fresh, flaky, and buttery. Just like the ones from Paris. With all the tempting pastries in front of me, I couldn't settle on just one item, so I also ordered the bread pudding. I thought it was good, but I like my bread pudding more "made to order" warm versus sitting out cold. One another visit, I had the Jambon Royale and Gruyere pressed sandwich. YUM!!!! Homemade thick slices of country bread pressed with smoked ham, Gruyere cheese and Dijon mustard. It's so delicious. The banana cream tart is another favorite of mine! Chocolate covered crust with real chunks of banana mixed with the banana pudding and then topped with whipped cream and shaves of chocolate. Such a decadent treat!!! They sell it individual tart size and large pie size!!! MMMMMMM..... Coffee and espresso drinks here are wonderful too!

How can you possibly review a place after 1,026 others have written before you? The irony is that I was around when this location opened. Oh well. I've never been too much of an early adapter. Tartine isn't unique in filling the surrounding block with its tempting aroma, but I'm so glad it does. It's tough: Is merely getting a whiff sufficient when I decide that the line is too long and too annoying? Probably not, but it'll have to do. Okay, I once declared that Tartine's ham-and-cheese croissant was the single best food item in the 49 square-miles of this city. Today, I reiterate that claim. Mouth-watering, perfectly baked and flaky croissant filled with Niman Ranch ham and, I believe, gruyere (not sure where from). Everything is as hot and textured as it's meant to be, every time. The ham is slightly juicy, and a bit smoky. But enough of my yappin' -- just try one already. I haven't visited a substantial portion of the menu, but I can say that everything I've ever had has been utterly delicious -- morning buns (bits of orange rind round this out), plain croissants (again, perfect flakes), croque moisseurs, almond croissants (frangipane), bread pudding (with seasonal fruit), and, well, I know I'm forgetting a bunch of other things. Coffee is by Mr. Espresso, and I don't care what you say (well, I kind of do), it's damn good. Fresh orange and grapefruit juice. Okay, the downside (honestly, what keeps it from getting six stars) is the line, made worse by the fact that the place is just way, way too small. Perhaps not their fault, but my solution is to open Bar Tartine during the morning and early afternoon and serve coffee and pastries there. So I sort of feel like I can fault them for the line. But not really. The love is strong. Prices are reasonable ($3.25 for aforementioned best food item in the city). Get it to go if you can't stomach the line, take it to nearby Dolores Park, and let life be grand.

My French-born grandmother once told me, "When you are een Parees and you see a long line outside a patisserie, you must know eet ees fob-oo-less." Well, the same thing could be said about pastry shops in San Francisco (only without the bad French accent)! I'd read about Tartine in a magazine and then on Yelp and being the rabid francophile that I am (eet ees, after all, in my DNA), I simply HAD to go there and try the much lauded banana cream tart. One taxi ride reminiscent of the crazy double-decker bus scene in Harry Potter later and I was standing in line, in the rain, on a drizzly, cold Sunday morning. ÊThe locals had bed-head and were bleary-eyed but determined. ÊThere was a palpable wave of excitement undulating through the crowd (yes, crowd...before 9 in the morning) and it grew stronger as it got closer to opening time. Finally, the girl inside unlocked the door and dove for cover as the ravenous, zombie-like crowd burst inside. All that waiting must have made me a little loopy because I ordered: one vegie quiche, one Croque Monsieur, one morning bun, one eclair, and two tarts (There were two of us). Everything was delicious. ÊCrazy, zombie-satisfying delicious. ÊParis-worthy delicious. The quiche was light and mile high. The Croque was NOT a true French Croque Monsieur but had tomatoes on it and was open-faced on a baguette. ÊI'm a purist and prefer the traditional way but thus one was rather tasty. The eclair was outrageous. ÊNote: The pastry cream was much more liquidy, less pudding-y than I've ever tasted but it was delicious and flecked with vanilla bean. I do not care for banana but I did try a bite of the tart and thought it was good -- not as good as the coconut cream tart! ÊOMG! If Heaven had a taste, it would be Tartine's Coconut Cream Tart. ÊLight, flavorful and the crust is coated with chocolate!! Tips: Arrive early. Divide and conquer or you won't get a seat. Indulge but be sure to ask for a Togo bag or box as portions are generous. Don't venture on foot too far up 18th as the neighborhood gets decidedly dicey, especially if you're alone or female.

I would seriously move to the Mission Dolores area for one reason alone: Tartine Bakery. Tartine is so quintessentially San Francisco - the crowd is a diverse mix of hippies, hipsters and yuppies of all races and age groups congregating at shared tables (or separate tables thisclose to each other so that you might as well be sharing a table) over newspapers, chess games, and the perfection embodied by Tartine's frangipane croissants, lemon tarts, bread pudding and croque monsieurs. Yes, you'll have to wait 30 minutes in line just to order one croissant, so make sure you order EVERYTHING you want the first time around because you don't want to underorder then debate (after finishing off your croissant, smacking your lips and licking your fingers) whether you should get in the now 45-minute line to order that other pastry you were eyeing. Tartine makes me oh-so-happy. Even though my visits to Tartine are rare (it's just so out of the way for me), it makes me happy just to know that it exists and that if I am craving a perfect cup of bread pudding covered with fresh berries, or a cup of muesli made with Strauss organic yogurt and chock full of muesli, nuts and fruit, or a perfect flaky frangipane croissant oozing with almond paste filling, or a perfect tangy and creamy lemon tart, it is just a short drive (but crazy parking situation) or BART ride away. Tartine, je t'aime.

it was hotter than an ass crack in this damn place. I hate this insufferable heat. luckily, the wonderful aroma of baked goods and grilled pannini drowned out the sweaty body odor emanating from other patrons. those overhead fans didn't do jackshit, why bother turning them on. my only consolation was nibbling on a delicious macaroon the size of a grape. I exaggerate, it was the size of an anemic plum. my buddy's sandwich took friggin 15 minutes to make but she swears it was worth the wait. she tolerates heat much better than I. since she is a lifelong Sunset dweller just recently transplanted to the Mission (WHY GOD, WHY ???!!!), I do believe she will be dragging me to more of these alien Mission eateries and bars. I always told her she needed psychotherapy. I subtracted 2 stars for the minuscule space and the bizarre set-up. the food was quite tasty albeit pricey

LOVE IT HERE! I WOULD WAIT IN LINE FOR HALF AN HOUR FOR THEIR FOOD, AND IT WOULD (if I could make the font bigger I would) BE AMAZING!!! Their croissants are good, scones, yummy, but their morning buns are my #1 thing. Think sir mix a lot circa 1992 (baby got back) when you say this next thing *words changed*: My tongue don't want none unless you've got morning buns hun! What's even better are these "morning" buns are not just good in the morning! Oh, no... don't let the name fool you. They're great throughout the day... morning, lunch, afternoon! hahahah (they thought they could fool me...)

#8 on the 7x7 list brought me to Tartine at 9:30 on a Tuesday morning. ÊAnd there was a line. ÊAt 9:30. ÊOn a Tuesday morning. ÊI wait my turn, get up to the counter, and place my order - two morning buns, a pain au chocolat, an almond croissant, and a cup of bread pudding. ÊThe girl working the counter asks "to go, right?" and I shake my head - "no, for here please." ÊShe looks at me like I'm insane - I guess she thought I was eating everything myself? I finish paying and look around. ÊNo seats. ÊAt 9:30. ÊOn a Tuesday morning. ÊI thought to myself "don't these people have work!?!" ÊThen I realized what I was doing there. ÊYou see, Tuesdays are my "work from home" days. ÊSo the rest of the patrons must be "working from home" too, right? ÊRiiight. A few minutes later, a table opens up outside and I take a seat. ÊMy buddy (who also happens to be my boss/the CEO of the company I work for) shows up shortly after. ÊThat's right - while the rest of you slackers are too busy worrying about getting caught playing hooky by your boss to enjoy your morning bun and coffee, I'm sitting here having pastries with mine. ÊYup. ÊI know you're jealous :) Okay getting a little (ok, a lot) off topic here. ÊBack to the food. ÊThe pain au chocolat was pretty standard. ÊThe morning buns lived up to my expectations (except that the caramelized sugar on top kept getting stuck between my teeth) and the bread pudding even more so. ÊThe almond croissant was a pleasant surprise... not exactly sure what it was about it though. Definitely my go-to place for pastries here in San Francisco.

Super delish...but oh the line! I woke up super bright and early to see and taste what this place was all about. After waiting in line for an hour I looked at the menu and although I was super pleased all their ingredients were organic and local, I was a bit shocked by the price. However, the food more than made up for it. I got a croque monsuir with dried tomatoes (no ham for the veg.) and a pain au chocolat that filled me up for hours. I would definitely go back again but only if I'm patient enough to wait for the line to die down.

If you want a good place to break a diet, Tartine is it. ÊI went for the first time yesterday and had the bread pudding with nectarines (to go). ÊI got a cup, but the to go container was pretty full, so I think I got more than my money's worth. The only thing about this place that I don't like is that their menu doesn't give you much information and a handful of the items are announced daily. ÊIf you are new to the place, have a friend stand in line while you take a look at their display cases because once you hit that first counter you have to be ready to order.

If you've all the sudden become a passionate reader of my yelp oeuvre, you might have noticed that I only award 4 stars or higher. Three reviews isnt enough to start extrapolating a trend, but I will say: I do think some things suck and I will trash them in due time. For now, I am writing about the restaurants that I like, really like. Tartine is one of them. And I like it so much that Ill just go ahead and call it the best bakery in San Francisco, hands down. In fact, I think its one of the best bakeries in the world. And Ive travelled far on the pastry comparison circuit. If Tartine was on a corner in Paris, they'd love it as much there as we do here, it would even be better than a whole pile of Parisian Pastisseries. At aTartine in Paris, they might get around to improving their plain croissiant. It pales in comparison to the incredible ham and cheese version, a croissant that would have any Parisian on their knees in reverie, if that was their thing. Back to the Mission. If you can handle the line, you'll be rewarded. I think the line can even be fun: check out the condition your neighbors are in after a night out, oggle the outerhoodies who've been craving the bread pudding so hard that not only are they willing to queue a mile, they've also spent 30 minutes parking their Volvo in Mission-Dolores on a weekend. That same line rematerializes every night around 5 for the bread. Bread with crust, that is. Large, nutty peasant loaves that are unrivaled, if you can ever manage to get your hands on one. The supply doesnt seem to last longer than 2 hours. Favorites: The morning bun. Outrageous. Orange zest is the right touch for these. Like its name suggests, they are best in the morning while they're still gooey and before they've crusted off completely. When they are at their best, each bite is as good as the chewy core. I always make a point of pointing to one in the middle of the tray. Ham and Cheese croissant. Refer to Parisians on their knees in reverie. This is breakfast. The ham is thick cut and porky (which is how I like it) the gruyere is as pungent as good punctuation. With the filling as its brace, the pastry in these always seems to come out perfect - flake shattering and lap smattering. The plain croissant can come out bready, but these always turn out right. Bread pudding. Oh so good. They make brioches just to make bread pudding. That is crazy, but so is the result. Updates daily with what's available. Favorite yet had bananas and currants. The choclate chip cookie. I didnt think I like nuts in my cookies, and i also didnt think I liked them crunchy. These cookies are walnut laden and crunchy and I love them. I think its the butter+crushed nuts+high quality dark choclate trinity together that makes them happen. Pumpkin tea cake. This little guy is always hidden on one of the lower shelves. Its seems an afront to pay $2.75 for something that looks so plain, but its always been super-moist and properly pumpkiny. Great (if not obvious) fall fare. If your a fan of carrot cake, give this a shot. Gougere: a puff ball of cheese barely diluted by flour and butter. Honestly, too rich for me. Everytime I eat one, I am burbing black pepper and cheese all day. But as a specimen of gougere, these are top, top notch. Croque Monsueir: Its my understanding that a croque is a closed sandwich with cheese melted on top, but I wont argue about the semantics of a dish I like so much. The key here is the spread of bechamel to soften that famous bread, topped with ham or the seasonal veggies and then topped with a hard cheese that gets crisped to perfection. Strangely, the accompanying pickled carrots are essential to the experience. The cakes. Take one home to your mom. I did, and she lives in Madison, WI. She's a baker with an epic reputation, prone to exlaiming, ' good, but not as good as mine." Tartine's version of choclate cake silenced her. That ganache is just too good. I feel full just writing about all this. Print out this pastry guide and get in line!

Aside from one of the most convenient (yet high trafficked) locations in the Mission/Dolores area, Tartine Bakery is also one of the most enjoyable places to dine daytime. While the lines meandering outside the bakery appear intimidating, it's a fairly quick shuffle inside to order pastries and sandwiches. The FOOD: As Gaga would say-- "beautiful, dirty, rich." And 'dirty' as in sinfully delicious. For the notoriety of the Tartine name, the portions are very large, especially for the sandwiches. I devoured a blanc fromage and banana heat-pressed sandwich. Three massive chunks with a tart quince jam. Bread is made (duh) fresh in the bakery. Note: While most pork lovers will love the remainder of the savory menu, there is remarkably few non-pork meat selections. However, this does not disqualify the quality of the food! Oh, hell no. The croissant was carb-rich and delicious; chocolate just this side of dry, juxtaposed with the pastry dough. PRICING: You're paying for quality, my carbolicious friend. Whereas a giant choco chip cookie is around $2.50, a choco hazelnut tart runs closer to $5.50. Sandwiches are between $11-$13, unless you opt for the lighter portioned "open-faced" ones, running around $9. SERVICE: Ordering is quick, however I did end up waiting 20 minutes on a Saturday at 2pm for my banana sandwich. A server came outside to my table and personally told me that it was unusual to wait so long. She also offered to take an extra order for something to nibble on while I waited. That is damn fine customer service, especially how busy they are. You also bus your own table, for the most part. Servers bring you your food, but you get to clean if you want a table (which you have to be on the lookout for- otherwise there's a wooden countertop off to the side of the pastry ordering station). Props also to one of the most beautiful bread-making recipe books I've seen in a while.

I'm currently eating my way through the SF Big Eat food treasure hunt which lead me to the Morning Bun at Tartine. I have a lot ot say about the Morning Bun but first can we talk about the cafe itself cause this place is wonderful. You know when read some book and the protagonist is at a caf having a "moment". This is THAT caf. ÊIt's a rustic, romantic, warm buttery spot in the middle of SF's unending fog. I felt that perhaps I would be able to speak french just by crossing the threshold. The morning bun was revelatory, soft and light with just a hint of orange zest. My friend had a ham and cheese croissant which was also delicious. We might've accidentally bought 4-5 other baked goods as well to "take home to my husband" I wanted to stay there for the rest of my life. I might move there when I'm retired. During a hard day at work I close my eyes and think about Tartine, it's my new happy place. Verdict: Go immediately. Eat anything and everything. Then tell me about it so I can live vicariously.

SADLY i came at around 4 pm and they were out of all the things yelpers were raving about! no bread pudding, no banana cream tart.. no morning buns.. IF THOSE ARE THEIR SPECIALTIES shouldn't they be making those all day long!?! i was SO excited to try tartine.. but sOOO dissappointed in what i ended up ordering.. they should have more than just 3 good items! i got a almond tart with blueberries on top which had a nice flaky and buttery crust but i probably wouldn't get it again... and the latte i ordered wasn't top-notch either.. my friend got the chocolate hazelnut tart. it was kind of gross.. and the chocolate tea cake my other friend ordered tasted just like the costco chocolate muffin.. the best thing was my friends rocher! sadly i doubt i'll have another chance to try their crazy good items since i live in LA.. guess i should of gone in the morning!!

I smelled this shop before I saw it. ÊThankfully we arrived JUST before the massive late breakfast lines began on a sunny/rainy Saturday, otherwise my drool may have flooded the tiny restaurant. We ordered a few of the bread puddings (warm and flavorful with a great hint of cinnamon and lots of creaminess), lemon-almond poppy bread (perfect for snacking on later), bacon and leek quiche (hot! Êvery tasty), pumpkin cake/bread (dry, but ok), almond croissant (flaky and nommy), croque monsieur with sun dried tomatoes (CHEESY GOODNESS - mmmm), a morning bun (had to have the 2nd wave order this one as they ran out for about 20 minutes - WORTH the wait), a couple of coffees and a latte that I mistook for a huge bowl of butternut squash soup. This place is crowded and bustling and no one is in a hurry to leave their table. ÊI felt bad for vulturing over a couple people, but Tartine either needs a bigger space or to finish whatever construction they are doing on the corner and get some sidewalk tables! ÊI'll be back, but I'll be taking my bread pudding and morning buns out for a picnic a few blocks away in Dolores Park :)

Almost impossible to find parking around this neighborhood but don't you fret! This is how I do. Listen, I'm going to drop you off in front the Tartine! Stand in line while I look for parking and if you get to the register before I find my parking spot then get me 2 morning buns an eclair, two tea cakes and a banana cream tart. Absolutely amazing! It's butter in all shapes, sizes and textures. You want creamy? They'll give you creamy. You want flaky? They'll give you flakly. You want moist? You have moist. You want the best? Tartine is the best!

Fartine, that's what I call it. The staff often treats you like you just farted and the line is so obnoxiously long that it's humorous. There are better pastries at better prices out there. The bread is pretty scrumptious however. Just order ahead. Last time I was there there were two kids running around the inside area, and licking the length of the pastry case. The staff ( and parents) said/did nothing.

I love pastry shops! Aww... reminds me of Paris. The shop is small, quaint and casual. The pastries a little pricey, but they're large. Some items I tried were: DOUBLE PAIN AU CHOCOLATE - 3.5 stars BANANA CREAM TART - 4 stars LEMON CREAM TART - 3 stars ECLAIR - 3 stars WALNUT CURRANT COOKIE - 4 stars, my fav Street parking spots are very limited.

What's all the hoopla about - maybe I just ordered the wrong things. 3 out of the 4 things I tried were average to below average. The almond lemon pound cake wasn't moist enough and tasted too much like marzipan. ÊThe bread pudding brioche with peaches was chunky and just lacked something. ÊI'm a big fan of muesli so I gave the muesli a shot as well - underwhelming. Given the line to order, not sure if its worth the trek.

Why go to Tartine when you can go to Boulangerie in the Fillmore and Cole valley? I know I know, there is an overwhelming majority of San Francisco foodies who swear by, make a Sunday morning pilgrimage to the mecca that is Tartine, and absolutely adore Tartine. Well f*** it! I really, really wanted to love Tartine, but it's always let me down. I'm only giving them two stars and not one because I once had a delicate and orgasmic chocolate tart from them. Their croissants are burned pieces of bisquick. The outer crust is all wrong, burned black and not flaky at all. You have to dig deep through that crust to get to the meat of the pastry, and then it's too buttery and greasy. After getting fat on butter in Paris I crave light and flakey, not black and greasy. I tried to give Tartine a second chance and wanted to get lunch there because I was in the hood, hoping to have a little pic-a-nic at Dolores park. After agonizing in the long line, then dealing with the dismissive 'tude of the urban hipster staff, paying 15 bucks and waiting a painful 15 minutes for my croq monsieur I left to the park to eat. What a freakin cheesy, greasy mess. Way too much cheese, the soaked-in-grease paper bag should have been my clue to my imminent grease soaked bread and ultimate indigestion. Anyhow, try the little chocolate tarts, they're heaven.

Tartine is like Mecca in San Francisco for lovers of pastry. ÊWhat did I love here? ÊThe ham and cheese croissant, so flaky and buttery, no skimping on ham and cheese, and almost as big as my head! ÊI regretted seeing all those lovely bits of pastry fall away as I bit into it. ÊSigh... ÊAnd yes--the brioche bread pudding is more moist than most--but I loved it and much prefer this to the dense style. ÊThe contrast between the bright, perfectly sweetened berries and the creamy, soft, almost souffle-like bread pudding was outstanding and beautifully balanced.

I found heaven this past weekend at Tartine, a cute little neighborhood bakery and coffee shop in SF owned by a married baker couple (how romantic, I know). The shop is simple and small with a sort of French feel. There was also a really long line trailing out the door (reminded me of Golden Gate Bakery in SF Chinatown), so we had to wait a good half hour before ordering our food. But it was definitely well worth the wait! According to their website, the French word "tartine" refers to a piece of bread, any size or style, with something spread on it. Thus I was expecting some excellent baked goodies and desserts...and luckily, everything was orgasmically good. There were so many cakes and pastries and desserts that we had some trouble choosing our orders. And everything looked so pretty in the display case! After much debate, I decided on a lemon cream tart - a sweet pastry shell filled with rich lemon cream and topped with unsweetened cream ($5.50 for 4"). The lemon filling was nice and tart, but not too sour. And the cream was so smooth! I also liked how they put tiny pink flower petals on top of the cream. Points for presentation! Tartine is pretty famous for its bread pudding ($2.75/cup, $4.50/bowl). To be honest, this was the first time I had any kind of bread pudding, but it tasted great. A very generous bowl of homemade brioche, caramel, and fresh strawberries. But my favorite by far was the banana cream tart ($5.50 for 4") - a flaky pastry coated in dark chocolate and caramel and filled with pastry cream and bananas, topped with lightly sweetened cream, shaved chocolate, and powdered sugar. An absolutely perfect combination of textures, and the bananas and pastry offset some of the sweetness from the chocolate and cream. Mmmm. Of course, Tartine also has other great items besides pastries and desserts. All the sandwiches we tried were excellent. I ordered the croque monsieur (I was feeling very French that day) - an open faced sandwich with Tartine's great bread, topped with bechamel (some creamy white sauce), gruyere (a type of cheese), thyme, and pepper. I had mine with extra Cowgirl Creamery fromage blanc, but you can also get it with Niman Ranch ham or shiitake mushrooms on top. The resulting sandwich is very rich and filling, sort of pizza-like but with more bread. And finally, you can't really go to a coffee shop and not try the coffee. My latte was pretty good, although it could've been creamier. I liked how they served it in a small bowl, though. Very cute. Anyway, Tartine is definitely worth the drive and the wait if you're in the SF area! Freshly baked goods, gorgeous cakes and pastries, and fast, friendly service. Plus they use a lot of organic products in their baking. I want to try their croissants and pain au chocolat next time! (See accompanying photos!)

Pop Quiz. What's more annoying: 1. slightly overdone pastries 2. hopeless waitstaff 3. rude, NIMBY yuppies trying to take it over? if you answered 3, you are correct! (you'd get a free pastry, but the yuppies ate'em all). otherwise, it's nearly perfect.

05-20-08 UPDATE: went back to see if anything has improved and unfortunately, no update. Still the same hipster-girl staff that blankly stare at you with no emotion behind their eyes and think if they add a monotone "please" to our miserable interaction that they're doing a good job. ============== 11-12-07 ORIGINAL POST: Yeah, the food is good, but this is one local establishment NOT to support -- they value your money more than they value their customers as evidenced by their continuing apathetic, smart-ass, hipster wait staff and lack of operational efficiency. And I LIVE in the Mission. Too bad, since I live in the neighborhood and may be taken for a smart-ass, hipster myself, but when I'M PAYING $20 for pastry and tea for breakfast, I would not like a heaping helping dose of apathetic art- school eye rolling and grunting customer service. I really do want to support local biz, but their customer service is a buzzkill and I will NEVER go back, having given them so many chances since they opened. ÊIf you're reading this, then you're a foodie too, and you know that there are too many good alternatives in SF to support businesses that berate the customers who are PAYING for their food. Read on. Here's a typical visit: Queue up in the food line that's almost always 20+ people deep. Ponder why you would wait for 20 minutes in a food line outside of a communist country. As the line moves past the front door, wait in front of the dessert case. Listen patiently to the staff talk about their weekend, who's sexy, or who sucks. They will eventually, when they are ready, turn to you very nicely and ask what you would like. Cuz ya know, if they ask nice, who cares if they ignore you. If it's in the morning, be asked what you want before you can even see the selection since it's in the next case over closest to the register. Dumb. And you know, ham and cheese croissants aren't ready until 9am, and blah blah. Place your drink order. Oh wait, you CAN'T order your drink while you are in line. You have to order it at the register -- and THEN wait another 10+ minutes for your drink to be ready on the barista's glacial pace. It's so nice to score a table, get my food, eat, and THEN have my coffee or tea ready. Finally, get to the register. Do as they say and don't ask any questions -- or incur the wrath of hipster drones who have grown up at everyone's -a-winner soccer tourney's and believe that somehow they are special award winners entitled to everything their way as adults too. Newsflash, I am paying YOUR salary through my patronage. You may have gotten a million trophies cuz no one's a loser when you were a kid, but grow up. Try to find a seat. Decide to squeeze into the communal table, the tables near the cases, or the tables near the coffee bar. Each location affords a lovely opportunity to kick someone in the nuts with your head as they wait in line or worse, snake their way past you with their hot coffee en route to the cream and sugar at the OPPOSITE end of the store. Wait for your coffee or tea. And wait. And wait. Decide to finish eating your food instead, as the barista has decided to chat with the other customers and waitstaff anyway. To top it off, bus your own table. Give me a break. For what I am paying, and the amount of staff there, I expect THEM to bus my table. Hell, the taqueria buses my table. The food court at the Westfield Bloomingdale's mall buses my table. My advice, no croissant is worth the bad service and hassle. Go across the street to Craig's Place for a hearty breakfast. Or one of the myriad of places between Dolores and Valencia on 18th instead, but steer clear of Tartine Bakery.

(aka cinnamon rolls on crack?) orgasmic buns.. the first layer is crispy crunchy, dusted with sugar followed by flaky goodness hints of orange and cinnamon with ooey-gooey caramelly sweet stuff and soon enough, you get to the very middle the very best part don't get me wrong, everything else that preceded this was good, great, delicious even but this is the good stuff that makes the next level that much more intense the very best part the part that makes u climax and its not so crispy but pillowy .. and fluffy .. and buttery.. and then!!!... before you know it, you've gobbled the whole thing in a hurry leaving you a little sad you wish you were able to hold out a little longer to prolong that wonderful feeling bittersweet pleasure I'm waiting until the next time, I got me some crack shakes!! -1 star for: *being pricey *me being short and not being able to see everything behind the glass with all the other ppl in line until im right in front *the way the line wraps directly in front of the glass so I can't see *making me wait I guess if you don't want to wait and want a line out your front door, make me some!!! http://www.7x7.com/eat-dÉ

1200+ Reviews for Tartine Bakery?!? My fat son took me and the family to Tartine. He knows his food, hence why he is fat. I really liked their Mexican Wedding Cookies (known to me as Russian Tea Cakes) and Lemon Bar. ÊThe Opera Cake was good too with Êhazelnut butter cream and dark chocolate. ÊWe also tried their Bread Pudding and Black Forest Cake, which I thought were okay.

I really wanted to like this place as everyone else does, but frankly I wasnt that impressed. Although the lemon meringue cake had interesting flavors, the cake itself was really dry. I guess I should go back and try something else, but as a bakery having a top notch reputation- I wouldnt have expected to be so dissatisfied. Another thing- why the heck is service so crappy here?

I would consider moving to San Francisco if I could eat Tartine's croissants at least once a week. I hadn't been in at least a year and it was just as good as I remembered when I visited over the holidays. I'm in love with both the plain croissant and the pain au chocolat - they are so incredibly indulgent and large. I'm also a major fan of the gingerbread. So so good. It's like a crossbreed between a cake and a cookie. It breaks off easily and you can snack on it all day long. Not so much a fan of the 20 minute wait to get my hands on any of Tartine's delicious pastries but to me, it's totally worth it. I wish there was a bit more seating... It seems like once people stake their claim on a seat they don't seem to really care that there are other people waiting to sit down. Oh well. Walking around and eating your croissant, thereby getting crumbs all over your clothes is just as fun...

Four stars for the food. One star for the staff. Morning bun and frangipane croissant were good. Ham and sun-dried tomato quiche was different from other ones I've tried- the filling was light and velvety, though the crust was just okay. Attitude must be a requirement to work here. My bf and I got to the bakery 10 minutes before opening time, and there was already a line forming. One of the workers asked everyone to move against the wall, only to bark (seconds later) at the lovely couple in front of us to move out of the way because they were shifting chairs around... "obviously." It didn't stop there. I saw eyes being rolled and more snooty remarks directed at other customers.

I saw this bakery listed with so many thousands of Yelp reviews, so I was immediately intrigued. Since we were already waiting so long to dine at Delfina, we picked up a few things here for future consumption. The smell was intoxicating from the box, but we had to wait until we drove back to the East Bay to start eating the pastries. Honestly, I didn't try much to make a valid judgment on the entire bakery as a whole. I'm not much of a baked goods kind of dude anyway. I'll wait in lines for pizza, but for pastries? Not so much. So when I tried the coconut tart, it was pretty darn tasty. The lemon bar was pretty good too. Heavy, but good. I was amazed at how massive these things were. At over $6 each, I suppose they better be massive. It was definitely enough to share with at least a couple people. If I were to finish off one for breakfast on an empty stomach, I'm not so sure how I would feel. All in all, a good tart for sure, and I wouldn't mind trying out some other stuff.

One phrase: Banana cream tart! It's delicious! Love the crust, it's addicting fantastic goodness for the soul! This place is packed! It doesn't tell you on the outside of the building that it's tartine until you walk up to the door, it's just a black painted building with a line out the door. I have to say go early if you want some chocolate croissant or banana cream tart, they sell fast! The people are nice and very helpful if you don't know what to order. I didn't get a chance to try the quiche or the sandwiches. I would definitely recommend this place who love desserts and pastries!

Apparently the trick to avoiding the mile-long lines at Tartine is to go in the middle of the afternoon on a weekday, as I did - no line at all for me! ÊLooking at all the scrumptious baked goods in their display case, the lemon bar caught my eye. ÊGood thing I gave into my urge for the lemon bar- it was damned delicious and made for an excellent dessert when I got back home. ÊIt was not overly tart, not overly sweet, but a perfect balance between the two. ÊThe smooth texture of the lemon filling combined with the lovely crust - aahhh, it was just the best. I also got a slice of the cake aux olives, which was like a savory bread pudding shaped into a loaf. ÊIt had bread, gruyere cheese, smoked ham, white wine, and black olives - pretty much all my favorites. ÊUnfortunately, it wasn't quite as good as I imagined it would be. ÊThe crust was a little too thick and slightly burned, while the loaf itself wasn't as savory as I would have thought it would be- I think a little extra herbs or salt would have done the trick. ÊStill, it made for a good snack. Ê There were many other things in the display case that made me want to indulge- double pain au chocolat, Êmorning buns, frangipane croissants, Scharffenberger chocolate brownies, ÊPaasion Fruit Lime Bavarian slices....the list goes on and on. ÊI could have just sit there and eaten one of everything. ÊAll in all, a great bakery- I'm gonna be back for more!

"In that moment all the flowers in our garden...and the whole of Combray...,sprang into being, towns and gardens alike, from my cup of tea" Marcel Proust, In search of lost time. Proust's novel begins when the protagonist dips his Madeline in a cup of tea which suddenly restores his past and opens an unexplored region of experience through the interplay of sense and memory. I am walking past Guerrerro street on a cold winter morning couple of years ago when my attention is drawn by the huge lines sprouting from the corner of 18 th street. As I come nearer, ÊI am overwhelmed with a delicious smell of wholesome pastries. I stand in line and when my turn comes, I order a Morning Bun(laced with orange sugar), a chocolate pudding and a coffee. The place is totally packed and this is one Cafe in SF, where you see lot of babies with moms in tow. I dip my Morning Bun in my coffee and suddenly, like Proust's protagonist, I start thinking of my childhood and the happiness I felt as a pampered baby. I feel sucked in a vortex of love and warmth and bask in the glow of childhood innocence. Ever since then, I have returned again and again, to Tartine. All the items(excepting the yogurt parfait) is extremely good and their quality is consistent. They never try to outgrow their local roots. So if you are looking for a "feel good experience" which will temporarily transport you back in time to the magical kingdom of childhood, Tartine is your place to go in SF.

PORTION CONTROL: a weight-loss approach that works by specifying the amount, or portion size, of foods eaten in a day with the goal of eating a specific number of calories. (from the Weight Watchers site: http://www.weightwatcherÉ) Yeah, so, Tartine doesn't exactly have it. Portion control, I mean. I made myself sick, SICK, I tell you, last night from polishing off a "small" banana cream pie. It looks (at least to my super-sized, pump up the calories, breastfeeding eyes) deceptively like a single serving, but is SO rich that it clearly should be for 4 servings. I was in here the other day and bought the following, in honor of hubbie's b-day: 1) "small" chocolate hazelnut tart 2) "small" banana cream pie 3) ham & gruyere croissant thing for him 4) buttermilk scone thing for me The "small" pie type things (tart & pie) really did look like single servings when they were in the display next to the larger $27 versions of themselves. Hence my confusion in ordering two desserts for his b-day. Next year, it's one small thing, and that's it. I was shocked, SHOCKED, I tell you, to walk out of there paying only $17.50. What is WRONG with these people? They're giving away gold here, pure gold, I tell you. I'd heard so much about Tartine, I assumed it would have cost an arm, a leg and some back fat just to get a single desserty thing, but these prices are unbelievably pedestrian considering the quality of the food. If you're on a diet, do yourself a favor and just keep walking by.

Tartine reminds me that a decent cappucino is hard to come by. The coffee they make here trumps the rest, by far. And if you get nothing else, for the love of God, people, DON'T PASS UP THE BREAD PUDDING! This bread pudding is SO good, it could beat Gavin Newsom in an election. It's campaign ads would go something like this: "Bread Pudding: Doesn't have sex with best friend's wife...Has never been accused of cocaine abuse...Is the most delicious bread pudding you'll ever put in your mouth/smear all over your face...Vote Bread Pudding for mayor of San Francisco."

First off - the baked goods get 4 stars. I want to try everything. My first trip here was great. We came late in the afternoon, the place was pretty empty, and we shared some bread pudding. Dee-licious and pleasant. The second trip was not as wonderful. We came around lunchtime on a Sunday. Big mistake. You'd think the service and food would be better during peak operating hours, with high turnover rates of food, but that is not so. They're too busy to mind the details, and they get sloppy when the place is crowded. Plus, there is nowhere to sit, so you figure you'll just get the food to go. The to-go boxes are all the same size, at least in my experience that day. It doesn't matter whether you order a cup or a bowl of the bread pudding, they still put the same amount in the little box. You would get much more bread pudding if you just ordered the bowl and stood there to eat it. To make matters a tad more annoying, the girl who put the bread pudding in the box gave scraps and slop and remnants of the pudding, instead of breaking off an actual piece of the bread pudding. That is R-i-d-i-c-u-l-o-u-s. We don't stand in line and pay $5 for left-over slop. It just didn't taste good at all, and it felt like such a waste of money. On the up side, the chocolate croissant was tasty - flaky and sweet. I just hope the bread pudding debacle doesn't happen again. My friend was pissed. A bakery of this caliber should not be selling mediocre servings of their food. I will be back.

"So where is this Tartine?" ÊJust look for a place with a line out the door like mad. Came on a late Saturday afternoon after a day at Dolores, and by then a lot of baked goods were sold out already. ÊAll croissants gone, morning bun gone, and pudding gone. ÊThose just happens to be my favorites. Decided to grab a lemon pound cake and a huge chocolate walnut cookie with a cup of latte. ÊThe lemon pound cake was amazing, especially the crust. ÊReally refreshing lemon flavors and makes me forget I'm actually eating a really buttery piece of pound cake. ÊThe cookie was awesome as well with bits of walnuts throughout the whole cookie. ÊJust adding the walnuts makes a chocolate chip cookie taste that much better. Also got to try their open face sandwich. ÊPerfect size for a fulfilling lunch. ÊThat artisan bread holds all the ingredients up really well so. ÊCheese, tomato, ham are the main stars on the particular sandwich that I had. For the drinks, there's a separate counter and you can order there as well rather than waiting at the long line if you are only getting drinks. Having all their stuff gone already, I'm determined to get all that I missed the next time around!

For a place with little or no signage, it sure gets a lot of traffic. I suppose it's a prime example of the power of 'word-of-mouth.' Tartine is guaranteed to please with freshly baked goods and freshly squeezed oranges. Mid-morning is best in order to avoid the breakfast and lunch rushes, and tables are EXTREMELY limited, so grab it to-go. After my croissant, I told my dining partner I couldn't bother to try the bread pudding. But, I was wrong. I could bother. I did. And then I felt bothered when I had to continue sharing it with my friend. Next time, I'll get my own bread pudding.

I visited last evening and there was no line. I got a slice of cake to go, since we were eating dinner elsewhere but I never get a shot at Tartine when it isn't busy. When I got to the register, I saw a total of $5.50. I handed dude $6 and stood there for at least a minute, expecting him to hand back change. He was gabbing to someone else behind the counter the whole time, making absolutely no eye contact with me, closed the register and just walked off. My friend couldn't even get his attention for a napkin. Now, I would have just thrown the .50 in the jar, but it's the principle. Isn't this a huge faux pas? Never withhold change. I thought: Is this a douchey, snotty cafe, thing? Is it an 'I'm tired and distracted, I've been here for 6 hours after 2 classes and have to ride home 20 blocks and I'm still hungover from the knockout last night and couldn't care less about you people right now,' thing? Could the tax have not rung up on the register but yet had not been included in the cake price? In that case, I'm the dumb shit, but I couldn't even check because I don't recall him actually telling me the total, and no, I wasn't given a receipt, either. As for the cake, it was okay. I got the lemon cream layer cake with coconut on top. The cake was moist and tender and the cream was fresh. The lemon was a bit much on the puckery end, and not flavorful or satisfying enough on the lemony end.

I just can't stand the staff here, after working in the food industry for years I guess I never bought into rude = cool, inefficient = cool, indifferent = cool. While their pastries are tasty and an excellent treat (especially the morning buns) I just can't spend my money in a place that seems to have a goal of creating a line. I have never even had the guts to venture in there on the weekend but on the weekdays it would be so easy to get folks their stuff and get them on their way. but alas, this is not the tartine way.... a line must be created....boooo.

Are you familiar with the Food Network show - Best Thing I Ever Ate? If I had to profess my love for one food to the rest of the world on national television, it would be the Banana Cream Tart from Tartine! An untouched tart has large delicate chocolate shavings layered on top of a fluffy mountain of quality whipped cream that hides the banana slices. All seems average so far.. but when you take a whole bite from crust to the shavings - you'll find a slight layer of caramel that blows everything else out of the water. Amazing!! I'm grateful the full sized Banana Cream Pie is a bit pricey because if it weren't I would be indulging in the wonderfulness every day.

PROS: ÊVery tasty baked goods, delectable sandwiches, to-die-for mochas, beautiful interior with fun ambiance, clean bathroom, great location. CONS: ÊLong lines, long waits, expensive for a neighborhood bakery/cafe, and sometimes once you've finally gotten through the line, you find there's no place available to sit and eat what you've just paid for.

Maybe my expectations for dessert places in SF are way too high, or maybe I shouldn't stuff my face with Mexican food from the Mission before I waddle over here, or maybe it's the five cavity fillings that prevent me from sinking my teeth into anything I want, but I expected deliciousness to the umpteenth degree at Tartine. After finding out this place was nominated for a few James Beard awards, I was really excited to see what this placed had to offer. It's definitely much smaller than Citizen Cake and is more of a Sunday brunch, coffee place than it is for specializing only in pastries; however, I did enjoy what they had to offer. I had the coconut cream tart, but I also got to try everything else from other people: the banana cream tart, lemon cream tart, lemon bar, brownie, and that fruit medley tart. They were pretty good, but was still missing that 'wow, this is the best pastry/dessert I've ever had' factor. Although I did appreciate their high standards for their pastries. I also got to try their shortcake; they ended up giving one piece for free to my friend who bought it because it didn't have enough powdered sugar on one side. Wow. That's my kind of bakery! But I was so stuffed from lunch, that I couldn't really enjoy my tart because by the end, I was so stuffed, I could barely finish the last bite. But I could probably say that it was the best coconut cream tart that I've ever had: crunchy crust with a layer of chocolate and also a surprise caramel filling inside. Edit: Oh I guess I also didn't try the best thing that they have here - the bread pudding. Stupid me; I guess that -1 star is for my stupidity and that I owe this place another chance to try their famous bread pudding.

Yah! ÊI'm a fan. ÊEthereal croissants--- they are expensive but worth every cent. ÊI have not had anything at Tartine that was just okay--every morsel here has been flawless. ÊI love all the cookies--a lesser guilty option than everything else. ÊThe chocolafied items are expensive in fact everything here is expensive. ÊBut the quality and first bite remind you how it was worth it. I am still amazed when I go to Tartine -- even when it is slow it is slow--I was in line late yesterday--- only one person in front of me-- took me 10 minutes to get my croissant and pay. ÊThe person in front of me was making or trying to make an art form of her order-- I thought she was ordering up a couple of Faberg eggs, a Harry Winston diamond ring and a few Tiffany bangles instead she was ordering cookies. ÊIt was a painfully long wait; I wish I could have helped myself. ÊThe counter guy didn't help in fact was a contributor to this jewel-like selecting process for baked goods. I have tried going at all hours--first opening, a few minutes before closing, mid-afternoon. ÊThere is no good time to go. ÊI end up going just a few times a year even though I live nearby. ÊLove Tartine but only rarely.

I"m sick and tired of how Tartine constantly overbakes/browns/burns their pastries and I'm registering my protest by downgrading them a star.

What can I say that hasn't already been said about Tartine in the previous 1000+ reviews? Ê Brioche bread pudding was tasty, but I recommend the small bowl for two people or less. ÊWe got the large and felt rather ill afterwards. Ê The Ham and Cheese quiche was definitely made with heavy cream. ÊThe crust was a little over cooked, but that was okay for a salty pie thing. But the morning buns. ÊOh yes. ÊWe just happened to be in line at the time when the buns came RIGHT OUT OF THE OVEN. ÊIt was all fluffy, sticky, chewy, and crunchy all in the right places. ÊFor the morning bun alone does Tartine get 5 stars. Ê Their lattes weren't bad either. Ê The line was atrocious. ÊYou feel like a jerk and a half for hovering over people and anxiously asking them when they're leaving and if you can have their seats. ÊIt's not a very pleasant dining experience, but it might be worth it to get it to go and sit in the nearby Dolores Park on a sunny day!

This place stands for everything I support ... from organic to free range and local to cage free, they made my experience a pleasant one before I even walked in the door. We were lucky enough to find parking right away and when we walked in there were only about 4 people in front of us -- total score! Êbecause when we left the line was out the door! ÊIt only took about 5 minutes or so for the woman to get to us, and we ordered four different pastries: a regular croissant, a chocolate croissant, a fruit tart, and a morning bun. ÊMy boyfriend and I split everything so that we could get a taste of a good amount they had to offer. ÊOn top of the pastries we ordered their house coffee and a latte. Our total came to about $30 including tip, which yes ... would be considered pretty expensive with pastries, but you have to realize what you are really supporting when you purchase anything. ÊYou really do get your money's worth here, it isn't just a name or a brand you are paying for -- which made every penny worth it. The croissants were what we dug into first while I was waiting on my latte. ÊNext the morning bun, and we saved the fruit tart for later. ÊEverything was absolutely amazing, crisp where it needed to be and moist where it was supposed to be. ÊI later received my latte and I didn't get a cute decoration like I wanted, but it tasted great. ÊOut of all the things we ordered I must say that my favorite was their original croissants, which is weird because I really don't like croissants ... but here -- I love croissants. Two days later we tried the fruit tart and it was absolutely amazing. ÊI can only imagine how it would've tasted if we tried it that day. ÊIt was gone in minutes ... There are SO many more things to try at this bakery and am SO glad that it's actually pretty close to my boyfriend's house, about a 5 minute drive to be precise, and because of that I will look forward to my routine visits into town.

OMG. Yes! Drool... Another WIN from my fellow Yelpers. I totally trusted you guys and you did not fail me. So I was at home watching Cake Boss and Buddy got me hungry for pastries. I wanted something GOOD, like reeeally good. So I went on Yelp and found this place. I was further intrigued by the fact that it's 1/2 a block from where I grew up. I remember the area being completely shady back in the 80s, but MY how that's changed! It's totally posh now. The type of area where they have sidewalk cafes with chic SF-ers sipping on red wine. I wish I still lived there. I'd be so much cooler. But on to the important part - the yummies. O-M-G...the Passionfruit Lime Bavarian (topped with coconut) cake was something soo delish it can only be adequately expressed through a happy dance. I had to snag an Eclair, too, and a lemon creme tart. They were all little bundles of flaky heaven. I was super bummed they were out of Tres Leches, but it also gives me an excuse to go back. Yee! For all of you reading this - this place is a must try. In case you haven't figured that out already ;)

ÊI found it really surprising because we had just been remarking how nice everyone is in SF restaurants as compared to NY, BUT Tartine made me feel like I was right back at home. So thanks for ALMOST ruining my perfect quiche and chocolate croissant, bitchy lady! ÊThe quiche-- fresh vegetables suspended in fluffy egg. ÊThe croissant-- moist, thick layers of flaky pastry surrounding an enormous, melty chunk of rich chocolate. I prefer more down to earth places, though.

Just GO! & you'll know! Nothing to lose rite? Pain au chocolat, yum! Banana cream tart, yum yum! Croque Monsieur, yum yum yum! Almond croissant, well u get it rite :) Go with a friend or 2 cuz the only dilemma you'll have is what to order. I have a family of four & we ordered different things so we could taste them all! Can't wait for our next visit to SF. Good thing we r only an hour away!!! Warning!!! Be prepared to wait in line. We were there 1/4 to 9 on a Sunday morning (they open @ 9) & there was a nice long line waiting for us but it moves fast:)

Not for the carbo-phobes! ÊThis place is carbohydrate heaven. ÊBreads, pastries, cookies, etc. etc. etc. ÊThey have it all at this place and EVERYTHING looks really good. Ê I did not feel like spending my life savings on eggs, flour and water, so I opted for one sweet and one savory, a slice of the ham quiche and a chocolate croissant. ÊBoth were crispy, light, and excellent. ÊI also got to taste the croque monsieur and morning bun. ÊBoth of those are definitely on my ordering list for the next visit, along with the lemon cream pie and the giant chocolate chip cookie. Ê The place is definitely a little on the pricey side, but everything I tasted was amazing. ÊI guess you cant put a price on amazing right? Ê Parking is ridiculous, especially on the weekends. ÊDelfina and Bi-Rite are right around the corner and are just as popular as this place, so there is definitely some competition for the limited street parking. ÊBring a friend, drop them off to wait in line with your order, find parking and meet them inside.

Yeah, this shit is good but is the 'tude really necessary? I thought the cashier was going to spit in my face because I didn't leave a tip for my frangipane tart to go. I have to admit that I do appreciate the irony of seeing a queue full of yuppies like some bizzaro world cold war era bread line.

What an absolutely great bakery! ÊI had heard a lot of great stuff about this spot so I made sure to stop in on my last trip to SF. ÊMy girlfriend and I rolled up around 9:30am for breakfast and the line was wrapped around one side of the building! ÊI told her we should just forget it and go somewhere else, but she insisted that we try it since we were there anyway. ÊI'm so glad we did because we had the most delicious meal : ) We shared a piece of the Ham Quiche, the Smoked Ham Croque Monsieur, and took a Gougere to-go. ÊEverything was delicious, even my Cappuccino. ÊI really wanted to try their famous Bread Pudding but we were just too stuffed to have anything else. ÊI'm a huge fan of Quiche and I have to be honest, theirs was just okay. ÊEverything else was outstanding though. ÊDefinitely give the Croque Monsieur a try... next time I plan to have the Cowgirl Fromage Fort one! Four stars until I have the chance to sample more of their menu : ) ------ UPDATE: The Ham & Cheese Croissant and the Cake aux Olives are DELICIOUS! ÊI think the Bread Pudding was just so-so though. ÊNothing to write home about. ÊAnd I'm a big fan of Bread Pudding.

Tartine is simply delicious and unique. ÊI admire the simplicity of their system... You line up to order- Êwhile you get a glance of all the yummy goodies people carry out before you, you salivate even more because the register where you order is all the way to the end of all the yummy pastries in their glass shelves. By the time you get to the front, your order meets you at the register, pay and EAT! Ê Everything they serve looks so mouth watering and the entire bakery smells like heaven. ÊI had a vegetable focaccia topped w/ asparagus and mushrooms- Êif it had not been for the big serving, I would have definitely ordered something else. Ê The people are so laid back and friendly that despite being so busy, people did not seem to mind the long line and the elbow to elbow seating. I will definitely visit Tartine again!

Today was a big day for me. ÊI drove in the city... all the way from the Richmond to the Mission. ÊI know it seems silly, but this is big for me, I never drive... not that I can't, I just don't like to, it makes me nervous. ÊBut the idea of delicious Tartine baked goods was too much for me to resist... This was my first time at Tartine. ÊThe line was long but the 15 minute wait was well worth it. ÊKeep in mind that you will be overwhelmed. ÊEverything looks and smells soo good. ÊYou might be tempted to buy Everything, but start slow. ÊI ended up getting a humungous Almond Croissant for now and a big Morning Bun for later. Ê Armed with croissants and cafe au laits, my friend and I walked over to Dolores Park and enjoyed our baked goods in the sunshine (I definitely recommend doing this). ÊMy Almond Croissant was flakey, buttery and delicious as was my friends Chocolate Croissant. Ê I am already planning my next trip. ÊI think I will try the Gougere with gruyere cheese...and maybe another croissant....

Tartine falls into the category of "out of my league," which means the line is generally too long for me to wait. ÊNot that I have anything better to do, mind you, I just really hate standing in winding parallel configurations of humans. But one Monday afternoon, I found that there was a short enough line to step up my game and approach the "out of my league" restaurant. ÊThere was so much build-up, I was almost scared to try it. ÊWhat if I was disappointed? What if all those days of dreaming were for naught? The little chocolate temptress behind the glass was giving me the eye. ÊThe open-faced sandwich thingies were begging for my carress. ÊScores of scones were aching for me to nibble their tips. ÊBut I ended up settling with the bread pudding, which was like a pleasant blind date with a snack you would never, ever have sex with. I promise promise promise that I will visit agian, if only to update this review for all you hungry fans out there. ;)

The staff are incredibly helpful and friendly despite having to deal with some of the most banal specimens of humanity I've ever encountered. (And oh, can those staff members keep a good poker face!) Ê To be fair, it's possible that my hangover from a visit to Smuggler's Cove the night before had a part in my ardent loathing of Tartine patrons. ÊMaybe I just picked the worst day ever to stand in line, but I swear my IQ went down 15 points and I got 10x more superficial just standing there, lacking a mute button to use on the wanna-be hipsters in front of me. ÊBut don't say I didn't warn you about the excruciating pain of the line. ÊIf you ever feel inclined to write a piece of nonfiction inspired by Sartre's "No Exit" I suggest you set it here - hell is other people, the people surrounding you at Tartine. They were out of the chocolate croissant I wanted, but this gave me an excuse to eat a banana cream pie that was out of this world. ÊOh, shaved chocolate, oh scrumptious cream, oh 1500 calories of flaky crust and real banana chunks - I would eat you all over again! ÊAdd to this that they have baristas who will happily and quickly whip up a latte that actually tastes good, and you have a happy Emily - or you will, once I've finally managed to extricate myself from the sea of long-winded Tartine patrons.

While waiting in line I was able to see the kitchen and the wonders it dispensed. The wait is not unpleasant when you can see the light at the end of the tunnel. I bore witness to the Lemon Merangue cake. ÊI heard tales of its wonders as I reveled in the Frangipane tart. There is very little seating within so it is worth it to send a delegate from your party squat for a place to sit. ÊThere is also a counter at which you may stand & dine. If you are lucky enough to find a place to sit please do remember it is your responsibility to bus it. No, you won't be wiping the tables or placing your wares into a neon plastic dumpster a 'la McD's but you will bring them to a rear counter. Upon my trek I noticed the wine selection. I was not surprised. Just think, breakfast, lunch and desert items. What better to round out their offerings than a wine selection?

Tartine Bakery is brought to you by Liz and Chad Robertson, a husband-and-wife team that named the bakery after the French term for a piece of bread on which something is spread. ÊIt sounds so much better in French. ÊTartine Bakery is one of those places that is perpetually busy. ÊThere never seems to be a good time to go. ÊI even went on a Tuesday for lunch and had to wait in a long ass line to order. ÊDon't people work in this city??? Food: Ê4 stars. ÊThe croque monsieur with ham is delicious and a must try for a first-time visit. ÊI also had a couple of bites of the lemon almond poundcake and bread pudding and was mesmerized by the awesome, sweet flavors. ÊThe only disappointment was the chocolate hazelnut tart, which I only got because they didn't have the lemon cream tart available. ÊWhat I also found annoying was the fact that the website indicates you can purchase the passion fruit bavarian cake by the slice, but it was only available as a whole cake when I went. Ê Service: Ê3 stars. Ê This is one of those places where you don't expect anything in terms of service, but they did an admirable job. ÊThe cashier was super friendly and helpful. Ê Atmosphere: Ê2 stars. ÊThis is not a fun place to visit on a hot day. ÊThe lines are generally long and you need to be patient and lucky to get a table (I am neither). ÊThey really need to expand the bakery to a bigger space to accommodate all the demand. ÊAlso, the crowd generally leans toward the ugly side. Ê Hits: Ê Croque monsieur, almond pound cake, bread pudding. Misses: ÊLack of space, long lines to order, some items are not available by the slice or at all. If You Like This Place, You'd Probably Like: ÊCitizen Cake, Noe Valley Bakery & Bread Co.

IM HERE.. IM GETTING A BAKE GOOD!.. Hhhahah.. so i stood in line, trying to figure out what I can get before dinner that wont make me too full, I got a brownie. Êit cost $3.25. Êi thought it was a tad pricey. ÊBut as i found out later.. it was worth it. I split it with my friends. Êman... thats a rich brownie. Êand its bittersweet chocolate, so its not too sweet.

Hot diggety, over 1800 reviews! I came here upon a weekend adventure up the bay area. Through friends, I quickly found out that this place was given high marks for a number its dishes and its listing by the San Franciscan 7 by 7 Magazine/Blog. This magazine recalled Tartine to be one of the 100 places to try before you die. So in that light, I had to try this place. It is a small corner shop with not too many seats and an occasional standing line. It was very clean, and dimly lit around sunset, so it provided for a very trendy audience. Parking may be a bit hard around this place, so I recommend taking the bus here. Two words - sesame loaf. The sesame loaf my friends, is to die for. I rarely make these type of statements, but this beats any La Brea bakery bread, on any given day. As a to-go customer I tried the sesame with brie and it turned out to be extremely flavorful. The smell taste of the sesame bread is extremely powerful, and did not let the brie take over my taste buds. While the outer shell of this bread is very hard, I recommend having it warmed up slightly, because the texture of the bread was far more agreeable. I plan to come back here on many occasions, given that I still have carb cravings and wish to try out their fancy-looking desserts.

Crowded all the time and small so you have to fight to find a seat but OMG oh so worth it. I got the morning bun, lemon tart and eclair. WOW I am salavating just thinking about it again. ÊThe food was so good, rich and light at the same time. ÊPerfect and cannot be described only your taste buds can understand. So just eat it! My advice is to avoid the weekends because there is without fail a line wrapped around the block from Sat morning to Sun night. ÊI went on a Thurs and no line went straight in. But if you are only here for a weekend then get up early and go line up and try as much as you can. ÊIt is soooo worth it!!!

Nooooo, all of you who haven't been leaving the BEST RATING POSSIBLE -- its totally because you are not getting the right things!! For me personally, the best things I've had from Tartine are their frangipane croissants, the gougeres and the paninis. I've tried the bread pudding, a large assortment of cakes & tarts, quiches, cookies, etc. But really, what made me become a diehard Tartine fan was that goddamn frangipane croissant. I split one with my boyfriend & when he stepped away from it, I totally snuck a bite of his half and he got mad at me. That's how good this stuff is!!!!! & OMG, the gougere!! If you don't really have a sweet-tooth, get a gougere!!! It is heavenly and so moist and full of flavor. Everytime I come home to a gougere waiting on the counter for me, I die a little (mostly physically because of all the fat in the gougere, but also mentally because my boyfriend is so nice!). Yes, the staff is surly, but I've never been one to let some douche get in the way of me & my pastries. Tartine is the shit. & damn, I haven't even tried the morning buns yet.

Hey battuh battuh battuh. ÊSch-wing battuh battuh battuh. Now that I've gotten that out of my system, I'll proceed to write this review. Every morn, the bakers at the ever-popular Tartine whip up fresh, delicious, and calorically dense pastries, breads, sandwiches, and oatmeal (my personal fave) in addition to drinks such as Scharffenberger hot chocolate--basically, anything you could want from full-service bakery/cafe. The only drawback to this place is the fact that if you choose to make a trip on Saturday or Sunday morning, you'll be forced to queue up for at least 20 mins. ÊIf you're taking your food to go, it's not a huge ordeal, but if you plan on dining in, good luck because this is where your second dilemma begins--owing to the low diner turnover and number of tables. ÊIn my opinion, it's not worth it because the the experience is nothing special--there is no harpist to serenade your brunch, no tinkle of an indoor fountain, and no white-gloved server to lift the bell jar off your pastry. On second thought, maybe I expect too much from dining out in general.

If you're ever in line and don't know what to try, here's a list of what you should try if you haven't already: Frangipane Croissant: A must try if it's ever available when you're here. It usually sells out right after it's out of the oven, so get it whenever you can. By the way, don't be that guy that buys the whole rack and screws it up for everyone else in line behind you. Double Chocolate Tea Cake: It's like half brownie, half-spongecake. Or half sponge, half browniecake. Or half cake, half browniesponge. Either way, delicious! Lemon/Poppie Seed Tea Cake: Heavy like a pound cake, but moist. Not too lemony, and hints of almond paste. Surprisingly good, even if you don't normally eat tea/pound cakes. Almond Rochers: $0.75 each. Give one a shot. You're welcome in advance!

YUmmyyyyyyy =) Always satisfied when ordering from here, even if it's not something I've had before! I got the Mexican wedding cookies, the outer is like powdery but the inside is a shortbread type of cookie. Like it! I also got a Croque Monsieur (turkey one). It's like a french bread pizza but the toppings are like turkey and tomato and some spices (of course). I wanted to order some croissants and the banana cream pie (tart size) but they didn't have any, so that's on my list the next time I visit. The price is a little bit above what you would usually pay for in a bakery but it's well worth it. FYI : the line is usually out the door for this place, so be prepared to wait for your goodies =)

This place ALWAYS has a line and you ALWAYS have to fight for a table, but you know what? It's ALWAYS good! Perhaps a little overprice and overhyped, but it's still my go-to place for Sunday brunch with my friends. I'm particularly a huge fan of the quiches that they make and the fresh fruit tart. The other other day I tried the chocolate banana cream tart and could have died and gone to heaven. The staff could stand to be a little friendlier though. They all appear to hate life. And everyone in existence.

A year ago I would have given Tartine 5 stars - no question. ÊBut, I haven't been impressed these days. ÊDon't get me wrong, there are definitely some yummy things at Tartine - you just have to know which they are. ÊNot everything is as good as it looks. ÊMany items, like all of the cookies (except the Rochers) are dry. ÊGougeres are dry too. ÊThe pastry crust for all tarts are too thick and overwhelm the filling.

I'm no expert at making or eating pastry's but Tartine Bakery left me speechless. The banana cream tart was refreshing, creamy, and the crust was flaky topped with thin sliced chocolate rectangles with a little bit of powered sugar to top it off. It was hard to eat with a plastic fork they gave me but I couldn't wait to taste it so I just grab it and took a big bite into it. The first bite you can taste the sliced bananas, little hint of caramel on the bottom and of course the crust which had a buttery taste and flaky texture. I went on a weekday around 2pm so the line wasn't long at all but if there was a line I think it would be worth the wait. Everything is made fresh and the selections are top quality.

4 stars solely based on the Banana Cream Tart. I was really surprised to see that there was already a long line out the door on an early Sunday morning, day after Christmas. ÊI guess everyone had the same thought, since we are already gorging for the holidays, why not a little bit more? Ê The morning bun was crispy on the outside but really soft on the inside. ÊIt was buttery good but the main star of the event was definitely the banana cream tart. ÊA crust that is coated in dark chocolate is quite flaky once you are able to slice through it's hard outer shell. ÊThis tart is filled with fresh sliced bananas and lightly sweetened pastry cream. ÊTo top it off, there is a layer of caramel cream and shaved chocolate. ÊSo light, so fluffy, so creamy, and a perfectly balanced amount of sweetness. Ê All in all, It took us exactly 45 minutes from the moment we stood in line, ordered, paid, and got our tarts, morning buns, and caffeine to go. ÊIt is a bit of a hustle and bustle here at Tartine Bakery. ÊI'm not sold on the long line here just for some pastries. ÊThe tart was definitely good but not worth the wait. ÊIf for some miraculous reason I drove by and there was no wait, I would do a tuck and roll out of my car into Tartine's and get some!

We went late on Friday evening - and there was thankfully no line. I really enjoyed the seasonal tart with lots of berries and shaved almond flakes.. it was fresh and had a good mix of sweet and tangy. And you may think the tart looks like a nice small regular tart for 5 bucks.. but when you actually eat it, you'll find out it's a secretly HUGE tart. Like a fat girl who hides her love handles very well. Nice and filling! The opera cake and cookies weren't bad either. But I'd go back for the slim looking fat tart, anytime.

Uhhh, how come I never knew about Tartine's Croque Monsieur??? That thing is so delicious that if I didn't have a follow-up pastry waiting for me, I would've ordered another 5 more. Or 10. What're a Croque Monsieur? According to Tartine it's an.. Open face sandwich made with their country bread, bechamel, gruyere, thyme and pepper. Topped with either smoked Niman Ranch ham, Cowgirl Creamery fromage blanc, or shitake mushrooms and seasonal vegetables. *sigh* I need to get my hands on another one soon!

What is not to love about Tartine? Oh, I know what. ÊThe long line that snakes outside on a beautiful day in Mission-Dolores! Aside from that, I ADORE this establishment. From the homey goodness that is the bread pudding. ÊA generous heap of challah bread soaked in a slightly sweet eggy-custard and studded with seasonal fruit. To the beautifully flaky croissants in all their powdered sugar glory. To the decandent open-faced croque monsieur, a humble slice of bread topped with saucy bechamel, melty gruyere and a slab of niman ranch ham, with piquant marinated vegetables on the side. oh how i love you, coconut cream tart and banana cream tart. Êi dream of your fluffy pastry cream, calorie-laden goodness. Ê i gain pounds just thinking of you. and my newest love. Êmorning bun. Êflaky croissant layers bound together by a surprisingly good, orange glaze and bespeckled with cinnamon and granules of sugar. thank goodness you are located far from me. Êi would otherwise weigh a ton. Êbut i fantasize about you frequently.

As evidenced by the over 1000 yelp reviews, this place is popular. Don't let the line discourage you. Nor should you let the $12 sandwich steer you to a lower priced option. It'll be big enough to share. The slowness of the line appears to match the slowness of the patrons. If you wait in line, you will likely get a seat. I really wanted to love Tartine. It didn't turn out that way. The overly rich Spicy Turkey panini proved to be too much for my stomach. The bread must be buttered before they press it. There's no way the provolone could make it that greasy. The broccoli rabe pesto sounded intriguing, but was just OK. The much hyped spicy carrot pickle turned out to be limp. The side salad (extra $) had beautiful baby lettuce heads from Star Route farms (local !), but was overly dressed and almost inedible. Tartine gets stars because they are doing something special. The pastries look amazing.

This place is insane! ÊThere was a constant line out the door and plenty of people fighting for tables. ÊI finally got to go here on one of my days off and lucky for me, I found parking up the street about 1.5 blocks away! ÊThe line wasn't all the way down the block either, but at least to the perimeter of the store. I really like this place for it's vegetarian friendly options and pastries. ÊEverything looked delicious, especially the desserts. ÊHowever, I had to limit myself to what I was going to get because this bakery is not cheap! ÊA quiche is $4, sandwich ~$11-12, and desserts/pastries ~$4-7. ÊI got a tart, quiche, and pastrami sandwich, which totaled $23. YIKES. ÊIt was delicious though! Ê Recommend: -Frangipane Tart Ê Ê4"-$6.00 Ê Ê Ê-Light almond-cream filling baked in a flaky pastry shell with seasonal fruit. -- doesn't look as exciting as the opera cake, but it was sooooooooooooooo delicious!!! ÊI would definitely try this out! - Pastrami sandwich - watch out for the horseradish... will definitely clear your nasal passages! The sandwiches take about 20 min wait... so in the meantime we had the pastry and quiche... Needless to say, I was stuffed by the time i got my sandwich! ÊI would have liked to try other desserts, but the line was too long, and I would have gone broke. Now that i've seen the hype of this place, I probably would only come back here if I was in the area and wanted a dessert or morning bun (which I still hve to try)

Follow your nose to this excellent little corner bakery! FAVES: 1. MORNING BUN! ÊTopped with orange flavor, this was my favorite out of all the treats we tried. 2. Almond croissant - just the right ratio of flaky to gooey sweetness. 3. Cafe latte - it comes in a soup bowl. ÊNo joke! ÊThe caffeine helped me run around San Francisco all afternoon! 4. Croque monsieur - rich, but a slice of cheese and sundried tomato heaven. NOT TOO SHABBY: 1. Pumpkin bread - I thought it was really dense and I like mine more like banana bread instead of pound cake texture, but it was spiced well. 2. Bread pudding with fruit - Fruit on top was fantastic. ÊIt's more on the eggy/moist side, so if you like your bread putting soft, you'll love this. ÊI prefer more of the bready crustiness on top so it wasn't my favorite, but like the pumpkin bread, definitely more of a texture preference issue than taste. ÊI would still recommend trying it! GRIPES: 1. Be prepared to wait in line! ÊWe got there before the mad rush apparently, but we still waited 10 min or so to get to the counter. 2. Small space inside. ÊAs Laura B. says, you do feel bad vulturing over diners for a table, but there are really no other options if you want to get a place to sit. Ê 3. They ran out of morning buns when the first half of us got there, so it's all about timing or you may miss out! That being said though...worth the wait if you love sweet breakfast foods!

As it turns out, the line moved fast enough that we had just decided what to order by the time our group reached the register. ÊThe display of sweets was absolutely tantalizing. ÊIn the end we went with a banana cream tart, a lemon tart, a brioche bread pudding, and a croissant. Everything was great. ÊThe croissant was flaky and pulled apart in buttery layers. ÊThe outside was pretty and brown. ÊThe croissant was not at all sweet with almost a bitterness to it. ÊThis was not my preference, but the texture was spot on and I'll bet it would've been magical with some chocolate or almonds. ÊThe brioche bread pudding was very bready and moist without being soggy. ÊThere was a good amount of baked apple and the whole pudding was infused with the taste of vanilla. ÊNeither the croissant nor the bread pudding were the best I've ever had, but they were pretty delicious. The lemon and banana tarts, on the other hand, were the best of their kind I've had anywhere. ÊThe lemon was as screamingly tart as it could be without getting unpleasant, with a nice dollop of whipped cream on top to cut the sourness. ÊThe texture was creamy and custardy, just, mmm. ÊAnd the banana? ÊEven better. ÊThe tart was obscenely gooey with thin fast-melting ribbons of chocolate on top that imparted just a little bit of chocolatiness without overwhelming the other flavors. ÊThere, that's my attempt at describing it. ÊIt was inadequate, but I'm done. I gather that Tartine can be kind of a hassle, but it was easily worth ten times the distress. ÊThe line was minimal and though the spacing was tight, we were able to get seated after a short wait. ÊI can see how this place has managed to retain such a high rating with so many reviews. Ê ÊEverything was delicious and the tarts were just phenomenal. ÊIf I lived nearby I would be horribly fat.

Oh Tartine, why must you tempt me with your luscious tarts....your scrumptious crossiants....your delectable quiches....your heavenly pastries....your decadent cakes?! Thank goodness you're always so busy or I would be a fat little asian girl filled with the buttery goodness of Tartine. There's not much I can add to the 1000+ reviews of this place except to say that this is my favorite place for a quick breakfast. You should think of the long line as a benefit to you...because of that line, the pastries n such go so quickly that they are always making more. What does that mean? Well, that means you get a croissant that is STILL WARM when you get it...not because they heated it up or kept it warm for you...but it's THAT FRESH! So I'd recommend the croissants if you haven't guessed...they're some of the best I've ever had. I'd definitely give this place a try more than once. Experiment and try different things till you find something you love because there are so many options! They're open fairly late here, so you can attempt to come in, but don't expect any of the morning pastries to be available. I was utterly devastated the first time I came...because it was 6:00pm and me being a pastry-loving girl was faced with this horrible dilemma of having NO pastry options! NooOOooOoo! But, late in the day, they do have some cookies and tarts (My dilemma was solved by the hazelnut chocolate tart! and oh my taste buds...how they thanked me.) and cakes available. As Rachael Ray would say, YUM-O! Definitely give this place a try or two...or three...or every day. Mm wait, I take that back. The line is long enough as it is without YOU going :P

Standing in line outside was not so bad - par for the course for any unmarked small breakfast place within walking distance of Dolores Park. ÊBut once I got inside, I started to develop an eye twitch. ÊAnd maybe a bit of a nose twitch. Too many shiny glazed things to look at. Too many salivary gland exciting smells. Too much. ÊToo too much. Nothing lives up to this kind of hype. ÊThe croque monsieur was delicious with those shitake mushrooms and the three cheeses melting through the gaping crevices in the bread. ÊAnd yet...there was an emptiness to my fullness at the end, the tour de senses finally over, my meager stomach capacity incapable of trying everything and my patience unlikely to permit me to return. Ah well.

This bakery was featured on America's 10 best bakeries on Yahoo and I had no idea it was so close to home!! After going to two different ice cream shops (loved BiRite and Humphry!), my friends and I had to take a break from the sweets. My friend mentioned Tartine so we stopped by. It was a little hard trying to figure out where it was because it didn't have a big sign for their bakery, and what's even more interesting is that in the front of the door is written Carl's on the floor. I didn't understand that part. Maybe Carl owned it? Or a long lost lover? Who knows! There was a line out the door and sadly enough, there was a sign that said "Sold out of Bread today". Sigh. Guess it just wasn't meant to be. However, we did order a Lemon Cream Tart, their popular Morning Bun, and a croque monsieur. The Croque Mensieur was really good, but even better when it's hot. Their morning bun was soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside, of course it would have been better if it was hot. Lastly we have the Lemon Cream Tart. It was definitely lemony, a perfect dessert to end a heavy meal! Service was quick and there were 3 tables outside and a couple of them inside. Prices were a bit on the expensive side, but it is definitely worth a try!

I am a huge fan- I would love from them to make an outpost in Seattle. I entered the bakery line when it had reached outside, and found that the wait to order was very short. Having done research, and being on a mission to eat my way through The Mission, I ordered a lemon tart and almond croissant to-go. Right after I placed this order I saw the bread pudding and a few other options that made me vow to myself to come back on my next visit. The high ceiling-ed space and vibe also helped with my decision. My lemon tart was wonderfully flavored and a perfect sour sweet treat to eat at the park. The crust was thick and shortbread like. The tart came with a dollop of cream and a garnish- very pretty. The tart filling amount was perfect- any more would have been painful. The croissant was well made and the almond filling was not a glob of paste, but rather well spread out for flavoring and effect. The texture of the croissant was not the best I have had, but came close. I would order it again. FYI's~ * Many many seating options- outside, inside, communal, bench * Crowded with all types of people * Cash only espresso bar in back * They take your order when you are standing in line and you get it when you pay * Great postcards for sending home or to make friends jealous :) * Lots of black and white and drawn art * Wonderful service! My tart was misplaced so I got two!! * To-go items are placed in paper sacks or cardboard boxes- not great for long time travel

When my best friend Kate told me I HAD to try Tartine's banana cream pie because it was "the best banana cream pie in the world"...I was a little skeptical. ÊI'm sort of an expert when it comes to amazing banana cream pies, so when someone tells me about the greatest pie they've ever had I have to wonder just how great it really is. Ê The pictures of Tartine's desserts and baked goods really don't do them justice. ÊYou can't get the sense of how moist yet flaky the pie crust is, or how perfectly the dark chocolate shell and layer of caramel combine to create the most delicious pie base everrrr. ÊIf you haven't tried anything from Tartine yet, and like me, doubt it's deliciousness...just drive by there and the line winding around the corner will provide you with the evidence that yes, Tartine IS that friggin' good. My favorites are the banana cream pie (duh) and the coconut cream pie. ÊIt's better to come earlier in the day because it's likely that they'll sell out near closing time. Some not-so-amazing things about Tartine: 1. the wait can sometimes be horrendously long, but when there's an out-of-this-world banana cream pie waiting at the end of it all is forgiven. Ê2. Êthere's only ONE bathroom and for some reason the people that frequent Tartine seem to take a long time in there. Ê3. it can get REALLY, REALLY hot inside the bakery which is okay during winter months, but almost unbearable during summer.

Went to this place three time this past year, the most recent was two weeks ago. I could have given this place three stars because of the long lines (at least 1/2 hour wait), hard to find free parking and a few items were not that great (morning bun, frangipane tart). ÊRaise it up to 4stars because of the freshness and price. ÊI had the eclair before which was really good and cookies (save it the next day and it was still moist and fresh). But the five star (you have to be there early, before 11am) is the Double pain au chocolat . . . claude van DAM! Flaky, crispy, buttery crust on the outside and rich chocolate inside. ÊExcellent!

"Spare a quarter" you ask people as you pretend to be a robot, that for some reason only moves its torso and arms in piston-like motions, while making strange sounds through its mouth, never really using its robotic legs to walk anywhere. "SPA-ARE A QUAR-TER". "Daddy, why is that robot orange?" a little girl will ask as she and her dad walk past you on the corner of Powell and Geary. "Sometimes robots are goddamn orange!" he will yell. "Shit, am I a goddamn robot! Why the hell would I know!' he will continue. He drinks a lot. You hear her question, and want to explain to her that the orange paint was on sale this week at Home Depot, and that the Ralph Lauren 'Sparkling Silver' you had been covering every exposed crevice of your body with for the past few weeks was raising your Operating Expenses so high that you were no longer turning a Net Profit, but you didn't, and instead, in a very loud and frustrated robotic voice you say"BIT-CH GIVE ME A QUAR-TER DDDDVVVUU DUUUUU". You try to shake it off, telling yourself that orange robots are actually, actually probably, more realistic visions of the future than anything else. "Who will be able to afford that goddamn silver paint?" you'll ask yourself, as you contemplate the widening gap of wealth and poverty in the country. After everything, however, you will take your hard earned quarters and head to Tartine, where you will buy as many as those goddamn delicious Mexican Wedding Cake Cookies at a quarter each as you can. [Editors Note- At the time of this writing, the Author only knows the small white powder coated crunching balls that cost a quarter each as Mexican Wedding Cake Cookies. Let it be known that the Author has never been to a Mexican Wedding, nor plans to ever attend one, as Mexicans are known for drinking dangerous amounts of alcohol as a pretext to smashing the shit out of a stuffed animal or something of the sort, a Pinata, as he hears it called, and this terrifies the Author).

Another one of yelper's favorite eateries, and with good reason. This place is magical. All the pastries are scrumptious, the croque monsieur piquant and the coffee delicious. I personally come here for the banana cream tart. ÊIt is a gratifying banana cream pudding(?) on a crunchy pastry shell that has a light layer of chocolate lining the bottom. My gf comes for the lemon tart, which she claims is the best dessert she has ever tasted despite not liking lemon tarts anywhere else. Finally, the croque monsieur is one of the best things you will ever taste in your life. There are often long lines, but the food is worth the wait.

It is all about the Morning Buns. Seriously. Get here early, and by early I mean before 8:30 to secure yourself an out of this world morning bun. Buy two. One for yourself and one to give to someone you love so they can be just as addicted as you are and then you both have an excuse to nag each other to go back to Tartine extra early before work. I made a mistake of buying just one... and there were only 2 left! Coffee and a morning bun = the best way to start your morning. I can't believe I've waited this long to try one. Eat with caution, you may not be able to devour just one! p.s. They have the best croissant I've ever had in my life. moist, flaky, buttery goodness.

Tartine was the best thing to happen to Mill Valley in years, but after the price of running their ovens went up during the California energy crises they moved to San Francisco.

ÊThey loved it! ÊNot only does it have recipes for all Tartine's great food, it has in depth conversations about how to really bake it correctly.

ÊAnd I come all the way from North Beach, land of bakeries galore, to enjoy Tartine when I need to escape the congestion of North Beach.

Every chef in training should eat at Tartine to know what a true eclair and croissant is. The next closest thing would be to go to Paris or train at the Culinary Institute of America. Some tips for you: 1. Expect to wait in line, especially in the mornings. A line that goes out the door is *not* unusual. 2. Expect to be packed inside the cafe and share tables with other people. This place is usually packed and any available seat, even on the same table, is usually taken up (but please ask to join the table, be polite). 3. Expect to walk (~5 minutes) from your car (street parking - if you can find one) to the bakery. Highly Recommended : (If you want to know what a "true" Eclair and Croissant is supposed to taste like, you will not regret this choice). -Eclair - Thick slab of rich chocolate, with warm vanilla cream and specks of vanilla bean with the smell of egg yolks. -Croissant - Slightly dark, buttery, crunch with a phenomenal middle. After I ate this, I DO NOT buy croissants anymore (from markets, bakeries, etc.). After you taste divinity, it feels like a waste of money spending it on less qualified, so called "croissants." Even the Panera croissant would be a C- compared to this. Regular market croissants, I would give an F. Costco croissants, a C. Tartine croissants - an A+.

Long lines for food is a gamble. Most times it's unwarranted hype, but sometimes it's so worth it. For Tartine Bakery, the line of hipsters may lead you to think the former, but keep at it: a most delectable treasure awaits you. I highly advise bringing something light to snack on because the portions are colossal. I ordered the Pecorino & Almond Sandwich & that beast lasted for three meals ($12 well spent!). Mind you, I can fit a disproportionate amount of food & I came there hungry. So about that sandwich. The insides were all kinds of wonderful & they were hugged by gourmet Sizzler Cheese Toast!

Parking is a drab and there's never anywhere to sit... BUT WHO CARES?! They have MORNING BUNS! I went there for the first time this morning (despicable, I know). ÊI've seen the Tartine cook book around, and even flipped through it several times but never dragged my butt down to the shop (mostly because parking sucks!) Ê But when I made a breakfast date with one of my girlfriends, she suggested Tartine. YES! I'll gladly go. Boy, have I been a fool. Ê The morning bun is like nothing I've ever had--Crispy, flaky, caramelized on the outside and incredibly fluffy and croissant-like on the inside. ÊIt's lightly sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar on the outside with a hint of orange. ÊI devoured that morning bun like no other (thank goodness I bought two!) I also bought an almond croissant, which I haven't eaten yet because I felt so compelled to write a review the moment I got home! The line is usually long (so I hear) but from today's experience, it moves pretty fast, so if there's a line out the door, do not fret. pssst, Bobby Flay has been spotted here with his wife...if it's good enough for Bobby, well, it's good enough for me.

I'm glad I live walking distance but not too close to Tartine or I would be broke and 50 pounds heavier. This is my favorite bakery in the city. I first discovered this place when dining at Delfina and my friend gleefully announced that we were eating Tartine bread. So of course I had to try it. Their croissants and pain au jambon are great, as are their cookies, especially the deliciously buttery shortbread. They wont slice their ginormous loaves of bread so I split it with my friend and still gorged on it for a week. The country bread loaf is probably the best bread I've ever had. period. I always go during off hours but one day I braved the lines for a weekend brunch. My rooommate loves their morning buns and pressed sandwiches. I think they are good but really I could just gorge on the plain bread and be happy. Not EVERY item is a hit but most of it is amazing. *Update: Uh oh a rave review in the Times? I fear for the fate of my favorite bakery.

As others have mentioned, there is barely any recognizable signage on this small corner bakery on Guerrero St, but you really can't miss it. The fresh smells of butter and sugar waft through the air, and the line at the door tells you, you're there. I came early in the morning for breakfast and did not want to miss out on these morning buns I've heard everyone raving about. ÊAt 10 AM, they were already sold out of bread, and there was a sign posted on the window "Sold out of bread for the day." ÊWhat kind of bread is this that they sell out of within 2 hrs of opening!? Ê I waited patiently in the line that starts at the door, and in less than 12mins was at the front. ÊAs I passed the glass displays of desserts, you're overwhelmed with all the pastries and delicious goodies, you just want to order one of everything. ÊWaiting in front of these displays makes it hard to chose just a few items. ÊIt's to their advantage I suppose. I made up my decision for 2 morning buns and a large croissant with some kind of almond cream filling. ÊThe morning buns were everything I hoped for and so perfectly delicious with it's crispy flaky crust and soft interior. ÊIt reminded me of a Cinnabon, but made from heaven because it was so light and perfect. ÊI also got a cup of coffee and chamomile tea. ÊThey gave me a cup and you help yourself at the coffee bar (which you have to cut the line to get to). ÊI liked the fact they have simple syrup. ÊMy chamomile tea was made by the Barista who took it out of a large tin can and put it into a tea bag. ÊIt was so good, must be a special blend. ÊAfter receiving both cups and 3 plates of food, I had to go outside and search for my BF who was holding down a table. ÊThankfully it was a nice day outside, despite what the forecast predicted. Ê When I bussed my own table*, I asked for a bag to take the half croissant we couldn't finish. ÊThe girl at the register pointed me to the bins in the back to place the dirty dishes in. ÊI was a bit taken aback that she didn't take the dishes. ÊAs I waited in line a 2nd time to purchase some more morning buns and a Pain au jambon to go, I noticed something peculiar about these girls. Ê The girls were very pretty. ÊMaybe their aspiring models or actresses, I don't know but they were very pretty, not cute, and not hot, but pretty. ÊSo if everyone is commenting about their rudeness, lack of attentiveness, or service, perhaps it's because they aren't waitresses. ÊPerhaps they have poor customer service skills, but who cares cuz they're servin up heaven on a plate every day. Ê My items to go were consumed the next morning, and the morning after I returned to NYC. ÊThe orange scented sugar made it a sweet memory. ÊI'll return next time, and maybe for some desserts. *There is a sign in the bakery that says "Thanks for helping us bus our tables"

My diet is ruined. My only consolation is that I ran all the way there and (hobbled) back. Ê(Note to self: Êmust get new running shoes.) ÊBut despite the broken shoes and ruined diet, I keep coming back to this abusive relationship. ÊTartine beats me down with its amazingness, and, in my masochistic ways, keep coming back for more. The croissants, the frangipane croissants (like the regular ones, except with a delicious almond paste inside, chopped almonds on top, and sprinkled with powdered sugar . . . GOOD LORD, I am salivating right now), and the afternoon breads that are OH so crisp on the outside and OHH so soft and fluffy on the inside (I make sandwiches with the bread-- see here: http://pineapplebread.woÉ). ÊThe cookies, pies, and bread pudding. Ê I need to restart my diet. Tomorrow.

Sunday morning breakfast with Aimee J. Arrived 5 minutes before they opened at 9am. The line was already down the block! On a Sunday! Once they opened though, it took a little less than 10 minutes to arrive at our destination of glory: baked goodie heaven. The morning bun and quiche are good, and the bread pudding was nice just as I remembered it, too..but the true all-star this time around was the: Almond Croissant: OMG. SO FLAKY GOOD. Don't bother pulling it apart or cutting it...just sink your teeth into the *CRUNCH*...Mmmm...*drool* And the almond paste inside? So smooth, almond-y, and not too sweet. This + a Chai Latter (served in a huge bowl) was excellently filling. This place alone makes me want to move to the Mission...

I don't understand why this place has 4.5 stars but maybe I tried the wrong things here. The place literally has no sign outside but I guess they're so popular, they really don't need it. I feel like this is a place to be seen and drink coffee and live the Mission lifestyle and perhaps that's why it's getting such high ratings. We ordered the brioche bread pudding as it was highly recommended, the banana cream pie, tres leche cake and an oatmeal chocolate chip cookie. All together, 4 pastries came out to about $18 which seemed a little high but I told myself it was worth it for finally getting to eat a Tartine Bakery treat but now I'm gonna hold myself back from now on because I've learned. The bread pudding was bland and could have a little more cinnamon or sauce. The fruit was not fresh and beyond smushy when I got it home and was quite the disappointment. The banana cream pie, while looking impressive and having a giant piece of chocolate shaving on top, wasn't sweet and had an unusual tasting crust that had the consistency of Filo pastry. The cookie was burned and crispier than I was comfortable with and 4 days later, the cookie and tres leche cake are gonna get put to use in the compost. I hate wasting food but I couldn't bare to finish either attempts at good pastries. A word of warning also if you want to try this for yourself: the lines are ridiculously long and they take their sweet time packaging your order and in my case, can't remember what you ordered. Also, the parking is non-existent and there's no seating available because as I said before, everyone's got coffee in front of them. Maybe it's the coffee that brings everyone back then? Also, if they can raise their prices couldn't they could stand to turn on a light bulb now and then?

Pickled. Baby. Carrots. At such a renowned bakery, you'd expect the springy, moist, flavorful bread pudding to steal the show. Or maybe the morning bun... a deliciously fluffy and sweet non-sticky version of a sticky bun. Or even the crisp-on-the-outside soft-on-the-inside country style bread that the pressed sandwich came with. Heck, even the Mustard, Ham and Gruyere should come first in taking the proverbial cake. But it was the pickled baby carrots and its touch of acid to counteract the buttery, salty sandwich that really made my meal. Dainty in size and delicate in its soft crunch, this physically small yet epically important morsel of food made a brunch that was already one of the best in recent memory THAT much more enjoyable and THAT much closer to being perfect. 5 stars for, well you should know by now Revisit? A resounding yes!

I ordered the spicy turkey sandwich, a lemon tart, and 2 cookies. Total $22. Turkey sandwich was tasty. Toasted bread with ooey-gooey cheese. I like the spicy pickled carrot on the side. Lemon tart was very yummy. One of the best I have had. 2 cookies were crisp, but nothing too special. Factoring in the long line, the lack of tables (first come first service), the lack of service for dine-in eaters (self-bussing of tables, getting own utensils, etc.), Tartine comes out to be a 3/5 stars. I would come back but am not in a hurry to.

This was a great place to grab some lunch on my recent trip to the area. ÊI had an awesome ham-n-cheese experience for lunch, and had enough room for the a cherry/chocolate bread pudding for dessert. ÊThe sandwich was better than the bread pudding, but I'm a bread pudding snob. Ê So yeah, I went for more of the cafe experience versus the straight Bakery deal. ÊI got yummy food and a great weekday lunch was had by me here. ÊOf course I too encountered a pretty crowded place with far too limited seating and customers buzzing around everywhere. ÊIt didn't really bother me, since I was on vacation from out of town, but it seems like they might want to focus on baked goods more or risk frustrating their regular customers out of wanting to bother waiting for either their baked or cafe/sandwich/dine-in foods. ÊOr maybe it's THAT good? ÊI personally can't say.

Êat 8:30 am on a cold crisp friday morning, the lines were palatable, although i hear horror stories about waiting for an hour. Êalso, you have to time things just right, we ended up showing up 15 minutes too early for the stuff we actually wanted. but oh heaven is the food excellent. Êthe croissants were still warm and melted in your mouth. Êthe double chocolate inside of them was still melted, but oh so beautiful.

To tell you the truth, I wasn't as impressed with the bakery as I was with Bar Tartine. ÊThe line is just darn too long and the communal table is just not as good as Le Pain Quotidien. Ê Having said that, the bread here is great as are the lattes that come in huge bowls (too big of a bowl? ÊMaybe, but I like it that way). ÊThe shortbread cookie had that buttery and slightly "cool" aftertaste you would expect in a very well made shortbread. ÊI wasn't impressed with their croissants though, since it is too dense and doesn't really portray the "layered" testure of a good croissant. I would come here for take out but probably will not sit inside the store again.. particularly not on a weekend.

Ok I have to upgrade tartine to four stars. On his last visit up here my boyfriend and I decided to stop by tartine after some shopping. There was no line (it was 6pm), and the staff was very helpful. What really bumped up the rating was the coconut tart and my inability to leave without buying at least three other items for us to try. Once again I had to get the cake aux olives, we also got some incredible cookies. The only draw back was the price. I guess for how yummy it was it really merits five stars, but I'm stubborn, and know that next time I'm there during the day I'll bitch about the line! What a brat! Last Sunday I went on my own little tour (with four friends) of local bakeries and had a wonderful time! We tried Arizmendi, Boulantgerie, Delessio, and Tartine. Tartine was our last stop (thank god). We got there around 2:30 pm and there was a pretty good size line. I waited for about 15 minutes and made some very helpful friends! With the help of my newly found "tartine professionals" I ordered a chocolate croissant, a morning bun, a fruit tart, and the cake aux olives. After all my sweets the cake aux olives was wonderful. It was almost like a custard(ie) texture with bits of ham, olive, throughout. The crust somehow managed to still be flaky and buttery, the combination was sinful! The morning bun was awesome! It was flaky and buttery and covered in sugar. It was so light and yet obviously rich. We all enjoyed it thoroughly although the lingering aftertaste of butter was a slight turn off. The tart was nice. The crust around it was also a winner The croissant was weak compared to the previous bakeries. At the end of the day between the long line, the rude and unhelpful staff (thank god for my friend in line), the inadequate seating, and the higher (not high) price, Tartine is a great place to stop in and get something to go if your in the neighborhood, but not a place I would go out of my way to visit for comfy weekend treat. If you have the time and the money though it won't leave you disappointed.

I've done pretty crazy things in life all for the love of sweets. Back in college, my roommate and I had a craving for tiramisu during a snowstorm. The temperature was 25F (gotta love New York), snow was hitting our faces horizontally and ice was everywhere. So after slipping on Êice, a ripped pair of jeans and a bruise as big as a giant mango, we finally had our tiramisu. And it was worth it. We went to Tartine recently and after circling the mission for almost half an hour and STILL not finding a parking spot, we finally decided to park, uhm, illegally...RIGHT ON Guerrero and 18th. Yep, blocking part of traffic. All for the love of Tartine's Banana Cream Tart. It's probably the BEST Banana Cream I've ever had. Flaky crust coated with bittersweet chocolate and a filling of sweet bananas with caramel and cream, topped with more whipped cream and chocolate shavings. Ahh, what could be better. Simply divine. PS - We didn't get a ticket, but it would've been still worth it if we did!

I came Yelp to check if anyone has experienced "unpleasant customer service" at Tartine. ÊI am relieved to find out I am not only one to experience. If customer service is good, I would have ordered more. If a girl behind the counter asks me "would you like to have anything else?", I would smile back with another order. I feel sorry for Tartine to lose a business opportunity. Tarts were wonderful as usual, but memory of unfriendly customer service added bitter flavor.

This place has the best breakfast in the city. Le Croque Monsieur, bread pudding and the morning bun are all to die for. Although only available in the afternoon, the bread is also fantastic - I had the bread at Delfina and its the only time I've ever stopped the waitress to ask her where they got the bread from. It's just so good. Sure, the seating can be a little annoying, but you'll just have to deal with it. Really, it's one of the highlights of the city. Golden Gate Bridge, Pier 39, and Tartine bakery.

Things to know when you get to Tartine: "Croque" is pronounced like "croak". It might be 10 am, but it's perfectly acceptable to order a piece of the coconut and passion fruit cream cake (seriously divine). You're going to wait in a shitty line regardless of the day and time. Comes with the territory. This is not the place to set up shop and read a book or work on a paper. Even though I saw people doing this, it just looked uncomfortable. Plus, there is little seating provided to begin with, so those who are sitting around pecking away at a croissant for two hours to give reason for their loitering are just being a-holes. Related to the last point, people will stare at you like hawks willing for you to finish your food and leave your table. Again, it is tight and cramped up in here, and while some people do order to go, it seems like the majority want to stay. Know what you want by the time someone takes your order, otherwise you're again being an a-hole and distressing the rest of those waiting in line. It's kind of pricey, but what's new in the world of gourmet sandwich and pastry shops. You bus your own tableware when you're finished, and there are bins on a rack behind the register counter where you place them. That's all I can think of for now. Everything looked good, but I decided on the mushroom croque, which was like an open faced sandwich, and a slice of the aforementioned coconut cake. Both were solid. It was a 16 dollar breakfast, which wasn't the most cost effective, but you know, when in Rome.

Stumbled upon a long line near Mission Dolores and decided to try it out. Everything looked amazing. It ended up being good, but very packed and the servers were really haughty. I tried to ask one what her favorite thing on the menu was, and she just scoffed at me and said mumbled something about that being a hard question to answer. YEAH. DIFFICULT FOR YOU, because you probably haven't patronized your own place well enough to know. Or aren't very good at promoting. We finally got the open faced sandwhich.. which was okay, but nothing spectacular. Average ingredients, kinda cold. We also had one of the desserts which was delicious, but really over priced. Don't get savory here- get sweet- but that might be my sweet tooth talking. Overall I would say its one of those hyped foodie places in the Mission.

Part of me never wants to mention Tartine to anyone, so I can keep as much of it to myself and the in-crowd that knows about this little overstuffed piece of Heaven tucked in the Mission. But unfortunately, the word is out; it's not just local shows and media that blow the cover on this place -- personalities from Food Network even show up here from time to time. Outside of France, this is, hands down, the best bakery we've ever been to. We used to live only a few blocks away, walking distance, and would come here almost every weekend. We've tried just about every pastry here; they never ever disappoint! Liz Prueitt (co-owner) is a pastry goddess and a true artist. Of course, like many patrons, we love the orangey-cinnamony Morning Buns. We usually contrast a sweet morning bun with Pain au Jambon for the salty, savory side. And if you can catch a Pain au Chocolate when it's warm and fresh from the oven, it's so flaky and soft, and the chocolate may just ooze down your fingers and force you to lick it off. Yum! The bread pudding is always changing, and popular. The crumbly currant scones are wonderful with a large cup of coffee. The Gougere (a poofy mound of goodness with gruyere and pepper and herbs) is tasty if you're looking for something savory and not so sweet. Then of course there are all the tarts, cakes, cookies, and puddings for later on in the day (or heck, even breakfast too I guess). For lunch, the sandwiches are pure heaven. But make sure you also order a pastry or tart for dessert. Most mornings, you may need to wait in a long line that runs halfway down the block, but it's worth every minute. Small tip: if you want coffee to sip while you wait in line, when you first arrive, walk past the line and right up to the espresso bar toward the back on the right. You can order and pay for coffee or espresso drinks separately there -- just order your drinks to go, and then get in the big line. Another tip: The line is often too long to rejoin after you finish eating, and can sometimes be longer than when you arrived. So order everything you think you might want the first go around. You can always take it home and save it for later if you can't eat it there. Just don't order the last five Morning Buns if I'm behind you in line, or I'll kick your orange-cinnamon butt before it even gets to the cash register! Unfortunately for us, we no longer live in the City, so Tartine isn't as conveniently blissful as it used to be for us. Still blissful, just not convenient. We still drive up to the City at least once a month, sometimes just for a fix from Tartine, then immediately drive back down the peninsula! We're hopelessly addicted.

I waited around 30-45 minutes to reach the front of the line to place my order because the line was out the door like it always is, but man did I get some goood pasteries! Frangipane Tart - I tried the Huckleberry one. It wasn't bad. It can get somewhat dry so make sure you have something to drink with it. Coconut Cream Tart - Good if you're into coconut desserts. Not a huge coconut fan myself, but I enjoyed what I tasted. Devil's Food Cake - Rich, chocolatey, delicious. A little heavy to eat the whole thing. I suggest splitting with someone. Bread Pudding - It's served room temperature in a little cup. I only wish it were served warm. Good, nonetheless. Walnut Bread (loaf) - Ehh.. not my favorite. I'd say just get the plain. Almost Croissant - DELICIOUS! The almond paste filling is the best part. Haven't had a croissant that was better. Poppyseed Cake - A dense, sweet cake with a hint of lemon. Really REALLY good for the taste buds. Shortbread Cookie - Melts in your mouth like butter. Fantastic. I love the tea here too. Add some honey and everything's perfect. By trying the food, you know Tartine only makes their pasteries with the finest ingredients. You're also paying for it as well because this place is a little pricy, but you forget all about it when you take your first bite. Come here on weekdays and you should be fine, but the ridiculously long line on weekends are a turn-off. No croissant is worth waiting 30-45 mins in the cold wind, but you know when you have to use the bathroom sooo bad that as your proximity to the toilet gets closer and closer you feel like you're about to almost wet your pants? Well that's sort of what it's like at Tartine. As I move up in line and get closer to the food where I can smell the delicious goodies, my stomach growls more and more.

Not much to add to the 700+ reviews on this place other than...Tartine is AWESOME! ÊI'm definitely a fiend for baked goods and this place does not disappoint. ÊWhen you drive by and see that line 10 deep out-the-door...don't be discouraged...the line moves relatively fast. ÊSince seating inside is limited, most people are there to grab their goodies and run. ÊAnd since I equally like to get my sugar fix on while sitting down or on-the-run...the grab-n-go system at Tartine works well for me. Everything I've tried so far is really good...The Morning Buns are however the stuff doughy legends are made of.

So the first time I came here, I had the lemon meringue cake. ÊThe person working actually gave it to me on the house because there wasn't much left and it didn't quite come out to a full slice.

ÊSadly, after having such a great experience with their lemon meringue cake, I had too high of expectations for their other times. ÊDon't get me wrong. ÊEverything was good, but the only thing that really stuck out to me was the lemon meringue.

If you're more in the mood for savory, try the pressed sandwiches on their fresh country bread. The Jamon Royale (fresh Niman Ranch Ham and organic Gruyere cheese) and Pastrami are both incredible. But be warned, they are HUGE: two people can be more than satisfied by one single sandwich. If you don't have someone to share your sandwich with, it's easy to overeat because it is so delicious! They also have delicious coffee drinks. This place is hands-down a rare treat!

Things to bring with you to Tartine: 1) Reading materials for the wait 2) A companion you trust 3) A warm coat unless it's one of SF's 3 hot days of the year 4) Sunglasses 5) Sunscreen 6) Patience Strategy: 1) Walk, don't try to find parking. 2) Read the menu while your companion (see above) looks at the inside pastry cases 3) Read 4) Play on blackberry 5) Wait 6) People-watch 5) Place order Ê- we usually go for some sort of hot sandwich, croissant au jambon Êor croque monsieur and a pastry or two and always the bread pudding (with changing seasonal fruit). Sometimes we go for a cup; sometimes a bowl. 6) Pay for order 7) Retrieve drinks 8) Find a place to stand or sit - we like the outdoor tables outside if we have puppy with us 9) [optional] Leave room in belly for Bi-rite (yes, even after the bread pudding!)

MY FAVS: The croissants...chocolat or plain...soo good with your bev of choice in the morning..tea, coffee, milk, diet coke...They are so flaky and each layer just melds into buttery goodness. Chocolate cake is a great bad day pick me up, the cake part is heavy, but the filling inbetween melts and coats your tongue with chocolate, which entices you to..take..one..more bite. I am allergic, but my husband loves the tarts....he loves the chocolate, cream and banana flavors that the tart brings together. It's a must have for him. The one star is knocked off and I am not sure if it is Tartine's fault or if it is the price of fame: the uber long lines, the lack of signage, and for first timers, a tough time knowing what in the world there is to order until it is waay too late because you are already at the counter. Otherwise, worth the wait, there are tables, but good luck getting one, and same thing goes for parking. If you can, come on a weekday morning and the line won't be as long.

I would find it hard to believe that dessert gets any better then this. I had a coconut creame tart that stopped all conversation and made me have to take a momment to gather my thoughts. It is kinda hard to find parking try to bring someone that can jump off and run in. I drove an hour for these and it was worth every minute.

Happy happy joy joy! ÊThis is what makes me LOVE living in San Francisco. Ê Breads, pastries, and desserts are all legendary. ÊI feel like I died and went to heaven at this place, and they really bring the love to Bar Tartine, their restaurant (see last meal on earth on my profile). But back to the bakery. ÊYou really cannot beat a sunny weekend day in Dolores park with anything from Tartine. ÊIf you are in a breakfast mood, they have pastries, if you are in a lunch mood, incredible pressed sandwiches.

TARTINE.....come to meeee!! The majority of everything here is so freakin fantastic...BEST IVE EVER HAD status. ÊThe reason there is a line all the time is bc everyone is entranced by the decorative pastries and constantly ordering more as you walk through more choices to the cash register. Almond Croissant: Flaky, chewy, light, decadent paste....all at the same time. ÊHow is that possible. Ham and Gruyere Croissant: Cant even talk about it without my mouth filling up with water! Morning Bun: ok....its like a melding of Croissant, doughnut, and cinnamon bun with a hint of orange zest. ÊIs that not the perfect pastry? Chocolate Hazelnut Tart: DO IT. ÊThat perfectly made crust holds the richest creamiest chocolate mousse. Ê Coconut Cream Tart: A little too rich for me....maybe Im not as big of a coconut fan as I thought I was. Sandwiches....who care which one you get. ÊGet 2!!! ÊNo matter what you get they use the BEST ingrediants and baste the bread in butter before grilling it up. ÊThere could be grass in between that bread i would still eat it. Just be prepared to hit the gym for the next few days....you will NOT leave this place with just one thing!

Tartine and I have a love affair that will last for ages... I've always kid about living right on top of this bakery or right around the area just so I could stop by everyday, but I think I'd really consider once I move out of my current apartment. This place has got a sweet buttery aroma that permeates that corner of 18th and Guererro. It's charming, it's chic, and perfect at any time of the day. I've frequented more than a few times in the early hours before work- 7-8am and really, that's when the croissants are worth every dime and more. They are probably the best croissants I've ever had. Everything else is good too, but come for the croissants or the banana cream tart. I tell every one of my friends I'd bring them here, just so I have an excuse to go over and over again.

Why do 90% of the 3-stars-and-below reviews come from people who don't live in San Francisco? Curious. Curious indeed. Do they not know what deliciousness tastes like because their senses have been dulled by sub-par pastries from the likes of Starbucks? Or are they so jealous that people who live here can have Tartine anytime we want that denial causes them to tell themselves it's not that great, anyway? I would love to know what these people think is a superb pastry. If a more superb pastry exists, I have not had it. I adore Tartine. Adore it. The morning bun is worth losing a parking spot over, and the gruyere-ham croissant is one of those experiences that makes me forget that I have a brain--I just become pure taste. Tartine just knows how to make the perfect pastries. I have been meaning to create a reason to go running in the morning, and jogging down here to eat a sticky bun and then running back just seems like the perfect daily ritual. I'm on it. Starting tomorrow.

Came here this morning at the earnest suggestion of a wise old man. =) YUMS : Pecorino & Almond pressed sandwich - Sheep milk cheese & almonds crushed with olive oil, lemon, and sage. Very rich, I'd be in awe of any person who could finish the whole thing, or even 2/3 of it. : Jambon Royale & Gruyre pressed sandwich - Niman Ranch smoked and cured ham & Dijon mustard on Country bread. A savory rendition of the classic ham & cheese with a bit o' spice to it. : Banana Cream Tart - Flaky pastry coated in dark chocolate with caramel, pastry cream, and lightly sweetened cream.... WOW - like insanely delish! Ê100% times more enjoyable than the bread pudding, I swear my life by it. UMS : Bread Pudding - I know this seems to be a favorite here, but I must say, I've had better. I prefer to have the fruit chopped to get bits of it easily along with the pudding. I guess I could have just cut it up myself, and who am I to say how it should be done - nobody. ÊIt was still yummy as hell and worth getting...just don't think i'll be getting it again. NOTES : Yes, even on a rainy Wednesday early afternoon, the place got packed to the rim. : Wish I had known that the sandwiches were large enough to share, even among three. That's ok, cuz now I have enough to last me the rest of the week. The wiches were a bit too greasy. : 2 wiches + 2 lattes + 2 pastries = $44 Time to go run a few dozen miles...before I go back to sample some of their other delectable treats... ======================================== UPDATE:: The fact that I am friggin craving the BANANA CREAM TART every damn day makes me change my rating to a 5 - just for that tart - so get it!

After hearing all the hype about Tartin Bakery we decided to take a morning drive to see why everyone is giving 5 stars to this restaurant. Finding parking to get to Tartine Bakery could be a mission but we were able to get here during the weekday right after the breakfast crunch. This bakery was choked full of tourist, hipsters and locals enjoying a cup of brew or a morning pastry. We ordered the Croque Monsieur with sliced turkey breast and sun dried tomatoes it was one of the better ones i've had but a few of the pastries can be overwhelming and over rated as well. We also order the Banana Creme Tart which was good but the crust was so hard you could only eat the Creme inside, I'm not sure if it was suppose to be this way so that you can put it in the palm of your hand or it was just sitting out all morning. Everyone who has given this place a 5 star rating has never been to Thomas Kellers Buschon Bakery which is simply amazing if you have had the chance to try it next time you are in Vegas or NYC. All in all I gave this a 3.5 but I would have to come back again to try the rest of the buzz. Also don't forget to Bus your own tables since there are no waiters at this establishment! We had to pour our own water, Seat our selves, Put away our dirty plates and wipe our own tables.

Of all the places I have eaten in San Francisco, this has to be one of my favorites. Actually in all the places I have eaten in this country, I think it may be in my top 3.... The croque monsieur is absolutely lovely, the soft gingerbread in the shape of crown moulding is splendid, and the brioche bread pudding is one of the most amazing things I have ever put in my mouth. They also have yummy hibiscus iced tea to wash it all down with. Every time I go to this place the line is literally out the door, so seating is kinda hard to find, but it's okay, Dolores Park is just a couple of blocks away... so grab some brioche pudding and go up to rub your toes in the grass while you eat it, it's a lovely experience...

This is my favorite place to come for banana cream tart and tea. The tart has a very buttery flake crust with chocolate encrusted with loads of banana and cream --delicious. The Zucchini bread is very light and tasty too. I am not a fan of quiche so I do not like the bread pudding. The hot sandwiches here are good and big so you might want to share it with another person. It takes about 20 minutes to make the sandwich and it comes out really toasty and tasty. This bakery is pretty pricey but then again you are paying for quality so it is totally worth it. One banana cream tart cost about $6.00, bread pudding about $3.00, and sandwiches ranging from $9-$12.00. I love the jasmine tea here to wash down the desserts.

Tartine really knows how to do charm. With the random bread art on the walls, the standing dining bar facing outwards, the cute little waitresses and the families and pets that frequent this place, I can't imagine anywhere I'd rather have breakfast on a Sunday morning. Croissant - very, very flaky and delicious. Slightly dry for my taste but still really good. Morning bun - holy crap this was delicious. Very rich and not too cinnamon-y. Bread pudding - my favorite thing we ordered. Warm, gooey, with fresh cranberries and pears! Croque monsieur - this thing is HUGE. They come in four varieties, but not all of them are always available. You will fall into a deep food coma for hours after consuming this. Maybe days. If you decide to eat at the bar by the window, be prepared for a lot of pointing, ooohing and aaahing, and exchanging awkward smiles and thumbs ups with random strangers. It's actually kind of awesome.

I just moved to San Francisco and was hesitant to even set foot in this place, as I have celiac disease and can't have any gluten. But my roommate used to work there and told me that I'd be safe with the chocolate pudding, the meringues (or Rochers, as they call them) and the macaroons, as they don't have flour in them. I went, tried all three, along with a latte in a big bowl. So good! And I didn't get sick, so I've gone back several times. The chocolate pudding is outrageously expensive at $5, but it's awesome. And I'm not even really a fan of pudding. Had I not had the gluten restriction, I probably never would have tried it. I have to admit, most of the employees here aren't super friendly, which is a bit disappointing. I've found the same to be true at Bi-Rite Creamery. People, you know this place is going to be crazy busy. If you don't feel like being nice to customers, then don't get a job here. In any case, I still go. And get super excited if I can even find room to sit down and drink my yummy latte while reading a book. But that's doesn't occur too often, as the place is usually packed.

Tartine has what are hands down the best croissants I've ever had the privilege of eating. ÊTheir dessert pastries are all among the very best in town and thier quiche (yes, real men do eat it) and sandwiches all melt in your mouth (try the croque monsieur with the niman ranch ham). The only thing that makes me sad is that as wonderful as tartine is, the crowd that it draws from other neighborhoods has the unfortunate side-effect of encouraging further gentrification of this neighborhood which is already crippled from the impact of class warfare.

First off, sorry, I'm a yelp virgin. I've used it hundreds of times, but I've only recently decided to add my two cents. I started a Yelp account because I realized that I can't write like a normal person anymore. All the sentences that I write comes out to sound like something a science nerd would say. This means, my language ability is somewhat incomprehensible. And you might wonder, what's with the sudden interest in improving my writing skills? I'm taking my GRE's in 2 months, and I need to sound like a real person. Not a science geek. (I sadly have a subscription to Science and Nature magazine. Actually, not Nature, but wouldn't I be even geekier if I did? Perhaps I should invest.) Anyways, my point is. Tartine is good. Very good. The hot pressed sandwiches are to die for. The bread was my favorite part. So flaky, so moist, so oily, and so yummy! It's essentially just a ham and cheese sandwich. But the bread makes all the difference. If only we can eat this with no regrets. My damn clogged arteries! What makes this place even better is that you can go to Dolores Park which is up the block and walk off that fatty sandwich. Coffee there is surprisingly good too. Very creamy. (I have my coffee black.) I didn't get a chance to try a croissant, but the bread pudding was really good too! The open faced sandwich not so much, it tasted nothing more than a glorified pizza to me. I am officially a food yuppie. God help me.

If I could walk in and out of Tartine in 10 minutes for a morning bun, they would get 5 stars. ÊI would go every day for one until I weighed 300 pounds. Ê Their Mexican wedding cookies are also worth dying for. But frankly nothing else on their menu that I've tried (latte, gouchere, and bread pudding) is worth waiting for. ÊThe space is also impossibly small, so good luck getting seated if you have more than 2 people in your party. ÊEither way, you'll get cozy with someone at Tartine (either in line, or sharing a table with someone).

After watching "The Best Thing I Ever Ate" on Food Network, it immediately became my destiny to come to this place. The guy on there (I forgot his name) was raving about their chocolate croissaints, and boy, do I love chocolate croissants. A few days later, my fellow yelper Stephanie Yuan showed me the 7x7 list of 100 Things You Should Eat in SF Before You Die, and the morning bun from Tartine was on it! So I knew right then and there that we had to go, so that's exactly what we did one cold morning in SF. We arrived on the corner of the bakery at exactly 7:37AM, 7 minutes after it opened, and there was already a line of maybe 20 people deep. I decided to go all out and order both the chocolate croissant, morning bun, and a coffee. Stephanie also had the morning bun and a chocolate chip cookie w/ oatmeal that was as big as her big appetite. LOL! Anyways, so on to the food... THE MORNING BUN IS SOOO GOOOD! If you were like me, you would also be thinking, how good can a morning bun get, right? And what the hell is a morning bun anyways? If this was the quintessential morning bun (and I can bet you it's not), then a morning bun would be a big, fluffy, doughy bundle of goodness with hints of orange and caramel. Oh so goood. Now on to the chocolate croissant.. I wasn't too blown away by my first bite, but after a couple more bites, and after it cooled down, I decided that it was pretty good. I find warm, flaky croissants extremely difficult and messy to eat. The chocolate is dark chocolate so it's pretty bitter. The croissant itself is the perfect doughiness with a flaky surface. If you're willing to spend close to $10 on a pastry-filled breakfast (which in my case I spent $14 because of my all-outness), then Tartine is just the place for you! Until next time, Tartine.. In the meantime, let me work off the 1000+ calories that you have given me.

In high school I worked in a market where my job included prepping baked goods by going down into freezers in the basement, Êpulling cold lumps of lard, flour, and chocolate out of a box from the Quaker Oats Company, and sticking those lumps on trays for tomorrow's "fresh" baked goods section. Ê Customers never knew that their croissants came from some factory in Trenton, NJ or wherever. ÊThey didn't know that the "croissants" they were consuming were actually "fresh baked" (not "fresh made") preservative-laden crap! ÊThey were getting fatter for no good reason! Tartine, on the other hand, is croissant heaven, where you can get fatter for very good reasons! ÊYou don't even have to ask yourself where and when their sublime chocolate croissants were made...you can see them making them right there in their bakery! ÊTo me, that kind of true freshness is well worth the wait and well worth the price. ÊAnd well worth the extra exercise or pounds I put on! But, go ahead and give Tartine low-star reviews...maybe the line will get shorter! Thank you! Ê;)

I've heard about Tartine, seen the cookbook, read about the hype, and finally tried this little spot while a girlfriend was in town. Being the little piggies we are, we kind of went crazy and ordered more than we really should have because we wanted to sample as much as possible. We arrived right at noon and not a minute too late because there was a HUGE line forming behind us right after we entered. From the pressed sandwich menu we tried the sheep's milk cheese with quince jam. It was really buttery, like it had been drenched in butter prior to being put on the griddle. I'm one of those super sensitive to butter types of people, so I felt like it was a bit much. However, for those butter lovers out there, you'll want to lick your hands of the butter that has formed on them after you finish your sandwich. The tangy sheep's milk cheese coupled with the sweetness of the quince jam was a great combo. Next up was another sandwich off the pressed sandwich menu. Fromage blanc with bananas. It was also extremely buttery and the banana chunks were a bit large, but it was also a good flavor combo. The chocolate croissant was the highlight of the meal for me. They use Valrhona Chocolate and use a lot of it. It's not like the typical chocolate croissants that contains two "tubes" of chocolate and it's mostly pastry and no chocolate. Not this version; there's yummy chocolate in every bite. All in all, I get why Tartine has such a following, but I felt like there were some small things that needed adjustments. However, I will make the trek to the Mission any day of the week to experience that sinfully delicious chocolate croissant.

Tartine, Tartine. 922 Yelpers can't be wrong. They're not, don't worry - I ain't callin you out (I just had my nails done afterall, uh!), however I do think y'all are a tad over-enthusiastic about The Tart. We got there about 4, good for the line, it wasn't too long, the people are fast, friendly and cool, the bakery display is heaven to gaze at whilst in line. We had the croque monsieur, the Jambon Royale & Gruyere and the Sopressata pressed sandwiches. Admittedly, I didn't know what the hell sopressata was - but it came with pesto and broccoli rabe - I liked 2 out of 3! They were beautiful. The 2 sandwiches were done to perfection, but the croque monsieur was a little over crisped, making the crust slightly tough to chew and the ham a little dry. It was my mistake ordering the sopressata, I'm not a fan of salami and that's kind of what that is, and the cheese was an odd choice to accompany, the pesto didn't have that savory punch that I love about pestos the world over and the broccoli was mysteriously missing. I did call the local authorities, however they told me that it has to go missing over 24 hours before it's technically "missing." So, we'll see. We took a whole Lemon Meringue Cake home to share and this tasted as good as it looked, however dry on the ends, but the wonderful tart, tangy lemony middle made up for that with meringue that was so light, sticky and perfectly browned. The place is tiny and no matter what, if you've got a table, you've got prying eyes waiting hungrily for you to get out of your seat so that it will soon become their seat. All in all, I love coming into the city and trying new places and this was good - but there's just no way that I can be this close to Delessio's and pass it up. Not for Tartine, I just can't do it!

This is going to be the 961st review and I feel like there were 961 people in line before me. Every minute, every day, tartine has a line. Raining, hailing, alien invasion....they will probably queue too, for a hazelnut tart. Price? Slightly high...but good, no questions. The Eclair was unbearably runny but the light touch of lemon zest and the buttery flour sensation of the cream was unbeatable. Chocolate/hazelnut tart was rustically authentic. Espresso can be improved. Overall? A terrific pastry shop, very often found in Europe, very rare in San Francisco. Oh no!!! They make sandwiches? F##K, I've to put myself in line after the aliens!

Originally I wasn't too thrilled about coming here because I saw the line outside, I'm not really a pastry person, and I had just stuffed myself with donuts. But the line moved fast and I'm always down with savory food items. ÊThe only savory items they have before noon are basically the Croque Monsieur, a croissant, a quiche, and a few other things here and there. ÊThey have four types of Croque Monsieurs but at the time we arrived, there were only the Ham and the Frommage Blanc. ÊWe got one of each at around $10 per. ÊIt's made very differently here because they use one slice of thick French bread as opposed to two slices of regular toast. Ê This was the BEST. ÊI cannot even begin to describe just how exquisite it tasted. ÊBoth had its pluses. ÊThe Frommage Blanc had a lovely curdled texture to it and wasn't overpowering as it was paired up with the gruyere. ÊThe Ham one is good because the quality of the beat is superb and it just adds a nice hint of meatiness to it. It takes a while to come out because they heat it up and it's pretty fresh. ÊIt's topped with some tomatoes which really aren't your typical tomatoes... they're not that acidic. ÊEverything about the Croque Monsieur was light in flavor but heavy in texture. ÊYou get pickled heirloom carrots on the side which balances everything out nicely! I would gladly come back for some Croque Monsieur.

CROISSANT. Even when it was cold and after being pressed flat in my bag, it still exuded buttery goodness.

If someone were to ask me where to get a great croissant I would point them in this direction with the caveat that a wait in line is inevitable. ÊThe delicious morning buns are also kind of like a hybrid between a croissant and sticky bun. ÊRolled up similar to a sticky bun and sugar glazed with cinnamon, but with the light buttery and flaky consistency of a croissant. ÊAdded in the mix, which caught be by surprise, were sparsely placed small bits of stick-to-your-molars chewy candied citrus rinds. I've also had a hot-pressed spicy turkey sandwich and some of the bread pudding from here as well. ÊThe sandwich is very good but a word of caution, if you are in a hurry you probably shouldn't order one as they actually take quite awhile for them to get it to you. ÊThe bread pudding wasn't too bad, but nothing really special in my opinion.

TARTS: Banana Cream tart (4/5): There is literally more whipped cream than banana custard. However, I love the chocolate on the crust and the thick crust which is ever so difficult to slice through. This glorious item is usually sold out in the afternoon. Coconut Cream Tart (3/5): Again, I'm a big fan of the thick crusts, but the coconut itself tasted light and artificial. Lemon Cream Tart (5/5): The tart didn't look as fluffy as the other two and I put off purchasing it until my 4th visit there. I love how the thin crust wasn't flaky but was substantial enough to contrast with the creamy lemon. The lemon itself had such a zesty, powerful flavor that it reminded me of some of the lemon bars I've eaten. Tartness + dollop of whipped cream that was absolutely devoid of flavor = heaven Frangipane Tart (4/5): Crust is croissant-like, but much tastier than the croissant because it has more almond cream Chocolate Hazelnut Tart (3/5): very rich and satisfying, a little dry CAKE: lemon meringue cake (3/5): the cake itself was lemon-infused with two layers of lemon curd. It was covered with meringue that was too sticky and solidified after awhile. passion fruit lime bavarian (4/5): Light like a bavarian should be but with strong passion fruit notes. So Tropical! I couldn't really taste the lime, but the toasted coconut on top was super crunchy. tres leche cake (3/5): It was moist and very fresh, but very ordinary. It is not your traditional Mexican tres leche cake if that's what you're looking for. fresh fruit bavarian (3/5): A seasonal cake that Êcontained blackberries and raspberries of monstrosity! Very light with not much cake. Think English trifle. Lemon bar (2/5): very ginormous lemon bar for $4. Its crust was too dense, flavorless. The lemon gelatin on top was overwhelming/thick/sticky Bread pudding (3/5): They bake it in Êlarge trays and the fruits used in the pudding vary Rocher (4/5): very airy, comes in cocoa nib and almond flavors For their savory items, I like their croques and quiches. CUSTOMER SERVICE (0/5): Like recent reviews mentioned, the cashiers seem like they were all selected out of Grouches 'R US. Usually service doesn't bother me that much in terms of bakeries, but I never want to deal with their attitudes so early in the morning. They are even so inattentive when taking your order that they often mess up.

The continual challenge I have with the bakery is this: Êthe brutal gap between a great product and poor service. Service is so disorganized, casual, and unapologetic. ÊAs if waiting in line for at least 20 minutes isn't bad enough to get a bag of pastries, you wait another 5-10 for the coffee bar to serve your coffee that you can only order at the till -- but it's certainly not made to order. Ê"Our grinder only makes doubles. ÊYou can choose the 8 or the 10 ounce. ÊSame shot in both." I would be a regular customer if Tartine could figure out how to serve customers at the speed of Grand Central Bakery (of Seattle and Portland).

Update 7/24/08. ÊHow could I not have given five stars to this place? ÊI think it was the coffee. ÊYes, Tartine has improved their coffee finally to something worthy of the food inside. This restaurant won the James Beard award this year for the best bakery in America, and I know why. ÊI hate waiting in line and yet....well I will let my poetry from my first review speak for me. ÊI could write something similar for every other thing I have eaten there--quiche with its magnificent crust of perfection and creaminess; croque monseuir with a garden of mushrooms and the spicy gloriousness of white pepper; macaroons, pudding, and coconut cake that are making me drool even today. Tartine is sheer perfection. ÊThere is no equal in America. I love thee, o morning bun. ÊAllow me to wax poetic about your velvety buttery insides, your caramel orange toffee coating and the rich cinnamon sugar sprinkles. ÊThat you were fresh out of the oven my darling made your beauty that much more appealing. ÊHowever, the mountains I had to climb to find you (long line, no seating, no parking), make you sadly, only an occasional treat. ÊYour friend, the cafe au lait, while dressed appropriately in Parisian bowl style, was a bit too cold for my taste. ÊI shall be back to taste your goodness and perhaps that of your friends, lemon bar and chocolate pudding.

The croissants and pain au chocolat are some of the best that I've had in SF and it measures up pretty well against the flakey awesomeness I've sampled around ze planet! The actual eating area is waaaaaaaay too congested to get any real pleasure outta the food, so I always get my pastries to go and head down to Dolores Park (weather permitting haha!) to enjoy them. Oh yeah, they need to fix the long-arse queue problem. There is absolutely no reason folks should wait that long. That aspect is definitely not authentic!!

Is there nothing that isn't SUPERB in their bakery case? ÊMy friend and I pulled up nearby Tartine, early one Saturday morning and the line was already quite long. ÊAs we pulled into a magically available parking space, directly across the street (seriously? Êthis was a sign!) he said, "Don't worry about the line, it's worth it." ÊNow, don't get me wrong, I trust AJ implicitly when it comes to most things food oriented, but I've seen lines before, waited in them and felt horribly ripped off by my meal after having wasted time. ÊI kept my misgivings to myself and we lined up as the pleasant aromas of the bakery wafted out the door and down the street. Once we got to the Bakery window, I started to get pretty excited, because I could see these giant vats of cream fillings and pastry puffs waiting to be filled with pure delicious. ÊThat's when I started to have a crisis...whatever would we get? ÊI mean, how was I to choose just one...or two of these lovelies??? ÊI shouldn't have been concerned...we ordered just about one of everything! A coconut creme tart, bread pudding with fresh peaches and blackberries, ham and cheese croissant, quiche, morning bun, chocolate chip cookie, lemon bar and probably some other stuff...it's been a few months since this trip and I'm writing from memory. ÊWe headed up to Twin Peaks, enjoying the misty morning and chowing down on our FEAST. The best part....when I arrived safely home to Seattle, some 14 hours after ordering, and devoured the most amazing lemon bar, I've ever eaten. ÊAny bakery item that can survive a day of sitting in a car, and being smooshed on a plane and still taste the way that lemon bar did is AFUCKINGMAZING. Ê The line and then some was well worth the wait. ÊThe fact that I can write this review, months after my visit and with total clarity (and a real jones for a lemon bar) has got to count for something!

I'm a little disappointed that Tartine's hot chocolate isn't as rich anymore and...it was just warm.

I'll wait all day for a mocha at Tartine. ÊThey pre-melt super nice chocolate (not powder) for this yummy treat, and I'm hooked. As far as their foodstuffs, I experience anxiety every time I get in the line because everything is tasty. It's always a tough choice between something savory (like the croque monsieur) and something dripping in sugary goodness. A warm sunny Saturday morning is well spent taking your mocha to Dolores park with a book and a blankie.

I am pretty certain that heaven smells exactly like Tartine. Tartine was on my list of places to check out on our quick stop in San Francisco. We were able to stop by on our way out of the city. We got there about twenty minutes before they opened and already a line was forming. The crowd outside all appeared to be salivating. When we stepped in the smell was intoxicating. We both ordered two massive almond croissants filled with chocolate and coffee and were on our way. While on the Bay Bridge we took our first bite and felt as if it was the first croissant we'd ever truly had. I mean sure we'd had croissants, Parisian croissants, but this was entirely a different league. And it was the perfect way to say goodbye to SF.

The masses on Yelp aren't lying. I've tried the entire sweet menu by now, so I can say with authority that the absolute most delicious thing is their chocolate pudding, made with Valrhona chocolate and hand-whipped cream. N00bs come for the pastries, which are excellent of course. But you, seasoned Yelper, should know to stay for the bread. One country loaf will turn into half a country loaf by the time you finish walking home with your boyfriend, who is more bread than person at this point. And that half a loaf will still last many meals and sandwiches. I won't try to describe the bread for you with my clumsy, non-English-major words. Read this. http://tartinebakery.comÉ

I don't think there was any way this place was going to be able to live up to the hype. As I stood in line devouring a bag of chicharrones from 4505 meats, I contemplated my plan of attack. I wasn't sure how I was going to do this. It was too crowded to see exactly what desserts they had left, but I knew many difficult decisions lie ahead. The bread pudding was a must, so we got a large order of that. For my secondary dessert I went with the coconut cream tart. As we sat outside devouring our purchase I concluded the following. The bread pudding was a warm apple bread pudding, and was honestly nothing to write home about. The coconut cream tart was a great concept, unfortunately it was a 9.5/10 on the difficult to eat scale. The dark chocolate base on the inside refused to break off and the coconut custard and cream top created a mess in the struggle to cut this thing apart. A pleasant surprise came in the form of a pocket of caramel hidden somewhere inside this complex dessert treat. Nothing blew me away. The bread pudding was supposed to be the show stealer but left me disappointed, whereas the coconut tart was good, but had me remembering the complexity/difficulty of the dish rather than the flavor. Yet, I would go back, they had too many other good looking things in their display case.

I've been addicted to the Coconut Cream Tarts in here for years. The eclairs are also exceptional. It's always too hot and claustrophobic to stay in to eat, but as a take-out bakery, Tartine's amazing. The staff have always been very sweet too... Except for that dude with the beard and 'comedy' round glasses who I dealt with last week... He was unhelpful when the woman in front of me asked him a simple question (he mumbled something and immediately walked away from her, much to her frustration), then straight up ignored me for quite a few minutes despite not doing anything else in that time other than staring at the ground and slowly wiping the counter in front of him. It was weird, given how great the service usually is in here. Not cool, but not even Glasses Man's stinky attitude will keep me from my coconut tarts. Absolutely delicious. And clearly incredibly complicated to make. Good work.

Great, great coffee and wonderful(!) hot sandwhiches - but it's quite horrible sitting in there. Way too crowded and with a constant line of 30 people makes you feel like everyone have their eyes on you and your table. Also make you feel like you're at a bus terminal. Too bad. The coffee is great - and I like coffee a lot.

I thought this place might have been too hyped up, but it actually lived up to my expectations. This place is pretty noticeable once you see the long line of people waiting outside. It was a Saturday morning so it was to be expected. The line went somewhat quickly though so it wasn't too bad. I ordered the gougere and the morning bun. The gougere had a good flavor to it and wasn't too cheesy. The morning bun was okay, but it wasn't as good as people made it out to be. My roommate got the brioche bread pudding which for a girl like me who isn't normally a fan of bread pudding, loved it! Nice soft texture with yummy apples on top. Also tried some of her banana cream tart which was very delicious and decadent. Too crowded to really hang out there, but i would be come back to get some goodness to go.

Delicious! I went in intending to try the goat cheese pressed sandwich but standing in line I saw something delicious go by and just had to have it. It was the Croque Monsieur that I tried. An open face sandwich with bchamel, gruyere, thyme and pepper and topped with ham, turkey or vegetables. I wanted the ham, but it was going to take an extra 15 minutes for the ham and I didn't want to make my friend wait so I got the turkey. It was incredible. The bread is sliced thick and toasted to a perfect crunch. The cheese goes well with the herbs and turkey. I finished off the entire thing. My friend had the Spicy Turkey which was almost as good. We tried the eclairs which were delicious. I don't always love eclairs because I am picky about the custard insides, but this one was well worth trying. My friend insisted that it was the best one she's ever had. The bakery itself was interesting. You get in line which usually wraps around the outside, order at the counter and get a number. Pretty basic right? Then you get your own silverware and water, again basic. It was the location of the silverware and water that was interesting. Its all on a rack behind the counter where you pay, right sort of in the kitchen. You also bus your own tables at the end and bring everything to bins right below the water pitchers. Very unique. Wonderful sandwiches and to die for pastries....you will see me there much more.

Someone in management please do something about the snail-pace line!!! Yelpers will agree with these statements: Tartine's morning buns are unique and wonderful. Tartine's Passion Fruit Lime Bavarian and Chocolate Souffle cakes are great. Tartine's Croque Monsieur, Jambon Royale & Gruyere, Proscuitto & Provolone, Mozzarella & Tapenade, Humboldt Fog Goat Cheese, etc. are excellent. However.....if the Department of Motor Vehicles and Kaiser Permanente can improve their wait times in lines, so can Tartine Bakery. I mean, c'mon! How hard is it to hire two more people added to their unfriendly staff? It doesn't take a genius for management to rethink this problem by taking a moment and say: #1: "Hmmmm. I think it would be wise to have a person taking phone orders." (lightbulb glowing) #2: "Hmmm. I've got another brilliant idea. Why not have a separate cashier for just pick-ups?" (another lightbulb beaming) I don't recommend visiting this bakery anytime after 10:30am, especially on weekends. YOU WILL WAIT FOR AT LEAST 30 MINUTES! If you have the time to preciously give up, then stand in line. Otherwise, bag the entire venture and thank the heavens you minimized your carb intake that day!

First and foremost: if there isn't a line, Tartine isn't open. Once you get your food, you'll probably have a hard time finding a table. You may even wind up having to share space with another human while enjoying your fantastic meal. Get over it or don't bother. If it is convenience you want, go to Starbucks or move to Danville. Tartine is a wonderful neighborhood bakery that is all about the sublime, amazing food. The scones are moist, with fresh ingredients in them. The chocolate croissants have ruined me; I don't know why I even bother to get them anywhere else now. If you need a larger portion for your breakfast, the Croque Monsieur will do nicely, thank you very much. With over 800 reviews, you have to expect the place to be popular. So if you can't spare 15 minutes for the best damn pastries in SF do one of two things: 1) Re-examine your priorities; or 2) Go on a weekday. The best way to avoid the line at Tartine is not to go: more for the rest of us.

My girlfriend and I stopped in one afternoon and the line was pretty short for this place. There weren't as many confections and pastries plus we were hungry and opted for sandwiches. The sandwiches list is really a selection of paninis. The sandwiches were BAD. Uneven-cut, super thick, BURNED break slices with a minimal amount of food stuffs in between. They were soaked in either oil, butter, or both. In fact, the fat was so heavy we both felt nauseous for the rest of the day. The sandwiches were the worst part. After that though, the service sucked. Two of the people behind the counter were snobbish. One sandwiches came out but the other was nowhere to be found. After a wait, I inquired and found they stuck mine in a to-go box and left it somewhere hidden away. They gave it to me cold without heating it up again. When I asked where creamer was (didn't see it), the response was very rude. On top of the sandwiches, we got a slice of the banana bread to start with. It was cold, which kind of sucked but that's just a matter of personal taste. It was nothing special. A lot of people seem to rave about the confections, but the service and sandwiches are really, really bad. That's enough for me to avoid this place.

Without a doubt, this is THE best "French" bakery in San Francisco. It is more likely the best in California and probably one of the best in the entire country. Yeah it is that good! Here are a few of the amazing items they offer: - Loaf of bread. They make about 170 of them from Wed through Sun. There are just amazing & I do get mine every week. - Croissants. They are literally to die for :D. They are buttery, crispy, hot out of the even... everything you are looking for when you should get a croissant actually. - Double pain au chocolat (or pain au chocolat). They are a good alternative to croissant and are as amazing. - Morning buns. if you are more in a salty mood they also offer amazing quiche and open side sandwich. But you should come back for their pastries! Quality if definitely part of this place. And there is two great book about this bakery you might want to consider if you want to know more about them: Ê - Tartine (http://www.amazon.com/TaÉ) - Tartine Bread (http://www.amazon.com/TaÉ) No wifi here but I think the only think you would like to think about when you are there is to indulge and enjoy the food you just get isn't it? Disclaimer: I'm French :-) ============================== Pros: - Best bakery EVER! Loaf of bread, croissant, pain au chocolat. The list is almost endless... - Well located. Close to Bart and to Dolores park. What a better location to enjoy a nice pastries on a sunny day with a beautiful view on the city? - Friendly staff. Line move fasts actually. Cons: - Huge lines, especially during peak time. - Place is too small if you would like to eat he, getting a table can quickly become a challenge. - Parking can be also tricky is this area of the Mission. Cedric's secret advice: - best time of the day to go there and avoid the crowd? out of peak time. So either very early in the morning (before 9am) and mid-afternoon (3-5pm) during weekdays. And definitely not on weekends! - how to get you bread every week and avoid lines? Give them a call before 3pm the day you would like your bread and then pick it up after 5pm. You can then bypass the line and go straight to the cash register :-) Cedric's favorite combo: - A slice of their Sesame bread, put in a toaster for a minute to get it warm, and then topped with Nutella :-) YUM!

Dear Tartine, I met Êyou for the first time on saturday... and although you made me wait in line for over 30 minutes, it was totally worth it! Between 4 of us, we got 4 different types of sandwiches ($7.95 to $8.95), breadpudding ($4.50/bowl or $2.75/cup), a lemon cream tart ($5.50), and a bananna cream tart ($5.50). ÊAnd I must say... every bite was heavenly. ÊI don't even like banana cream tart, but your BCT was absolutely exquisite... ÊHow do you create such perfections and only charge us with reasonable prices? Êno, no, i am not complaining, merely expressing my gratitude. Ê So, after leaving your bakery on saturday, all I can think about and taste in my mouth was your delicious pastries and I started to fantasize about what other items may taste... so I went back on Monday (yesterday)... and you satisfied me once again. ÊYour chocolate crossiant ($2.95ish) was.... perfect. ÊNot too sweet (dark chocolate) and flaky on the outside and soft on the inside... And the lemon bar was great too... with buttery crust that wasn't too over-the-top. Ê You are now officially my favorite bakery and I will be visiting you every week or so... or as long as I can still fit into my jeans...

I was really happy that my friends live relatively close to Tartine. Such a great bakery! I went on the weekend and the line was a nightmare but when I went back during the week it was almost non-existent. My friend and I tried the Almosd Frangipane Tart with Seasonal fruit, the brioche bread pudding, an eclair, and the chocolate croissant. This was however between two trips. We don't want to seem overly gluttoness, do we? The quality fo the baked good is fantastic. I used to work at Flour bakery in Boston and Tartine really gives Flour a run for their money. It's a good thing that they are on opposite coasts. They lose one start because their employees are devoid of personality. Not my favorite thing to experience after waiting in any line.

But a bunch of halfwits from McDonalds could double the througput and halve the wait. ÊIts a good thing there are so many people with disposable income but no obvious job who are able to wait in line for 30 minutes for croissant and a cup of coffee.

On the positive side, their bread - which seems to be available only in the afternoon/evening for some reason, is really spectacular. ÊOf course, it gets stale while you wait in line, but still.

Oh Tartine, how I love thee? Let me count the ways... 1. Sharffenberger mochas in a bowl 2. Lemon Tart, so sweet, light and tart (ha!) with a firm crust; sometimes you are dressed in rose petals, and other times in a few pine nuts, what ever you wear, you are delicious 3. Morning Bun, O! Morning Bun. Your sweet roll of orange and cinnamon make me forever forget my former lovers at Cinnabon(TM). Your crunchy sugary tops and your soft and tender center make it a joy to start my days with you. 4. Salad, Le Petite Green Salad. You have inspired a simple salad brought I've into my home. Simply romaine, fresh lemon juice, salt (and I"m guessing honey) you are the perfect match for number 5. 5. You, decadent quiche are quite delish. 6. Bread Pudding, you aren't so bad yourself! For those who know how much I like hot fruit, this is the place to get it. So fresh, and bready eggy yum yummy. These are the only things I've tried so far, but beware mousse au chocolat, macaroons, cake, etc. I've got you in my sights!

HEAVENLY would be the word to best describe this little gem of the Mission District. ÊEverything, and I mean everything, here is to die for. ÊThe famed morning buns, for example, are just divine! They're light and flaky with delicate hints of orange zest and cinnamon. I get this every time I go. ÊThe chocolate vanilla pudding is another unbelievable creation, so soft and so luscious. ÊThe croque monsieur is also fantastic. If you're looking for savory goodness, then this is a sure bet. ÊBe warned though that it takes about 10-15 minutes for it to come out, unlike the other ready to go delights. ÊOh and the lattes, served in a nice, large bowl, are excellent too. What can I say, I can go on and on, listing all the organic pastries and breads that this place has to offer, but you'll just have to try for yourself and see....that I am absolutely spot on!

Love it but hate how high-maintenance this place is. First the bread doesn't come out until 4 pm. Or 5. Or 3. Who can say? ÊNext, getting said bread is an ordeal -- you wait in a tremendous line only to arrive at the front to find out it's still baking. Join Citizens for a Tartine Bread Express Lane!

Some people spend their entire lives searching for love. Some people try to find the perfect words to express it in books, song, poetry, etc. What many don't realize is that all you have to do is bite into one of those croissants at the corner of Guerrero and 18th to find it. In some ways, I hate my friend Jeanne Y. for introducing me to this place several years back. It's a total diet killer, but I guess I would have found it eventually. It's like a siren, except the dangers you are lured to are carbs (is there really anything worse?). So where to start? The croissants are amazing. I love them to death. The bread, especially when fresh out of the oven, is perfect. The bread pudding is delicious. I could go on, really, but pretty much every thing I've ever tried at Tartine is absolutely perfect. Ê I will say, though, that the one thing I actually did not care for was the morning bun. It was a little too sweet for me. Tartine Bakery, I would probably leave my boyfriend for you if you were a stunning French man.

Every time I step in here, I can't walk out of here with less than a shopping bag full of World Class Baked goods here!!! This time I end up with 3 Coconut Cream Tart ( they ran out of my fave Banana Cream Tart), a small Tres Leches Cake and 2 loafs of corn bread for stuffing for Thanksgiving. Everything was devour the next day and smiles all around. Possibly one of the Best Croissants outside of Paris in the Bay Area ?? I had quite a few in Paris myself... p.s. This was Carl's Bakery back in the day, as I remember, the Best sheet cake during the 70's!!!

Tartine rocks for the pastries. This is THE place to get birthday cakes.The coconut-passion cake raises my rating to 3 stars. I wish I could do more. For the rest: bof! I am sorry but the croissants are te-rri-ble: super heavy and the butter as a weird after taste. I tried a couple of times, never managed to finish one. Coming from France I know what they are supposed to taste like. This is not okay. The Tartines are way too salty. I tried and tried because I was a neighbor and my friends kept on dragging me there. 3 stars is all I can do. Too bad. I really don't understand the line around the corner at lunch time. Good for them.

The food - fantastic. The service, the long lines, the lack of seating? As I was told by the sales woman at the Givenchy counter in Galleries Layfayette while I frantically searched for a limited-edition, nowhere-to-be found mascara, 'They are a product of their own success.' Here's a thought - buy the building currently occupied by Farina, as I doubt they'll get a liquor license with all the hubbub. I'm not coming back, as no one should have to wait 45 minutes to buy a damn bun and a cup of coffee, regardless of the taste.

There are no signs overhead or on the door but you know it by the line that wraps around the corner. The coconut macaroon, quiche lorraine, and cafe mocha were all fabulous. The croque monsieur was a bit disappointing...it just wasn't that flavorful...melted cheese, shitake mushroom on a big piece of bread. I could've made this at home. Nonetheless, a great experience.

Just wanted to restate my love for Tartine and while I'm in the loving mood I also love San Francisco and I love Dolores Park and I love my little dog Spammy. A perfect day: short line at Tartine (I know what a miracle), yummy flaky jambon croissant (Spammy was eyeing my croissant the whole time waiting for a big ham chunk to fall from my mouth), best chocolate pudding, fresh squeezed grapefruit juice, banana cream pie, 70 degree weather, a nice blanket and book, and a nice tired dogster from playing all day with the other dogs.

Let's start with the cons. 1.We went on a Friday, lunchtime. It was still difficult to get parking. 2. There is very limited seating. ÊI can't imagine what a weekend looks like. 3. The staff doesn't really help you understand how to order or ask if it's your first time there. ÊThey just treat you like a regular. You have to be aggressive! 4. There is no sign out front that says "Tartine" just a small menu in the window. ÊBut you can't miss it if you look for a corner store with black walls and cafe seating outside. The Reason it still gets 5 stars: 1. The food is fresh and amazingly delicious. ÊI don't really like carrots, but their in house spicy marinated carrots are worth the trip any time of day. 2. The menu items always have a vegetarian option. 3. You know they use the best quality ingredients if they have Humboldt goat cheese on the menu. And menu items change depending on what produce is in season. When we were there, they had Croque Monsieur with Shitake mushrooms and quiche with asparagus. 4. The best deep dish quiche I ever had, and I claim to make the best quiche. Although my bf now agrees that Tartine may have the best of me. =( 5. Great bread pudding. It's not too sweet like most I've had. ÊI just wish it was more warm. 6. The "Bus your own Table" concept. ÊNot only does it save you money, but it has a fun communal feel like you're eating at home with a bunch of strangers. The will be the first place we visit anytime we come to SF again. I just wish they would expand!

Just as a note to tourists: dont get 1.5 things from here for breakfast. Its too much... butter. My friend and I split the banana cream tart and I had a almond croissant and she had a quiche. We couldnt finish our individuals. Especially not first thing in the morning. The almond croissant was pretty good and it was the biggest I've ever seen at 3.75. I like the marzipan a lot cause it had so much almonds on it. but its not as sweet as those in new york. The banana cream tart was a second fav. My only problem was that the crust was pretty hard. Though, if I ever have a chance to come back here, I would like to try out ALL of their pastries. They look so damn appealing.

My loverman actually wanted cake for once and I was in no position to object. We were on our way to Bi-Rite when we noticed Tartine was actually not packed for once. It was probably due to the fact that it was incredibly hot and there was no A/C inside. I was about to order the fruit tart until I noticed they had my favorite dessert, bread pudding! I very rarely ever find good bread pudding anywhere. It's usually really dense and gross and makes me wonder why I even like bread pudding. A bite of their brioche bread pudding reminded me. I was given the option of a cup or a bowl. I'm so glad I ordered the cup because it was a huge portion. I wasn't even able to finish the whole thing and I ALWAYS finish dessert. Well okay, this wasn't dessert in the literal sense but it was sweet and baked which usually means I'll eat the whole thing, and then want seconds. Their bread pudding with strawberries was light and not too sweet. I still regret not finishing the whole thing but the fact that I was sitting there, sweating my thighs stuck to the chair, really made me want to leave. I think their bread pudding is one of the cheapest things there too. My loverman ordered the lemon tart. I took a bite of it but I have no memory of whether or not I liked it. I was probably lost in the euphoria from eating that bread pudding. He also ordered some cheese open faced looking sandwich thing that he took to go. I could've spent another good hour or two looking at all the baked goods but my sweat drenched back had other plans.

This place is famous for their bread pudding and this sweet bun or something. We got it for the sake of it being so famous...and we also got a million other items. ummm, i think everyone is on crack with the bread pudding. It sucked. Too sweet, and not the best thing here at all. The eclairs are yummy. The cream is light and a little runny, but still delish. The lemon creme tart is my favorite of the pastries here. We also got the 3 cheese sandwich and the open top veggie sandwich. Both were wonderful and great to share. We cut everything into 4 pieces and it was perfect. The 3 cheeses were random and I can't remember the names, but it was very tasty and the bread was also very crunchy and good. The veggie sandwich was flavorful although it looks like a big glob of weird stuff. Trust me, it tastes good. The cafe au lait is also in a bowl and soooo yummy. I thought the cafe at Le Garage is better than Tartine's but this was also very good. The peppermint tea is refreshing and just warms your stomach. Can't go wrong with that. The line for this place is out the door everytime. We got there around 10 and it was packed full. We waited about half an hour to get in and place our order...so get your orders ready while you wait! The turn over rate is fast so you are likely to find a seat in the crowded place by the time you place your order...but you are likely to share it with other people who are vying for the seats just like you. The place is teeny tiny, and everyone is crowded up against each other like a metro in Rome. Our table was jostled by the people in line ordering, but that's the fun of it. Just don't spill your coffee!

Tragically, I wasn't very hungry when I came here today, so just shared the "hot chocolate" - a chocolate pudding cup with a chocolate chip cookie on top... and had a cup of coffee. Both were about the best I've had. That being said, the sandwiches looked AMAZING and I want to go back for those. I was not even a little hungry and my mouth was watering. Only lost one star because the guy behind the counter looked so unkempt, even by SF gritty urban standards, that it gave me a moment's pause.

Tartine is ah-mazing. ÊSo good. ÊMainly, for me anyway, it's all about the morning buns. ÊWhy do they run out? ÊI don't get it. ÊIt's such a popular item, you'd think they'd make them all day long.... but they don't. ÊWhich can lead to me being a very unhappy camper after walking for SEVERAL blocks in the RAIN, dreaming about the sweet, sweet taste of a morning bun with each cold and damp step. Ê I'm taking 1 star away because they don't "keep 'em in stock" despite obvious demand. ÊTaking another star away because they should move into a larger space. ÊThe current space is way too small. ÊEven if you are lucky enough to score a table, it kind of takes enjoyment of your food away when your chair keeps getting bumped into and people keep saying "oh, sorry, oops." ÊYou also need to be prepared to have people give you the evil eye if they deem you have lingered a moment too long after eating.

4.5, because I've never been inside. My friend brought me a berry tart and an eclair. We'd already had pizza and BiRite ice cream, so I took them home safely encased in their box. I was careful to keep them upright for over an hour while walking, on muni, and on bart. I'm about to open the door to my car when I drop the box with the goodies inside. Small scream. Cursing. Pathetic sulking all the way home. Lucky for me, everything was still delicious and only slightly mangled. That has got to be the best eclair I've ever had. Good quality, smooth chocolate on the outside that doesn't melt too quickly. A crust slightly softened by refrigeration but still dry and encasing the vanilla bean custardy creamy filling. The eclair is a good companion to the berry tart (especially smashed together), as all the berries are fresh and the custard they're sitting on top of is even more delicious than that inside the eclair. It's not the same filling but it, too, did not render the crust soggy. These two desserts are extremely well executed and definitely worth breaking any diet you're on for. If you're gonna eat sweets, do it right. These treats survived a bad fall and several days in the fridge with me picking at them. I highly recommend them and will be stopping by the next time I'm in the area. A lovely surprise for friends or just for yourself!

Not feeling too generous with stars today but Tartine's was good and I'll admit the line out the door caused us to drive to Stable Cafe and back to the line....Interesting herd effect at work here! Drove at least 2 miles around the block and alleys to find a space just across the street - no deductions for tough parking. Once in line, we needed the extra time to gaze at the menu and decide on the Muesli and Bread Pudding....The Muesli was a little too 'yogurty' for me so by adding honey it gave it the right sweetness. Next time I'll stick to anything flakey like croissants because they are GOOD. ÊBut almost every other customer had the bread pudding...so include that if you're new. Ê Sitting at a table in or out is fine for people gazing but a little challenging when the line is active. Oh, the coffee is fine...I expected a darker richer look when I pumped it from the self serve pot so I was a little suspect of the 7-11'ish thin looking coffee but it did taste better than it looked. ÊThey also have a custom coffee bar that seemed to be the default for regulars.

For all the hype, I had extremely high expectations of Tartine. ÊIt didn't exactly disappoint, but it didn't blow my mind either. ÊThe line wasn't quite out the door when we went, but it was decently long. ÊWent by at a good pace, as it gave one ample time to salivate over the baked goods in the display as well as peruse the *one* menu floating around. I had to get the morning bun. ÊI wondered if it would be much different from the Starbucks one. ÊIt looks about the same, but the orange zest does add quite a bit to the morning bun experience. ÊI wish it was slightly warm so it was softer, but morning buns are just fantastic in all ways. ÊPart croissant, part cinnamon roll...mm... my only issue with it is the top layer. ÊI found it to have a sugar crust, almost like a creme brulee. ÊIt was like eating rock candy and having sugar crystals stuck in the crevices of your teeth, eating away at the enamel. ÊBoo...but other than that, tasty! Pain au jambon gets a thumbs up. ÊThere's cheese in it, in case anyone wondered if it was just a piece of ham hidden inside a croissant. ÊVery filling though. Ham quiche is also a win. ÊThe filling is super fluffy and savory. ÊMm... Unlimited coffee refills. ÊLattes served from perfectly French chocolate bowls.

All right, I've been coming to this place for years, and I must say that overall, this is an excellent French-style bakery. ÊIt is a must-visit when you're in SF, but be warned that it is extremely expensive. The prices have gone up and I don't think the value is as good as it once was.

ÊLots of hipsters here, but also lots of "normal" folks too. Ê But what is up with the attitude of the staff? ÊSeriously, do you need a dual degree in surliness and bedhead to work here?

The line was out the door as I expected and it moved along pretty quickly. While my friend was in line I took a peek at the pastry case and the size of the cakes, tarts, crossiants Êetc were all HUGE and decadent. I highly reccomend the banana cream tart and the broiche bread pudding. Just thinking about them make my mouth water. The crust on the tart was perfectly crispy Êand not too thick and im typically not too fond of crust. Inside the cream tart were real bananas and bits of chocolate chunks filled with yummy goodness. It was absolutely delicious and my favorite out of our 3 picks. We also had the bread pudding, the very reason that lead us here. It was accompanied with fresh berries which was a perfect balance with the sweet bread pudding. Without the fruits the sweetness would probably be a lilttle overwhelming. The consistency of the bread pudding was at par. It Êwas not mushy and saturated so I was very pleased. Ê The last item we had was the Frangipane tart which was nothing amazing compared to the other 2 items I've mentioned. It reminded me of a chocolate covered donut with nuts on top. You can go ahead and pass on this one. ÊOverall, I think this was an awesome bakery worth trying. Im definately going to visit again to try the cocunut cream tart.

Three Words......Banana Cream Tart! Today was my first visit to Tartine Bakery and I have to say that their Banana Cream Tart really blew me and my friend away! ÊIt wasn't super sweet which was a good thing, and the bananas and cool cream gave it a nice contrast from the big bowls of espresso we ordered to go with it. ÊMy bowl of cafe mocha was also really good! When we got there at around 3pm, the line went out the door, but it went really fast and we still managed to snag a table.

ÊMy favorite thing here is the banana cream tart and the surprising thing with that is that I'm not even a fan of bananas but the chocolate that they use at Tartine is soooo good that it just makes this tart.

Wow! I was like a kid in a candy shop when I came in here for the first time. I read the menu over a few times, scanned the pastry case back and forth, and changed my mind about a thousand times before I could decide on a few things. Yes, I got more than one thing. I wanted to try the sandwiches while I was here, but since they were backed up, I couldn't order one. I decided on a piece of almond, poppy seed pound cake, a chocolate croissant, and a cheese gougere breakfast pastry. Don't worry, I shared with another person. Word of advice, if you want morning buns, bread, or sandwiches you've got to get there when they open. Also, you may have to wait in a fairly long line, but it moves semi fast. Definitely want to make it back to try the morning buns and sandwiches.

Okay, so I finally tried the bread. I had no idea what I was getting when I ordered the bread, so when I got the giant roundish hard shelled loaves of bread I was a little surprised. I actually went into Tartine on two different days, Wednesday (to order in advance) and Thursday (to pick up), surprisingly, no wait at all. It might have been the bad weather, or just good timing. Even if there is a line, if you order in advance for pick up, you can bypass the line and just pick up your prepaid bread. When I picked up the bread (only available after 5pm) it was still warm. At 7.25 a loaf, a little expensive but a nice treat every so often. I tried the walnut bread, and I really liked it. My mom on the other hand, didn't like it so much, too hard for her. The crust of the loaf was hard and chewing the end piece made my jaw tired. But I have no problem with that, I once ate so many baguettes that it made my jaw sore.

at tartine, it's no holds barred for even the slightest of cautionary eaters. you might as well go BIG (gastronomically) and indulge. the croissants are to die for - get the chocolate croissant if you love chocolate. the hazelnut tart has a kick that is a bit overbearing... i have pretty high sugar tolerance and it was still overwhelming. lastly i tried the banana creme tart. although i usually don't prefer anything banana flavored Êfor the most part, the dark chocolate lining along the tart is a verrrry nice surprise and blends well with this banana creme pie-wannabe. don't get intimidated if the line goes out the door. the interior is pretty small so it'll naturally expand outdoors; it goes by swiftly and you can take advantage of the time queuing to dwell on what you want since the selection is so vast inside. service sucks though. the worker was rude and seemed vexed with the THREE questions I asked regarding the banana creme tart's contents. if I'm paying $40 for the thing, i'd like to make an informed purchase. then the cashier who rung me up was too busy engaging in personal conversation of her own.

I've been hearing phenomenal things about Tartine for the longest time but never had the opportunity to check it out till now. ÊOften regarded as the best bakery in the city, you know I had to put it to the test. My buddy insisted that I try the panini with the Sopressata, Fontina cheese, broccoli rabe, and pesto, all grilled on comfort bread. ÊWe also tried the frangipane croissant as well. ÊLet me say that both were absolutely spectacular! ÊI have now officially tasted awesome, and it goes by the name of Tartine. ÊThe flavors were all extremely distinct and it was grilled together to perfection. ÊEven the pickled carrots that came with the sandwich were sensational. ÊThat croissant, it was just, wow. ÊIt was so good I even took one home with me to San Diego! ÊHonestly, it's difficult to pick a favorite because the quality and flavors here are so amazing. ÊIf I lived in the area, I'd probably come here every day. The vibe here is great and they occasionally have live music playing as well. ÊThe food isn't the cheapest around but considering the quality and flavors, it's great value. ÊThere are a couple tables outside where you can enjoy a pastry and a glass of wine with your dog, and everybody seems to have the same idea. ÊThere's usually a line here and it takes a little while to whip up the sandwich, but it's absolutely worth it. ÊThis is now officially my favorite bakery in all of San Francisco, and perhaps beyond. Food: 10/10 Service: 9/10 Price: $$ Atmosphere: 9/10

Tasted my first bread pudding here. It was good but after a few bites, it got a little too sweet that a friend and I didn't even finish the one serving. Was looking forward to Banana Cream tart but I guess they don't make it on Mondays. Morning Buns were good. That I really enjoyed, specially while they're warm. This place gets crowded so come early or if you plan to come around lunch time, make sure you're not starved or you'll pass out while waiting in line.

One of my sister and I's favorite brunch places. ÊThe pastries here are really decadent. ÊI recently found the recipe to their morning heavenly buns on the 7x7 magazine website and I'm going to be trying it out using Trader Joe's frozen croissant dough instead of from scratch...yum...http://www.7x7.com/content/food-?finds/tartines-heavenly-morning-buns-recipe. We always have really funny experiences when we're here...because the seating is so close together, you can eavesdrop on other people's conversations...we once had a guy comment on all our girl talk...it annoyed some of the girls in our group...but it made my sister and I laugh! :) ÊAnother time a lady came in with a fur coat and our friend was absent-mindedly brushing her cheek up against it because it was so soft...we teased her mercilessly for that! ÊFun times, fun times... oh, and the croissants here are incredible...the chocolate ones have whole pieces of Scharffenberger chocolate in them...

The fantastic pizza just round the corner was too packed so... Gave Tartine another try. ÊHad one of the little bread / cheese spreads with tomato.

Cute bakery on the corner that serves AMAZING pastries that are worth standing in line for however the snub that I got from one of their baristas threw me off. ÊOrdered their ham&cheese croissant, banana tart, and chocolate croissant that lived up to the hype that previous reviewers have posted. ÊTheir croissants are flaky but the good type of flaky and every bite gets better but makes me sad that its one bite more till its all gone. ÊIt was my first time there so ordering was pretty intimidating because everyone knew what they want and you were expected to know what you want because they need to keep the line moving. ÊI wanted a drink to go with my pastries so I head over to the bar and I'm waiting while the barista is having a convo with her coworkers. ÊI just voiced out that I wanted to order a chai latte and she looked at me and said "what do you mean? you ordered one or you want me to make you one, I don't get it." ÊI don't understand how you could misinterpret my request to place an order? ÊSo I said I haven't ordered anything yet and would want a chai latte, and she got frustrated with me and mentioned something about it being hard because she doesn't know who ordered and who didn't. ÊI was not having it so I just told her nevermind and just walked away. ÊLucky for them that their pastries are freaking so that their customer service can suck but still survive and bank on their good food.

Four not five stars because of the limited seating... but once you go, you'll know why the place is so crowded! I've been a few times, but the my recent trip was most fruitful (ha!) because I had the illustrious banana creme pie. Wow. The pie crust was crispy, then came a layer of solid chocolate, topped with banana filling and some kind of heavy whipped cream on top. Plus some chocolate shavings after that. I was full for what seemed like days. Well, I have been full for days anyway because it's the holidays and I'm off my normal routine... but after eating this pie, I actually turned down someone's offer of more chocolate. This is rare. Visit Tartine - you won't be sorry!

We were among a small gathering of late lunchers and were second in line when we arrived. My husband and I shared a Sandwich (which are huge and very very rich) and a side salad and a slice of the lemon meringue cake. All was over-the-top rich and amazing. Service was just as poor as my previous visit which really did disappoint Êas it was not busy. I have spent most of my life serving people and I try to be the best possible customer so when I get attitude from three different staff members in a span of five minutes it hurts. Then they lost my order again... only this time they admitted it and made a half-assed apology. How do you do that to the same customer twice? I also had to ask if the dirty dishes from the previous guest could be removed from the edge of our table as the food runner had brought us our lunch had neglected to notice there was a tower of crap there already. I really want to give these guys one more star because of the divine food but my service industry gut says no way. They need to revamp their order system and get a grip on how to treat people if they want locals coming in again and again.

Tartine has been a bakery Gilbert H. has always wanted to try, and I'm glad we were able to stop by for a quick energy boost during our Mission District exploration date :D AMBIANCE The bakery itself is very small and neat, but packed to the brim with folks! ÊPeople of all ages filled the seats, and some patrons watched like hawks in order to swoop on a vacant table. There are a few metal tables/seats outside, but be wary that it may be a bit too windy for you. ÊWe couldn't find seats inside, so we were forced to sit outside. ÊI'd say, sit at the tables furthest away from the corner of the street so you won't feel the wind from the cars rushing by. FOOD I wanted to eat EVERYTHING because it looked so delicious, but I knew my stomach would hate me later. ÊSo the bf and I decided to just share two things, and grab a mocha. ÊBe aware: the regulars know exactly what they want, so don't take too long to order!! 1) ÊCoconut Cream Tart (4"-$6.35) "Flaky pastry coated in dark chocolate with pastry cream, and lightly sweetened cream." ---I'm a "crust" girl, meaning I loooovvveee flaky crusts / pastries! ÊAnd I fell in love with this pastry the first time I laid eyes on it. ÊSlightly on the hard side, you definitely have to use a knife to cut through this bad boy, but it will be worth it. ÊThe little shavings of coconut are so scrumptious! ÊLet me just say that in the end, my plate was CLEAN. 2) ÊChocolate Eclair ($4.65) "Filled with vanilla custard, dipped in Valrhona glaze." ---The boyfriend is an eclair kind of guy, so he wanted to see what the hulabaloo was all about. ÊThe eclair was more on the cream side, which was fine by me because the taste didn't overpower my mouth (a plus!) 3) ÊMocha Latte ...Mocha in a bowl? ...That's when you know it's legit. All kidding aside, Tartine's mocha's = amazingness in a bowl. ÊSo cute, and just the right amount of sweetness. ÊWonderful to sip on during a slightly cold, autumn day :) A cute bakery in the area that everyone in the area should stop by and try. ÊYummy Mission District snack!! ÊI'm definitely coming back to try more food :D

Good things come to those who wait. I waited and Tartine delivered. I'm talkin' 'bout large, fresh, buttery croissants that tear apart with the slightest force of finger. ÊYummy gougeres (baked pastry with gruyere cheese inside) and chocolate chip cookies (note: these came with bits of nuts, and are of the thin and crunchy texture) so large that I had to save half for later. ÊDefinitely try their seasonal fruit tart... it looked strange at first, but the huckleberry's tanginess was a wonderful accompaniment with the sweet and buttery taste of the rest of the tart. ÊCombine it all with a simple house coffee (free refills!), and you'll for sure not leave disappointed. If you want something a little healthier, you can try the Muesli- but in my opinion: go big or go home! ÊDefinitely will be back to try the rest of this wonderfully gluttonous bakery! =)

If it were for food alone, 5 stars. It's unique and delicious.The hefty chunks of fantastic bread smothered in rich mustard and savory ham & cheese (Jambon Royale & Gruyere) are a perfect balance between rustic and delicate. Same with the Croque Monsieur. Fantastic pastries and cakes, of course. Tartine is typically very busy, but you get the feeling it would be kind of a clusterfrack even if it weren't. My gripe is the somewhat complex workflow involved in lining up, dealing with people dragging their bikes in, ordering food, ordering drinks possibly at a 2nd counter, finding a place to sit at communal tables and bussing your stuff after. There really isn't any direction from signage, or from the staff (who are really sweet, but seem to be on another plane most of the time). Nobody is in much of a hurry about anything, which is part of its charm, but also always makes me think: "I wonder if they're gonna get this order right?". The place just seems to work based on the fact that most of the customers are regulars who just "get it". ÊYou just kind of have to wander through and hope you're doing it right, and that those around you know what they're doing. Screw it. 5 stars. I love the place.

Yeah, it's good... but not ridiculous line/ crazy rep good. the lemon cream tart was pretty damn delicious, but i dont know about 6.95 delicious. The bread pudding was mediocre, and the mixed fruit tart was good at best. I was really excited to go this place and really wanted it to live up to its expectations, but.... that was a no go. Although the random Italian guy behind me who insisted that his guide book said the best thing to order is the jam tartine, and that we should totally share to find out if it's true. And insisted the entire remaining time I was in line that we share. That was when I decided to do take away instead of eating in. Maybe next time.

Decadent doesn't even begin to describe Tartine Bakery. This place is paradise; everything they make is so amazing! Granted, there is probably enough butter in all their baked goods to give you a heart attack, but you only live once! You gotta try all their cakes, pudding and bread. I've not had one thing there I didn't like. Most recently, my friend Dustin and I spent a rainy day here with a slice of tres leches cake and two glasses of sparkling rose (that's right they serve booze as well). PERFECTION! Of course something this good gets super busy, and they do run out of things. Nothing unmanageable but just food for thought. Tartine Bakery is simply the darling of the Mission. ~A

Having just returned from some time in the coffee-proud and pastry -rich city of Vienna, my partner and I decided to go to Tartine for a late drizzly Saturday afternoon snack. We decided to give it a whirl since, for once, the line was not half the way up Guerrero Street. Even though the line was only inside, it still moved at a snail's pace. I echo all the sentiments previously expressed about Tartine's woeful operational deficiencies: why not have more service staff and both cashiers going at all hours when the bakery is full (which is most of the day)? When it came to my turn to order, miraculously a whole new tray of bread pudding arrived. So I ordered a bowl. But the food server started to spoon into what remained in the older tray. I asked for a serving of the fresh bread pudding. Aghast! How could I ask for such a thing? I got the arctic cold stare followed by an extremely self-important "humph!" The place was jam packed, not a seat to be had. Yet when we got to the cash register 3 seats opened up at the communal table. But wouldn't you know it a group from the very back of the line grabs the seats! I calmly walked over and in a very polite tone informed them that there were people already in line waiting for the seats. Two of the women look like I just insulted their first born child while the guy gets all belligerent on me! We ask the cashier what the seating policy is, only to be told "oh, people just do what they want." I have had this kind of experience a number of times at Tartine now. Enough is enough. Sure, some of the selection is prepared wonderfully. For example, I think their almond croissants are the best in the City. A lot of other items are above average. But then there is plenty of stuff that is average at best. In short, some good finds, but nothing justifies the horrendous waits, haughty staff, bad seating, lousy staffing and operational patterns, and rude customers. If you can get in at "off hours" and get the food to go then you probably will be one lucky pasty hound! Update: the last few times I have been there the staff has been more friendly in the past. Also, I stay away from "peak" hours, so the seating and noise madness is not so noticeable.

I'm not one to wait to look for parking 3 blocks away, I'm not one to wait in a line out the door on a Saturday morning, in general I was pessimistic at the possible taste of a croissant for breakfast - but lucky I was wrong! Parking wasn't so bad in turned out and on a beautiful, sunny day in the city it was a pleasant few block walk. ÊThe small line out the door was alarming at first, as well as the intensely crowded small bakery - but in general the line was quick, the patrons friendly in a low hum and I was still questioning this supposed amazing croissant I had been promised. The counter girl and cashier were both friendly and quick with such a crowd and soon we were off with our breakfast. ÊI chose the ham croissant and Ê. . . . . oh my! ÊIt was sooo buttery, flakey, flavorful, the ham not too salty or over powering but a perfect combination! ÊI devored it and was soon sadly left with crumbs in my lap. Worth the wait, crowd and I hope to be back soon!

Frankly, I think this place is overrated. Don't get me wrong -- their sweets are delish. And I like their bread. And a friend ordered a coconut-covered passionfruit cream cake for her birthday, and that was mighty tasty. And I liked the fancy chocolate pudding from here that J. gave me for my own birthday last year. Another plus: I like seeing all the different kinds of dogs that hang around with their owners outside, on-site. But I get tired of all the brouhaha around Tartine, all of the write-ups in national publications. And, okay, I don't like their brittle version of the humble chocolate chip cookie. And the lines are ridiculous. I'm giving Tartine a backlash rating of three stars! Unfair? Perhaps. Not in keeping with my generally positive review of their food? Maybe. But sometimes gut feeling, apart from more objective evaluations, is what it's about.

Very good bakery for SF. ÊWhile I won't say Tartine's quality comes near any bakery in Europe, it hits the spot for the US and this city. ÊGreat coffee, good pain au chocolat, and filling/cheese-covered sandwiches are quite delish. The lines, staff, service, and crowd leave a lot to be desired so I will only go back if I can just take my order and get the hell out. Also, the basic croissant is not that great.

I'm a big fan of quiche so all of them taste good to me hah. The atmosphere is really cool too. I like bakeries like this where it's ok to be solo and eating by yourself.

Tartine is a great spot to have a cup of coffee and a sweet pastry. ÊMy wife and I came here and had a latte (the cups are big enough to share for two) and a banana cream chocolate tart. ÊBoth were delicious and the tart was bursting with flavor. We were lucky enough to get a table outside and enjoyed our afternoon snack people watching.

My five stars is really for their pastries. ÊThey are unbelievably great!! ÊI have tried their grill cheese sandwich, but was disappointed. ÊHowever, I am not a fan of these kind of sandwiches, so my opinion might be bias. ÊSo enough of my disclaimer, let's talk about this place. Food: Banana Cream Tart is my favorite. ÊThe crust is amazing crispy. ÊThe chocolate flakes/shavings on top gives it a nice mix on the taste. ÊThe filling has real banana (I think ^_^) and not too sweet cream. ÊI had the banana cream pie in Mission Pie, but I have to rate this entree better. ÊMorning Bun is another good pastry. ÊIt has a light sweet that I can probably eat without liquid to water down the sugar. ÊIt also was surprisingly crunchy or crispy like eating toast. ÊMost buns that I have tried are a little soggy or soft in the middle, but it wasn't the case for Tartine's Morning Bun. Ê(Maybe, I bought the right bun.) ÊCoffee/Esppresso is ok. ÊI had better coffee in Blue Bottle. ÊHowever, presentation is impressive, such that latte is served in a bowl. Ê Ambiance: Honestly, the atomsphere is not great, and I couldn't find a restroom. ÊHowever, it is categorized as a bakery, not a restaurant. ÊIf you go to most bakery, they mostly share the similar feel. ÊThe lines can be brute that goes outside of the bakery. ÊI recommend order more than one item. ÊYou should order stuff to-go. ÊProbably for dessert tonight. ÊIt would make the wait worth it. ÊHowever, I have been in worst lines such as Brenda's. Overall, given the fact this is bakery, it is one of the best bakery that I have tried in SF. ÊYou should always expect a wait (including the rain). ÊThe taste is worth the wait, but also order to-go. ÊGet a tart to-go and eat a fresh bun in the morning. ÊHappy eating...

Wonderful breakfast stop! As long as you have thirty minutes to an hour to brave the line that always extends out the door and wraps beside it. Just know it will be well worth the wait. Favorites include Double Pan au Chocolat, Buttermilk Scones, Iced Chai Latte, and Soy Lattes. I also own a copy of their bread cookbook, which is incredible. One day soon I hope to make it at 5 PM to grab a fresh loaf of the Country and Country Walnut bread that's fresh out of the oven.

Not only is Tartine on the 7x7 Big Eats list, but rumor had it that the line out the door often meant an hour-long wait. This means that what's inside must be good, right? Sadly, they ran out of the famous Morning Bun during my visit, so I didn't get to try the item everyone's been raving about. However, I loved their pecan pie... it was about as sweet as you could get without being TOO sweet, and I absolutely loved the pastry dough they used for the pie. I'd love it if they started making more pies in different flavors! I thought the lemon poppyseed cake was just OK, as it was a bit too artificially sweet for my liking and reminded me of the kind you typically find packaged in a vending machine. Tartine, please produce more Morning Buns each day! Nothing screams disappointment like arriving at Tartine to find that they're all sold out!

Is it worth the line? ÊMaybe...So I finally got to try the infamous Tartine Bakery. ÊAnd after my great experiences with Bar Tartine and waiting half an hour in line, I had high expectations! ÊDid it live up to all the hype? Ê The food did!...we had a delicious strawberry bread pudding; the quiche was tasty; the ham and cheese croissant was flaky and buttery; and the jambon and gruyere pressed sandwich, took 20 minutes, but it was melty and steaming hot when it came out. But, Tartine gets a minus star for the long line, long wait for food after you order...but definitely has cute atmosphere if it weren't so crowded on a Sat. afternoon!

Not sure why people are so obsessed with Tartine. Ê I heard so much about this place and even read about it online before I moved to this city. ÊI was very disappointed. ÊI've been there 3-4 times and after I visit each time, thinking it will be better the next time because I didn't order the right items, but no luck. First of all, I love real French pastry. ÊThere is simply nothing like it in the world. ÊIt's just one of the great creations of mankind. ÊAnd for some reason, Americans just cannot reproduce it, including Tartine. ÊThe baked goods are just Êtoo dry, often over baked and not flavorful enough. ÊThe texture is not on the mark. ÊThe croissants just don't taste like a real French Croissant - not layered, tasty and buttery enough. ÊThe cakes and bread pudding are just okay, nothing unusual. ÊThe banana cream pie is the only item I've had there that actually stood out. ÊOther than that, it's just very ordinary... just a bit better than your average bakery with a rustic French presentation/exterior. ÊI guess I just have to continue to search for that real French bakery in SF.

ÊThey also offer up my favorite Pouilly Fume (imported by Kermit Lynch, of course) by the glass. Sigh. Keep in mind space is limited --- so it's best to go solo or with a buddy to stake out a spot. ÊGreat ambiance for reading, writing and people watching. ÊOne of my preferred spots in the Mission to catch a breather. The staff can be friendly.

I finally had the chance to go to Tartine Bakery after church last Sunday. ÊI've attempted to go a couple of times, but every time I drove away because of the huge line outside. ÊHowever, this Sunday I decided to just wait it out and see. ÊI waited 30 minutes, but it is totally worth it. ÊWe had an almond croissant & a morning bun. ÊMorning bun was ok....I can live without it....but the Almond Croissant was amazing!!! AMAZING! ÊIt is the best croissant I've ever had. Ê I saw a ton of people ordering the bread putting with fruit on the top. ÊI am not a bread putting person but it looks like almost everyone there had a bowl. To all that wants to try this place... definitely go and wait! It's totally worth it. ÊI am a huge fan and definitely am going back often.

If you have a chance to head over early in the morning... their fresh croissants can not be beat. Flaky on the outside, warm and buttery on the inside. Incredible.

I've said it before and I'll say it again... it's a damned good thing that Tartine is 6 blocks away and not 2 or I'd easily weigh 300lbs. I guess I am biased in that I can walk but the lines have never bothered me, the staff has always been friendly and the pastries are phenomenal. It's a staple visit for all of my out of town guests and I have a hard time keeping them away once introduced. Once my friend and I arrived too early and sat on a bench underneath their vent hood... the smell of buttery goodness was almost too much to handle.

Went to Tartine because I love bread pudding. After reading rave reviews of Tartine's bread pudding, I knew I had to try it. The claims of giant portions is true. I got the bread pudding to go and my little box was so heavy! Unfortunately, the bread pudding was not quite tasty enough for me to relish the ginourmous slice I had been given. My problem with the bread pudding was simply that there was not enough custard and the flavor was too bland. Just kinda sweet with no real eggy-ness or apple-ness. Just a blah-ness. However, their Passion Fruit Lime Bavarian cake was really good. The passion fruit filling in the cake was so flavorful and tasty I ate out most of the middle before my SO could take more than a bite or two. :D The cake was moist and soft. The coconut shavings on the outside were a little hard and bland, but you just ignore that part. Croissants were OK. Not the best on the West Coast as claimed by that NY Times guy... but it was flaky on the outside and nice and chewy on the inside. Flavor was lightly buttery.

If you are easily seduced by cake, pastries, bread pudding, quiche, and latte in a bowl, this is your happy place. I got a cup of bread pudding, a latte, and shared a french thing that I can't name but can describe as a hunk of really divine bread toasted with fresh mozzarella and sundried tomato with a side of pickled baby carrots. The pudding was topped with caramel and appples, and just the right firmness for me. Best strategy? Go with 2 friends, and share. Don't go wiht more than 2, as seating is hard to manuever then.

My friend Max has a wise saying: "A line outside the door means the place doesn't suck." ;-) Tartine's line was long...but so worth it. Don't go when you're hungry, otherwise you'll do what I did and spend $20 on pastries -- everything looked so good! Ordered 2 morning buns and 2 tarts.

I come here religiously for breakfast when I come to visit. My idea of a perfect SF breakfast involves a croissant, large fresh squeezed orange juice and an americano. Nothing more, nothing less.

It's so quaint, the staff is uber friendly and the area is great for a nice walk to kill off some off the calories ; )

Bread is the star of the show at Tartine, for sure. The closer your item gets in bread-ness to a straight up fresh baked batard, the better. That is to say, puffs and macaroons = meh, quiche and tarts = ok, gougere and frangipane croissant = great, bread pudding and fresh baked loaves = outstanding. Definitely worth the wait if you're in the area.

Was down at Bi-Rite Creamery and walked by... Nate C.'s girlfriend needed a Tartine fix so we both walked in. ÊI could smell the deliciousness from down the street so definitely bought a couple of the small $1.50 pastries. I don't remember all 4 of the pastries I got. ÊThere where only two that were really tasty, the coconut macaroon and the oatmeal cookie. ÊBut they were delicious enough to give 4 stars for. ÊI think there was a little bit of ginger in the cookie which definitely added some depth. ÊI also love coconut so I'm a little biased on the macaroon. I think I need to go back and try some more things but for now, 4 stars for the two pastries that were delicious and cheap enough for me to try without breaking the bank, although for $1.50, I wish all 4 had been memorable.

The pastries are amazing--have you ever eaten something that is the ideal of that food item? ÊTasting it redefines that food item. ÊThink in the perfect summer peach or strawberry, a perfectly grilled steak, Êetc. ÊThat ideal is reached whenever you bite into a chocolate croissant, nibble a morning bun, or eat a spoonful of delicious of scharffenberger chocolate pudding. It loses one star because the lines are sometimes too long and the coffee is overpriced. ÊA certain store across the street has better and cheaper coffee. ÊThe trick is to go with friends and have one person stand in line the coffee place, one person stand in line at Tartine, and one person to snag an outside table. ÊThen once objectives are completed, meet at the outside table and people watch. Must eat chocolate croissant, must eat chocolate croissant, drool....

There are so many reviews of this place it's going to be difficult-to-impossible to say anything that hasn't already been said, and I'm not about to read close to 300 reviews to sort that out. So at the risk of being redundant... Of course Tartine makes lots of really wonderful, beautiful things both sweet and savory. There's no denying it. But as other reviewers have aptly pointed out, the lines are long (often even at 'off' times), and a place to sit can be super hard to come by (leaving you standing there dumbly, trying to juggle a plate, a bowl and a cup of coffee). The employees are also prone to acting like they're doing you a really big favor by deigning to take your hard-earned money or put your order in a box/bag/on a plate, which is a little bit tiresome (although I'm sure the endless stream of customers is tiresome to them too...). But now, at the risk of sounding like the Antichrist, I'm going to say this: there's too much chocolate in the pain au chocolat. I don't care if it's Scharffen Berger -- there's just too much of it! The balance of pastry and chocolate goo is...well...not balanced. This is my opinion, I realize, but I do have some street cred in that I lived in France for four years and have eaten a lot of chocolate croissants in a lot of different places. And finally, I like their quiches --the egg part-- but the pastry is poopy. It's kinda soggy and tough and often tastes slightly burned. I want light and flaky and buttery! (I refer you to my byline, or headline, or whatever it's called. 'nough said.) Aside from all that, I truly do like Tartine and regularly subject myself to the haughty treatment of the cashiers in exchange for a little piece of edible heaven...like a lemon tart, or an open face croque-monsieur.

So, why does Tartine need another review? ÊWhy am I compelled to bang my keyboard on a place that you already know is good? Because we did something really geeky and cheesy on the surfance but turned out to be incredibly fun. ÊWe hosted a "Croissant-Off." ÊIt all started with a Montague-Capulet Ê"I am better than YOU" non-sensical feud on whose almond croissant was better - Tartine or La Boulange? [for those of you rolling your eyes right now because you know the answer already, do continue to read on. Êpromise it'll be fun] So one Sunday, many baked goods were purchased from Tartine and La Boulange - almond croissants, plain croissants, pain au chocalate, various specialty ones from L.B., and of course the Ham&Cheese. We geeked out - we did a whole scoring card thing. ÊWe decided the categories (appearance and taste, with taste counted double). ÊWe scored, we rated, we tallied, we try to figure out who had similarity taste in. I'll spare you all the gory details, but we found that once and for all, the almond croissant ("Frangipane") at Tartine simply demonlished the one from L.B. ÊEveryone around the table, including the Capulets who swore by L.B. concurred. ÊHowever, the pain croissant came in just the opposite - L.B. 's was almost perfect. ÊLight, just crunchy on the outside, moist/flaky inside. ÊThe one from Tartine was a little too crispy (it wasn't too baked, I think Tartine just like to make theirs crispier). One of the funnest brunch we've hosted - and the caloric count was not nearly as bad as we thought. ÊWe basically ended up each eating about 1.5 pastry.

I really don't think ANY other bakery in the Bay Area compares to Tartine in terms of quality. I think Dottie's is comparable in terms of its pastries, but they don't sell them to go.

I went here with some friends 4th of July weekend. It was hella busy but they moved the line pretty fast. I was super excited to eat here but had no idea i was gonna love it so much. I ordered the Croque Monsieur (an open face sandwich), and my friends ordered the mozzarella & tapenade sandwich, the spicy turkey sandwich and one other one i cant remember. First off, the four of us could have shared 2 sandwiches. They were ridiculously huge, and quit honestly the best I have ever tasted. I also had a fruit tart which was good.

I was very, very excited to try Tartine, as my friends have been hyping it up now for months. ÊI have the biggest sweet tooth, and a passion for pastry. ÊBut I wasn't so impressed when I finally tried it. I went with my cousin, and we ordered the chocolate hazelnut tart and the bread pudding. ÊI had ordered a double shot of espresso to balance the sweetness of the hazelnut tart, as it usually compliments it well. ÊI thought that the actual tart was nice as it was flaky and had great consistency. ÊThe chocolate hazelnut filling was rather mainstream and lackluster, however. ÊNutella would have tasted better and been less preparation, I'm sure. I was rather disappointed with the bread pudding, since it was my friend's favorite treat. ÊThe consistency was rather soft, and it had a strange tartness to it. ÊIt just doesn't come close to the bread pudding you get in the South, and maybe because of that frame of reference I didn't have as good an experience. ÊMaybe next time I'll bring in some rum to drench it in...maybe it would make me a little happier to eat it. The one saving grace was the espresso I had. ÊIt tasted like piss, but it kept me up all night. That is a rare feat to achieve given this caffeine tolerant twenty six year old that started chugging espressos since my first days at Lowell High School in 1995. ÊMaybe next time a sweeter pastry would help me get the buzz while masking the taste.

I love Tartine! I heard about the morning buns from a friend and could not wait to try them! The line was far out the shop on a sunday morning around 9 am... I hate waiting but this is a wait I will never regret and will wait again if it means more morning buns :) Waiting in line looking at all the treats left me with a watery mouth and eyes bigger than my stomach :) I finally got to the front cashier and ordered a banana cream tart, morning bun, chocolate croissant, and a ham croque madame. I did not eat all this alone just FYI haha I gladly shared :) the morning bun was sooo delicious my favorite bite was the gooey center yummmmmm!!! Can they overnight these amazing buns to Hawaii??? please!!!!! OH and one more thing, seating is a nightmare here. Beware of seat stealers!

During my short stay in SF I ended up going here twice, yea I'm pretty surprised too. ÊWaiting in line is almost a treat, makes you reconsider every food choice you thought you decided on. Ê The part I don't like is glaring at people trying to establish who's place you are going to take. ÊThe first time I was able to easily squeeze into seat right after getting my food but the second time I actually had to ask someone if I could have their table after there were done. ÊTranslation: "Come on seriously, get the hell out, you have been finished for some time". ÊThe dude gave me the "you're an ass look" while the chick agreed it was time to go. The grilled sandwiches are surprisingly large. ÊThe coffee is self service as is busing your own table. ÊNothing attracts a crowd like a crowd... the bread pudding, this helps a lot... simply delicious.

My brother suggested we go to Tartine after dinner for some proper dessert. ÊThere was a small line which we made it through but it was just constant throughout the night. ÊThe place was packed so there was some hovering about. ÊWe managed to score the small wooden ledge by the front window. Lemon Bar - the perfect balance of sweet and tart is what I look for in a lemon bar and Tartine delivered. ÊI couldn't get enough as everyone wanted a piece. ÊThe winner of the night. Devil's Food Cake - moist cake with velvety layers of ganache. ÊThe only thing I was missing was a tall glass of ice cold milk. Lemon Almond Pound Cake - another great cake especially with the touch of lemon. ÊThis one is good but the other two are a step ahead. After taking a look at the other reviews I feel I need a return visit to try the breakfast pastries and maybe a sandwich to give this place a full review. Ê4 stars for now.

I mean, the other 2,000 reviews are correct - they make amazing things. Ê My recommendations: the bread pudding is a relatively inexpensive bowl of amazing - get a large, and eat it while lounging in Delores Park. Ê The hot sandwiches are incredible, but (And?) terrible for you. ÊDon't assume that they don't do savory - they do it well. The 5th star is missing because I think the hype and line contributes to a bit of a price premium over other great / amazing bakeries - the food on it's own is clearly 5 stars.

Tartine's line can be long every day. There's not much way to avoid it. The heavy butter croissant is a classic, and the hot chocolate is creamy (great for winter). An artistic trendy place and a neighborhood favorite for breakfast. Very good french bakery with its own twist. Expensive. The cookies are thin, dry and crunch. Not much space inside, not much tranquility because if the long lines, and outside seatings are occupied forever. Good for quick stop, individuals and sometimes couples. But not groups

Friends swear by this place, and from the 514 reviews it seems that Yelpers do too. But the number of times I've been here I haven't found myself that enthused by the pastries. Maybe I'm ordering wrong? I've tried the Morning bun, the tarts, the pudding, etc. etc. and I still don't see why everyone loves this place. The prices, the limited sitting, and the ridiculously long line don't seem worth the wait. If you're not from the Mission or a nearby neighborhood I'd opt for your local bakery.

I'm not a huge bakery guy, so take this with a grain of salt (which I prefer, actually). Delightfully, I was brought there for my birthday and ordered a devil's food cake slice AND a banana creme torte thing and found a seat at one of the communal near-picnic tables. I have to say, these pastries were everything I expected: rich, large, carefully made, and delicious. The hardest thing to do was decide on something to order. Did I mention that I went there on my birthday? I didn't experience a line at all; in fact, I walked in and they asked me what I wanted immediately. So, 10-10:30am on a Tuesday is a good time to go, apparently.

The best croissant I've had in America was made here. (FYI- I've had croissants in France, Belgium, and Switzerland). And actually, the Tartine croissant is better than those I've eaten in Switzerland. I'd go to this bakery more often if it were less crowded. Or if the people in line were pre-caffinated, instead of the bitchy 'tude due to lack of latte in one's bloodstream. People are much more pleasant after one sip of coffee or one bite of sweet. If only world peace were that easy....

I had given up on ever getting pastries from Tartine. ÊHappen to be in the neighborhood, parking in front and I was good-to-go. Ê Tartine's morning buns are my new addiction - I become completely obsessed to the point of "must have" on a weekly basis. ÊSo this will become a Êfirst stop for me as I head out on errands. Ê I need, I want to try everything. . . The man in front of me purchased a Chocolate Bavarion Cake for his wife (her favorite) and it looked amazing.

Tre Croissant! If I could be a pastry or maybe just use one as a blanket it would a Tartine Croissant. SO Amazing. Joseph Sofaer thanks for the recommendation. This croissant is just many layers of sweet butter bliss. With its flaky crust of an outer shell, and sweet soft insides you'll want to grab one to go so you have something to look forward to a little later. Totally worth the extra set of 25 crunches.

I was informed of their greatness after several months of living in San Francisco. Ê It also received an extra star for being within 20 minutes walking distance from my apartment. Ê I was also forewarned by their long lines. Ê On my first try, Êmy bff was coming by to take me to Napa to shop at the outlets. ÊSince I had an hour to burn, I drove to Tartine to check out their pastries. Ê I ordered the Morning Bun and Double Au Pain Chocolat. Ê ÊMy friend chose the Double Au Pain Chocolat. Ê She said it was very flaky and finished it within 10 minutes. Ê This thing was huge too! Ê I was left with the Morning Bun but am so grateful to have been given this choice. Ê I thought I had tasted wonderful pastries before, however this was unlike any other. Ê The outer layer of the bun was crunchy due to the orange zest syrup or layer of sugar and the inner layers were chewy and soft. Ê ÊSo yummy! Second try, it was my nephew's 1st birthday and my brother called me last minute to pick up a birthday cake. Ê Fortunately for him I was still at the apartment and about to leave for their house in Dublin. Ê I immediately knew where to go. Ê I waited in line for 15 mins at least. Ê I couldn't decide between the Chocolate Souffle Cake or the Passion Fruit Lime Bavarian. ÊI ended up ordering both and knew that my family would be happy with either. Ê ÊI was almost floored when my aunts fought over who was going to take home the last slice of the Passion Fruit Lime Bavarian. ÊThey loved the lightness and exotic taste of the cake. Ê They also enjoyed the fresh coconut shavings that covered the cake like fresh sheet of powdered snow on a hill. Ê ÊThey said the Chocolate Souffle was good since it was very rich and you don't need a huge slice to feel satisfied. Ê I have since picked up Morning Buns to share with my co-workers on Christmas Eve. Ê The admin enjoyed it so much that she did not say one word or allowed anyone to bother her as she finished it off. Ê My French CIO said it was tasted like Brioche. Ê I can see what he means now. Ê My co workers also commented, Êthank God the bakery is only in SF, otherwise they'll be stopping by daily and eventually blame me for their weight gain. Ê Tartine Bakery is like a rare gemstone that you take out to wear on special occasions or when you feel like a star.

I've heard my brother talk about this bakery and I've always wondered if it was that great. Ê Since we were in the city on Monday, my bff craved their pressed sandwiches, so lunch at Tartine! ÊThere is always a line out the door. ÊThe line to get the pastry and order the sandwich wasn't bad but the wait for the sandwich was BAD. ÊWe waited about 30mins for 2 pressed sandwiches and that was just crazy! ÊI've never waited that long just for a sandwich. ÊI said to my bf, "this better be a BOMB-a$$ sandwich for us to be waiting this long!" Ê We ordered 2 sandwich for the 3 of us. Ê(Prosciutto & Provolone; Sopressata, Fontina, Brocoli Rabe Pesto) The sandwiches come in huge 3pc portions so it was plenty. OH YUMMMY! ÊThese sandwiches are the BOMB. ÊI don't know how I can explain the yummy goodness of the bread. ÊThe bread is chewy yet doughy yet crispy. Ê WOW! I can probably eat just the bread itself!!! ÊNOTE: ÊThe sandwiches are heavy so it won't be a "light" lunch. Ê Of course I had to get myself a pastry since Tartine is KNOWN for their pastries. ÊI picked up an order of the small lemon tart ($6). ÊThe tart was great! ÊIt had JUST enough zest and sweetness. Ê I'll definitely come back again for their pastries!

I got up at the crack of dawn (7 am for the "live free, live unemployed") and headed over to Tartine in the hopes of beating the heinous line that forms in the morning. ÊLuckily, if you get there before 9 chances are you will not need a wristband for CarbFest and I got in and out rather quickly. ÊThe staff is very helpful suggesting options that really did fulfill what i was looking for. ÊI got the Gruyere cheese puff pastry (sorry I forgot the Frenchie phrase for it, Êbut it is located by the quiches) and it was excellent. ÊThey lose points for playing a depressing medley of Morrissey . ÊDo you guys sell handguns too?

Not bad but definitely did not live up to the hype. Usually, a long line is a good indication that a place must be on to something if people are willing to wait a long time for some pastries that can be bought at any other bakery. However, I think this is one of those instances where the line tricked me! I ordered the apple crisp and my gf got the eclair. The apple crisp was a little on the mushy side while the apples were incredibly sour, as in Extreme Sour Warheads kinda sour. As for the eclair, I thought it was generally good. The cream was smooth and tasty but the chocolate was a bit on the rich side. We also got a latte, which was decent. For those of you driving here, be warned that parking can be a little tricky on the weekends since the popular Bi-Rite Creamery is just down the street.

i LOVE TARTINE. I come here all the time especially when I have the time to leisurely sit and chat. Whenever I come here I would most often get the: 1. Passion Fruit Lime Bavarian: I love passion fruit and anything with passion fruit. It's a hit or miss for some. Sometimes its deliciously moist and sometimes i've had it where the cake was dry. But you must try! 2. Banana Cream Tart: Delicious! caramel, chocolate, flaky crust, bananas and whip cream. I always get this 3. Bread Pudding: Always so tasty, not heavy and i love the seasonal fruit 4. Ham quiche: Light and very flavorful. It's to balance my sweet meal 5. Ham & cheese croisant: Flaky, buttery and oh soooooo good! Others i've had were the morning bun, lemon tart, chocolate ganache cake, and some cookies. I didn't like these as much as my favorite items. Place is small, there's always a line out the door but it moves fast. It's hard getting a table but if you wait around you can catch one or just pack it up and walk to Mission Dolores Park and have a picnic. It's beautiful up there especially if you walk to the Top left corner of the park, there's an awesome view of the city.

TARTINE BAKERY is slipping! Had lunch with Mom today at Tartine Bakery. We both ordered the Niman Ranch Pastrami Sandwich w/gouda, horseradish, & dijon mustard on sourdough. $10.75 I have a new name for it: HORSERADISH - DIJON MUSTARD Sandwich which includes garnishes of bread, pastrami, and cheese. First Mistake: ÊTrusting that someone in the Tartine Kitchen would actually taste the sandwich (and tweek ingredients as needed) before putting it on the menu. The combination of dijon mustard and horseradish, and the generous quantity spread on the bread, completely over-powered the sandwich. Both Mom and I starting coughing from the burn. I'm not exaggerating - napkins covering our mouths as were gasping for air, coughing, and tears rolling down our faces. It was like someone had an open bottle of ammonia under our nose and asked us to inhale, deeply. THAT's what it was like eating this Pastrami sandwich today. The sandwich was inedible. And the sad part is, the pastrami and cheese were actually in the sandwich, and not a lot of meat or cheese, mind. ÊYou couldn't taste either. I paid $21.50 for two sandwiches where you couldn't taste the pastrami or the gouda. I even opened the sandwich to make sure gouda was in there. It was. ÊWorst of all, you couldn't taste - much less enjoy - the delicious sourdough bread. The sandwich was ruined by the horseradish and dijon mustard. WHY doesn't anyone in the kitchen taste the food before it's put on the menu?? ÊIf the kitchen did sample this sandwich and approve it, then Tartine Bakery has lowered its standards considerably. Adding insult to injury, the gal at the register advised that it would take 15-20 minutes before the sandwiches would be ready ... but the bakery was half empty. ÊPeople were eating; they had been served, except for our table and one other. How could grilling two sandwiches take that long? Ê25 minutes later, the sandwiches were served. While waiting for lunch, I bought a couple Mexican cookies, two shortbread cookies, and two small chocolate ganache desserts. The Mexican cookies were good, not amazing. The shortbread cookies weren't crumbly. They were dense like pound cake and very plain; needed sugar. The chocolate ganache desserts were okay. Moist cake, dark chocolate - but just okay. Not the "Wow!" we had anticipated. I'll end with a final observation: ÊThe tables were sticky dirty! Staff were not cleaning up after people finished. Several of moms & dads had a toddler sitting / walking / laying on the tables (yes, shoes/sandals on the table, too). ÊStaff couldn't be bothered to wipe any of the tables down before new patrons arrived. It was a really bad experience today! ÊAnd I was embarassed having told my mom what an amazing place this is and how great the food/desserts are.

I'm a pain au chocolat kind of guy, but since lots of people rave about the Morning Bun, I had to give it a go. Sooo delicious -- flaky layers of pastry with drizzles of light sticky drizzles of cinnamon and sugar. With a nice cup of coffee and a little time to drift and people watch, it's a wonderful way to start the morning. I have also tried the banana cream tart here. Unbelievable!! The banana custard is lovely, but it's the surprise at the bottom of chocolate and caramel that takes me into dessert ecstasy. Oh... my... gawd...

I have a HUGE problem with cafes and restaurants were the service is slow, the staff rude, and the food terrible. ÊTartine managed to hit all of those categories. My girlfriend asked me to take her here for coffee, and while I'm a sucker when it comes to taking her out for coffee, I have little patience for bad service. I dont' know what it is about some restaurants, but it's almost as if the wait staff act as if you should be grateful that you are able to be served by them. ÊCan I just say inappropriate? Also the sandwhiches are TERRIBLE. ÊA panini where the bread has been soaked in butter instead of lightly brushed with olive oil? ÊI couldn't finish the overpriced thing, and tried to pass off the rest of it to my girlfriend (she was having none of it). ÊThe coffee was also burnt and tasted like it had been sitting around for quite sometime (still better than starbucks, although here a large is a mere 12ozs.

Again, so very tasty. This time, I got an eclair and a lemon tart. My boyfriend preferred the tart, and I preferred the eclair, but both were so delicious. Biting into the eclair was like biting into heaven, a very delicious, vanilla cream filled heaven. The cream that filled that eclair will haunt my fantasies. The lemon tart was a very well-balanced dessert. The almost savory whipped cream mellowing out the tartness of the lemon filling, and the crust provided some texture in an otherwise texture-less dish. Coffee was terrible though. It tasted burnt. Next time I come here, I'm definitely skipping on the coffee. Some side notes: -Tartine is incredibly popular and so it'll get crowded. However, if you go at less peak times, the service is faster. I went today at around 3 PM (thereby avoiding the brunch crowd), and I got my desserts quickly. I was even able to find a table inside to sit at! -The desserts are expensive, but worth it if you're willing to splurge. If possible, try to find someone to go with so that you can split desserts and not spend so much (although I found it was very hard to share the eclair, haha!).

Wow! Now I see what all the fuss is about. This place always has a long line stretching out the door, and it's worth every minute of waiting. The cakes are quite amazing. It is absolute torture when you reach the part of the line where they're on display behind the glass of the counter. These are *really* tasty cakes with great presentation. The sandwiches are just ok, which is a shame, but I won't let that hurt the review. Both of ours had way too much cheese on them, and the portion size was too large to also have a cake, and being a heated sandwich wasn't appropriate to box up and eat later. I think I may have had the best mocha I've ever had in the US. I could see her making it: milk poured in carefully and slowly, mixing. She asked if I wanted whipped cream on top. "Why not?" I say, expecting to see her grab a can. No, instead she puts two spoonfuls of thick, proper whipped cream on top. It looked like a work of art and tasted incredible. If you're ever in the neighborhood, don't get put off by the line. There's a reason people are willing to wait that long.

After not leaving fully satisfied the last time I came to Tartine, I must say now that I am a definite Tartine lover, like the rest of San Francisco is. Came back here last October with my mother and had to battle the line and customers to find seats. I swear it is like going into battle trying to get a seat in Tartine! lol. Anyways, we ordered the Banana bread, which was Êdense, moist enough and delicious! Couldn't forget the morning bun, frangipane croissant, and double pain au chocolate. This time I knew not to get the bread pudding and am glad because I came for the right stuff this time! We finished every single one of those breads and pastries! All were fresh, delicious, sweet and filling. I'll be back for the Country bread... that is if I can get my hands on some when they come out, fresh and hot from the oven at 5 pm. I have a feeling this time it will be more than a battle to fight for those.

My mother is an absolute Francophile. So when she was in town last week for a visit Tartine was at the top of her "to do" list. (Apparently, they've heard of it as far away as Michigan.) We stopped in on a Tuesday afternoon well after lunch hour and this tiny boulangerie was standing-room-only. Tartine lacks the ambiance of another one of our favorite lunch places, The Butler and Chef, however the Croque Monsieur sandwich I had was belly-achingly good. Beware to the lactose intolerant!

Oh yes, the famous Tartine bakery. ÊDo brace yourself, you will be paying $10+ for a sandwich and $4 for a chocolate croissant. ÊKiss your work lunches goodbye and save for a nice weekend visit here. ÊThe ingredients are top-notch (organic and local), so their inflated price is a function of their quality. Ê A had the sopressata (dried salami) and pesto pressed sandwich. ÊNow, we've had pressed sandwiches before, but this sandwich was nothing short of spectacular. ÊIt was as if an angel sat on the country bread and seasoned it with salt and butter crack. ÊIt did take 20 minutes for us to get our meal, but it was worth it. K had the prosciutto and provolone pressed sandwich. ÊIt tasted like ham 'n cheese from heaven. ÊThe cheese was melted perfectly and the prosciutto was perfect: not too dry, not too greasy. Ê The only downside to Tartine, as others have noted, is the wait and parking. ÊYou can NEVER find parking in the Mission and if you do, you'll worry about it getting jacked. ÊBut this place is that good. ÊIt's worth the risk. ÊSo remember to wipe down your GPS suction-cup windshield mark and take all valuable belongings with you. ÊThese will be the best $10 sandwiches you'll ever eat. Ê I guess #63 from that infamous blog "Stuff White People Like" is true-- they sure to love dem expensive sandwiches. Ê http://stuffwhitepeoplelÉ Thanks for sharing your taste with us Asians.

I had such high expectations... too high - THANK A LOT YELPERS :oT I ventured off to our usual morning get together with Jeff. He's my person - like in Grey's Anatomy... It was for our usual debrief on our lives, his girlfriend, and other important factors in our lives. First, there was limited parking... then there was a line (which is usually a great thing) and then, there wasn't really any seating. ÊI had to use my super Asian traits to hover over people who looked like they were ready to depart and start their day. The coffee, excellent! ÊI *heart* Mr. Espresso's coffee. ÊWe had 2 quiches (one ham, one... something else) and 3 pastries (overkill if you ask me) - croissant, chocolate croissant, and some spiced/herbed/cheese fluffy thing. The quiche was a little under and over done. The crust was so overdone and the egg so not, it made for a weird combination. ÊThe chocolate croissant and the spicy airy thing were my favorites, but still - not as great as I had hoped. Ê The line never stopped. It was super long the entire time we were there, and almost doubled by the time we were leaving (an hour later). I wouldn't drive all the way across town to eat there, but I would come back and buy their cakes for a special occasion.

Hmmmm, nothing like a decent cup of coffee and a morning bun...shared with many, packed into a small space, juggling their pastries and coffee cups, jostling for a table or space to stand. The pastries that we tried were superb, the almond croissant and morning buns were exceptional. The place was packed. I don't mind a short wait in line but once you get inside it's like a sardine can. Have to give the staff five stars, they were unruffled and very nice in the midst of morning chaos. If I was in the area I'd grab something to go, but still prefer Bakesale Betty's in Oakland for my morning sweets.

Pro - I can walk there. Con - I can walk there. ÊGrrr... Tartine is another one of those reasons why I'll never be a six-minute miler. ÊBecause holy Jesus, everything there is insanely delicious, and it's all I can do to limit myself to one trip a week. ÊThe line can be long (especially on the weekend), which only makes things worse, because you have all that time to gaze at the display case, thinking of more and more things you want to eat for "breakfast." ÊBy which I mean desert, 16 hours or so after the fact. I usually just grab a croissant, either plain or filled with ham & cheese. ÊThis, I can at least argue is a somewhat functional breakfast, even though it's mostly butter. ÊAs I've said to people before, unless you've actually been to France, you haven't had a real croissant until you've had one from Tartine. ÊOther things that regularly tempt me include the bread pudding, the fruit tarts, and the quiche, all of which could pass as centerfolds in some sort of food porn publication. ÊI've also eaten lunch there a couple of times - they have really great sandwiches with high-quality breads & meat (the turkey is my favorite), but again, beware the copious amount of (delicious) butter. ÊThe open-faced sandwiches (in the display case) are also phenomenal (but extremely filling). ÊI had a mocha there once, which was fine, but not amazing - generally I stick to the food.

I SCORED LAST NIGHT AND BOY WAS IT THE BEST! I was on my way home and it happened just like that! What grabbed my attention first was the amazing aroma coming from my latest conquest. I couldn't stop fondling, it was so big and fun to squeeze and warm and beautiful. I couldn't keep my mouth off it on my way home. Wow it is a rare happening when you score like this! You too can score like me. Just make it to Tartine Bakery soon after 5:00pm on Wed to Sunday. I was there at 5:30pm and seriously had one of the last loafs. It was a sesame loaf and was still hot. I was taring piece after piece on my walk over Dolores to Noe Valley. I am surprised that there was anything left by the time I arrived home. I actually ended up cutting it in half because it is so big and wanted to freeze it for next week in case I can't get back. Rumor has it this is the best bread for French Toast. Do yourself a favor and get some. This should be in the book "1001 one things you must taste before you die".

OVERRATED. Maybe I hyped myself up too much and had really high expectations, but then again the 3 other people that were with me on this eating adventure thought Tartine was a let down as well...but maybe we ordered the wrong things? Definitely not worth waiting in line for...if you are craving something sweet its more worth it to walk a block down and wait in line for Bi-Rite Creamery if you ask me. I wasn't in the mood for anything super sweet, so it was a total let down when the woman told me they had no more croissants...so in a rushed decision I ordered the bread pudding and a cappuccino. ÊFirst off, the bread pudding was not even warm! it was room temperature, disgusting! and to my dislike it was really wet, mushy and custardy...I like bread pudding on the dry side (more like a crumble consistency, which is probably not how its supposed to be made, but everyone has different tastes) The cappuccino was nothing exciting either. Ê My other friends got some kind of almond paste/berry tart, bread pudding, chai latte, and lemon tart. ÊOriginally my friend that ordered the bread pudding as well wanted to get the Banana Cream Tart, but of course, they didn't have any. Of the tarts, the lemon tart was decent, but nothing I would go back for.

There are few words that can describe such divine pastry crafting. I could rave about this little hot spot for hours. I'll save you the time and just recommend you leave now to get in line because it will wind around the corner. Please keep waiting. You cannot go wrong when you order.

We went here last night around 7pm, before catching Wicked.The place was hard to find (no signage and dark) but luckily there were no line. I heard so much about Tartine from the yelp grapevine and it's been on my bookmark to try for a while. So I was looking forward to trying Tartine. I'm dissapointed. It wasn't all that I thought it would be. We ordered the cup size Bread Pudding ($3) and the smoked ham Croque Monsieur ($9.25). They were OKAY. I've had better bread pudding with better texture. It might be because we got the last piece so it was just everything that was left in the pan. And I've never had croque monsieur before but I think $9.25 for a slice of bread with ham & cheese on top was a weeeeeeee expensive! Not coming back.

Whenever I go to SF, I try to make it a point to come here, around 5pm, when the bread comes out of the ovens. ÊYou can order just a half loaf, which is more than enough for a few days. ÊIt's so fresh it's steaming, literally. ÊCountry walnut is our favorite. Also of note: chocolate hazelnut tart is absolutely delicious, the best pastry we've tasted, with their frangipane pastry a close second. Space is crowded, but stop by, grab some bread and pastries, go down the street to bi-rite, get some cheese, and chill out with a picnic at Dolores Park (and maybe get some bi-rite ice cream while you're at it!).

Wandered over to Tartine after we were told it would be an hour wait to be seated at Delfina. Sadly, there was already a sign posted on the window saying they had sold out of bread. And all bready, pastry related items. SAD! There were a few tarts left, along with slices of cake and a few savory items. Since we were already there, I decided to try the quiche. It was a fairly generous slice, but I think a fairer price would've been ~$3.50 rather than $4.75. That's just being nitpicky I suppose. The quiche had a nice, flaky crust, and the silky smooth egg custard part was deliciously herby. For now, 3 stars... until I get a chance to try their fresh baked bread and pastries!

So, we felt like fools outside, pacing around trying to figure out if the corner cafe (where is the sign?) is Tartine. No need to suspect; if it's crowded and loud, it's Tartine. Tried the bread pudding and some kind of chocolate cake. Tasted pretty great. (The bread pudding, though, I would've hoped they make more frequent and smaller batches, because I got maybe the 2nd to last scoop, and it doesn't look as great as it would've if it were fresher. Besides, it is such a popular item).

Love the cakes, sweet and savory pastries here! Highly recommend the gruyere croissant and almond croissant. They are both soft, moist, and flavorful. I was pleasantly surprised by how good their almond (frangipane) one is.

If it wasn't for the consistently yummy fare, I would not exercise the patience required to wait in the slow as molasses line to order.

This place gets so crazy crowded! The line moves fast though, and you really don't have time for indecision. People come and go quickly too, so while you're waiting in line and the tables seem overly full, soon, the tables will open up for you right as you hit the front of the line. My friend and I tried the devil's chocolate cake, the pumpkin tea cake, and the chocolate tea cake. The devil's chocolate cake was so moist, decadent, and gooey. The pumpkin tea cake was also moist, with a nice top, and a hint of pumpkin without being overwhelming. The chocolate tea cake was also a hit, moist, rich, and joyful! I want to come back and try the savory foods such as a quiche or the croque monsieur, everything on the menu looked great, and judging from the crowds and the way everyone ate everything up, you can't go wrong!

You know when you go into something knowing that you have unreasonably high expectations because of all I hype around it? Well that's how I went into Tartine. And, I can honestly say, it lives up to its reputation. First, we had the Coconut Cream Tart. Now..I'm not even a big fan of coconut desserts..or cream, but this tart was unbelievably decadent and delicious. As a warning, split it amongst at least 2 or 3 people, it's very rich but well worth trying. We also had the Chocolate Hazelnut Tart, that was good but not phenomenal. We then had the bread pudding..delicious. Definitely worth a taste (btw if you're fans of bread pudding, District in Soma has a surprisingly good one.) The negatives are that parking is very difficult so take a deep breath before driving over. And don't go on Sunday cause they you have to compete for parking with local church-goers. The line looks long but moves fast so don't let that deter you. Oh..and the beers are great, definitely worth trying. Lastly, for the Croque Monsieur lovers out there, I didn't try the one here but if you're looking for a great Croque Monsieur or Croque Madame, try Grand Cafe on Geary. It's the best I've ever had in SF. Go to Tartine on a sunny, lazy saturday. It'll be a great addition to your day.

ÊTheir open-faced sandwich was one of my favorites, made from their fresh-baked bread. The banana cream tart - creamy and not too sweet with a flaky crust, it's inside coated with chocolate.

It's no secret that Tartine is one of those stops you have to make when in San Francisco {and apparently before you die}. While in town this past weekend, I had to stop and get my favorite croissant of all time...Tartine's frangipane {aka almond} croissant. For me, it's the best croissant ever. The morning buns and almond rochers, as well as the eclairs were out of this world. Everything seems so lovingly made...and the heaps of butter don't hurt either. Final thoughts...

If anyone wanted me to list my favorite bakeries and patisseries of all time, I would say hmmm...La Doree, Pierre Herme, Paris Baguette, Cake House, Bouchon, all Japanese bakeries in Japan, a bakery in Copenhagen with the best cinnamon rolls (can't remember the name) and Tartine in SF. ÊSeriously! ÊLa Doree and Pierre Herme were uttered in the same sentence! ÊThere is something wonderful and distinctly American about Tartine. ÊThe quality and execution of their baked goods is superb. ÊThere is great attention to detail, for example, the morning bun, which is their cinnamon roll, has a fresh orange or lemon zest taste throughout, which is a great complement to the cinnamon and nutmeg. The baked goods are quite large, which is the reasoning behind my "American" comment. Ê My other faves: the gougere, which is like an asiago popover and very light and fluffy, it is probably my most favorite baked good there, the regular croissant, the bread pudding, and the spicy turkey and pesto panini. ÊMake sure you have enough time to eat here because you will most likely have to wait in line, esp on a weekend, and then wait for a table, unless you are efficient and have friends hold the table while you wait in line.

After reading about this place in SF Chronicle, my wife and I decided to bus on over and try it out. We split a banana cream tart which was amazing! The cream was light, and the bananas flavorful but not mushy. My wife wasn't too keen about the flaky crust since it was hard to cut without a knife; she preferred a graham crust. I thought it was great, being a chocolate-lined pastry shell! Pros: - lotsa variety - fresh! - Fast and efficient. Despite long lines, the wait seemed short. - Probably the nicest, cleanest bathroom I've ever seen in a bakery. Hardwood wainscoting and a fresh orchid? It's a sure sign of how clean the kitchen'll be. Cons: - Small table spaces, but that's what happens when the place is so gosh darn crowded. - Did I mention the crowds on a Friday morning?

ÊTo sit here and write "oh tartine is the bomb, the bread pudding is to die for and pretty much everything they put their hands to is like a revelation from god" is sort of akin to reading shakespeare and saying "jeez that's like a really great piece of english writing". which is to say, Tartine makes really excellent bread pudding, and i dare say that nearly everything they put their hands to is like a revelation from god.

Sorry Tartine, you just lost another star for yet another passable performance -- a far-too-rich morning bun. All butter, no finesse. Good ingredients and fresh baking are delicious, but require no skill. May-06 update --- Hmm, I should just cut-and-paste my Pizzeria Delfina review (perhaps because I visited the same night?) An excellent experience but couldn't possibly exceed the hype. I had a brownie, of course, which was as expected and could not compare with Miette. Also tried a slice of Pumpkin Tea Cake, which was excellent (quality taste & ingredients), but nothing exceptional. Perhaps my next experience will be better when I'm not trying to block out an insult-to Ella-Fitzgerald, wanna-be jazz singer. As though the space weren't small enough already. Jeez.

I have to admit I am a little disappointed... with myself for not trying the bread pudding. Next time - and yes, there will be a next time. Today I went with my friend Yuriko and we shared a Croque Monsieur topped with smoked Niman Ranch ham, Cowgirl Creamery fromage blanc and asparagus, a ÊLittle Side Salad (Star Route Farms organic greens with lemon and shallot vinaigrette) and a couple of cappuccinos. The first thing I tried was the salad. The description of this salad seems pretty simple, but I was amazed at how delicious this was. As was our Croque Monsieur and the piece of Almond/Lemon Poppy seed bread we took with us for later. We were here on a Monday morning so the line was not too long, but come prepared to wait in line. On the weekends this will be a long line. The space itself is a little cramped, but once you go through line and order it's seat yourself. Most people eat and get out (like we should when there is a big line), so you can find a seat. This is not exactly an intimate space though. So if you want to confess an affair or Êa pregnancy this is probably not the best place to do it.

While the baked goods were tempting and I'm sure delicious, me and my friend actually settled on some prosciutto sandwiches. (I most definitely would like to come back for the baked goods someday though). Loved our sandwiches, they were quite respectable in size so I had no qualms in paying about 10 for them. Nothing wrong with the taste either! It would be hard to bring a large group here as seating is limited (be prepared to share a large table with a bunch of strangers if you don't get a small table) but I definitely think Tartine Bakery is worth a visit when you're wandering around Dolores Park. Just stare at the baked goods while you're waiting in line.

I would die happy if the last food I ate was a lemon cream tart from Tartine! The tart was the best I have had -- but this place is not all that hyped up people make it be. Secret: butter, loads of it ...

I'm always up for some sweets...so when I saw this had good reviews, I came all the way from Mill Valley by bus to try it out. lol The line wasn't super long but maybe that had to do with the fact that it was 2:30pm...not so sure. I had to wait about 10 minutes. The music was loud and the girl behind the counter spoke like a mouse. Good thing I could semi-read her lips. I kinda wanted to try the bread pudding but I also kinda knew it would probably be NOTHING like my granny's Southern recipe...didn't want a let down, now do we!? I decided on the lemor bar and coconut cream tart. I spent $12, total. Well worth it? Ehhhhh.....I might have to think about that one. The lemon bar was really good...for the first three bites. Then the sugar and sour started settling in and it just tasted super sour. Maybe that is what it's supposed to do, but either way...I just wasn't feeling it. The coconut cream tart...well, that is sitting next to me, as I type! It survived a BART ride, a short little ride on the 28, AND it crossed over the GG with me and into my fridge. It sat in there for about an hour before I couldn't handle it anymore...I had to have it. I couldn't get my fork thru the crust so I gave in and bit the damn thing. I think it may have been the chocolate that was so hard to break but anywho, now I have a big mess on my plate. ha. It's ok. I'm not a super coconut fan but it's pretty good. So, maybe I'll be back...maybe. I'm still thinking on that one too... Ooh, they need pecan pie. Yummmy.

I feel like I haven't tried enough to give a real review, but from what I've experienced so far, it's quite good! I had a bite of their coconut cream tart, which was filled with light, smooth cream and crisp pieces of toasted coconut. I don't like coconut, but I still found the flavor quite delicious, without an overpowering coconut flavor. The bread had already sold out by the time I came, but I hope to go back and try their morning buns!

A while back I sort-of dated a guy Ê- just sort-of dated, you know? You know how it is. ÊAnyway, we went to Tartine on our second sort-of date, and that second date was pretty much the best thing I took away from our sort-of relationship on sheer merit of the food. Pros: This is some of the best food I've ever eaten, inside a bakery or out. ÊThere are usually vegetarian alternatives to whatever meat dishes are offered. ÊPotentially flakiest pastry crust in the world. ÊTry some of their grapefruit juice, too; it's freshly squeezed and it's delicious. Cons: EXPENSIVE. Also, Tartine is always crowded, even in the wee hours of the morning; it's very popular and probably doesn't even need this glowing review. So yeah, I love Tartine. ÊNot just sort-of love, you know; this is the real thing. ÊI'm ready to commit to Tartine for the long haul. ÊJust us against the world.

Oh, Tartine, how I miss you so. I came here during a trip out west to visit a friend in SF. The pastries were AMAZING, it was just THAT good. Come here hungry and order to your hearts content. Trust me, your eyes will be bigger than your stomach and odds are you'll order more than you can safely consume (but you'll consume it anyway because it's so. freaking. awesome.) It gets super crowded and odds are you'll have to wait on line but it's definitely worth it. On a 4 day trip to SF, I came here 3 times. My friend brought some of their fresh baked bread back to NY and he's savoring every last crumb. You just can't get anything like it in NYC. Tartine, I'll definitely be back the next time I visit SF - it's a must!

Back in the bay area for the weekend and heard good things about Tartine. As advertised there was a line out the door, which only enhances the anticipation of getting inside and seeing all that they have to offer. Once at the counter, I ordered a double pain au chocolate and the croque monsieur. The chocolate croissant was flaky, full of rich chocolate and absolutely delicious. Equally amazing was the croque monsieur (an open faced sandwich that included: ham, gruyere, sun dried tomatoes and becahmel). The sandwich even included a seemingly normal, yet spicy carrot on the side. You serve your own water, bus your own table and the place is incredibly crowded but the food makes it all worthwhile. Definitely worth a visit!

If it weren't rude, I would be WRITING THIS REVIEW IN ALL CAPS b/c Tartine makes me want to SHOUT FROM THE ROOFTOPS: SO YUMMY! We've come here many, many times to get their fabulous breads after 5pm. ÊToday was the first time we actually ate a meal there. ÊI had the croque monsieur which was fantastic, love the gooey gruyere and ham and oh, the bread. ÊOthers waited 10-15 minutes to get the sandwiches (croque monsieur is served right away, doesn't count as one of their sandwiches), and those sandwiches were delicious!! ÊSuch interesting flavors, toasted perfectly, very generous portions, and the bread!!!! ÊWe were lucky to grab a table for the six of us but it didn't seem too impossible to get seats/tables. ÊFellow Yelper Jeff H. loves those pickled carrots served with the sandwiches. ÊAfter some initial skepticism, I decided that they were a very nice contrast to the texture and taste of the sandwiches. ÊYummers all around. Did I mention I LOVE THEIR BREAD???

THE SHHH ** IS BANANAS!!! banana cream tart hands down THE BEST. ÊI've never been a huge fan of banana cream pies in general, but I LOVE Tartines. ÊThe crispiness of the buttery crust, with the chocolate around the shell so that the pie isn't soggy. ÊThe croissants are pretty good. ÊVery rich and buttery. Ê I had there lunch sandwiches ÊSopressata, Fontina, Broccoli Rabe Pesto, but honestly, I felt like the sandwich was a tad bit greasy. I'd stick to the banana cream tart.

There's little I can say that's not already been said in the 1200 odd reviews before me. But I'll try. Yum? Oh joy? If heaven was a bakery, it would be Tartine? I'm too lazy to do a search on the words. A friend first introduced me to Tartine by bringing me a chocolate souffle cake for my birthday. Now, visiting town and being in the area, we swung by to see what was available. I've heard things about the queue. But while it existed around 7 pm on a Friday, it was only a few people. I say the queue should be an opportunity to examine the items on the counter more closely. But when you're wishing you were eating the bread pudding rather than looking at it, my rationale won't get a nod of approval. Anyway. The chocolate souffle cake is incredible. And everything else looks wonderful. Fat, decadent, rich, lovely looking pastries, cakes, breads, and served up in a rustic and sensual and lusty atmosphere. A quick glance behind me and I caught a woman in the midst of her mouthful of bread pudding. She was sitting alone, and her eyes were closed, savoring the moment. Ê Perhaps I might not consider it worth the wait had I been subjected to a long queue, but I got lucky. So I leave with my cake, a slice of quiche, and a memory of that woman enjoying her evening dessert. Merci.

Tartine, I Heart You. Seriously I do. ÊYou are my must stop shop when I am in San Francisco. ÊYou are my favorite bakery in the world. ÊTartine, you really got me now. Tartine is perfect. ÊTheir food is 5 stars. ÊI have never had bad food there. ÊI give it only four stars b/c 4.5 is not an option and I want to make a point to warn people about seating/ambiance b/c it doesn't exist. ÊPrepare yourself for lines out the door. ÊSteel yourself against the prospect of not sitting down. ÊKnow that it will be worth every bit of discomfort and awkwardness. ÊEvery single bit and more. The hot sandwiches are wonderful and huge. ÊThe humbolt fog grilled cheese is amazing. ÊThe croque monsieur is perfect. ÊAll come on crusty country bread with creamy and toasted bubbly cheeses. ÊAnd the famous Tartine pickled carrot. ÊMust find recipe for the carrots! ÊSpicy, crunchy, sour, sweet. ÊA perfect foil to the richness of the sandwich. The quiche is, well, there are no words. Ênone. its that good. Pastry? ÊPerfect. ÊThe gougeres are grapefruit sized and made with cracked pepper and one of my favorites. ÊMy brother swears by the Ham and Cheese croissant (and who wouldn't). ÊTartine takes their pastry and bread to just past the golden brown stage of cooking. ÊThey go dark with their savory puff pastries and breads and I love it. ÊThe lemon cream tart is both light and rich, creamy and sour. ÊThe friands and rochers feel like Paris in spring. Ê Am I gushing? Ênot enough. Ênever enough. Ê Go there. ÊWait in long lines. ÊTrust me. ÊWorth every minute. ÊIts bliss.

I decided to take advantage of my afternoon working in the city, and hit this place up before heading back to the south bay.. My little detour was well worth it! The reviews are true!! Oh man, this place is heavenly.. It looks like your regular bakery/cafe, but don't let that fool you.. The food is awesome. I got their ham+leeks+? quiche. Soo good! The crust is made out of flakey, buttery phyllo dough instead of a traditional crust! I was pretty full after this, but couldn't leave without taking something back home to last me a while longer (or atleast until tomorrow morning!).. I got their Spicy Turkey hot pressed sandwich (toast in oven at 375degrees for 10mins.. you'll DIE!!) and a Banana Cream Tart (it has a surprise chocolate shell layer, between the crust & filling!). Another bonus, besides the awesome baked goods, is the outside seating and live music! Yea, its a really small place, but they had some cool, local musicans, jammin' it out! LOVE THAT on a Thursday night! I can't wait to go back.. it'll definitely be a destination, rather than a detour next time!

I'm giving this place 5 stars for the fresh baked bread only..if i could id give even more for the sesame loaf...the pastries i've had so far i Êthink would hang out between 3.5 and 4, depending on how angsty i'm feeling. but seriously, the bread here is amazing. i moved 2 blocks down from tartine just a few weeks ago, with no knowledge of its existence. happened to Êwander here right after 5 in search of a snack, and saw a sign saying fresh baked bread, wed-sunday after 5. fresh baked bread has broken my heart numerous times, but what can i say, i keep crawling back. I got a few pastries (not really noteworthy - im moody about Scharffen Berger, there are stronger chocolates out there but i digress) and half a sesame loaf. both pastries i had were eh, so after a bite i turned my attention to the bread. the loaf was still pippin hot, with toasted sesame on the perfect crunchy crust, and I tore of a piece to discover steamy, mushie perfection on the inside, laced with some sesame for some extra nuttiness. Êone bite bought tears to my eyes. the bread was so good, i sat there on the street corner and ate a good fourth of the loaf. walked 10 feet to the other corner, and sat down and ate another fourth. i love this bread. and it loves me. im really only writing this review to kill time till 5pm.

Things that make coffee good: flavor, freshness, and overall strength. ÊTartine manages all of these very well. ÊThe pastries are spot on, every single one, but my fav, by a landslide, is the morning bun. ÊThe orange zest coupled with the buttery pastry is so divine. It is also the perfect size, leaving you full and not overwhelmed by the richness (which can overtake the pleasure in some of the other items.) The lines are a pain, but again, sometimes they are worth it for something really special.

I don't drink tea or coffee, but if you want a damn good hot chocolate. Not something that tastes like it came from a packet then I highly recommend you set your ass down at Tartine and drink this fine concoction. I know not how they make it, but it reminds me more of the hot chocolate I drank in Spain. Thicker and slightly bitter. Make sure and ask for whipped cream because otherwise they serve it without.

My favorite things here are the morning buns, crossaints, and the fresh fruit bavarian cake during the summer. This is probably the best bakery in san francisco. The lines here can be super long, especially on the weekend. Even before they open, they already have a line. The bread pudding is good too, but when summer comes I always make an excuse to buy their fresh fruit bavarian. I'm waiting for summer again.

Wow just browsing at the yummy pastries from the display makes me pile on the calories. I was quite undecided on what to get but eventually got the lemon tart and the two friands. The friands are small moist chocolate cakes with a smothering of chocolate on top. It is a great tea time snack if you just want a light bite. Ooooh the lemon tart was awesome too...the right amount of tangy custard in a nice crumbly biscuit base with a big dollop of whipped cream and two flakes of tangerines (I think that is what it is), it is just delightful. The iced hibiscus tea was tangy and refreshing. Oooh..I'll be back for more. I just wish there was more seating space. Passed by on the weekend and the line was snaking out of the doors so beat the rush folks! Oh the hot pressed sandwiches actually look sooo yummy and so was the quiche. It was light and flaky...I am usually not a big quiche fan but this one, i thoroughly enjoyed it :)

Yes their pastries are exceptional, especially the eclairs.

Great ambiance, relaxed vibe, delectable treats and the richest chocolate pudding ever, mmmmmmmm. The only reason I knocked it down one star is the seating factor. ÊWhenever I do find a seat it's usually at this cramped communal table that has seats right up to the wall/window and a few times there has been nowhere to sit at all. ÊBut this is just an indication of how good the food is here. ÊThe quiche (at least one veggie quiche per day in addition to the meat quiche) is very good as well, the crust oh so flaky.

Literally, the best croissant I ever had was at Tartine. ÊWe waited in the ridiculously long line on a sunny but cool morning, oohing and aahing over all the baked pastry deliciousness under the glass counter as we edged into the crowded bakery, and ordered up a whole array of buttery croissants, croque monsieurs, orangey-cinnamon morning buns, hot fragrant teas and coffees. ÊWe then proceeded to the park nearby and laid out the food for an impromptu picnic, tore into the boxes, and enjoyed bite after bite. ÊSeriously. The. Best. Croissants. I've. Ever. Had. Oh yeah, and when we were done, we relived a few "Full House" style moments running through the park with somebody else's dog (unfortunately, he wasn't a Golden Retriever like Comet, but close enough).

Don't really get what the hype is all about. First time I tried their spicy turkey sandwich was when my sister brought left overs back home. Sandwich was slightly burnt which left a bitter taste and very very oily and slightly smushy. ÊI assumed that the sandwich was like that because it was take out. However I finally went there in person a few days ago. These are what we ordered and the reviews of them. 2 spicy pesto turkey pressed sandwiches: I would rate 2 stars. THe whole thing was covered in grease and oil. The inside of the sandwich was pretty good due to me liking melted cheese and turkey. You can't really go wrong with that. However it would have been much better with 1/4 the oil. Its insanely expensive for the quality and taste of this sandwich. They also packed a lot of oil on the inside which i like but again there was WAAAYYY too much grease on the inside of the sandwich as well. to summarize: BIG OILY GREASE BALL TURKEY SANDWICH Breadpudding: ok but i felt like it wuz kinda of dry. I didnt see what was so great about it. ÊAlso cost an arm and a leg. ALmond croissant was good. but not GREAT. not good enough for the price I would say. Lemon tart: was also good but not GREAT. too pricey. All in all I would probably not come back due too high prices and lack of quality to match those prices. Your much better and will save a ton of money going somewhere else. Also what is up with the workers?? They look INSANELY dirty and unkempt. Makes me seriously question what they could possibly be doing to the food while my back's turned. Just don't come here ok. THe people who rave about this place are delusional.

I am a dessert kind of girl. Yes, I totally have a sweet tooth! Finally, I made time to give this place a try. It's kind of hard to find because there's no sign or banner with its name. ÊAfter circling around, we finally found it with parking right in front. SWEEET!!! Small little bakery with some tables inside as well as tables outside, perfect for those nice sunny days! Between two people we tried... COCONUT PASSIONFRUIT BAVARIAN CAKE: this was recommended by the guy who was helping us. ÊThis was the first dessert we dug our forks into. ÊNeither of us enjoyed it too much. ÊI was expecting more of a coconut flavor to it, but the tartness of the lemon and passionfruit overpowered the coconut. ÊAlso, I didn't like the coconut flakes that the cake was topped with. ÊThis just didn't do it for me. We moved on to the cookies.... COCONUT MACROONS: nice light little treat. ÊI loved its crunchy outside and chewy inside. ÊThe coconut flavor was not TOO much, just perfect. ÊI'm not a big coconut fan, but this definitely left me wanting more! ROCHER with toasted almond: I had no idea what it was when I ordered it, but I decided to give it a try and it was another delightful little treat! ÊI'm not sure what its made with, but i love how its chewy almond flavored insides. Delicious. BANANA CREAM TART: the best thing we ordered! i wish we didn't save it for last because we would have killed it if it was the first thing we ate. I absolutely love the flaky crust, which went well with the custard cream. ÊThere is also a bit of caramel in it, which definitely makes it different from all the other banana cream pies I've ever tried. ÊI wish the banana slices in the pie were sliced a little thinner. I think it would have been a bit more enjoyable. I enjoyed my dessert with a Latte while my friend had a ginger beer. I wish the latte was served in a mug with handles to hold onto. ÊInstead it was served in what seemed like a soup bowl. weird. The ginger beer tasted like ginger, not my type of drink. I noticed a great variety of savory pastries and goodies. I will definitely be back to try more!!

I am in love. Their baked goods are just as good as if you were to get them in France. Rustic French baking (I think so anyway) is delicious here. Their pastries are fragrant (from all the butter) and their cakes are moist, pungent and mouth watering. I was a little early for their afternoon bread so I was disappointed in not getting a chance to try their bread. If everything else wasn't $6 each, I would've taken one of everything home with me. I also love that they have outdoor seating, and you can sit outside to enjoy your coffee and sandwich. Parking here is almost nonexistent because of the neighborhood so don't plan on driving here. Also, the first time I came here, I wasn't sure if this was the place or not since it doesn't have a gigantic sign but it is. If you drive by, it looks like a bakery with people packed inside and out. That's how you known you're at the right place. The gals behind the counter are friendly and helpful, though the cashier seemed a little less friendly. Still, the deliciousness of the goods is worth coming for.

This place was packed on this Sunday rainy afternoon. The rain had briefly stopped for an hour or two and I would have thought people would have stayed home and relaxed. Apparently it did NOT stop this place from filling up and having no sitting room. Coconut cream pie I like to give this a 6 stars out of 5. I love coconut and I can't say I'm too big of a cream person. This one hits the spot for me and ME LIKEY. I think this was my favorite item. Banana cream pie This one deserved a 4/5. It was good but not Coconut cream pie fantastic :) Now I'm not saying don't try it, just make sure you try the other pie first. tres leches?? This cake was ok for me. My friends liked it a lot more than I did. This didn't seem like anything special to me. I'm just glad someone else liked it. Overall I like this place a lot.

This is one of those places that you hate to love - OR - that you love to hate - It has the bestest - yummiest pan au chocolat (That's chocolate croissants for the rest of us non francophiles) - It has the rudest - meanest - nastiest - slowest people behind the counter I have seen in a long time - and I lived in Paris for god's sake - It has the bestest - yummiest - most delicious butter laden cookies your cholesterol craving clogged blood stream could want - And the bitch behind the counter - Gee whiz - I said "Good morning - how are you today - I'd like a _______" - and she snarled at me and walked away like I had just informed her that I had run over her cat with my gas guzzling SUV. (I don't have an SUV....) -Maybe she was in a bad mood cause she hadn't licked her cat that morning ..... Tartine is one of the bakeries in SF that make eating baked goods worth it - Maybe they can set up an Automat style window system - you Êknow - put your $$ in the wall - open the door and get the item you want - and not have to deal with slow and weird and rude and hippy mission types gotta go - I think the croissants are due out in the next few minutes and I need to get inline for my butter and abuse ............

The only reason this place doesn't get five stars is because the line is terrible and you'll have a hard time finding a place to sit. Other than that, it's great. I've been multiple times and tried a lot of different things and have never been unhappy. And no matter what your budget, you can get at least something here - they have a variety of small items for less than a buck. Whatever you do, don't take your stroller - you won't be able to get it through the tables and chairs. ÊI made that mistake - once. Also, the coffee is good enough to stand up to the pastries, but not good enough to write home about. If ÊI want good coffee, I'll go to Ritual. I'm spoiled on their quiche, here, however. I now can't eat it anywhere else, it's never up to Tartine standards.

Tartine has amazing food. ÊOne time when I was unemployed, a friend and I said we were going to try and eat our way through the entire dessert window. ÊAfter our second visit, we gave up, because we realized we would gain entirely too much weight. ÊIt's not that you couldn't do it, it's just that isn't the way Tartine is meant to be enjoyed. ÊBring a newspaper, and order just about anything, and then wait. Ê It's also great to bring some of their fresh baked bread to dinner parties. ÊI went a solid year where I would go at 5 pm to pick up a fresh country loaf of bread, and grab a little bag of their thin, crispy, chocolate chip cookies. ÊIf you have a smaller group, you can grab just half a loaf. ÊIt's worth it.

I know people who will claim this is the best bakery in town. I'm not sure about that but definitely can fight on one of the top 3 spot. This is one of the only places that understands that croissant is not just a different shape for donut. They also feature other interesting delicate pastry which mean you can do breakfast, branch or just spoil yourself with sugar. Note that this place does get full after 10:00 and you will probably need to stand in line. But yes. It's worth it.

Was celebrating my colleagues birthday and wanted to a get a cake for him. We landed at Tartine Bakery on a Saturday evening at five and there was a serpentine queue outside. The place seemed very popular. It is a small cafe with few sitting and standing spots inside and a few seats outside. Nothing to vote on the ambiance It is a self service joint, so you stand in queue, choose the stuff, pay the bill, find a place and take the food and then take the empty plates back to the dish-washing place (i found the last bit just by observing other people!). So i vote myself a 5 for service :-) After a 15 minute wait, we got a 6 inch "Opera Cake" for $26..was little expensive..i guess it is not a safeway cake! and when we ate it later was wondering if it was supposed to be so hard? Would have liked it to be little more soft and moist. The lemon tart and bread pudding were out of the world....absolutely lip-smacking, the best i have eaten. The Hot cocoa was not too great, i think Starbucks is better. My friend said his coffee was good though. For a total $46 it was little heavy on the pocket. Still would vote 4 stars on the food I would like to go again to try other items in the menu. Oh well, later i also found this joint was a Bay Area Top 100 listed. Well, that explains the pricey tag!

Tartine is the closest I've come in the US to European (especially French and Italian) baked goods. ÊThe croissants are the perfect combination of flaky, salty, sweet - and if you can eat one soon after it comes out of the oven, you will be in heaven. ÊWhat I like is that they do the basics so well, the scones, breads and pastries are just right. And then there's dessert. ÊThe passion fruit coconut cake or the lemon tart are perfect if you happen to be tired of chocolate. Ê My only sadness about it is that when I'm really craving a sweet and a cup of coffee (or glass of wine), it feels like torture waiting in line staring at all those taunting cookies behind the glass. ÊAnd then once I get my plate and cup in hand, waiting again for a table to open up...

Alright, so I have never reviewed here and this place triggered an urge inside of me to review it. Tartine is simply the best bakery I have ever been in the whole world (trust me, i have traveled to over 30 countries)! Luckily for me I went there on my last day in San Francisco and I am very happy I did. Their morning buns and almond croissants are simply delicious. The quiche is also pretty good. Bottom line is: if you are in San Francisco, this place is a must.

The pastries are so good that someone actually tried to steal them from me!!! ÊNo Joke! Ê My boss asked me to pick up some pastries, so I got to the bakery at 7:30am (a feat in itself) and waited for 20 minutes in line. ÊAfter I got some warm yummy Morning Buns and Croissants I got on the 22-Fillmore heading to work. ÊAs I sat reading Êmy newspaper, a well dressed middle-age woman on her way to work (she was sitting facing me) jumped up grabbed my box of pastries (not my purse) and makes a dash off the bus!!! ÊShe tried to steal my pastries!!! ÊThe Audacity!!! So I lunge over the guy sitting next to me and yell "That's mine!" ÊShe doesn't stop so I grab the pastry bag and tug on them until she lets go. ÊMeanwhile I spill my coffee on the guy next to me (who was reading a How-to book on developing personal magnetism). Ê ÊAt first I thought she picked them up by mistake but then I realized that she never said sorry and just ran off the bus. ÊPlus the pastries were warm and smelled really nice. ÊI can't believe it! ÊAnyway these pastries are so good that it causes seemingly normal looking people to try and steal them from you - watch out!

Ah Burning Man week... The BEST time to live in San Francisco. Less traffic, fewer commuters, shorter lines, it's fantastic! So I decided to celebrate this holiday in the Bay by going to Tartine, which usually has some insane lines. I had attempted to go to Tartine a few times before but couldn't handle the wait. Today I was able to walk right in, check out the pastries on display and... wait. I wasn't sure what the protocol was, as I stood by the case I kept trying to make eye contact with one of several Tartine employees so I could ask them a question, but nobody came by. So I walked to the register, where a girl was standing, and waited some more. She looked up once, the sort of fiddled around with some stuff, while I stood there. There wasn't a "I'll take your order in a moment." or anything like that. After this, I decided to just order an eclair and some lattes, and decided to shelve any questions for another visit. I have to say, the coffee drinks weren't all that good, but the eclair was alright. I can't say I would go there again, and I can't for the life of me imagine why anyone would wait in line for this. If I wanted to wait in line and deal with less than enthusiastic staff, I'd go to Ritual. At least the product at Ritual is worth waiting for. Why aren't there any other decent bakeries in the Mission anyways?

Really tasty pastries, especially the chocolate croissants and lemon tarts, but I think their sandwiches are the real star here. they're unique and just delicious. try the Spicy turkey with the broccoli pesto.... amazing! There is always a pretty long line, the cooked food takes a bit of time before its brought out to you and there's not a lot of seating. That being said, the wait is totally worth it. yum yum.

I'll keep this short and simple...If you don't know what to get, definitely try the -Bread pudding (with brioche bread) -Lemon tarts -House coffee -Morning buns I love the food at this place and pretty much the reason it gets 4 instead of 5 stars is the poor attitude of most of the servers here (with the exception of a couple). ÊJust because people will come back for the food doesn't mean you should have lackluster service consistently at all times of days (to name a few: 7:30am on a wednesday, 12pm on a monday, 1pm on a saturday, or 4pm on a sunday).

Always worth the wait. and the line moves fast. I can't say that I've ever been disappointed here. The daily bread pudding topped with fresh fruit is wonderful in the AM. The gougres are the best. The tarts (banana cream, coconut cream, chocolate etc), the croissants... Sizes have been apportioned up for America, so the items mostly come in larger sizes than you would see in France. The pressed sandwiches are varied & fantastic and always too big for one person, so I like to bring a friend to help me eat one. This also saves you a bit of room for dessert, which a sane person would never pass up here. They don't always have every bakery item at all hours of the day and that's how it should be. What's available now is always fresh. The Coffee is also excellent. If you're having coffee or tea with your food, order it at the main food line. But if you only want a beverage you can always go straight to the coffee bar and order it there. The revolving art show on the walls is always a pleasant surprise. Interesting choices. It's always crowded but this place always feels like home.

The place seemed really hectic/chaotic, but my cousin and I put up with the line to try their bread pudding and they packed it in our box, alright.

Ê THE MUST EAT: 1. bread pudding (not too sweet, not too bready, not too much pudding, just the right amount of fruits and delicious in every way. ÊI got the cup size and they give you so much. ) 2. Morning Bun (just the right amount of sweetness, i liked the crispy shell the most) 3. fresh squeezed orange juice (literally tasted like i was eating an orange) THE "YOU CAN DO WITHOUT": 1. the chocolate croissants (nothing special, it was super flaky though if that is what you like) overall: pretty good, it was worth the wait ( i waited ~15-20mins)

Completely OVER RATED as many reviewers have mentioned. ÊWe've been here several times, each time ordering something different, hoping to give Tartine "another chance". ÊI grew up in a family owned bakery specializing in croissants. ÊIn my opinion, the croissants are the best items in the case, perfect layers of flakiness, perfect texture and the rich taste of butter in every bite. ÊThe Tres Leche Cake and Passion Fruit Lime Bavarian are good but not great, a little dry in my opinion. ÊThe sandwiches and cookies are nothing special either, again, good but not great. ÊIt's true that the service is NOT friendly, seating is limited and there is always a long line no matter what time you arrive.

Upon reading so many good things about the banana creme tart, I had to give it a try. ÊThe place was bustling on the inside, so after we got our tarts, we headed for the outdoor seating. ÊSince it was only slightly windy, I enjoyed the outdoor seating because there were so many cars and people passing by. Ê The tart was scrumptious! ÊEvery component of it, from the thin chocolate flakes with powdered sugar that formed a roof over the tart to the slices of real banana lightly covered with caramel, made the tart absolutely enjoyable. ÊAlthough the tarts were a bit pricey, I am definitely coming back to try the other pastries they have to offer.

So I finally made it to the Tartine Bakery! There isn't much I can say that the 1800+ yelper ahead of me haven't already said. It really is THAT good. But I will warn you that this is the place where well intentioned New Year's Resolutions go to die!!! I went with the nave idea that I go and pick up a couple of things for breakfast and enjoy my coffee before starting my day. Instead I had breakfast and left with a goodie bag of treats I couldn't pass up to share with my co-workers later. I needed the excuse of treating my co-workers to live with the fact that I bought soo much. I will say that I usually don't like quiche. However, their ham and arugula quiche looked so good I couldn't pass it up. And I was glad I didn't, it's very light and fluffy and not too rich. The morning bun was also amazing and it's usually not my top pick in a bakery. But after reading the raves of my fellow yelpers I felt the need to try it as well. I don't think I've ever had such a flaky croissant! I sampled the chocolate filled one which might have ruined me for all other croissants in the future. Ê The brioche bread pudding is also very good! Not as sweet as other bread puddings but very creamy and filled with lots of baked apples! I'm a fan.

yum yum yum. There are too many things to try! Almond croissant: Deliciously moist, almondy, and flaky. Perfect. Banana cream tart: not actually as good as I thought it'd be. Not a fan of the weird hard-but-flaky crust. croque monsieur with turkey: took a bit long for them to heat it up, and the bread was slightly too crusty and oily tasting. I was also really full by this point, dessert came first. On my late night drive back to the southbay though, I devoured this baby. Dare I say it was more delicious cold than hot?

I had my first (but definitely not last) Tartine experience last weekend. Everyone in San Francisco raves about it.. they used to look at my like I killed someone when I said I had never been! We stopped by Tartine after hiking Twin Peaks- it was a well deserved treat! The line was ridiculous but I toughed it out. I picked out a couple of things and was not disappointed. Would have loved to try their famous morning bun but since it was 4pm there was obviously none left. I loved the brownies- they are so rich that it took me extra long to savor and enjoy. Can't wait to go back next time we are in Dolores Park. I might even give up waiting in Bi-Rite Creamery's line for Tartine... wait, maybe not :)

I was told by a friend to visit this place for their Eclairs. While I was standing in line, I was tempted by all the other wonderful patries, so in addition to an Eclair, I picked up a butter croissant, a morning bun, a banana tart, and a coconut tart. (yeah, that's what usually happens with me, just like buying milk at the supermarket) The Eclair was just ok. But I'm not a huge fan of eclairs in general, since they are usually soft after being placed back into the fridge. However......I'm addicted to their croissants, morning buns, and banana tarts!! I've gone back many times for said items. The croissants are buttery and crispy (especially when reheated in the toaster oven). The chocolate layer and caramel gives the tart that extra edge. Delicious! I really need to try their other items, but I always end up getting the croissants and tarts.

This place is always busy and yes, even on stormy days when most people stay at home (I know). They have a wide variety of decadent desserts and other items. As my friends and I all agree, this place is pretentious. It seems out of place since all the other places in this neighborhood are all chill and hipsterish. In the end, good food is good food. - Fresh Bread Loaf: nice, chewy, soft consistency while having the hard rustic outer layer, but not too hard so you can't even bite into it. - Eclair: good but filling was a bit too runny for my taste - Oatmeal Currant Cookies: thin, hard, but good

I'm writing this review while in Tartine; wi-fi is spotty. ÊThis is not one of Tartine's strong points; however, it's not meant to be. ÊThis is a place to enjoy the food, drink, and converse with your family/friends. ÊIt's NOT a coffeehouse where you spend a couple of bucks and stay for hours working. ÊIt's one of the reasons I believe you never have to wait long for a table even though this place can get mobbed like others mention. ÊSo for those who complain about long lines, long waits, etc, show some goddamn patience. ÊI've been about three time now (I come whenever I'm visiting my brother); it's always crowded, but the staff moves people along in a quick, cordial manner and people don't table hog for hours. That said, I've tried the morning bun, a banana tea bread, the ham and Gruyere croissant, and some other things. ÊEverything has been delicious. ÊI love the subtle hint of orange in the morning bun, and it doesn't make me feel disgusting and guilty for eating it. ÊThe coffee is decent. ÊIt's not their strong point, but, again, it's not meant to be. ÊIt's quality, though. The best I've ever had? ÊI don't know about that; I'm not going to oversell it. ÊBut Tartine is certainly worth visiting, and I'll continue to frequent it whenever I'm in SF.

The only reason why I'm not giving them 5 stars is because one time I ordered a lemon bar, and it was such an intense sweet and sour flavor that it stung my throat. :( Other than that one incident, this place is perfection! From the little 75 cent bites to the $5-6 slices of cake... or my favorite, the lemon cream tart. Don't let the line out the door intimidate you. It moves pretty fast, and I've actually always been able to get a seat (because so many people take their stuff to picnic at Dolores Park!). They also serve delicious hot sandwiches, which, at $12, seem pricey but are actually well worth the price!

Hm I don't know if it is fair of me to rate Tartine Bakery because I only had cookies, pastries and coffee from it, but I'm going to do it anyway. We really wanted to come here during our trip to SF, but we didn't have time to squeeze it into our schedule. However, luck was on our side! When were walking to Dolores Park, we decided to look for a store to buy some water and we accidentally stumbled into Tartine Bakery. Once we got inside, the smell of the bakery just overwhelmed us. We had already eaten lunch but we had to try some of their pastries. We bought about half a dozen random cookies, a chocolate eclair and some coffee. Tartine's eclair was so rich and delicious, it was really something else. Hopefully next time I'll be able to try the food. Recommendation: Coffee

Tartine is located on the corner and has no shop sign, which i found really odd. There's an ample amount of seating outside and inside. The line can sometimes stretch outside the door. Although the line stretched way beyond the door seemed intimidating, it went by pretty fast. There were tons of options. I limited myself to a few items. Since I wanted a taste of a variety of things. I ended up ordering Êa croque monsieur, a morning bun, a chocolate croissant, a fruit tart, a frangipane tart and a cup of bread pudding. Everything was delicious! If you're not looking to overstuff yourself like I did, I'd recommend starting off with the morning bun or the chocolate croissant. YUM!

Banana creme tart (~$6) with dark chocolate. Lemon tart (~$6) with a dollop of unsweetened white cream. Simply amazing! The desserts are enough to share for two so bring a fellow sweet tooth ... but you might just want get one each and dig into both! If I had a family to feed, I would order the big pastries such as the Passion Fruit Lime Bavarian or the Tres Leches Cake. The long wait and limited seating (hopefully it is sunny out so you can go out to Dolores Park!) is worth it. If it's your first time there, it might be difficult to decide what to get as there are throngs of people blocking view of the pastries and desserts. Although I have only tried the desserts, I also see plates of quiche and hot pressed sandwiches pass by. I will definitely have to try some of these sandwiches (~$12): Idiazabal & Membrillo with smoked sheep cheese with quince jam Pecorino & Almond with sheep cheese & almonds with olive oil, lemon and sage Sopressata, Fontina, Brocolli Rabe Pesto Prosciutto & Provolone with arugula Croque Monsieur ($10) with bchamel, gruyere, thyme and pepper

Overhyped. ÊAnd before everyone gets their shorts in a wad and starts responding craziness like "you obviously don't know good pastry"--let me start by saying: ÊMy sister was a pastry chef that graduated from the San Francisco Culinary Academy and I have had many unbelievable confection creations. ÊThat being said, on a recent trip to SF, my son and I were so anxious to go to Tartine. I had the shitake mushroom brioche and lemon creme tart. ÊHe had the open-faced chicken and pesto panini and chocolate torte. ÊThe crust on the tart was too much like a Catholic-communion-wafer and the lemon tart lacked ANY soul. The chocolate torte was very good which is why the bakery is getting the second star. Ê Both sandwiches were absolutely burnt to a crisp, totally charred. The gruyere atop was rubbery from the overcooking. This was probably because the cashiers were unbelievably disorganized. ÊThey were snotty and kept giving out the sandwich I ordered to people who ordered after me. When I pointed this out to the cashier, she kept saying "yours is coming" without ever looking at my number. ÊWhen she finally realized the mistake, they hurried and burned a couple of sandwiches to give to us. And people say L.A. waiters are snotty.

Everything looks so good!! ÊBut how does it tastes? ÊMy partner and I ordered a variety of things at Tartine, and the overall opinion about this bakery is it's just "OK". Here's the breakdown: For a sweet: A slice of the Passion Fruit Lime Bavarian. ÊI like this the most out of all the things we ordered. ÊIt wasn't overly sweet and the tangy lime is refreshing. ÊNot much of fan of the shaved coconut on top though. ÊIt makes the good cake taste dry. For a savory: ÊOne gougre and a Humboldt Fog goat cheese sandwich. ÊIMHO, the gougre doesn't have much of a Gruyre cheese taste to it, only a hint of it. ÊCould use more pepper too. ÊI wish the taste is a bit bolder. The $12 grilled goat cheese sandwich was just how it was written on the menu. ÊJust bread and cheese. ÊDon't expect anything else. ÊThat said, it would've been nice if there were a few slices of tomatoes or something to counter the richness of the goat cheese and buttered bread. ÊThe sandwich was grilled very nicely with nice blackened frilled marks. Ê Points for that. ÊHowever, I didn't like it so much when I bite into my sandwich and it was more like a (VERY) hard cracker bread with melty cheese in between. ÊBtw, was it walnut bread? ÊI didn't see any walnuts that the other reviewers mentioned. ÊMore like white bread. Lastly, A loaf of bread to go: Êtasted bitter and burnt from the bottom crust. ÊDefinitely not the best quality. ÊBut for $8??? ÊBoudin is much better. Ê Drinks: The earl grey tea: ÊNot the best. Mocha: Mediocre in taste and served in a bowl. Ê First time I've ever had mocha in a bowl. Ê Mocha soup for you? ÊNo thanks for me.

Delicious Food Madame la Tartine, Very delicious food, however, beaucoup, beaucoup trop dispendieux! beaucoup trop cher! I bought a few items at your joint: one cookie, one gougre, one lemon pie and one Sopressata sandwich and the total surprised me! I also ask to place all these wonderful items in the Tartine's cotton bag like the one found at grocery store for 2 bucks, but... when the lady told me it is 40 bucks for the cotton bag I resisted... Tartine has delicious food but, at what price!!! ÊI guess this is California rule!

Yep...its pretty damn amazing, and although the coffee is between a three and four star, the pastries seriously pick up the slack. ÊI can personally attest to the wonderfulness of the banana cream pie (their crust is coated in ganache/caramel), pain au chocolat, croissant, almond croissant, currant scone, chocolate chip cookie and bread pudding. ÊMy favorite dessert of all time is bread pudding and this one makes the top five list! ÊIt comes with a seasonal fruit and the day I ordered it was bananas! Êfan-frickin-tastic! I personally think if you want an actual dessert time is of the essence! ÊNext time I go I will patiently wait for a seat at one of the tables and make a go of it right in the store! Ê Also this place is a stone's throw from Delores Park and Bi-Rite so if you really want a blow out get ice cream to go with your pastry and get your gorge on!

So I'm strolling through the Mission with a fabulous friend on a very warm, sunny day. We had just left Dolores Park and had, successfully, drained a bottle of pinot, a french baguette and way too much cheese. ÊWe were sunburned. We were buzzed. And we were sleepy. Ê That's why when passing Tartine, it seemed like the perfect idea to dart in for a great cup o' joe in hopes of securing a bit of stimulation. ÊIn ordering a nonfat latte, I asked at the last minute if they had any vanilla flavoring. ÊThis was clearly the wrong place to reveal my yuppie streak, because the barrista put his milk carton aside, and shot back, "This isn't Starbucks, sweetheart." with an unmistakable glare. ÊI mustered a "no problem" response, and paid for the beverage. Ê It didn't bother me that they didn't offer the flavoring for the coffee, but it was his delivery that rubbed me the wrong way. ÊIt was rude, unnecessary, and incredibly sarcastic. ÊThree things that do not add up to good, let alone decent service. ÊI do have to say, however, that the latte was delish. This mediocre experience aside, ÊI will most likely return to sample the sweets. ÊAt the time, I was too full to indulge in their heavenly-looking creations. Update to follow once I fatten up on their goodies....

First of all, I would like to thank God for NOT blessing me with diabetes so I can feel so happily guilty eating all the sweetness my Dentist tells me to stay away from. What hasn't been said already? Exactly. We go here when we have extra time (meaning I actually make it out of bed by 5am) to get to the city for work. Allen E got me hooked on the morning bun. Forget the crust!! I start chowing down the middle. That's where the party happens!! I gotta give it up to their bread pudding and their packaged thin cookies. OMG!!!! I really like how I can just eat a bun on the way back to the car and a dose of daily amusement courtesy the panhandler laying down on a mattress on Dolores. Only in SF can you find smart bums! Out of the plenty times we stopped by, I'm yet to see the nasty lines everyone talks about. But then again, we're there right when they open on weekdays when I feel like I have pregnancy cravings - but then it's just my indecisive female hormones that kick in to play. Check out their restroom too. CUTE and CLEAN. Aha. . . until next time Tartine.

A place with 713+ Yelp reviews and 4.5 stars just has to be incredibly amazing, right? Well I was rather disappointed. Yes, the place has terrific looking baked goods and yes, the almond double baked croissant and devil's food cake tasted good, but I didn't think this place was THAT amazing. And what's up with the $3 slice of pound cake? I can buy a whole big pound cake for the cost of 2 slices. ÊAnd the place was a zoo inside and all the tables were dirty from the previous inhabitants. Bottom line: Yes, I was happy to go there and be able to say I've been there but Tartine and overall experience is overrated. I'd be willing to go back and try some other stuff to see if it changes my mind. 3.5 stars.

one of the last SF Must Haves that I had before I went to Boston was a 'morning bun' from Tartine. My roommate at the time kept telling me about this 'morning bun'-- she never exactly told me why this 'morning bun' was worth a trip to the Mission. ÊAll I remembered was she used a moaning sound to describe this 'morning bun'. Ê "Like that?" Ê The last time I felt like describing a dish or a delicacy by using a moaning sound was when I was at Ippudo in New York City--when I had the delectable Akamaru Modern ramen with a side of braised pork belly. Ê*moan* Because my eyes are bigger than my appetite, I also had a couple other things, like the fruit tart and something else that was unremarkable. ÊBut the 'morning bun'..... this... 'morning bun'... so flakey... but not too hard.... not too soft.... but juuuuuust riiiight. with a hint of orange... mmmmmm. *cue LL Cool J's "doin' it"* like that. ( | )

The first thing I had at Tartine was the chocolate eclair. It's flat-out the best I've ever had. Since I've been back I've moved on to savory items, specifically the typical croque monsieur -however their preparation is not so typical. They use oblong cuts of bread, top-notch smoked ham, and grilled asparagus. Best I've ever had, not sure how it could be better (someone email me if there's better, I'd like to know). While there's typically a line and a wait, and the place isn't exactly cheap, the quality of the food and the charm of the place earns this 5 stars in my book.

It's been on my mind to go here for several months now, but I have just never been that motivated.

ÊExcept that the waif like girl that arranged my packaging smushed it in there so the pudding spilled out.

In any event, I would definitely go back and I am definitely glad that I don't live any closer to the place.

While its hard to find new words to describe this much beloved Mission bakery, I would support just about any flowery compliment bestowed on this wonderful bakery. The lines are always out the door, but they move quickly enough and give you time to take in the myriad of options. The morning buns are terrific, as are the chocolate croissants and tarts. The cheese sandwiches (croque monsier and three-cheese) are absurdly heavy, but if your the type who likes to get all your indulgement in at once, they certainly are tasty and use delectable sharp and smelly cheeses. The bread pudding was very enjoyable, but not as great as I'd heard. Despite complaints a hipper-than-though staff, I've always found them friendly and accommodating.

*SPOILER ALERT* Well, it's not really a spoiler but if it was it would go like this - imagine going to a bakery and seeing all their baked goods. Now think in your mind how good the cookie, tart, croissant - whatever it is would be once you got to taste it. Now if you take that and raise it a level above that - that would describe how good Tartine is. After seeing their book and hearing the name so many times, I decided to try it out. From reading the Yelp! reviews I knew I had found the place, not by the address but by spotting the line outside the door. Yes, it was quite a wait but not quite unbearable - I wasn't that hungry yet. People there are pretty easygoing and seem to expect a line and a wait, so everything went fine, that is anyway until I reached the counter... Soooo many choices! Since I was new there I wasn't quite drooling onsite, but next time - watch out! Everything looked good - how was a girl to choose? But I wisely chose a small variety - for me and my friends to sample (hey, I was already waiting in line, so I thought, why not share?). We enjoyed everything - the chocolate cookies, the pain au chocolat... Oh, and can I also say - I loved how nice and accomodating the staff is. With so many people coming through the door, I expected the staff to be disinterested and impatient but it was nothing like that at all. As busy as they were they were still great and answered my questions and even were as considerate as to ask me questions as to how I wanted my pastries packed. The staff is also large and I can see that they are trying to get the line moving as fast as they can. That's an "A" for effort in my book. Definitely worth 5 stars and definitely worth a return visit.

Tartine was my first love in San Francisco. ÊLong before ever moving here, a friend took me for lunch at Tartine with the promise of the best scone I'd ever taste. ÊMany scones (and quiches and croissants and tarts) later, Tartine is still my favorite bakery in the city. ÊTheir dessert case is enough to make any calorie-counter keel over in anguish, especially after waiting a good half an hour to catch a glimpse of it (which you will spend in a line snaked down the street f you plan to sample Tartine at any time on a weekend - believe me, it's worth it. ÊWhy else would we all be standing there?) Not only are the scones delicious, but the quiche has made a true vegetable eater of my partner. ÊEven as a meat eater, I prefer the daily veggie variety (ranging from mushroom to kale) to get that much more egg-goodness. ÊThe crust is flaky and perfect, but be sure to heat up your slice if you choose to take it to-go. The serving staff is sweet and flirty, and surprisingly good natured for the nonstop nature of their work on weekends. ÊThe coffee is strong and good, and the chocolate used in mochas and the like is some of the best I've tasted in a cup. Not only was my first visit to Tartine consummated with a tasty Croque Monsieur (love the pickled carrots on the side), my friend and I were also photographed enjoying our lunch street side by a roving group of National Geographic Traveler journalists. ÊI never found the article, but this bakery deserves national coverage. ÊI bring all out of town guests here and pine after their cookbook (though making their recipes likely won't disrupt my regular visits!)

I have to rave about how great their desserts/pastry are!! I'd say it's one of the best in town! Venue: Cute semi-small place. there's seating outside. Service: Very casual. You basically line up and order, they give you a number, you go find your own seat, they bring food to you. Food: - Banana Cream Tart 4" (http://www.yelp.com/biz_É) - $6.50 I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this tart!! It might be my most favorite tart in the whole world!!! *hint* to friends reading this, they also make a full size pie for this.*hint* Ê;) The crust is perfectly flaky. The bananas are perfectly sweeten and not too sweet. The Whip cream on top is perfectly airy. And the ribbons of chocolate on top is a bonus! GET IT! - Lemon Cream Tart 4" (http://www.yelp.com/biz_É) $6.25 - This one is good also but might be a little too sweet for me. Still good though. - Muesli (http://www.yelp.com/biz_É) $6.50 bowl - Toasted whole grains, whole-milk yogurt, fresh and dried organic fruits and toasted nuts. I know.. sounds too healthy.. I wasn't a fan of this one. - Croque Monsieur Ê$9.75 - Open face sandwich with bchamel, gruyere, thyme and pepper. Topped with either smoked Niman Ranch ham or seasonal vegetable. They make their sandwiches super crunchy here. Very good but also greasy. Price: A little pricier than some other places, but well worth it. Overall: I will come back very often just for the banana cream tart.

So I left with a light wallet and a tight belt. Indeed, this place makes an array of super delicious and beautiful pastries and other baked goods. The prices are pretty darn high though. I enjoyed: -bread pudding-- would have been even better if served warm! got too sweet after a few bites, but probably good with tea. -hazelnut torte-- light and less sweet than expected (a good thing) -quiche-- served hot and toasty; a bit heavy after a few bites. -chocolate croissant-- very flaky, good texture. We couldn't get seats (on Friday 1:30pm), so my friend and I sat outside on a bench. Would love to try their bread and a hot-pressed sandwich next time; but, I'll have to re-fill my wallet again before my next visit.

I've been twice so far and both experiences have been good but not the five star ratings that everyone else is giving it. ÊHere's why: 1. ÊThe line is slow and too long. ÊIs it the service? ÊIs it the customer? ÊI can't tell from either experience since I was too far out of earshot to hear how each patron's order transaction went. ÊAll I know is that the guy in front of me had to tell the counter women three times (there was one helping him, then she stepped away and another came in to replace her) his order and he was ordering for four people. ÊHmm... Êthat might keep the line moving less steadily. 2. ÊThe patries are good and look so pretty, but really... are they worth the price? ÊI guess they do use organic and the frangipane tart was something I would hestitate to attempt myself... ÊThe cappucino I ordered wasn't so bad either. ÊOk. ÊI give on the pastries. ÊBut the open faced sandwich (basically a piece of Êbread toasted with cheese and ham/veggies on top) at nearly 8 dollars a pop? ÊI don't know... 3. ÊSeating. ÊA bit awkward for a cafe/bakery. ÊIt's the kind of pastry at the kind of price where you want to sip on your cap, eat your eclair feel relaxed and carefree doing it.

This is a good neighborhood joint for coffee, pastries baked goods. Parking in the mission is the worst, but on a good sunny day if you are in the neighborhood this is a nice treat. Last time had the hot chocolate and the bread pudding-very tasty, sweet and moist, enough for two to share. I also had their chocolate pot de creme which was amazing. Their croque monsieur is good but a bit on the greasy side and one order is enough for two as the sandwhiches are so big. Last time I had the prosciutto one and it was a bit on the salty side but still very tasty.

My partner is an avocational baker, so Tartine was a "must" on our visit to SF. It reminded me a lot of the Cheese Board's pizza caf in neighboring Berkeley - noisy, crowded, wait for a table, spartan, good food. We had panini sandwiches (Humboldt Fog and Sopressata, respectively) - both were scrumptious, with Sopressata the top fave. (The sandwiches were massive - when we go again, we will order one to share and have them cut it in 2 or 4 pieces.) I had hoped to get a pain au chocolat - but silly me, I waited 'til after our sandwiches, and they were all gone. He who hesitates is, indeed, lost. We did come back for bread at 5pm, and scored a delicious walnut loaf. Yet another definitive SF experience... ADDENDUM. ÊDuring our lunch visit and a subsequent drop-in, we purchased a loaf of walnut bread and several pastries (yes, I did get a pain au chocolat, and my head is still spinning). All the baked goods were absolutely superb - I give the bakery 5 big, buttery stars!

My pastry savvy friend recommended this place to me mentioning the Banana Cream tart and the morning bun. Lines out the doooooooooor. After finally making it inside (which was after a ten minute wait - the cashiers move as fast as they can) I was completely overwhelmed by the choices. You have your typical morning pastries, savory breads and fancy desserts in addition to some hot breakfast entrees and coffee bar. Picked up a roll with baked cheese in it, a medium portion of their bread pudding and a chai latte. THE BEST BREAD PUDDING I EVER HAD. First of all anything with Brioche, I am a sucker for, so please, i'll take a hearty portion of the Brioche bread pudding. Soft but not mushy and a ton of favor, thanks to the sliced peaches on top. My roommate shared her Banana cream tart with me- I'm not particularly a fan of bananas or chocolate but I polished the rest of that thing off for her. I don't know if anyone could eat one by itself because of the richness but sharing is caring. Keep in mind that if you are looking for a place to dine and lounge for awhile, you should be prepared to wait for a table, and a small one at that Êbut Tartine definitely lives up to the hype.

FABulous French Bakery that lives up to the hype. And is worth the line. Yes, I have found a bakery that I actually believe is worth the half hour line, in the scorching heat that took place that weekend I flew up. Everything they had was the real shit, from fruit tart to croissant and quiche to hot pressed sandwiches. I ordered a frangipane croissant with iced tea, and my friends had their quiche, jambon royale et gruyere, and berry tart. Everything was so damn good. My croissant, and I am quite picky about my croissants, was light, flaky, buttery in all the right places. The frangipane was well incorporated into the croissant itself, and it was well made. You wouldn't think that frangipane could be difficult to mess up, but trust me, you'd be wrong. I've had far to many disappointing frangipane tarts/croissants, so to find a bakery that could make it just right, was SUCH a relief. Now, this place is packed, so strategize if you are with a group of friends - take their orders while they hunt down an open table stake it out. Or else, you'll be standing with your plate of food, mingling by the counter for another half hour, and then your sandwich will get cold, and no one wants that.

Delicious sweet-tooth haven attended by many a tourist and staffed by prim, but polite, (and sometimes beardy) hipsters. Try: Mexican Wedding Cookies. Just $0.85 to look like a coke addict with all that powdered sugar covering your face--man, it's just so good. They offer a plethora of baked delights, with croque monsieurs (Americanized) and the like. Eating inside is kind of a crowded experience, but if you're lucky enough to find a table outside, it's lovely. Or, walk to Dolores Park. Who doesn't like pastries in the park? No one.

Ok, so the lines are long, and sometimes there's no where to sit. But, some things are just worth waiting for, then bringing to Dolores Park and enjoying in the SF sun. The pastrami panini is really good. Good, meaty pastrami slices, deliciously melted cheese, and really spicy mustard on Tartine's country loaf. It's pretty magical. It comes cut into 3 sections, which is kind of odd, but it makes the pieces more manageable. Served on the side are pickled vegetables, usually baby carrots. Beware of the cute baby carrot. They are pickled, like really pickled, like soaked in vinegar for a year pickled. Other than that, delightful. The pastries are also good. Croissants and scones are notable and worth trying at least once. I'm avoiding the cakes after the chocolate cake, bought to impress, disappointed. And these were chocolate loving people. It was "too chocolaty in a gross way". The banana cream pie had a decent crust , the inside coated in chocolate to prevent sogginess. But there was no custard. Just loads and loads of banana topped w/ whipped cream and more chocolate. I don't know about you all, but I like the custardy part, and this pie lacked in that department. The prices are a little steep, but worth it when the product is consistently good. Don't expect a cheery, friendly counter-person, and you won't Êever be disappointed.

We've been here twice, with us being impressed on the 1st visit with the one or two items that we ordered (we forget what we ordered exactly) but disappointed on the 2nd visit. ÊThe 3 stars is a reflection of our recent visit. A few years back we tried the croissant, which was very delicious. ÊDuring our 2nd visit we ordered a gougeres which smelled heavenly, but I wasn't impressed. ÊI've never had one before, so I'll admit that my ignorance of what a gourgere is led to my reaction. As for sandwiches, we were very excited to order a pressed sandwich but to our dismay when we got there they were out of bread for sandwiches!! Ê(A bakery out of bread?!) ÊWe ordered a ham croque monsieur, a mushroom one, and a ham quiche. ÊWe were very happy with all three, especially the quiche. ÊDespite the fact that it is basically eggs, cream, cheese, ham, and a buttery crust it seemed very light--we were impressed! ÊMy husband and brother enjoyed their croque monsieurs, but I wasn't blown away, especially the ham one. We finished off with a delicious chocolate pudding. ÊIt was a very nice ending but it's hard to see how a place could not make more than *3/4 * of its lunch/dinner menu not too long after it started serving. ÊWe could understand running out of bread 8, 7, maybe even 6 hours into the afternoon service but we got there at 1, just an HOUR after they started serving lunch. ÊThat was very disappointingand unacceptable.

This place has soooooooooo many pastries and desserts, huge variety. I've actually never heard of this place before, until my friend took me this weekend. I was awed by how much yummies they got, and by how long the lines are. I heard the lines are always really long though, which I'm not surprised about since the stuff is so delicious. So between the 3 of us, we got: +banana creme tart: DELICIOUS!! =P absolute heaven +chocolate hazelnut tart: pretty yummy +double chocolate cake: kinda dry, not what i expected, but still decent +cranberry bread pudding: pretty good +rocher: very delicious =D We devoured all of it...so good, definitely wanna come back to try the rest of the stuff. The only downfall I would say is it's pretty small so it's hard to find a spot to sit. They should build a second floor!

I've been to Tartine a few times and I can't think of a better bakery anywhere. Don't know where it is? Just look for the place with a line out the door and down the block. I got there at 9am when they opened and there was a line out the door. The morning buns are perfect; tasty with a bit of orange zest, and fun to unroll. They do run out by the end of the day, so get them in the morning. Enjoy your day and come back for some fresh baked bread at 5pm. I've had the sesame bread and it was an experience. So much sesame flavor! Perfect on its own, or as toast with your favorite topping. When it comes to the food though, I'm fairly certain that anything you get will be amazing. The bread pudding, oh my, out of this world. So delicious. The tarts and sandwiches are amazing. I hear the croissants are no joke either. Oh yeah, there's Four Barrel coffee if you like Four Barrel, and there's also a coffee bar serving delicious espresso drinks with organic Straus Family Creamery dairy. The only downsides are the lines and getting a seat / moving around inside the restaurant. (There's also some tables and chairs outside.) But hey, if the food is this good, it's got to be expected right? I mean, they were the only restaurant with TWO things on the 7x7 2010 list. Oh yeah, the owners were voted best pastry chefs in America in 2008. 'Nuff said.

I met some friends here for breakfast on a Saturday. After reading reviews, I knew I would be waiting in line. It's a rare occasion if I wait in line for anything. But the wait wasn't horrible and I had good friends to chat with. I split a chocolate croissant and a ham and griere croissant....both were still warm from the oven. Both were also a little flakier and crumbled to tiny pieces. Delicious pieces, but I think a little over cooked. Who cares, though? They were still warm! I also ordered a chocolate hazelnut tart and a coconut macaroon for later. The coconut was terrific. Not too sweet and hit the spot. Haven't had the tart yet. Overall, its a little overrated. But I would go back and I would stand in line again. I'm just not begging to go again tomorrow ... Staff was fast and helpful without being fake or bossy. We even scored a great table outside.

There's not much I could add that hasn't already been said. I have trouble deciding on what to get at Tartine. I love love love their banana cream tarts and chocolate eclairs, as well as the Pecorino and almond pressed panini. The best thing to do is go with friends and get five different things to taste. For a great afternoon, head up a block to Dolores Parl to enjoy the tart in the sun.

I will surely be a regular here. Tried it the first time on Easter weekend and it was FABULOUS! We tried a few things to try to get the lay of the land - ham and cheese croissant (my husband loves these and this is the best he has ever had), a macaroon (spectacular), quiche (really loved the use of seasonal veg and it was just the right creaminess with crisp/flake of the crust) and a hazelnut tart which was the only thing I wasn't totally impressed with. Line was a bit daunting, but it does go pretty fast and you can keep yourself entertained people watching or reading the menu or looking at all the amazing stuff they have. Definately reccomend Tartine.

I went to Tartine in the afternoon, which was an unfortunate time because it was too late for the morning buns, but too early for the bread. We had: Quiche, Prosciutto and Provolone Sandwich, and the Frangipane Tart. The Sandwich was good, but a little too oily. ÊIt was pretty large though, so be aware of that. ÊThe Frangipane tart was good too, but it was hard to get all of the goodness in one bite, as it kept falling apart. Another reason for the loss of star: The atmosphere was a little bit snobbish. ÊMy examples: no continual baking of morning buns (ok, so if it is Êmorning bun, those should be served in the mornings, but since they know people would buy it in the afternoons just to try it, the fact that they don't sort of gave me a "i'm-too-good-for-morning-buns-in-the-afternoon" attitude. ÊAlso, the people behind the counter weren't that friendly.

WEAK! I lived for a year in SF and was always told to go to Tartine for great pastries and desserts. I meant to go while I lived there, but just never got around to it. I was back in SF for a day last week with my wife so we made it a point to visit. We shared a croissant with almond filling and it was definitely one of the worst that I have had in my life. It tasted old, it crumbled in ways that it never should have and it was just not good. It was also WAY overpriced. I honestly didn't care about the prices at Tartine when we ordered because I was confident that it would be good, but I was proven very wrong. Never again will I go here. I just don't get why SF is considered such a great place for food. I understand NYC, but after a year of eating out in SF at some of the highest regarded restaurants, it's quality restaurant and food reputation eludes me. Also, the silly ass hipsters in SF who hang out at places like Tartine look like cloned clowns. I know that many of these people are nice people, but their pretentiousness and personal insecurities exude their every pore. SF has geeky hipsters and LA has plastic. They're both the same, but just in different packages. Just be yourselves and womens jeans on men and black tights with tan boots on women is not original when everyone else is doing it. I'm so glad that we moved and I'll be happy to not go back to SF for a while. Cool city, but not as great as people make it out to be.

I first noticed the burned meringue(which customers may only notice if they have experience making and baking meringue) on two of the cakes in the case, but continued and ordered for our group a spicy turkey sandwich which was huge, expensive and only okay.

4/17/09 - I'm getting Fat. Strawberry Bavarian - Droooooooool Banana Creme Pie - yum! --------------------- Cons: For first time visitors - Not having any identifying name for the bakery from the street. Ê I drove around in circles looking for it until i finally parked and asked a passerby. Ê When I got there on foot... oh yes... that dark blue cafe on the corner with no signs anywhere to identify it; Êok , I get that you want to be cool and have people "recognize" the bakery or restaurant that has no name on it, but really, it certainly was not good for the environment as I wasted 20 minutes worth of gas driving around in circles trying to find it. Poor customer service - the cashier packing my tarts in the bag with the heaviest on top. ÊWhich caused the bag later to fall over twice, smashing the coconut creme pie. ÊThe cashiers always asking if i needed a paper bag when it is obvious I do not have a bag on me nor is it possible to carry 5-6 individual shaped items down the street without dropping it. ÊUnless they thought i was a juggler by profession or could float along in the air. Ê I was disappointed with some of the tarts - coconut creme: the caramel just made it too sweet & heavy and the coconut flakes' large size made its texture too chewy. The hazelnut tart was meh. ÊThe ÊLemon bar was too sour. ÊNot even the powdered sugar on top could help balance it. ÊI really do think this was an awful item. O Why O Why? ÊThe desserts I had at their restaurant was delicious. Ê The pressed sandwiches: Ê Êthe niman ranch pastrami was horrible. ÊLike biting into a giant mouthful of salt. ÊI'm not sure if it was a one time thing due to the particular pastrami they used or if it's the norm (2/27/08). Êthe sopressetta (also in the pros area) was a bit salty. ÊIf they cut the salt level, it would be a really good pressed sandwich. The lonng lines but that can't be helped. Pros: The frangipane pastry Croissant Ham & Cheese Croissant (must be eaten warm/hot!) The pressed sandwich sopressetta was interesting though a bit salty. Ê Lemon tart - flavor was balanced beautifully with the dollop of whipped cream. ÊEach mouthful of lemon tart MUST be eaten with some of the cream, otherwise the tart will not taste very good. ÊThis is an example where two separate flavors create one incredible one. Ê The chocolate pudding was truly delicious. The Lemon meringe...not bad! Êreminded me of the lemon tart where the meringe cuts the tartness of the lemon tart.

Going to Tartine always brings a smile to my face. Dessert lovers (like myself) will go crazy here. All pastries are good, but I definitely recommend the Banana Cream Tart (available everyday except Monday) and the bread pudding, especially when it's heated up. Both items are like heaven in your mouth. For those who need a meal before dessert, you can't go wrong with the croque monsieur topped with Niman ranch ham. One gripe, however: lack of seating. Tables are always taken whenever I go to Tartine so prepare yourselves to be aggressive in finding a seat here.

My friend told me about this place awhile back and the first time I went I was amazed at how many people were willing to stand in such a long line for some pastries! The store front doesn't do a whole lot of TARTINE promotion. I guess it's their way of keeping it a local secret spot! I've tried the morning bun, quiche and chocolate croissant and they were all very tasty! I don't drink coffee or like hot drinks too much so I felt like a 5 year old because I ordered a nice big cup of milk, just MILK. The open faced sandwiches looked delicious but were kinda pricey, so I always cheapen out and go for the crossaint.. Four stars for this place because of the long lines, crowded shop area and lack of seating. But if you're hungry for some hearty breakfast items or pastries and willing to wait! Give it a try!

WHAT DO YOU MEAN THERE IS NO HAM & CHEESE? WTF, I dream about these Ham&Cheese kwasaants, and when I'm able, I try to load up. However, I haven't had one in about 2 months BECAUSE every time I go in, it seems there is some H&C emergency (last time: it was bad weather or something, they burnt the batch, whatever). I'm going through some serious withdrawl and there isn't a damn thing I can do about it. In general though, going to this place is like going through a Herculean ordeal. Yes, there is no parking (you're likely to get a ticket if you park ANYWHERE in the area at ANY TIME), yes you have to stand in a ridiculous line to get into the joint, and yes when you go through all that they may be fresh out of the thing you've been dreaming of. That said, I'll simply quote you the notes I made in my (snobby I know) Zagat guide about their bread pudding with fresh seasonal fruit: "It made me weep with fond memories of my childhood on the farm!"

So I live down the street, and always pass by this place. Its cute and there is always a monstrous line out the door so i keep walking. Today, however, Lovefest was upon us and so the line was fairly short so i perused the fine and tasty looking deserts, tarts, and other cute baked goods. The staff were overly sweet and the charm this place has cannot be put into words. I ordered a mozzarella and tapanade sandwich (which was delicious). You may be asking by now... What the f*ck... why did you give them a low score? REASON: After waiting about 25 minutes for my sandwich i noticed the waitress take a plate off of a table, this plate had been sitting there for about 7 minutes and had been touched by everyone on the table. she then put down a to-go box and removed the sandwich from the table, and apologized to the girl and said the guy in the back had boxed the wrong one... I thought nothing of this until 5 minutes later when the waitress returned to me with my sandwich in a to go box.... the same sandwich that had been sitting on that table, pawed through by 3 other people, and by now cold... to say the least... I did not expect something like that to happen at such a charming place. ÊMost people would have pitched a b*tch fit but I lived in India and that kinda stuff doesn't bother me that much anymore... So I gave this place a 3 cus is ok, but I'm def not yet a fan. perhaps I will go back... if the line is short enough and the whim hits me.

They say the bread makes the sandwich, and so it is no surprise that their sandwiches are phenomenal! I'm not a fan of sweets, so it's kind of weird reviewing a bakery -- but on the sweet note though I can definitely appreciate the bread pudding. Namely, I'm in love with their savory items. - All the grilled sandwiches are a win - I like the open face sandwich just a bit weird to hold - Quiche is quite good too, just make sure you get it extra hot Ordering from there is a little confusing. They take your baked good requests first and then you can pay for it and order your drink at the register Seating is a free for all, so it's smart to have a few friends save seats while the others order.

Over 2000 reviews already, but... just in case you happen to randomly stumble upon mine: Lucked out and stayed at a place literally around the corner one weekend in September. ÊCame on a Monday morning and avoided the weekend hoards. My friend got the quiche, but I still prefer real eggs (with white toast, bacon, sausages, and fresh OJ). ÊSpeaking of which, their real OJ was spectacular, considering I was craving it all weekend (and Nob Hill Grille had let me down). ÊI got a buttermilk scone boxed to bring to a friend for breakfast, which he also thought was "bomb."

I prefer the croissants at Boulangerie Bay Bread on Fillmore and Pine. ÊThey are made with 100% plus-gras butter and cost less than the not-so-good ones at Tartine. ÊThe humongous mutants at Tartine are nothing like real French croissants. Ê I originally went to Tartine for a baguette, since my friend who lives near there told me "Of course they have baguettes. ÊThey're a bakery!" ÊNo, they did not have any baguettes. Ê They did have a lot of American sweets in American portion sizes. Ê So, I'm still looking for a Parisian-style baguette in San Francisco (NOT sourdough, NOT with a chewy leather-like crust)

I do love me some Tartine. Yes oh yes. But: might I suggest to the owners a little clean up of the joint? I don't expect it to be hospital clean with the constant and never-ending stream of customers it sees, but the place just looks...tired. And worn. And the bathroom? Yikes. Come on Elisabeth and Chad! You need to spruce up the interior to match the high quality of the incredibly delicious food!

I came here with a friend/fellow yelper, Olivia Tanquilut at 7:37AM. The store didn't have a big sign and we're both pretty blind so we weren't sure if it was it at first. The line definitely gave it away for us. It was cold and the line went out the door, but BOY WAS ÊIT WORTH EVERY SECOND! The workers were fast and the line moved quickly. I decided to get the morning bun since everyone on yelp raved about it, and the chocolate chip cookie because it was cute and HUMUNGO! The morning bun was MMMM..MMMM..GOOOOOD! I started grabbing at it right after I paid for it since it was still warm. I will never forget that great blend of the crunchy outsides and the fluffy insides. The hint of orange and cinnamon-ey taste in the fluffy area AND the surprising bits and pieces of caramel on the crust was just perfect! I killed that tasty goodness in 5 minutes! The cookie was pretty good, but for $2.25...MEH. It wasn't your traditional chocolate chip cookie. It had an interesting crunchy texture, but the cookie dough and the taste of nuts was a bit overwhelming for my liking. My friend just HAD to get the double chocolate croissant (double pain au chocolat) because she saw it on the food network, but I thought it was mediocre at best. Yes, the fluffy texture was great just like the morning bun, but it just didn't have enough chocolate to be called a DOUBLE chocolate croissant!! Maybe I was expecting too much from a $4.25 croissant; I thought it was comparable to the Starbucks version. I still want to try the tarts, bread pudding, and sandwiches so in the words of Arnold Schwarzenegger...I'LL BE BACK!!

Multiple problems taking place at Tartine. For one, their positive reputation and lines out the door just contribute to their lack of customer service. It's a problem not just at Tartine, but at many of the city's eating and drinking establishments. They survive with a good product and ignore the part about providing that little extra. They take your money and say fuck you at the same time. All the while delivering food that doesn't even warrant that attitude or those prices. I blame this on the owner, who could stand to implement a little change in the atmosphere. This place is constantly crowded, so the employees are worked into the ground and I can sympathize with that. I'm not looking for chit chat or a bubbly greeting, but simply dropping the gruffness would be nice. After that aspect, I was indifferent about the food. People check out Yelp and figure this place will be life altering and have no problem waiting an hour for a couple pastries. Then after the buildup, they eat it in ten minutes and while it's tasty, in the back of their minds they hear that voice chanting "Over-rated." clap clap. clap clap clap. I don't fall into that trap. It's an overpriced bakery with good, but not hour long wait with hipsters everywhere good, stuff. If you can figure out a way to get someone to pick something up for you, that's your best bet. That way, you can simply enjoy the food and not deal with the annoying aspects this place tosses into its business model.

Succesfully shattering the curse of Lady Baltimore, Tartine has clearly seized hold of San Francisco's culinary heart, except for those people who don't want to wait in line to buy bread. Bread is delicious (4.95 is not exactly a bargain) and my clear faves are the croissants of both sweet and savory kinds, the morning bun and, especially for those of you who have German mothers, the Brioche bread pudding with fresh seasonal fruit is delicious enough to make a German mother swoon. ÊIt's kind of hard to go wrong here, though some of their bona-fide tarts may be too rich for some folks (the chocolate hazelnut tart was crazy). Ê Ê Now, it may just me, but I don't recommend the yogurt with meusli , which I am probably spelling wrong, which is fine, because you shouldn't get it. ÊYou will be very, very disappointed, unless you are a masochistic health nut. ÊYou shouldn't even go here, wait in the long line, and jostle for a seat if all you're going to get is some yogurt. ÊIt's kind of like the chicken entree at a fancy restaurant. Tartine could improve by replicating, and not by creating the expensive savory non pastry version they made on Valencia. ÊThere just needs to be more Tartine old schools. ÊI can only hope the former Danish cookie place (who, incidentally always had cookies for Diabetics) under construction will magically reopen as another Tartine. ÊGo 18th Street!

It took 2 years to decide but the verdict is, Mr. Bittman are you high? ÊDid the butter go straight to your head? Ingredients are fresh, yes. ÊAppearance? oh yes, I'd like me some of that. ÊBut what is up with the super sizing and the not so subtle handling of butter? ÊIt took me and and my honey 3 days to finish the bread pudding which was as heavy as a brick. ÊAnd those croissants are huge! ÊThey are Hummer sized compared to the Go car sized croissants you usually get in France.

I saw this place on Food Network's The best thing I ever ate. The Pain Au Chocolat was featured on it as the best thing this one Chef ever ate. Well I love CHOCOLATE and Croissants so this was a must try for me. My boyfriend and I got here around 11am on a Thursday. The line wasn't too bad but it was a little bit out the door. Seating is limited. It's very much like a coffee shop with an amazing bakery inside. Of course my boyfriend and I tried the Double Pain Au Chocolat. I also ordered two regular croissants to take home for my parents. OMG. To Die For! It was so crispy and the chocolate was divine! It was really flakey and I got it all over the place including my hair. So ladies, be careful! LOL. It was very buttery and it had the perfect amount of chocolate to croissant. I just wish it was warm. I loved it and I cant wait to be back and try all their other yummy goodies.

This place is so good, I make sure to stop here on my drive from Los Angeles to Oregon.

I would eat three of them if I didn't live in LA and care about being skinny. The orange cinnamon sugar on top is sublime. Love the bustling cafe atmosphere and the do it yourself vibe.

Came here by everyone's recommendation since they all know we love bread. ÊTuesday at lunchtime saw no line. ÊWe ordered a regular croissant, a chocolate pain (croissant stuffed with bitter chocolate), and their two signature dishes: the bread pudding and the morning bun. ÊThe morning bun was like a scone or something that was drowned in sugar and orange zest. ÊGood but a bit much.

Yes it always seems too crowded and unsmiling and just not worth the effort, but we should all treat ourselves more often to their pressed paninis, open-faced cheesy asparagus toasty concoctions, banana cream tarts, and croissants. Even if you're out of cash, just scrabble around for loose change and you can get a scrumptious 40-cent meringue cookie. I can't judge their coffee because I'm always too distracted by what I'm eating but it seems above average. Added goodwill for having a cute-as-a-button name that's French without causing awkward pronunciation dilemmas.

The line always sucks, but there's a legitimate reason for its existence. If all you want is a latte or some other caffeinated (or alcoholic) beverage, you can just go straight to the coffee counter to avoid the wait. Easy. However, if you're craving the orangy, sugary goodness of a morning bun (and you should be yearning for it if you've ever had one); or if you want to roll around in a pile of luscious bread pudding (which is a little strange, but to each his own), you'll just have to wait in line. Or wait ON line, as some of my non-Californian friends like to say. It's worth it. If you can't decide, just close your eyes and point at the glass. The other end of your finger will be zoomed in on something amazing. Just don't press your face against the aforementioned glass and fog it up as you moan, "Yummm..." They won't like that very much. Not that I know from personal experience or anything.

I'm very wary of heavily rated eateries and am aware that hype does not necessarily guarantee a good experience. That being said, I was surprised, VERY surprised that I find myself wanting to go back again and again to eat all their delicious baked and bread-y goodness. Don't be daunted by the huge line out the door. It won't take more than 15-20 minutes and it gives you plenty of time to soak it all in and think about your order. For me at least, I need A LOT of time to think about my order so the extra wait is perfect. Once you get inside, you are greeted with beautifully made cakes and tarts, frangipanes, enticing pastries, scones and breads. Everything is made by highly skilled bakers hands who must really do some amazing baking magic in the back kitchen. Albeit PRICEY (expect to pay about $4 -7 per order), everything is beautiful, delicious and something worth savoring and experiencing. Here is a run-down of the shamelessly long list of things I've tried: Morning Bun -- a brioche-like sweet bun with a hint of orange and cinnamon. Almond Croissant -- amazing!!! This croissant is just so... so damn good. You bite into it and the layers just shatter because they're so delicate and flaky. The almond filling is velvety and chunky, not gooey and pasty like many almond croissants can be. Be careful though, once you have Tartine's Almond Croissant, it's hard to go back to anything else. Quiche -- you can taste the creamy egginess, which is a good measure of a high-quality quiche. Comes in vegetable or with ham. Croque Monsieur and their other sandwiches -- Made fresh with seasonal and local ingredients like cow-girl creamery cheese. They're all savory and delicious. Comes on their HIGHLY COVETED Tartine Bread Tartine Bread -- this is QUITE a loaf of bread. You have to call in and pre-order and pick it up at 4:30PM. There is no room for error for this order. Quite fussy right? But it's so worth it. The intense yeasty aroma, beautiful crust and unfathomable spongy, porous texture still haunts me today. Once you have this bread you can die happy. Frangipane tart -- almondy, fruity tarty goodness. I bought the mini sized one which is perfect to share with a couple people (or for yourself!). As you can see, I love this place. If I had the budget, the metabolism and just an ounce more of fanaticism, I'd probably eat here everyday.

Oh, Tartine - can't you be a little more inventive? Yes, your items are very good and yes we bring all of our town guests here.

Have been there so many times yet to write about them because I am afraid if I write more good things about them, then the line will get longer! This is my favorite bakery in San Francisco. Every time I walk in, I just want to tell the person behind the counter, "please, just one each. Yes you heard me. One of each kind." With my iron will, I suppress the urge to say that but one day....one day....when INS decides to deport me... OK, even I like every single thing in Tartine, I do have one or two favorites. The passion fruit cake and the lemon cream tart are Êmust-haves if you like fruity kind of cake\dessert. I think they have the best passion fruit mousse, better than the one from citizen cake. The hot-pressed sandwiches are yummy also. Very crunchy with a lot of cheese. It's a 4.5 from me also. The only deduction is coming from the coffee. Really not so tasty coffee. I would rather get coffee from Ritual or Dynamo or Philz Coffee.

The fruit, the cream, the egginess... 3) The morning buns-- so buttery, sugary, cinnamony... 4) The sandwiches-- they're greasy, rich, flavorful, dense, decadent... and they come with those cute little pickled carrots. 5) Honestly, just standing in line staring at the pastries, cakes, cookies, food... is the most pleasant form of agony I can imagine. I change my mind 12 times while I'm waiting. OK, the line sucks, although it tends be a cheerful crowd, so long as the weather is good.

This place is freaking expensive - $40 for two sandwiches, a slice of cake, and two lemonades. But given the over 2k reviews (we're talking an Ike's Place level of hysteria here) - I had to go regardless of the price. I love Tres Leches cake, and I have yet to find a place that can match my homemade version (based on http://icuban.com/food/tÉ) so I had to try Tartine Bakery's interpretation. But it was lunch time, and no matter how insane my sweet tooth, I needed something more substantial. So I also got a sandwich with Prosciutto and Provolone. What's the verdict? The Tres Leches cake was good, but still couldn't match my homemade version. I found the coconut milk and cajeta cheese additions quite innovative - but ultimately it did not have the milkiness and moistness I expect from a Tres Leches cake. The sandwiches were better. The bread is amazing, as was the cheese and all the other ingredients. There was more butter in the sandwich than in Paula Deen's kitchen, but god damn the end result was worth it. Furthermore, the sandwich was huge - it actually lasted me for 3 meals. And I'm not a light eater or anything. Ultimately, the food was quite good here. But I can't give it 5 stars due to the high prices, so I have to drop a star due to the fact that a lunch for two will cost you the price of a kidney.

oh this place rocks! ÊSome of the best baked goods you will find anywhere! ÊWe came here for a light brunch the other day and it was packed! ÊThe line moved pretty well but the communal style seating is quickly swallowed up. ÊGot the frangipane croissant ($4.25) which was incredible! ÊFilled with some type of almond flavored cream! ÊAlso got the croque monsieur ($9.75) which was also quite good. ÊIt was topped with an asparagus, ham, bechamel and gruyere. ÊA must visit spot while in the Mission district!

The cause of my weight gain over the summer. To be more specific, it was the perfect bread pudding, the sweet mexican wedding cookies, the rich chocolate scharffen berger pudding, the tender croissants, the delicious tarts....the muesli probably wasn't a cause but I didn't like that.

I love this place (remind me to thank my sister). ÊYeah, it takes a long time to get in (at times) and even longer to get a table. ÊI don't get why the coffee is at a separate station, and then you have to schlep all the way to the other corner of the room to get sugar and cream, but it is what it is. The bread pudding is excellent and the chocolate croissants rock. ÊI'm sure everything else is good, but those two are my kryptonite. Bottom line - highly recommended. On a lazy, sunny Sunday morning, there's no other place I'd rather be in SF.

My friend has been dying to try this place for a while, and today was her chance! She got a lemon tart, which was really expensive at about $6, but when we all got to try a little bit, I'd say it was probably worth those six bucks. I love lemony things, but another friend who doesn't tend to like lemony things that much even liked it, so that says a lot about this lemon tart. The crust was perfect and I think there was probably a bit of orange rind in the lemon filling too. Mm...so good. While waiting in line for the bathroom, we saw a lot of huge loaves of bread that looked soooo good. Should try those sometime! I think I still like Masse's Pastries in Berkeley better, though.

I waited patiently in line for about 10 to 15 minutes from the time I arrived to the time I paid for my mother's lemon meringue birthday 'cake'. It was a spectacular surprise, although I had to fork 30USD for something I could have paid half that price elsewhere... needless to say, the quality was divine. It is heavenly fluffy and incredibly sweet, just the way you want your meringue and it still had a bit of a bite towards the end of it. I say if you enjoy well prepared desserts and don't mind having to wait in line, come in to Tartine and have a seat. There's outside seating as well on the side to enjoy a sunny afternoon for those lounging around although be forewarned, it is ALWAYS crowded therefore if you come with a group be sure to hunt down chairs.

Came here for a late lunch on a Saturday with some friends... Êsince we were starving we decided to try their Pressed Sandwiches as well as their desserts. Ê To start, because we were famished... Ê Frangipane Tart: Light almond-cream filling baked in a flaky pastry shell with seasonal fruit. Ê -- I gotta say, it didn't look THAT appealing especially since I was expecting fresh fruits, but the fruit was baked and it just looked dry. ÊOh, how appearances deceive!!!! ÊThe tart was flaky, but still moist and delicious!! ÊYou can definitely taste the almond, but it wasn't overpowering and best of all, not too sweet. Ê The pressed sandwiches were all made with freshly baked bread, which was a definite plus in my book! Spicy Turkey Pressed Sandwich: Peppered turkey breast, provolone, broccoli rabe pesto. -- Spicy? ÊI must have missed it, but it doesn't take away from this delicious sandwich. ÊThe broccoli rabe pesto with the turkey was just heavenly. ÊOnly thing I would change about this sandwich is probably using a different cheese. ÊI felt the provolone got lost in the flavors and instead just made the sandwich a little muddle towards the end. Pastrami Pressed Sandwich: Niman Ranch pastrami, horseradish, gruyere -- Good sandwich, could definitely use a bit more pastrami. ÊThe horseradish and gruyere were a good choice, but the pastrami itself, I've had better... so overall I wasn't too impressed with this sandwich. Ê Prosciutto & Provolone: San Daniele Prosciutto with dressed arugula. -- Probably the most unimpressive sandwich of the 3 we chose, then again it is just prosciutto & provolone. Overall, delicious place! ÊIf parking wasn't such a pain, it wasn't hot as heck inside and crowded, I would definitely come back every time I visited SF.

You'll probably have to wait 10-15minutes and add 10-15minutes to look for parking around Dolores but it's worth it. You'll need the 10 minutes anyways to narrow down your order after seeing the food displayed before you. I just wanted to order one of everything. Settled on a slice of tres leches, chocolate eclair, and cup of brioche bread pudding. All so tasty. We ate the bread pudding first while it was warm - amazing normally I'm not a soggy bread fan but this I'd eat again. Tres leches melted in my mouth and was even good the day after. Chocolate eclair chocolate was perfect. Pair it all with a latte, that you can get conveniently inside the bakery itself. Perfection I tell ya, just perfect.

This place is my favorite bakery in the city, no doubt. I go there almost every time I go to the city. Love their cakes, their croissant, their quiche, their bread, the list goes on... Their coffee is decent too. I will indulge myself with a cup of latte and a delightful pastry every time I go there, not to mention get a few items to go. There is ALWAYS a line there.

Too bad Yelp does not have half stars because this definitely deserves a 3.5, but it's not solid enough to round up to 4 stars. The line wrapped around the building when we arrived after lunch.

So my husband has a thing for chocolate croissants...he's crazy about them! When I saw the television show the best thing I ever ate featuring desserts. One of the chefs had mentioned Tartine Bakery supposedly had the best chocolate croissant EVER and sure enough they DO! I managed to roll out of be early Saturday morning to wait in line at 7:45am just to get my hands on a few pastries. YES I said a few...since I was going all the way there for croissants I might as well Êsample more than just one item right. HaHa. So after waiting in line for about 25min it was finally my turn to order...everything smelled so heavenly and I wanted it all. What I really ended up getting was chocolate croissants (EXCELLENT), morning bun (EXCELLENT), scone (EXCELLENT), chocolate chip cookie (EXCELLENT)...lol yes everything I bought from there turned out to be so savory, sweet and so perfect! I spent the next two hours at the gym but it was well worth it! The pastries are a little pricey but a good treat once in a while! I will def be back again!

When I went to Tartine, all I ordered was a croissant. The croissant was crispy and flaky which is how I like my croissants! The only reason I'm giving Tartine 3 stars rather than a 4 or 5 is because 1. ÊThe croissant was a little pricey in my opinion. 2.

Amazing Bakery! My wife and I went here during an anniversary trip to San Fran this past summer. We were shocked at the line wrapping itself around the corner (at first we thought it was a food kitchen line since there is a church nearby). The wait was about 30-40 minutes but we were encouraged by reviews we read on Yelp and the testament of a huge line. We had an assortment of treats: an eclair, a fresh berry torte, a morning bun, a gougre, and strawberry bread pudding. The gougre was possibly Êour favorite items; so light and fluffy, but packed full of flavor. The morning bun didn't make a lasting memory, but the rest was above par. Helpful Hint: Mission Dolores Park is only a block away making it a perfect picnic place! Tartine was so wonderful we went back the next day with my sister we picked from the airport. Since we went a little later in the day we were able to eat from the lunch menu. All the sandwiches were amazing; a little greasy since they are grilled, but so worth it (I don't remember the 3 sandwiches we shared). We also had a lemon tart, another gougre:) a big slice of tres leche cake, and I may be forgetting one or two items. I must say, I was pleasantly surprised by the tres leche, it was very light and creamy and did not have an overly coconutty flavor. My sister ordered some coffee drink (latte maybe?) and it came in a huge bowl-like cup. I attempted to order the same drink, but the barista was talking with his friend about tennis or raquetball and didn't really help with my order. The friend was a customer so I'm not counting it against them, I just ended up with a different cup of coffee. Tartine is so good we are planning on going back in December. We live in Tahoe but planned our flight out of San Francisco so we would have an excuse to visit again! I'm sure they will come through again. TSA better let us take our pastry boxes through security!

Line started outside the caf when we first arrived, but we only had to wait for approximately 5mins before we got to order. ÊSo it was a short wait. I got the Chai Latte and mushroom with tomato quiche. ÊThe quiche was not bad and the Chai Latte was pretty good. ÊNot too many places served Chai Latte, so I was really happy to find out they served it here. ÊThe Latte was served in a large ceramic bowl (not cup). ÊIt was really nice and comforting (perfect for our first stop in sf). My friends got the fruit bread pudding, morning bun, lemon cream tart and the chocolate croissant. ÊThey all seem to like it a lot. ÊThe environment was casual and relaxing with a lot of sf locals.

Thoughts as I break of a piece of my chocolate croissant that a co-worker brought in for being asked to come to work at 8:30am--after never having tried anything from this bakery: "The paper bag it came in is clear...... ummm.... thats a warning sign, I wonder how many calories..........." *Takes a bite* "OHH DAMN, WHO CARES...." EDIT: I didn't finish it, it was just TOO RICH... There was about a quarter left of it when it started staring back, teasing me if I was insane enough to finish the whole thing. Now it is 4pm and I am hungry, wishing I could taste that chocolate croissant once again.... =/

Is Tartine the universal code name for baked goodness? My brother somehow convinced me to navigate through the one way craziness of downtown to visit the bakery in the morning and I have to admit I'm now officially hooked to their lemon meringue cake. They are perfectly tangy, lemony, and plain heavenly. The soft sponge layers perfectly compliments the zesty lemon layers with just a hint of caramel. It's simply pure heaven. The other stuffs that we tried are also top notch. Honorable mentions goes to their warm, flaky croissants and their quiche. A must try for anyone in the area.

I love baked goods. Buttery, rich, flaky, and savory are words that elicit pavlovian-responses in me, and Tartine has obliged in spades. I suppose, unlike many people in the city, my first visit to Tartine was not influenced by glowing reviews. In fact, it was suggested rather spontaneously by a coworker who mispronounced the name as "Tartan's." ÊThat said, I had no expectations, just the hope that the tiny bakery around the corner would be a place I could frequent. I now travel from Nob Hill to the Mission just to indulge in some Tartine-goodness from time to time. It's not a place I would ever want to abuse by visiting too often; but make no mistake, the urge is there. What I don't find compelling is the line I often have to bear just to get my eager paws on a ham and gruyere croissant, a morning bun, or some fanciful little cookies. Yea, the staff appears a bit stand-offish, but they've always been warm when it's my turn to order, and they're not to be blamed for wanting to keep things breezy and efficient when the line stretches up the street. And all that matters to me is how my world dissolves into bliss when I get a fresh croissant. Hundred-dollar phone bill... huh? Unpaid credit card bills... hm? Rent due next week... wha? Hammmmm.... cheeeeeese.... all melty and warm, just like a lover's arms. I once encountered a woman in line who was visiting on business from France. She was attending anger management classes because American standards of etiquette are more delicate than those of France. She then demanded that I hold her spot in line, hushed a fellow patron's dog, and sat at a table made for four all by herself. I never did learn what she thought of Tartine after her meal, but she left her plate clean, and I was to afraid to talk to her about anything. Tartine may not blow your mind, but it is a solid experience if you're looking for a pastry or dessert that is above average. Nasty and fabulous French woman aside, I often return, and have not been disappointed.

I've been wanting to come here for so long... Approximately 5 years now. And I can't tell if the suspense has been built up for so long that my taste buds were expecting something spectacular or what. But I cant help but say that I was slightly disappointed. I'm definitely gonna need to try Tartine again and this time try several options... The one dessert I did happen to try while on my virgin trip was the banana creme pudding tart. The actual creme and banana was enjoyable, but I found the crisp shell way too hard. Perhaps I came too late in the day?? (3pm) and perhaps the dessert had been sitting out for way too long? Who knows... The shell was so crisp that every time I tried cutting into it, the flakes would pop off and shoot off onto the table and worse, sometimes the floor! I wound up eating the tart as a bowl with a spoon... :-( Guess I'll just have to come back again!!

If I closed my eyes and you put one of their CROISSANTS (http://www.yelp.com/userÉ) in one of my palms and a brick in the other, I wouldn't be able to tell the difference. Those things are heavy! They probably weigh (no joke) a pound each. Heftiness aside, they are pretty tasty. Very nicely browned and flaky crust (my favourite part - I've actually eaten just the crust of a croissant before), but a little too dense for me. I came here at 5:30pm one Monday afternoon and they were sold out of morning buns (makes sense since it was WAY past morning) and banana cream tarts. Sadness :( I would come in the morning, except that a little thing called "my job" gets in the way (need those regular paychecks to feed my pastries habit!) I also got their bread pudding with apples and rocher with cocoa nibs. The BREAD PUDDING (http://www.yelp.com/userÉ) was OK. It was sweet and moist, but kinda mushy and didn't have much texture. I prefer the dessert bread puddings I get at restaurants (especially with chocolate!) The ROCHER (http://www.yelp.com/userÉ) was actually really good. It looks like a lump of dried, cracked, white poop but tastes heavenly (it's basically a meringue). The bitterness of the cocoa nibs balance really nicely with the sweetness of the meringue. I'm pretty sure I instantaneously gained a few pounds after that croissant though...

I really want to love this place. ÊMaybe once upon a time it was great. ÊI still go there about once a week...just because it's on my way to work and I live close enough I can stop in when there's not really a line. Here's what's good: 1. bread pudding 2. cream 3. morning buns (when not burnt) 4. banana cream tart (not sure if it's the cream on top of it) Here's what can be improved (speaking generally for all pastries): 1. light, fluffy, flakiness 2. moistness 3. speaking specifically for croissants and morning buns, please don't burn them! I'm guess I'm thankful I don't love Tartine. ÊIf I did, I might be 300 lbs.

I have two things competing for the opportunity to kill me first: cancer and cholesterol. Tartine Bakery is giving cholesterol an unfair competitive advantage. Fresh out of the oven ham and cheese croissants are the Angelina Jolie of foodstuff. ÊTheir pillowy full lips and come-hither looks just scream "sex" so loudly I ignore the fact that they also scream "heart attack". The pastrami sandwich isn't doing my arteries any favors, but the crispy and chewy cheese encrusted bread on the outside and strong horseradish on the inside come together to make one of the most sophisticated and tasty pastrami sandwiches I've ever had. Then there's the Tartine bread. ÊIt's only available after 5pm and quickly sells out. ÊIt's worth whatever it takes to get a loaf. ÊYou will be handed a simple brown bag and feel the warmth of the freshly baked bread inside. ÊYou will feel the delicate perfection that is the thin crispy crust and fluffy chewy interior. ÊThis is quite possibly the best bread in the world. ÊI whisk it home with excitement, counting the minutes until I can slather it with exotic high cholesterol French cheeses. Ê Ê Tartine may prove to be the cause of my untimely demise, but they will put me to rest with a smile on my face.

I called in sick to work just so I could visit Tartine Bakery. ÊAfter reading all of the reviews I was paranoid, downright scared that the line would stretch 1/2 a mile down the street and I would never, ever have the pleasure of tasting this establishment's tasty treats. Ê My email to work went something like this: Me: ÊDue to flu like symptoms, (translation: chocolate cravings) I will be unable to come in today (it's Monday, do you realize that most people will skip Tartine today and the wait will only be 20 minutes?). Ê I will be at home recuperating and resting Ê(I'll be stuffing myself with whatever baked treats I can get my grubby hands on). ÊI'll make sure to drink lots of fluids, (I'll indulge in every known variation of coffee/espresso that they have to offer) and I'll make sure to nap as often as possible. Ê(I'll probably pass out from a sugar/carbohydrate overdose so don't bother waking me. I plan on coming in on Tuesday (with a big smile on my face and a bag of goodies from Tartine that I'll devour at my desk). Have a nice day. Ê I indulged in a slice of chocolate heaven, an iced coffee and a great book. ÊI love the self serve approach to getting water and busing your own table. ÊI'll be back but I won't use a sick day.

This place is good, but I just don't really get all the hype or the massive line out the door. ÊSeems like they're pretty famous for their bread pudding so I tried that thinking I can't go wrong since so many people were ordering it....DISGUSTING with a capital D. ÊI had to throw it out. ÊYuck! ÊWay too soggy and sweet. ÊMaybe I'm not a bread pudding person. But I also tried their oatmeal something cookie, the macaroons, the lemon bar, and the pumpkin bread. ÊAll good (Lemon bar was the best I've ever had actually), but nothing that marked it amazing or better than other bakeries I've been to. ÊAnd prices are outrageous! Ê$4 for a lemon bar? Ê$5 for a slice, a SLICE of pumpkin bread? ÊI've gotten a whole loaf of pumpkin bread for that much and it actually tasted better elsewhere. Ê So I recommend going here if you're in the neighborhood, but it's not a place that I would recommend going out of your way for.

There's a reason why I bring visiting friends from the East Coast to this place: because it's freakin' amazing. They lament that there's no equivalent in their neighbourhoods. That's because San Francisco's pretty great. While it is a little difficult (and painful) to go into Tartine with my moderately high gluten intolerance, I just step up the classiness a bit by eating their Valhrona chocolate pudding...for breakfast. It's better than (insert some nasty action here). And it definitely doesn't hurt that they serve Four Barrel coffee alongside their offerings. I can only stomach a little bit of gluten, so I sneak a bit of Morning Bun when I can. Yum.

I usually come here for a Pain au Jambon on the weekend. Sunday morning I showed up and I just couldn't stand the idea of standing in that line. It's actually never as bad as it looks, but it just bugs me... c'mon people, it's obscenely early on a Sunday morning... GO BACK TO BED! So instead I stopped by this morning -- Monday -- on my way to work. Lo and behold, I got movie star parking right out front and walked right up to the counter to order. I *almost* ordered a Gougere, but at the last minute decided that I needed my jambon fix. Oh, so good.

I'd give this place 3.49. While the name suggests it's French, but many of their items are decidedly very American (moist croissants, cream pies, etc). I was caught off guard for that. Nothing wrong with American bakery staples, in fact their pies are pretty darn scrumptious. I was disappointed with croissants. So I'd go here for more "American" stuffs. Not my favorite bakery, but I'd give this place another try, if I can find a parking!

Yes, only 3 stars. Why? One reason. The staff tend to have an attitude. Why? Who knows, but it gets old. I lived one block away and never quite understood the stand-offish and hipsteresque vibe, but whatever. Great pastries, snobbish staff. Which is too bad, because it makes everyone in line way too pushy and somewhat panicked. Sometimes I just want to yell: "EVERYONE JUST RELAX!" If they could just loose the "higher-than-thou" mentality, I'd probably say this is hard to beat. Sadly, they don't really care, but they make really good almond croissants.

Just can't imagine a more perfect desert place. 4 barrel coffee and fresh pastry. This place has the line that you would respect in a highly popular mission spot but they are very organized and the line moves at a decent pace. What I appreciate the most in a place (other than a good product) is employees who take pride in what they are selling. I had my eye on the Bread Pudding and a Lemon Tart. I asked the guy behind the counter to help break the tie and he told me that the Bread Pudding had been sitting around for a while so it is not a good example of it at it't best. He recommended the Tart, which was a bad-ass tart with a crispy buttery crust, creme, and a lavender flower. I enjoyed my tart outside on a beautiful day, with a perfectly made cappuccino. Yep, I know, life is rough.

This is another one of those places I have to ask "Why the constant line?" Yes, it's the only place of it's kind in the neighborhood. Ê(Read ... any pastry chef worth their muster could make a killing anywhere nearby.) ÊThe pastries are good, but just good. ÊMy bread pudding is way better. ÊTable seating is extremely limited and to be truthful the outdoor seating is crappy. ÊCrammed onto the sidewalk at the corner of busy car traffic, constant pedestrians and smelly bums is not a pleasant place to eat even if the food is good. ÊI really don't get the fascination. ÊWe always get ours to go that is if the line isn't insane which is not often. ÊIt's also not cheap. The service is at best abrupt. ÊI get they are constantly busy and the crowd can be annoying. ÊHow long must one stand in line before they can make a decision about ordering? ÊStill, it doesn't excuse the need for smiles and a welcoming attitude. Given that it's the only business of it's kind for quite literally over a mile around, it's better than no french bakery in the hood. ÊI really do wish someone would open some real competition nearby. ÊIt would ease the crowds and cause Tartine to step up its game in terms of food and cost.

I love every last bit of Tartine. ÊThe long line gives me plenty of time to contemplate the outdoor temperature; anticipate the mounds of pastries I can almost sort of see through the crowds of people; finally stare adoringly at said pastries; think through all of the possible items I might actually buy; order one of the very few selections I inevitably end up choosing between; and stare adoringly at pastries a little longer. Ê I've sat a few times, but mostly I stand at the bar facing the window while I slowly devour (if devouring is something that one can do slowly) whatever I've purchased. ÊThe crowds, random conversations, street noise, the wait and the hassle of it all only make Tartine better. ÊPastries like that (and by "that" I mean both that tasty and that chock full of butter) should be hard-won.

The wait: I got in line at 11:45am. I didn't leave the bakery with all my goodies until 12:45pm. ÊWe didn't bother waiting for a seat because it was close to being "packed". The bf gets annoyed waiting in line but he sucked it up and devoured his goodies. The items we selected: 1] Frangipane Croissant (Frangipane I learned from Wikipedia means Almond filled). ÊIt was a blueberry/almond filled. ÊYUM. 2] Chocolate Croissant. Melted chocolate in your mouth and BF said it was still warm. 3] Croque Monsieur -Open face sandwich made with our Country bread, bechamel, gruyre, thyme and pepper. ÊTopped with either smoked Niman Ranch ham or seasonal vegetables. ÊServed with house-made pickles. I liked the BF's sandwich more than this one. 4] Jambon Royale & Gruyere hot pressed sandwich. ÊYUM but raelly buttery and fatty. 5] Coffee and a Earl Grey tea. 6] Pickled and spicy heirloom carrots. ÊSo good! Experience: My first visit to Tartine and I think they need a better "waiting in line" system. I didnt know there was a separate line for the "drinks". You can merely just walk up to the counter and order your drink while you wait in line for the pasteries. Ê Would I go back? I just wanted to check out to see what the hype is about since they have a cookbook out in stores and all.

Very overrated. The cashier's rudeness sealed their fate as an unprofessional establishment. The friand we got was dry and stale (overbaked or day old perhaps?) and the croissant was dry, heavy as bread. ÊThe TJ's frozen croissants (made by Jean-Yves Charon) are light years better.

Tartine Bakery's Morning Sticky Bun w/a Cafe Latte would be one of my top 2 reasons I move to SF. Tartine is totally worth the hype and waiting in line, it moves fast, especially if you know what you want. A couple of things I've tried: coconut passion fruit cake - the passion fruit creme isn't as sour as most others, and leaves a refreshing feeling on your tongue that goes well with the cake/coconut flakes. mexican wedding cookie - not as buttery as most, very crumbly and delish. made with walnuts. bread pudding - not a huge fan of bread pudding to begin with, but i wanted to try it because everyone else had a bowl of it. suprisingly good, very filling though. besides the horrendous parking... this place is perfect! ::edit:: went back for breakfast. ham quiche: baked to perfection... the other quiche was just ok. morning bun: glazed with orange marmalade and sprinkled with a little sugar. w/a latte... mmm..

Stopped by here after getting ice cream at Bi-Rite down the street to see what all the fuss was about. There was a line going out the door, but it moved quickly. The inside is a cute little cafe-like bakery with a small display case of cakes, tarts, and pastries. Unfortunately, they were out of almost everything (including the banana cream pie, which I was dying to try). I settled for a slice of the chocolate tea cake, which was deliciously dense, moist, and rich in flavour. Everything was reasonably priced, and it looked like a good place to sit back and relax over a cup of tea. I would definitely go back to try other pastries.

Ah, croque monsieur, how you allude me! I have been to Tartine four times now and I still haven't tried the one dish that makes me drool just thinking about it. (Once I was there after lunch so no room for croque monsieur and three other times when it openend and they hadn't made them yet.) We will meet one day and I'm sure I will love you. Until then, here's the lowdown of what I've had so far: FYI, I'm not a complete glutton. I shared the following items on each visit, so I got to try a lot of things :). Lemon tart - This is one of my favorite deserts in general so I was amazed to try Tartine's version. Hands down the tastiest, creamiest lemon tart I've ever had. Comes topped with whipped cream and pieces of pomegranate. Totally recommend this one. Morning bun - Sweet and buttery. It was actually too rich for me to eat in the morning. Or maybe it was the hangover... Not sure. Delicious, but be prepared for this one! Cranberry scone - Super crunchy on the outside with lovely bursts of sweetness from the sugar sprinkled on top. Great breakfast staple if you're into American style scones. I'm a fan of scones of the British/Australian persuasion (they're soft) so I probably won't have them again. Quiche - Creamy, cheesy, tasty, delicious. I had a couple different kinds and enjoyed them all. Highly recommend this one. Bread pudding - The upside was that it was delicious. Not sure what fruit it was topped with (tasted as if an apple and pear had babies) but the fruit was awesome. We only got the small cup portion but it was pretty big and would easily satisfy most people. Only downside was that the pudding was a bit cold for my liking. Lemon poppyseed cake - Great choice for breakfast. I wasn't thrilled by it, but then again it's not my thing. Banana bread - Super yummy. One of the best banana breads I've ever tasted. Best way I can describe it is "fancy". It was fancy banana bread. Kinda cool. Almond croissant - OMG was that buttery, flaky and rich. Just like the morning bun, be ready for a butter overdose. If you can handle it, go for it, but be advised - your ass will expand by at least three inches as a result of eating. ÊSo worth it though... You have been warned. In addition to the great pastries, they also have a decent tea selection. I can recommend the rooibos or green tea and mint. All in all, regardless of how crazy the line is, Tartine pastries are worth the wait.

Lemon bar was okay, tasted a little eggy. Beyond disappointed with the tres leches cake - wtf was that? It just tasted like whipping cream shoved between cake layers.

The greatest bakery in the Bay Area. Fantastic rustic-French pastries, bread pudding (sweet and occassionally a savory variety as well), simple sandwiches, tarts, and coffee. Cappucinos - second best cappucinos in the city (bested only by Cafe Trieste), but certainly best foam anywhere. You can take a knife and cut through the foam, it's that thick. I used to recommend going early to beat the rush, but Tartine is full from opening through close. Don't go expecting to hang out either -- eat, drink, and get out. The line snakes out the door and there's always a queue to get in and for seating. We're all waiting on another location to open to address the obvious pent up demand. How about several more locations - maybe one in Pacific Heights, one in SOMA, one in the Marina.

I went here for the first time last Saturday. It's definitely a popular place. I can't say that Tartine rocked my world though lol. I shared one of the opened faced sandwiches and a pastrami sandwich with two other people. Yes, they were decent, but nothing I would care to eat again. I also tasted the eclair. The eclair was very rich and chocolaty. So it's good if you're into that kind of thing. Ê I feel a little cheated out of my first experience at Tartine. So I'll visit again and try different things next time.

For being someone who is not a super big fan of rich chocolate or super sweet dessert items, this place was really good. Parking was a b*Tch!! We probably made like 3-4 circles around the block until we found a tiny one. Either way, we made the car fit and proceeded to wait in line. the line was about 15 deep but being their for the first time, I knew it was worth it to wait. If the stuff tasted like shiet, I wouldn't think people would wait for it. So that's a plus! We ordered the meyer lemon tart, banana cream tart, and blueberry almond tart. The total bill came out to be 18 something since they were about 18 bucks. It was a little pricey but it was all worth it. The banana cream tart was so effing good! It was perfect. The bananas were fresh and not too mushy. The crust was nice and flakey and tehre was alot of crust. It wasn't too sweet where you feel like you just ate a pound of sugar. On top of it, they put large shavings of chocolate and it was so good!!! Then the meyer lemon tart had a few pomegranate seeds on it and this was not too lemony so it was awesome. The shell was pretty thin so it worked well. It was just heavenly while eating it. I loved it Anyhow, i think the drip coffee here is pretty good also since everyone had one. I'm cutting back on my caffiene intake so i didn't have it. I think it's a nice place to bring some friends and chill. will go back!

I love the almond croissant and fruit tart (raspberry is my favorite, but they only put on what's fresh). Ê Why is there always a line? ÊI bought their recipe book to avoid this but you'll see me back in line on the weekends. Great place to pick up goodies if you're visiting friends.

Croque monsier. That's what I had. I remember cause I couldn't pronounce it. But, the harder it is to pronounce, the yummier it will be, yeah? I wasn't far off - the croque monsier was an open top sandwich with your choice of topping, and it was really tasty! Just by looking at the sandwich though, I thought at first that it'd be a bit too creamy for my taste, but it was just about right. I had the banana cream tart this time. Light custard, fresh diced banans, and caramel flavor mixed in the center .Quite good. Overall I'd say their pastries are decent (I've had better), and I left feeling more satisfied from the sandwich than dessert. Seating is quite tight - all the times I've been there, they've been packed with lines. It took a little waiting and maneuvering to find a spot, so be prepared to wait a little if you want to dine in. Otherwise, I'd say pick up some food here and chill at the mission dolores park - that'd make for a fine afternoon as well!

Phenomenal ham sandwich! Obsession-inducing coconut cream tart! Perfect handmade coffee! The baked goods will make you cry. My only complaint is that the double-size pain au chocolat is too doughy. They tried to deliver a super-breed pain au chocolat, but it just doesn't have that nice, light flaky thing going; it kind of clogs your gullet. It's like a dough football with a bit of chocolate lost in it. But OH, you've never seen a finer ham sandwich! And clearly I need to try other things on the menu, which is stellar. Do wish the prices weren't so high, but they earn it...

If you like crack cocaine, definitely hit up Tartine cause i swear its addicting. Ê Its a clusterf*ck of bakery goodies and prepare to spend some dough(pun intended). ÊMy favorite is banana tart cause its perfect blend of banana, chocolate, and cream in one consumption. Ê The line is not bad but parking is typical SF parking so prepare someone to wait in the car while the other person gets the goods. payce!

A coworker recommended this place to me and after getting a sneak of the menu, it was on my must-see list while I was in San Francisco. And let me tell you, I'm glad I don't live near here because I would be a) poor and b) portly because i would be here all the time. No joke. I got the turkey croque monsieur and lemon tart and no joke, it was the most amazing thing I've had in a while. It's simple but the way it is presented and the taste is out of this world. But all of its sandwiches and desserts look amazing. And when I say amazing, I mean, you cannot possibly immediately narrow down what looks good because it all does. The outside has no markings as to the name, but you'll be able to find it because of the line outside. There is communal seating inside and out and it gets great light so you can easily take photos of your food. I do have to say, the inside is quaint but very small. VERY small so it can easily get warm and cramped. My only real complaint is the process of them taking your order. It's very slow and not very well organized. But despite this complaint, I still waited in that line and don't regret it. Also, be aware that it is pricey but I for me, it was worth it as a visiting treat :)

I'm on a sugar overload. All these sweets and my friend brings over another. A 9-inch banana cream pie. At first sight, all I saw was chocolate shavings riding on a creamy cloud. I cut myself a decent slice of pie and was overwhelmed by the layers of banana, chocolate and crust. This pie is delicious - the freshness of the banana and the the chocolate layer over the crust was the best part. Better not leave the whole pie with me, I'll devour it before bedtime. I like treats but don't know if I can afford this one on a regular basis. It's $38 for the pie - a hefty price tag for a pie.

I had been recommending this place to friends who visit SF - but had never gone myself, until yesterday. FINALLY! I braced myself for a line that wrapped around the corner, with people chanting "Tartine! Tartine!" but to my surprise, the Monday morning crowd was pretty subdued. We got there around 9:30 and hopped right into line, waiting only a few minutes before it was our turn. So many options, so little stomach space. I went with the bread pudding (only did a cup, shoulda chosen a bowl), my husband went with the coconut cream tart, and we split a croissant. The bread pudding was amazing. It had baked apple slices on top, and the bready part had a consistency that resembled flan (which I love) more than bread pudding. I loved it. It didn't go overboard with the sweetness, and the flavor was spot-on. The coconut cream tart was good, too, but more like a dessert than a breakfast. I loved the combination of caramel and chocolate lining the tart crust. MMmm...and the croissant - wow, all that buttery goodness. I can't wait to go again to try more things. I'm sure I will not be disappointed.

This place is a culinary art gallery -- perfectly crafted pastries, cakes, cookies and baked delicacies adorn a display case straight out of a magazine cover. And oddly enough, a magazine cover is what inspired me to go there. The latest issue of San Francisco magazine said that the grilled cheese at Tartine was a life-changing event. The second I read the magazine and looked up the menu, I said that it would be on the to-do list above an oil change and rent payments. Tartine had more hype than a Tiger Woods Mistress beauty pageant. So I go. I drove by on a rainy Saturday morning to see the entire sidewalk full of soaked customers, so I decided to do it another time. I'd planned to take a day off of work just to attempt to get there on time. Today, the line was short on a Friday afternoon, and the quite good looking, 99% female staff, made it look like I'd walked into an independent film bent on capturing San Francisco in 2010 for posterity's sake. I walked up, and a ordered my Humboldt Fog Goat Cheese sandwich, and a Pastrami sandwich for good measure. I'd made it here, why not make an event of it. I refuse to change my orders, getting an adequate judgment of their ideas of taste. I got my little letter placard and waited for my sandwiches. And waited. And waited. I was the last person to order anything off the menu instead of behind the counter for a good 15 Êminutes, and there were very few people waiting with placards on their table. I was basically the only one being served, waiting for my food. A good 30-40 minutes later, after the glow of being able to actually order from Tartine had worn off, and the charm of being in a quintessential San Francisco bakery had been replaced with reality, I'd become restless. 20 minutes, I would've possibly understood, but at 2:00 on a Friday with more people behind the counter than in front, I was dismayed. Then I got the sandwiches. They were brought to my waiting spot, and I'd taken them to go. On my walk back to my car, I took a bite out of the Goat cheese sandwich, and basically felt like San Francisco itself had been thrown into my mouth, perfectly pressed, on the greatest bread I'd ever sampled. I actually stopped while I was walking and started laughing. This really was that good. 13 dollars good? Who knows, but I was as hungry as a pickup truck at a gas station, and this was other-worldly. When I got home to a comfortable chair, I opened the pastrami. I figured I'd need a spot to sit to enjoy this. I opened it and saw absolute bread perfection, holding meat and cheese which looked like they could cure polio...twice. I took a bite, and puzzled, wait...horseradish? I forgot about that on the menu, but oh well, I really like horseradi.....what...is...happening? I then spent 30 seconds just staring at a wall, tears gushing down my face like someone had injected 150 CCs of wasabi directly into my brain, and stuck my head in a paint can shaker. I was floored, absolutely floored. I could taste one thing: my frontal lobe as it was melting through my sinuses. Some of the best ingredients ever sandwiched, rendered useless by a cheap, invasive plant root. I figured I'd gotten a bad bite, overwhelmed by mustard and horseradish, jousting it out in my mouth over who could fossilize my taste buds first. So, I ate more. One bite in there, with a reasonable amount of everything, tasted like a zeppelin ride over the city, wrapping a view of the entire peninsula into about 17 mandibular motions. From then, I stomached the rest with an inner conflict that the best sandwich in the city with a one bite exception...was now the worst I'd ever had. ÊHow could the greatest of culinary hype fall prey to someone puttying my sandwich with horse-radish and mustard based industrial solvents? How did it happen? There's 1/3 of the revelatory goat cheese sandwich waiting in my refrigerator, most likely representing my last trip to Tartine. I was in a bakery, a damned near perfect one, and I had that warm bakery feeling; a color wheel of edible magnificence, dough being kneaded by licensed masseuses, the aroma of butter creme frosting wafting through the air like spring fog, and metal boxes full of hot air turning a mixture of boring ingredients into, for some, what are life changing delicacies. Alas, it wasn't meant to be Tartine. In another time, and another place, I shall find a place such as you which makes me yearn to come back and spend 30 dollars on two sandwiches. But the little things that make me want to come back to a restaurant, like service with a smile. Any service, really. And a Pastrami sandwich which I could rest on my apartment floor in a bag for 6 minutes without risk of it eating through the, box, bag, and floor, then going medieval on my downstairs neighbors couch. Next sandwich please.

Oh Tartine, why are you in SF while I reside in LA. I suppose if it was acceptable to live in only spandex, we could have a closer relationship, but for now, you will have to exist only on random trips up north, following a week of healthy eating. Ê In the less than 48 hours in which I visited SF most recently, I was here twice. ÊBoth times with a bag to go. ÊNot okay. ÊWhat was VERY okay, was the morning bun, the cake aux olives, the almond croissant, the quiche with swiss chard. ÊOh, and the perfect balance of all came in a tasty little savory treat. ÊGougere. ÊSeriously, you must go now. My only complaint. ÊThe coffee is really only so-so. ÊThat's okay, I should probably stick with water while dining on sugar and cheese.

Knowing this is one of THE places to try in the Mission, I decided to go on a monday afternoon when it might not be as crazy. Ê I ordered and found a seat at the community table and had my sandwich within 20 minutes, which isn't too bad. ÊThe rich mozzarella and olive tapenade sandwich was warmed through, so the cheese is gooey and chewy, not fresh and cool as I expected. ÊBut delicious none the less. ÊIt comes out as more like a sandwich and a half, and I could have easily rested satisfied with just a third of that portion. ÊSo, splitting is a good idea here. The monkey oolong tea was excellent and served in a manner that allowed me to control how long it steeps, which is an essential detail. The crowd was nice to watch, but the older ones among them were also pushy in that entitled way SF matrons sometimes have about them. ÊAnd the people at the community table all seemed somewhat uncomfortable, which is understandable when none of them acknowledge each other's existence and proximity. The food is great but it is not the sort of place I would want to linger.

I told the nice gal behind the counter that I was flying back to LA and I needed to bring my wife something... and she smiled and helped us gladly.

You must try the coconut creme tart!!! It is coconut creme on a chocolate and caramel lined tart crust. ÊThe crust is hard to break open with a fork because of the layer of chocolate.

Customer service makes it or breaks it. I gave this place 4 stars because of the food, not the service. The service would have been 2 stars. I saw the morning bun on the 7x7 100 things to eat in SF, and really wanted to try it. So my coworker and I traveled and adventured there one day. Upon arrival, the lines were ridiculously long. It was insane that so many people waited in a line for pastries, but it was well worth it. The guy was somewhat friendly, recommended an almond croissant or tart because they ran out of morning buns. But it was delicious nonetheless. The girl who rang me up was so rude. I mean I never bought bread from here, so I just wanted to know what was the most popular type of loaves!?!? Was it that hard to tell me the different kinds so I could make my decision? I mean she could've just rolled her eyes (that was fine) but she didn't have to look at me like I was stupid too. Geez. Anyways, my friend and I had also ordered a loaf of bread each, and the girl said we could come back to pick it up at 5PM. Since we were hungry, we had gotten lunch at Pizzeria Delfina to go. We returned back to Tartine to pick up the loaves, but since they were NOT ready, we had to wait. Along with the box of pizza in my hand, I had also purchased an almond tart from them as well, so two boxes, and you know.... the pizza box is not small nor was it cold. So I did not mind waiting, but I figure kill two birds with one stone, eat the pizza and get rid of the box. ÊIt's not like I was only eating the pizza, but I was also eating the tart while waiting for my bread. (Sounds fatty, I know.) I thought it was kind of rude because the employees not only gawked like they never saw a pizza but showed how annoyed they were that we had brought outside food when we were waiting for our bread as well. By 5:10-15, I went to ask the girl if my bread was ready, the girl said, "Oh let me go check" and then went to go look for the bread. This was the same girl who told me to be back by 5PM to pick it up, and darted her eyes at me while I was eating my pizza. They couldn't find it at first, and then a guy found it after they searched more extensively by 5:30. Overall, the bread was good, fresh and warm right out of the oven. The customer service needs work, never work in the food hospitality field if you cannot offer customer service. Ê That's all, happy eating! :)

Understand why they are so popular---baked goods are amazing but until someone figures out how to manage the space/table issues the place is a boiling point for someone to freakout when they have their big coffee bowl and fresh pastry and no where to sit.

What else can I say about Tartine? What a great bakery. As I'm sure every reviewer has mentioned- the line-ups are utterly insane and it's rare to be able to actually get a table. Luckily its proximity to dolores park make that OK. All of the pastries are delicious (and oh so buttery)- e.g., croissants and morning buns. The bread pudding is also excellent, as is the daily quiche. The coffee is good. The desserts (particularly the tarts) are also great. The biggest quandary I have is trying to narrow down what I'm going to eat.

This is bad. When u heard so much about a place like Tartine, and seen so many good reviews about it, it's hard not to agree. But I guess my expectation for this place was too high. Nothing wrong, everything is made just right. But I didn't find anything exceptional either. Maybe next time?

First of all, PARKING is a biatch there and thankfully I had a "drop-off" driver to go p/up the "BANANA CREAM TART" 9" (yes their largest that feeds 8 people for $40 and you would have to order at least 2-3 days in advance). Anyhow, a friend recommended to order this dessert and honestly, OVERRATED! ÊIt was quite RUNNY inside where all the gooey caramel, MELTED custard & bananas hovered each other, yet no solid bound to glue everything in one place. ÊI enjoyed everything (whipped cream, chocolate pieces, bananas, runny custard & caramel) even though it was runny except for their pie CRUST. ÊToo HARD & THICK NOT light, crispy & airy; definitely had better.

This place is pretty pricey for what you get, but it's got some special variations on the normal goodies, so it's a cute place to go to. ÊI wouldn't call this my go to place. Mexican cookie. ÊNot bad for 85 cents. ÊNot as good as the $1.75 one from Roastery, but better than the ones from Whole Foods or Dianda's (in Mission). ÊNice coating of powedered sugar over the shortbread cookie/buttery/crunchy inside. ÊI could tell the cookie had a lot of butter/grease. Lemon cream tart- kinda pricey, but each part of the simple dessert was made well. ÊThe lemon filling was lickable like really tangy kick like lemon sorbet, but with the texture of a silky, dense, butter base. Ê It sat well on the clean crisp dense thin crust. ÊAnd to top if off was the dollop of cream, a light egg white/butter taste, great balance to the tartiness of the lemon filling and heaviness of the crust. Morning bun - $3.75 for a bun?! ÊOK, it's definitely special, so go for it. ÊI remember spending $50 at Tartine my first time and not wanting to waste $4 on a morning bun. ÊI should have. ÊIt's a mixture of a lot of things - not so sticky sticky bun, the layers are fluffy like a croissant, and each layer has hints of a biscuit texture/density/taste. ÊAlso sprinkled with orange and cinammon flavors throughout. ÊAnd the light crunchiness/burntness of the areas on the outside are the perfect crunchiness while keeping the inside soft, flaky, and gooey. (a year ago) Chocolate Hazelnut Torte - eh, nothing special. some other stuff; i'll have to dig it up.. but I remember I was so disappointed, it's taken me over a year to go back and try this place again.

Wow, I thought the cakery in Burlingame was good, this place is even better. Their croissants are to die for. ÊCrispy and flaky on the outside buttery on the inside. Êyum.... Ê Their pressed sandwhiches are really good too, probably because they drench the bread in butter or olive oil. ÊWhichever, it is yummy. The chocolate croissant is good too if you like solid chunks of chocolate in there but ÊI'm not a big fan of that, it's like eating a chocolate bar for breakfast. ÊThe scones are decent.

I visited San Francisco for a few days and I just had to come here after watching the video of baker Chad Robertson passionately making bread on http://www.youmightfindyÉ. I walked 2 hours to get to this bakery and It was worth the toe blister! I came here around 10am on a Monday and there was about six people on line. I can easily eat a dozen of their heavenly Morning Bun! Sweet and crispy on the outside and warm and chewy on the inside. I wish I bought more but now it's too late = ( *wishes Tartine delivers*

So, I haven't gone to this bakery, but my cousin brought their Banana Cream Tart for our dessert tonight and that alone is worth giving this place five stars! The crust was so flaky and it was lined with dark chocolate. The filling was not too sweet and soggy. It has to be THE BEST Banana Cream Pie I've EVER had! I will definitely go to their bakery/cafe location some time soon to try their breads, sandwiches, and to get another one of these Banana Cream Tarts!

I have a love-hate relationship with this place. ÊI LOVE their bread (especially the sesame) warm and fresh and I LOVE their croissants and morning buns. ÊI just wish it was easier to get the croissants hot out of the oven. But their customer service can be spotty. ÊAnd I hate that there is always a line (I know, not really their fault--it's tough being popular). ÊEven at 8:30 on a Saturday, which really takes the fun out of getting up early. ÊAnd some of their desserts are really just so-so. At least not on par with the above mentioned items. I recently had a cake from here at a birthday party and was seriously unimpressed. I couldn't help but wonder wondering how much it must have cost the hostess. This place isn't budget. And I am sad that they have raised their prices on bread. But I guess there's demand... I still get it on occasion. I also wish they had a better system for ordering the bread. Ê Their hot sandwiches are good and gigantic. ÊShare them...or you may not want to eat again for a looong while. ÊI like to ask for mine without oil, so it's not too greasy. ÊThe cheese inside generally provides enough grease and ooziness. ÊBut that's just my preference.

Wonderful bread pudding with berries. It was not too sweet or rich. It's a perfect "light" dessert. Hot sandwiches were good too, but it took them about 15 minutes to make them. Cons: Wait- It takes awhile to get to the front of the line to order, and then it takes awhile to get your hot sandwiches. Parking- It took about 10-15 minutes of circling the blocks to find a parking space. In general, food was fantastic. If I live closer to this place (like within walking distance), I'd frequent this place. I am not sure if it was worth all of the time (driving, parking, waiting in line, waiting for food).

I find it charming that you can drink coffee from a bowl. It reminds me of drinking hot chocolate from a bowl for breakfast at Colombian restaurants in Miami. Just drink it down and chug and chug and chug! Sounds like a beer fest, eh? Well it almost is - but without the hangover (when I last tested it at least). But San Francisco... you're lucky to have such a French bakery near a pretty park to relax on (Dolores). And furthermore, you're lucky to have a French bakery that serves a simplistic slice of bread topped with ham and cheese on top without another layer of bread - and yes, they charge you for ordering such a simple meal too! But, I assure you, forking over your life for this "croque monsieur" will get you into heaven faster than dying on the cross. Sorry Christians, but it's true! Okay, so it really doesn't cost that much, but it is definitely the best croque monsieur I've ever had... and to couple it with those crisp oatmeal cookies that has orange peel in them... can we say "mierde" together and just fly to France and slap the French asses for not spreading more awareness about these delicacies? I'm astounded that I would have to be in San Francisco to know about just how good they can just be! Now, if I can get the dogs out of Dolores so I won't have to live in fear of being licked upon while I'm drunk with some French love.... Note: Bread pudding could be better, a sandwich I had (mustard, ham and cheese) was not as good as the croque monsieur, but it's a matter of taste, and the rochers were a bit too sweet and airy for my taste. For desserts, stick with something tarty.

My favorite bakery in SF .. Best almond croissant I've ever had. Best ham & cheese croissant I've ever had. Bread pudding is good (brioche and strawberries). They use dark chocolate for their chocolate croissants ... which is too bitter for me but some ppl like it. Minus 1 star because they don't always have what I want when I want it .. shouldn't they make this stuff round the clock? It's not easy taking off from work in the morning to get a batch of almond croissants and morning buns only to find that I drove across town and took off from work for NOTHING. boo. update 04/08/08 --- for the THIRD time in a row they've run out of almond croissants in the AM .. (by 8:30am!) .. once I called ahead and asked if there would be enough by the time I could get there (30 mins) .. they said yes but when I got there, there wasn't any left!!!!!!!!!! come on! it's not easy leaving the hospital in the morning to run across town .. only to be disappointed again and again. I'm going to take it from 4 stars to 3 .. sorry I love you Tartine, and I think you're the best ... but this is my way of begging you to make more batches ..

My short-lived love affair with this place ended a while ago, and now the truth must be told. ÊAfter hearing about this place initially, I was very excited to try this out for the first time last year...and was not disappointed. ÊTheir coffee was very good, and I sampled a couple of their pastries, which were good, but a little too sweet for my taste. ÊOf course others may feel differently. I went a few more times, waited in their super duper long lines and tried other items. ÊWas very unimpressed with their bread pudding. During my last trip I tried one of their tartines, and then it hit me. ÊAlthough the place is called "Tartine Bakery", their tartines don't even meet the grade. ÊTheir bread, I hear, may be their saving grace, but the place thrives primarily because it is seen as a longstanding trendy locale. ÊFrom now on, I will only go if I happen to drive by and the line is short Êand only order coffee. ÊI'll stick to my favorite tartine place located elsewhere in the city for both tartines and better quality and variety of pastries.

Two words: SUGAR. HIGH. I don't usually consume such mass quantities of sugar for breakfast, nor do I drink my americanos from a cereal bowl. But... when in Rome. Or, when in Tartine. Definitely more on the expensive side than not, but still delightful... especially when the wait person gave me a bowl of bread pudding for the price of a cup... well, it was a fluke. The new tray wasn't out yet and the bowl was the only available serving size... but I was still quite happy about it.

ÊBut....last Sunday I diverged from my normal order and got a hot pressed sandwich. ÊIt took 20 minutes to stick some turkey and cheese in between some bread and put it in the hot press. ÊAnd it was dripping in butter. ÊI will return to pre-made food there. ÊSuper-disappointing for the rock star of my world.

This place is always crowded, but it's worth the wait! Both the vegetarian and meat quiches are divine. I don't know what this other thing was called, but it was ham, tomato, cheese and other tasty bits toasted on some kind of bread (I know, terribly vague I'm sorry! I didn't order the food!). Wow. SO GOOD! Their breaded pudding is supposed to be awesome right? I haven't tried it yet, but I definitely will one day. You should definitely come here for a taste. All their stuff is very very good. Seating is limited, but usually while you wait in line tables will free up.

Good, but maybe not worth the hassle. 1) Jambon Royale & Gruyere - Quite possibly the best ham and cheese sandwich I have ever had. Perfectly pressed/toasted buttered bread with delicious Niman ranch ham, gruyere, and tasty Dijon mustard. A pretty hefty sandwich, but they conveniently cut it in thirds. Took forever to come out though! To avoid a nasty parking ticket (I had already maxed out the meter with $1.50 for an hour), I asked them to box it up. Expensive though, at $10.25. I ended up eating it in my car as I drove through SF to GG bridge and then up to the Sonoma Coast. 2) Croissant - Not as good as I thought it would be. Large, rich, and buttery - yes. Delicately flakey? No. It seemed a little too doughy, but was good and better than most. Expensive at ~ $3 3) Friand - A nice little treat, kinda of like a really small cupcake. A bit of chocolate cake is topped with Valrhona ganache. Mmm...delicious. $2 4) Buttermilk Scone w/ currants - A pretty standard scone. I brought it home and ate it for breakfast the next morning. Did not dry out too much and was good. ~ $3 There isn't a whole lot of seating inside or out. They are a bit optimistic in trying to squeeze in four small chairs on one side of the communal table. Maybe if everyone is super skinny. Otherwise, prepare to rub elbows, literally. :P Come with lots of patience, time, and money. ;)

Tartine lives up to all the hype and more! Some of the places people recommend end up being let downs, but Tartine is every good as people say. I'm quite skeptical of any sandwich that costs $8.25 but their Croque Monsieur is sooo worth it. I normally don't have much of a sweet tooth but I tried bits of their Devil's Food Cake, the Lemon Almond Poundcake, and the Banana Cream Tart and they all tasted scrumptious without the danger of being sickeningly sweet like some other bakeries. Here's to the hope that one day I get up early enough (or stay up late enough) to drop in for their infamous morning bun and croissants.

After listening to my roommate talk this place up the entire bus ride there, I was pretty excited to try the oh so famous morning bun. But we got there around 2pm, and apparently the morning buns sell out quick, like, in the morning... So instead I went with the Gougere which was actually pretty good. I think I was a bit underwhelmed because of missing out on the famous morning bun and instead going for something not so sweet, but I'd get this again. Tartine itself is a sight to be had. Its a cute bakery jammed packed with people. No kidding, we waited in a line around the corner for more than 20 minutes before we got to the counter and found out we had missed out on the mourning buns. But I'm giving this place 4 starts anyways because the Gougere was pretty good, everything in this place looked amazingly delicious, and people obviously love this place. Can't wait to get back some other time (in the morning) so I can taste the deliciousness my roommate wouldn't stop talking about.

My wife is a pastry Chef and has been raving about Tartine for well over a year now. Ê We tried to stop in a couple of months ago but the place was insanely packed, so we moved on... Ê Then last Saturday we had to pick up my sister in law at SFO so we decided to wake up early and drive into the City for breakfast at Tartine. ÊThis time, my wife said, our plans would not be derailed. Sure enough, ther place was packed just like last time. ÊI dropped her off and drove around the corner to get a parking spot. Ê I showed up 10 minutes later and she was still in line. Ê We both waited patiently another 15 minutes before we were finally served, so the wait on Saturday morning was about 25 minutes... this is just FYI, though I'm not claiming this to be a scientific survey... Ê Anyway, moving on... I ordered the Croque Monsieur and my wife got a sandwich with asparagus and bechamel sauce. Ê She also bought us a bunch of treats and snacks to take home, including a couple of large chocolate chip cookies, an eclair, and an olive loaf. I was totally not impressed with the Croque Monsieur and in fact only ate about 4 bites of it... ÊLook, I realize this is SF and all but can y'all find some other bread than the Sourdough? Ê I don't know what the fascination is with Sourdough but it tastes like acidic toilet water to me... ÊPerhaps that's just my French genes showing through... Ê Anyway if I had to grade Tartine on the Croque Monsieur alone, they'd be getting a big fat 2 stars. The Eclair, which I tasted later, was pretty good with a nice coat of rich dark chocolate. Ê It was a good solid 4 star Eclair though it is easily eclipsed by the Eclair at Bouchon Bakery in Yountville, in my humble opinion. The Chocolate Chip cookie is 3 stars, but I'm rounding up the total to 4 stars since my wife likes this place so much... I'm not sure why since her pastries are far superior (in my not so humble opinion) and I know for sure that Bouchon Bakery takes this place to the cleaners... Ê Still, it's trendy and it's in the City, so I suppose that buys you some support... Ê My wife digs it and I thought it was decent... ÊNot sure I'd come back, though of course I probably will since you know the motto, right? ÊHappy wife, happy life. Ê;)

This is the perfect French bakery, and I wish I lived closer to it to take advantage of its delights on a more regular basis. Because if you are driving and parking there, um, good luck. Still, it's worth it. I suggest Tartine as the perfect brunch spot, because it satisfies the sweet and savory cravings in every way imaginable. The brioche bread pudding topped with fruit is outstanding (do the right thing and just get the cup, not the bowl - trust me). And the double pain au chocolat (this is why you just get a cup of the bread pudding) is the best in the city. You know how every other chocolate croissant here has the chocolate chips in it, all hard and not melty and buttery (with the exception of Boulange on Pine)? Yeah, so this is not one of those croissants. And double in size, it is. Tartine is at its best on a warm day like yesterday when I was there, since you may be standing in a line that goes out the door, and sitting outside not because you want to, but because you have to. That said, be patient, take a deep breath, and soak it all in. France without the attitude - bravo.

My friend and I stopped by here for brunch around noon on a Sunday and it was packed! I had heard wonderful things about their pastries so my friend ordered the banana cream tart and I got the fresh fruit tart with strawberries and a hot turkey sandwich. They handed us the tarts first and expected us to find a seat to wait for our sandwich. Luckily my friend scored some chairs outside and we ended up eating the tarts while waiting. They were dreamy and fabulous. The banana cream tart is just how it sounds and pretty heavy. The fresh fruit tart was light and airy and an explosion of fruitiness on the tongue. The only downside was that it was hard to find a place to sit and they forgot about our sandwich which they finally got around to serving us when I asked somebody about it. The sandwich was really good though and my friend and I could only eat 2/3 of it. Luckily my boyfriend showed up and finished it off. The service was friendly and you are supposed to bus your own tables but I couldn't figure out where the bussing station was. Inside the restaurant was so crowded it was almost impossible to navigate around looking for it so I gave up and left my dishes on the table outside. Forgive me!

With top rating over fifteen hundred plus reviews, Tartine Bakery needs not my affirmation of its status as possibly the best breakfast / bakery in the entire country. This place is simply the best. You need not read this review to know what to order. Everything is great. Looking around the packed house will tell you the local favorites. Asking the helpful staff will get you the inside scoop on what's tasty today. Our venture started on a Friday morning at 11am, explicitly chosen to avoid the notorious Disney-ish lines. Nonetheless, the wait was well over 30 minutes with the queue out the door and past two store fronts. Mind you, this is in the middle of a work day. I cringe at the thought of the wait on a weekend morning. One patron even had her airline bags with her; whether it was a last taste of paradise or the first stop of the addicted, it was clear to see the zealotry that Tartine inspires. And it did not disappoint. We ordered pretty much everything: clair, banana cream, hazelnut chocolate, coconut cream, breakfast pastry, open face sandwich, bread pudding, and ham croissant. Everything was awesome. Perfectly textured; incredibly balanced (not too sweet, not watery); beautiful presentation, hats off to Tartine for getting it perfect. I'm not a huge desert fan, but even I can appreciate a masterpiece. This place is a must try.

Had to update (not that Tartine needs more glowing endorsements)... got there at opening on Saturday and ohhhhhhh the morning rolls were so delicious! I still don't understand how you can get there at opening and then be asked to wait ten plus minutes for the morning rolls to come out of the oven (it's like...you're a bakery and you know everyone who comes in that early is going to want one of those things!) but no matter what, when they're on, they're on. And ohhh it's so good. I've also decided that their best bread pudding flavor is the nectarine-raspberry one. Enough tartness to cut the sugary goodness. Oh Tartine, if only you were calorie free!

Oh joy! Baked goods galore! It was my first time, and I think I went a little overboard. I got the morning bun, the berry bread pudding, and chocolate hazelnut tart while my friend got the spicy smoked turkey sandwich. Here's the breakdown: -morning bun: sugary, lemony, buttery bliss but slightly burnt on the edges -bread pudding: wonderful, especially fun to eat in the little teacup -chocolate hazelnut tart: "the tart to chocolate ratio was a little off" -spicy smoked turkey sandwich: love the bread, a little too cheesy, perfect pesto-ness, burnt crust= :(....and what do we make of the pickled boiled carrot?! nonsense. Overall, quite scrumptious. Next time we go, we're gonna go for the banana cream tart, quiche, and cheese bread thing, and the fruit torte. Then I'll be able to bump up my review to 5 stars! A perfect way to spend a warm, sunny Thursday afternoon!

A local took me and her mother here for breakfast today (Black Friday). I was dismayed to see the long line outside the door (guess a lot of people took off work today), but also relieved in knowing that long lines are a good sign. While you wait, you can watch the cooks mixing a huge bowl of several sticks of butter, or gaze at a pitcher full of eggs. When you finally get inside, your eyes gaze at the impressive display of organic, local and fresh pastries and cakes. We had gotten the croissant (it was half the size of my head, and the best one I've had my whole life), a ham and cheese croissant (amazing!), a morning bun (perfect chewiness with sweetness from sugar? and cinnamon), a charred swiss quiche (perfectly silky eggs with just the right amount of cheese), ham quiche (delicious!) and coffee. It was a grand breakfast, and I will definitely visit them again. Seeing as most, if not all, ingredients are organic, I was pleasantly surprised at the cost of the food. Really, it's no more expensive than Starbucks food, but this is so much more tasty and filling!! 5 Stars!!

The morning after my Gary Danko birthday meal we headed to Tartine for a quick bite before heading back to San Jose. We were unfamiliar with this part of town so we were not sure of the location but as soon as we saw the line we figured we had found it. It's much smaller than I expected. We ended up getting the apple bread pudding and the Croque monsieur which was cheesy, hammy ,tomatoey goodness on top of a thick, crusty, scrumptious slice of bread. The pudding was just ok the Croque was delish. I wish we had a bigger appetite. I gotta come back to try the huge morning buns and the croissants. Warning: the cute carrots that came with the Croque were damn hot!

YUM Ordered the pastrami sandwich, possibly the best I've ever had. ÊNote to self, get the horseradish on the side. ÊI can't hang with that stuff, it felt like someone was kicking me in the face every time I took a bite. The wait wasn't bad at all, and I like that you are responsible for cleaning up your own table, only if everyone would do it properly!

Holy crap, i did not know there is 1800+ reviews already. Ê My four stars is solely for the bread pudding- definitely the best I've ever had. ÊThe texture is custard-like and the bread is not soggy. ÊI drove an hour+ this weekend to get some. ÊSince the fruit toppings are seasonal, it was bananas this time- nothing too exciting. ÊIt's so much better with fresh berries in the summer time! ÊCan't wait for the warm weather and some fruity bread pudding!

I had my first taste of Tartine bakery and know that next time I'm in the San Fran/mission area I'll definitely be back. The pastries were so good that I know without a doubt that I'll make it a point to come back. The bread pudding was amazing, perfect custard to bread ration with a little more custard =]. I could have done without the apples (the seasonal fruit) but they didn't stop me from scarfing/savoring every bite of the bread pudding. We also got the banana cream tart...all I can say is with fresh bananas, a thin layer of caramel over the chocolate covered tart base how can you go wrong? Sweets treats at Dolores park with the sun shining down made for a great Friday afternoon.

***** REVIEW FOR THE MORNING BUN ONLY ***** 4.5 Stars ***** I saw this on 7x7's The Big Eat SF and I had no idea what it was. Then I heard my friend talking about it and that sparked my interest even more. She wanted to try it but the day that she came, Tartine Bakery ran out. =( When I first got to the bakery, I saw a line of people waiting outside. Possible good sign??? Sure was! While walking to the bakery, I could smell the sweet aroma dancing in the air. Haha.. I'm such a dork. I know. Anyhow, I didn't get to read the reviews and wasn't sure what to order so I ordered just the Morning Bun. My first initial impression.. that's it??? This little thing for $3.75??? Can you blame me for thinking that?! Well, I took my first bite.. ouch! I bit the outer part and it was a little hard, but after I got through the first layer, OMG!!!! I was in heaven! I'm serious!!! The Morning Bun, to me of course, is like a combination of a cinnamon roll and croissant with a hint of orange. It was sweet, soft, and was slightly caramelized on top. I definitely suggest this to anyone who enjoys a sweet, light bun in the morning. I'll definitely come back to try the other stuff.. enjoy!

WTH would give this place only 1-3 stars? ÊTartine is definitely in the 4-5 category only. ÊAlthough there's always a line outside, it's well worth it. ÊThere's also so much deliciousness on the menu that it's actually good you have some time to wait, and peruse the menu and what other people order as well. I'm so glad this place isn't closer to my house, I'd be 200 pounds. ÊDuring my most recent visit, I shared the a croque monsieur, spicy turkey sandwich and three delicious treats. ÊEverything was amazing, right down to the pickled carrots. ÊIt's a little pricy, my friend and I came in for breakfast treats and walked out with $40 worth of food. ÊIt was definitely enough for the meal and then snacks throughout the day! A SF establishment, don't allow the crowd to deter you. ÊOddly enough, every time I get up and order when I have my # stick, there's always a table that opens up.

My favorite is the morning bun, a touch of orange in a swirl of gooey fresh pastry. All of the pastries are delicious really, buttery and light. I also like to get a small lemon cream tart or hazelnut chocolate tart to supplement my breakfast pastry. Finding parking in the Mission district is very difficult. And then there's the 15-20 minute line to order on the weekends. There are very few tables, but Dolores Park is a short walk away on a nice day. All this difficulty is worth it though.

Tartine is the model of what all coffeeshops that serve French pastries should aspire to be like. Except they should aspire to make the place a little bigger to accommodate their guests. This place is popular and it's always crowded but luckily the line moves rather quickly and it's always worth the wait. The coffee and pastries are above par. I just wish that they would let you order after you've seen all of the selections. I asked for a hazelnut biscotti before I saw that they had morning buns. I exchanged the biscotti for the morning bun when I got to the register and they did not make a fuss over it. I didn't get to try their coffee for health reasons but I ordered plain old steamed milk. The barista forgot my order but my friend was nice enough to remind him and it was served up in no time. Our wait wasn't too long and luckily we were taking our order to go because there was nowhere to sit. The morning bun with warm milk was delicious. My friend enjoyed her double latte and croissant that she always gets when she comes to town. I had a bite and I'd say they're the best I've had outside of Paris.

I've decided that I must open a bakery. This place is making a KILLING off of some eggs, sugar, and flour. Of course I'm kidding - this place serves up a ton of exquisite pastries that I know require a lot of skill, time, and TLC. I think if you want a good selection of items, you have to go at the buttcrack of dawn or something. I dragged my husband here ("You want to go all the way there to try some bread?!?"), and was sadly disappointed that they were out of almond croissants - the one thing that i desperately wanted to try. Sigh. Instead, I picked up a gougere (a gruyere cheese bread ball), a banana cream tart, and a lemon tart. The gougere was good, with a slight peppery taste - the husband thought it was interesting. The banana cream was good, but not great - more of a very mild taste. The lemon tart had quite a kick to it! It was good, and my sister demolished it quickly. Now... is this place good? Why yes. I would love to try their sandwiches and paninis. Is it worth it? Uhm, I dunno. There are a lot of bakeries that are good and cheaper (hello, 85*C, anyone?); BUT i guess you have to pay for the ambiance, not to mention a little bit of snotty service (yes, some of the girls here need to take the stick out - of course i can't hear what you are whispering when the music is freakin loud!) Would I come back? probably. I'm a sucker for baked goods. Plus, I need to try those freakin' almond croissants.

We were tempted to try a sandwich here but it's so damn expensive! I dropped $15 easy on a coconut cream tart, a slice of devil's food cake, and a masala chai. WOW. BUT, it was totally worth it. I don't know when I'll ever be back, now I'm regretting not getting a sandwich (although to be fair, we also weren't hungry whatsoever) The devil's food cake was made with Valrhona chocolate and was rich and deeply thick. It lasted me two days. I'd eat a layer every few hours and savor it. I love a good chocolate cake, and this one... I'd like to be thrown in the middle of a giant slice and be forced to eat my way out, mm. The coconut cream tart was also way better than I thought it was going to be, considering I don't like coconut desserts. It had an awesome shell of dark chocolate on the inside and caramel. So. Damn. Good.

It was 81F in the city today and instead of beach bumming, I had to finish a paper. I looked at my bookmark list and saw Tartine. Might as well head over, do some writing and check off a bookmark. There were a few other customers also studying and unfortunately there were no plugs in the dining area. No more laptopping at Tartine, I guess. But I will come back to read and have more of the coconut passionfruit cake I had. It was amazing! The thing was covered in shaved coconut and the passion fruit flavor was just right. I can't believe I ate the whole thing! I'll be back to try some items from their lunch menu!

Tartine has the charm and upscale feel of a Brentwood or Westwood, LA cafe- without the pretentiousness. Located on a busy corner, Tartine is so well-known it does not even need a sign outside. The line was out the door with families on Saturday brunch, hipsters, and the local flavor. When you finally get inside you realize this place is tiny- with a few tables and seating outside (luckily Dolores Park is nearby). The line serpentined between tables and the display cases holding the most delectable looking pastries and cookies the size of a plate. There was not much decor that gave this place a theme or "feel". Me and two girlfriends shared 2 paninis: provolone and spicy turkey ($13 each). Expensive for a panini you would think until you see that they are cut into threes and we were barely able to finish all of it. The sandwiches were a bit oily, but SOOOO crunchy and delicious. The broccoli pesto on the spicy turkey (which was not spicy at all) was marvelous and a new twist on your everyday pesto. DO NOT eat the carrots that come with the paninis....it was disgusting. My friends did not believe me and each took a bite and made the same face. Expected a good wait in line (you got plenty of time to be tempted by the baked goods), a wait to get your food, and to bus your own tables - cuz they are WAY too busy to do it for you.

There was a line out the door waiting for the bakery to open up at 9AM on Sunday. The line moved quickly and we got a glimpse of the backroom... very industrial. The pastries are about $7 each but well worth it. I got the banana cream tart which was one of the best pastries I have ever tasted. The whipped cream is so light and creamy, kind of like high grade Cool Whip and the the bananas and cream were perfect. The thick crust was coated with dark chocolate on the inside and there were huge chunks of shaved chocolate. I also got the bread putting which they spoon for your with fresh fruit on top. That was okay. It was too soaked for my liking. My sister got a morning bun which was good and my sister got the almond croissant which was very crusty and hard. For the true SF experience, you must come!

Pretty sure the people watching is the best part--Tartine is like a hipster fishing hole. I don't mind paying a premium for super popular, supposedly super good bread, sandwiches and pastries, but man... The Croque Monsieur was just ok, actually barely passable. Was told to buy some sourdough because it's THE BEST in SF but there was none for sale and none baking?!? Confused and disappointed was me.

This place is awesome. We visited when on vacation in San Francisco and just had to have a chocolate croissant, or 5. You can tell that a place is good if there is ALWAYS a line! That happened to be the case here. The shop is small and when you are waiting in line at times it gets difficult to manuvre yourself out of the way for people that are leaving, sitting down, or trying to get by. I pretty much felt like i was constipating the whole walkway in between the tables, no doubt i was. But everyone was quite courteous and calm, so it was no big deal. It was worth it as the croissants were delicious, and the latte was really good as well. I saw several people eating the brioche bread pudding topped with fresh fruit and it made my mouth water, so i had to get some. It was delicious! Eggy, awesome, sweet, tasty, fruity.... IMHO it was even better than the chocolate croisant.

So. Good. Worth every minute in line, the high prices, and crappy service. The almond croissant is warm, buttery goodness. I enjoyed it more than the morning bun. Love that they have turkey and veggie croque monsieur variations for those of us who don't eat ham. My turkey croque was premade and not re-heated; it could have been better had the cheese been freshly melted. I wanted to try the spicy turkey sandwich, but sandwiches take 15-20 minutes to make (no thanks!). Not a fan of the bread pudding- it was too egg-y tasting and there was barely any fruit in it. 4 stars despite this because that almond croissant is amazing.

This place is absolutely fantastic. I came here with a friend (who got there before me and spared me the need to wait in line). We shared two morning buns, a ham-and-cheese croissant, and some cranberry bread pudding. The morning bun was coated in this sweet orange glaze that was excellent: not too powerful but certainly not too light. The best part was the very top of the bun, which had this crystallized crust of the glaze. It was unexpected and delicious. The croissant was definitely the highlight. At first I was disappointed because there isn't a whole lot of ham and cheese, but the cheese is baked inside the croissant so that the bread is itself crusted in smoky cheese. All in all, it was fantastic. The bread pudding was pretty meh, but I'm also generally not a huge fan of bread pudding. It was standard fare as far as desserts go, but I did really enjoy the cranberries. Ultimately, I won't let the somewhat mediocre bread pudding deter me from giving Tartine 5 stars.

Great pastries and cake, but I go for their completely over-the-top Croque Monsieur: a homey, reassuringly irregular mound of crisped cheese that you know has bread and either ham or shiitake mushrooms and sun-dried tomatoes buried beneath.

Hands down, the best panini ÊI've EVER EVER had. They hit all the details right... enough olive oil in the bread (which was of the finest sourdough variety), grill marks not to light not too dark, prosciutto cut thick enough to feel substantial but not tough, and just the right amount of crispy vegetables and cheese to provide a refreshing mix of textures. ...and that's just the sandwich! The baked goods here were also incredible... I think we spent about $40 bucks on croissants, cookies, lemon tarts, etc. Everything that wasn't eaten was the next day's breakfast at the hotel!

Im horrible at making decisions and am predominately an herbivore thus I generally stick to these two and dont feel guilty because they use quality/local ingredients.

I somehow have avoided the ridiculous lines for this place, which probably has something to do with the 5 star rating! Their open faced sandwiches are kind of expensive until you realize they can feed two people! The croque monsieur is perfect, and I've been to Paris! Their brownies made with Valrhona chocolate are super dense and rich, which means I can't eat it all in one sitting; a good thing in my opinion! My absolute favorite thing has to be the banana cream pie with the surprise chocolate and caramel inside. Orgasmically good. I need to try these chocolate croissants everyone raves about.

Amazing bakery and great brunch place! Bread pudding is lovely and many other pastries and cakes. Friend ordered a lovely passionfruit cake for her bday and it was DELICIOUS and tantalizing! Simply out-of-this-world! Expensive $4.95 per slice or 10-12 sliced cake at about $60-70! 3/10 Went with bf and ordered the passionfruit coconut cake by the slice and the banana bread pudding and I was a happy kid for the rest of the evening. :) Con: Not enough indoor seating/standing so we sat outside on metal seats and inhaled the desserts within minutes, it was 44 degrees out! Talk abt passion for dessert. Update: Tried the chocolate pudding/choco pot de creme in a container for $4.95 and it was really good, not super sweet but right texture and very chocolatey.

With so many great reviews, I figured I should try Tartine at least once. ÊSo I ventured over there one Sunday afternoon and find a massive line at 3pm! ÊOk, so a line out the door is somewhat encouraging, but not really that great when you're in the line. ÊAs some other reviewers have mentioned, the setup of the place is not great. ÊSeemed somewhat disorganized, and very cramped. After what seemed like 20 or 30 minutes of waiting in line, I ordered a Prosciutto & Provolone Pressed Sandwich and a slice of Passion Fruit Lime Bavarian for dessert. ÊLet me just say the portions are huge! ÊThe sandwich was definitely a size for sharing, and it was oozing with Provolone. ÊPersonally I would've prefered less cheese, but overall a good sandwich. ÊThe Passion Fruit Lime Bavarian was yummy, but not spectacular. Would I go again? ÊMaybe if I happen to be in the area, I will have to try the bread pudding, or grab another slice of cake, but I honestly don't think it's worth the wait.

The bread pudding is so money. I was in SF for a conference at the Moscone and was craving Tartine so bad that I commuted over during lunch for some pastries and bread pudding. Good thing it was a weekday so there was no line. Totally worth it. Tips: I'm going to carbo-load here next time I run Bay to Breakers.

My friends and I went to Tartine for brunch, and I was just a bit disappointed. ÊI had heard such great reviews, and I have a feeling I might've just ordered wrong. I got the peppered turkey breast sandwich with provolone and broccoli rabe pesto. ÊIt was really heavy and oily, and it wasn't very flavorful. ÊI think there was a lot of provolone, and I couldn't taste the peppered turkey or the pesto. I did try a bite of my friend's morning bun, and it was really good! ÊIt's just really, really sweet, so I'm glad I didn't order a whole one for myself. The bakery itself is really cute, and I love the neighborhood. ÊIt gets pretty packed because it's so tiny, so it's not a great place to go with a larger group. I think I'm going to stick with the baked breakfast goods next time.

I've been here a couple of times now. The first time I went, they were out of morning buns. I tried an assortment of other pastries/foods including Êthe bread pudding, chocolate croissant, quiche, and pain au jambon. I thought everything was just OK. My second trip here I came extra early just to make sure to try the morning bun. In short, it's a 5-star pastry. You must eat it there while it's warm. Flaky and yet soft, it's a really sweet way to start your morning. I enjoy the citrus glaze on top as well for a bit of chew. This is pretty much all I will eat here, but it shoots Tartine up to a 4 star. Now if only Bi-rite was open early enough so I could get both..

I just love this place. The baked goods, the coffee, the atmosphere, the feeling of having one the lottery when you can actually snag a table. I used to visit Tartine on a regular basis when I lived closer. Now, sadly, I don't often get the chance. Coffee: On any other day, I only drink Peet's coffee unless I come to Tartine. I love their coffee. Mr. Bean, I believe it is. Eats: Ham and cheese croissant, chocolate croissant and chocolate pudding are my favorites so far. Atmosphere: Always interesting artwork on rotation. Busy. Packed. Lively. The wait: Yep, this place is great, so there's always a wait to order and to pick up your drink. The tables are always full. It's a small place so that's just the way it is. Parking: Terrible. I'm still giving it 5 stars.

ÊThe crossiant had just the right flakiness, softness, and yummy buttery goodness.

I have a love-hate relationship with Tartine. (Well mostly love, but I hate the crowds.) The pastries here are great. If you can wade through the crowd of locals and tourists and score a seat that isn't cluttered with people who forgot to bus their own table, you're in luck. Sitting outside on a warm, sunny afternoon with their Scharfenberger chocolate pudding is one of my favourite ways to spend an afternoon.

Feeling a bit of French nostalgia? The gougere (cheese puff pastry) and croissants (both chocolate and non-chocolate) are simply divine. Ê Ê Pair either of these with an excellently prepared latte, and I'm in heaven. The food itself is worth the wait. Ê I only wish there was a little more dine-in seating. ÊAs I muster the patience to eye where to sit, it is a necessary evil to revert to my "table vulture" college days, swooping in as quickly as humanly possible on any tables that happen to open up. For those of you who drive and are not sure you are French pastry enthusiasts, the requisite circling around the block to find parking then waiting in a line that starts out the door might not be your cup of tea (or coffee, if you'd rather). Ê But one visit might make you a Tartine convert for life.

No real need to provide any more detail than the 800+ reviewers already for Tartine.

Hmmm....1337 reviews. Seems like this place is pretty popular! (end sarcasm} I decided to check off another item on the 7x7 100 things you need to eat/drink in SF before you die and go to Tartine Bakery for their morning bun. If you've read any of the other reviews on this place, then I'm sure you already have a good idea why you should try this place out, but here's my take on it - I came here early, before it opened and there was already a line out the door. Ooooo...one of those places in SF! (The line persisted by the way during the entire time I was here, about an hour or so) It was a wonderful sunny Sunday morning. The sunshine poured through the windows at this place. We got a morning bun, a cup of bread pudding, a cheesey bread thing, coffee and a cafe au lait. Yup, carb overload. I'm not afraid of carbohydrates, let's just put it that way and you can't be if you come here. Everything was good and I especially enjoyed my morning bun and cafe au lait. I love places that serve coffee drinks in big bowls! The morning bun was moist, gooey and crispy at the same time. I was surprised by the hint of orange. This is a nice place to treat yourself with some sweets. They definately know what they're doing in the oven.

I seem to only go to Tartine once a year, even though my friend lives above it. Could be the insane lines out the door past 2pm that keeps me away most of the time. Typically going for the quiche to-go, this time I was able to sit down and enjoy a nice ham croque monsieur to celebrate my best friend's move up from San Diego to the city. I couldn't talk the whole time. Face stuffed with croque. My banana creme tart is sinful and sitting in my fridge at the moment, since it was too much to finish in one sitting. I think I've gained 30 lbs. Fat and happy

How do I dignify this amazing gem with a review? I feel I am just not qualified to give an appropriate account of what one would experience here.... To start: yes the parking sucks and the line "looks" long. But the line moves fast and the second you are near the door any tension will melt away with that first inhalation of savory warm bakery air. It's truly an amazing place with a unique vibe that is hard to describe. Oh and the baked goods are ridiculous as well. I ordered a ham and cheese croissant for myself and bought a ton of baked goods for my fellow coworkers back at the office. ÊThe ham and cheese croissant is the most amazing bread product I have ever consumed. This place blew me away for breakfast, I can't wait to try lunch!

You can smell the buttery deliciousness wafting out of this place from down the street! ÊIt smells so good but you know it's gotta be sooo bad for you. I've been coming here on Sundays and the line is always out the door! ÊThey always have multiple friendly employees working to help you out with your breakfast cravings. ÊThe morning bun is my favorite thing here. ÊMy sister favors the croissants but that morning bun is freakin delicious. ÊWith a slight hint of orange, flaky and crunchy on the outside and soft and slightly gooey in the center, mmmmmmm. I've also tried all the different croissants - the almond one is probably my favorite of the bunch. ÊThe ham and cheese croissant was too salty for me. I really should stop eating those morning buns...

It seems like a lot of (thousands) people love this place but my experience was not the best. I came here in the middle of the day (1:30 ish) on a Wednesday with 2 girlfriends for a small lunch/snack. So I got an open-faced sandwich which was really just a big slice of bread that had cheese and tomatoes and ham on top. Like a pizza but not. More like a toasted sandwich with one slice of bread (instead of two) on the bottom. The "sandwich" was not good. To be specific - the bread was too hard so it was hard to bite and when in my mouth it was cutting my lips and gums! There were not too much ham and the cheese was hard.... not soft. The reason being that this sandwich was probably made in the morning and have been sitting around getting old for hours before I ordered it. I don't know what I was thinking ordering a "sandwich" that I can point at behind a counter... it looked old when I pointed at it. Toasting it didn't make much of a difference, just warm but not hot. Surprisingly not hot because it took them 20 mins to get it to me... its not like they had to make it from scratch, they had to toast it! Very disappointed. Oh and seats are rare, you have to fight for it, or hover over someone as they eat and wait for them to leave. Weird. I will give this place another chance when I'm in the neighborhood again. Since sooo many people heart it. I will try the scone next time.

Everything Tartine makes is solid gold. The croissants are fluffy, crunchy, and buttery all at once. The morning buns are sweet and chewy, with a hint of orange. The coffee has never let me down, plus if you get a latte they serve it in a bowl (tres chic! ...Unless you're prone to spills.) ...And don't get me started on their desserts! I mean, sure, almost everything Tartine offers could be considered a dessert depending on the time of day or if you didn't know better. Once you try their proper desserts, such as the chocolate cake or the lemon tart or the fruit bavarian, you'll realize the only place for their sweet cafe items is on the breakfast table. "Decadent" barely comes close to describing Tartine's desserts. I drool at the mere thought. The service is usually very good. There's always a line but that doesn't phase me because the servers are very good at keeping it moving.

How do I review this food mecca without giving justice, or offering an alternative perspective to the other thousand reviews? I will say this: I am a scone person, and I love their buttermilk scones. Trs Leches cake is divine and how-very-Mission-of-you. Love the pickled carrots that accompany the sandwiches. Thanks for using Four Barrel coffee.

The line is ridiculous, but it just goes to show you that we need more excellent bakeries in the area. You could open a tartine 2 across the street and it'd still be packed.

I came in prepared for a long wait in line. There was no point of even thinking about getting a table since not even one person left while I was waiting. I didn't mind the wait though since I was able to sneak a peek at the bakers in the back. I was looking forward to trying a ham and cheese croissant, but they were out. It seemed like they were out of a lot of stuff. I ended up getting the spinach quiche instead, which ended up being a poor choice. It was a bit too gooey and bitter for my tastes. The crust was perfectly buttery and flaky though. I probably should've tried the Croque Monsueir. Maybe next time. The Scharffen Berger mocha was probably one of the best mochas I've ever had. So smooth and delicious, with a generous dollop of fresh whipped cream. I could practically feel the chocolate flowing through my arteries. For some ridiculous reason I did not get a coconut cream tart even though it was calling out my name. Instead I had an eclair which was fabulous. The custard could've been a little thicker though. The cashier that helped me was a doll. We had a nice little chat. I will definitely make the trip here again to try out some more goodies!

Always delicious, never a disappointment. I am strictly speaking about the gastronomical gusto that Tartine packs in those amazing cakes (lemon meringue all the way around), bread pudding, quiches fit for kings and starving students, and paninis...however, the crowd could stand to lose a bit of that hipster-poseur-missionite-snobbery (yes, I said it, mission kids are snobs too) and just concentrate on eating that deliciousness that Tartine whips up.

Finally tried some new things here...always been wanting to, but always got stuck to my favorite ones. Banana Cream Tart: I thought the lemon cream tart has the best crust in the world, but after I tried the Banana Cream Tart, I discovered that there are 2 best tart crust in the world. It is so incredibly flaky, which is very different from the cookie-ish crust of lemon cream tart. The thin layer of chocolate stops the moisture from the banana caramel filling from softening the crust, smart!! It adds texture, and extra kick. The filling....can't describe it, so caramel-y and banana-y. Why so much whipped cream? Because it balances out the sweetness of the filling, how nice! I love the shaved chocolate on top too. The whole tart is a big box of surprises, texture, and dreamy-heavenly-creaminess. The fragipan tart was good but not my thing...it has the same filling as the almond croissant which I absolutely love, but this tart is just way over the top...too heavy and sweet... Pumpkin tea cake is nice and spicy. Possibly the best one i've had, except for the ones I make :-) Tres Leches Cake: pretty good, the cream in between the cake layers is very nice, not too sweet, just enough moisture. Not the best I've had, but among the better ones. Coffee: free refill which is great, tastes thin but big flavor! I've had almost all the sandwiches on the menu, not any single one of them is less than great. They are simple combination of the best ingredients. Isn't it the best concept ever? The muesli, I have to say, doesn't really taste like what I expected. I was skeptical about it since it's always been soaked in the yogurt in that big bowl in the cooler all day. I like my muesli crunchy. Finally tried, it's much light than I expected, and the crunchiness comes from the fresh apple, not the toasted oats, overall pretty straight-forward and possibly the lightest thing in the whole bakery. My favorite breakfast ever: plain croissant toasted (I buy 5 of them every time I come, weekly supply) in the oven 250 F for 10 minutes, eat it with Harvest Songs Rose Petal Jam...and coffee from Philz...that's what get me going every morning. I agree with the comment on the rude biker who parked the bike inside the restaurant. I HATED it. It's a table for people to stand and enjoy the food, not for your bike.

Let me preface this by saying that I at at Tartine for the first time a number of weeks ago. 'Twas before the end of finals and the blurr that is Christmas/the entire holiday season. That being said, you'll have to forgive me if certain delicious details are inadvertently omitted from this review. Tartine automatically gets 5 stars for me, because they were able to do something that no PLACE or no ONE has ever been able to do previously. But what would incine you, good reader, to read further if I told you this information now? Never one to give away my milk for free, I'll let you know why in exactly two paragraphs why Tartine warrants such blatant praise from yours truly. Myself and three friends luckily managed to grab a table not .00005 seconds after two old Asian ladies had stood up. We sardined ourselves into the chairs and waited for our food. And while we waited, we broke bread- specifically the gougre pastry (I believe?) which was spectacular. I had a Smoked Chicken (I think) sandwich, which (hah) was presented in four BIG corners. I could only finish three, being more than enough for a starving individual. It was absolutely delicious, and I savored every bite- something I rarely do. It honestly was that good. Ê Now what was in this delightful lunch item that made it so good? It was the broccoli and cheese paste that lined the pieces of bread. Now, I'm notorious for not eating anything green. It's horrible, but true. And I both ate AND enjoyed the broccoli paste. But here's the scary part: solid, unmistakable chunks of broccoli were in the sandwich, and I *still* ate them without fuss nor muss. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, THAT is why I give Tartine 5 coveted stars. No place or person has ever had me knowingly eat chuncks of a vegetable, and enjoyed it. Ever. *standing ovation*

I had read about Tartine Bakery on Yelp and I had always wanted to try it. When I finally looked up where it was, I was a bit confused because I did not remember it in the neighborhood. Turns out I had such Pizzeria Delfina/Bi-Rite Creamery tunnel vision that I never even noticed that Tartine Bakery was right on the corner. I had the delicious lime/passion fruit cake and it was sooo good. The lime makes it perfectly tart and the cake is moist as can be. My friend had the banana cream tart and she loved it. Half way through consuming it she noticed that there was caramel in the bottom of the tart - just when she thought it could not be any richer! Everything there looked so good, but the prices are a bit high. My only fear is that I will never come back because I will be tempted by the wonder that is Bi-Rite's salted caramel ice cream. Too much good food in a one block region.

I hate waiting in lines but Tartine is definitely worth the trouble. ÊDo yourself a favor and pick up some baked goods on your way to Dolores Park to enjoy on a sunny day. My favorite thing to get would be the Double Chocolate Cookies. They're small but sinfully decadent. My only complaint is about their Devil's Food Cake. This cake was served at my birthday celebration a few years ago; as it's been a while I don't remember what was wrong with it but I don't recall anyone enjoying it. We threw the leftovers away. Other than that cake, everything I've tried there has been delicious and they have a friendly staff.

I can't give Tartine anything but 5 stars, even though I find their popularity ridiculous. The pastry is very good. The way people line up, however, one would think starving San Franciscans had been eating sawdust for years and brioche were only just now available. I disapprove of fussy mission hype in general. I don't disapprove of Tartine or their pastry. I bought several dozen wedding cookies from them for - duh - my wedding. They were not just delicious, they were photogenic. The staff were also very helpful, even though I was only buying little cookies. We walked in, picked them up, and got married - with cookies.

Yummy yummy yummy! This place was packed when we arrived around 10:30am for a late lunch. My friend and I ordered a cup of Muesli and (a cup of) brioche bread pudding to share between the two of us. Oh, and the croissant filled with ham. They mistakenly put our bread pudding a bowl (and I just realized now that I left it at home and will be at my boyfriend's house the ENTIRE WEEK great...), but charged us the cup size for their mistake! Score! I wanted a hot chocolate but ended up getting a Lorina Lemonade (a decision I later regretted). It was packed inside, so we had to sit outside, which sucked because all of the tables weren't receiving sunlight since the building was blocking the sun. Boo. And that is when I regretted getting a cold drink... The Muesli was delcious! We ate it up. It wasn't too sweet and it was just right. The bread pudding was also delicious, but I was hoping it would have been served a tad bit warmed. Same goes for the croissant. That was delicious, but warmed would have been nice. I do want to go back and try more like quiche, croque monsieur, the almond croissant...so, good thing I went with my friend! Now I have to take my boyfriend back. :0)

WOW!! That was the first thing out of our mouths when we finally made it here after hearing and reading so much about this place. ÊIt took a picture of their morning buns to give me that push over the edge to get our butts over to Tartine and see what it's all about. So after a rather full lunch, ignoring all and any new years resolutions about eating healthy (yeah, forget that!), we made it over. Ê Small place, but it's chock full of goodies! ÊMy eyes were frantically looking over everything, trying to figure out what I wanted before it was my turn. ÊEverything looked SO good! ÊWe decided on the lemon tart, banana cream tart, ham and gruyere croissant, and of course, their morning bun. DELICIOUS!! ÊAll the hype and recognition this place has gotten is very well deserved! ÊYou really can't help saying "OMG, SO GOOD" after every single bite! And yeah, it's official, I'm coming back as often as I can, so seriously, goodbye resolutions! ÊI'm going to indulge myself!

1000+ gleaming reviews can't be wrong: Tartine has been called the best bakery in the city/US/world by many a yelper and pro food writer. They aren't kidding about those scones and morning buns. Tartine is also a cool place to hang out and people watch if you don't mind the crowds.And they have this little community bulletin board that I think is a joke, whatever it's hilarious. A must for any visiting foodie or local looking for the best SF has to offer. PS. The best thing about those scones is the Devonshire cream and apricot jam that go on them. My mouth is watering just thinking about it!

The fruit tart was probably one of the best I have ever had. All of the fruit that was on it was sweet and ripe. It was just delicious. So was the Banana Chocolate Tart! The bread pudding was okay, my friend gave me a taste of her's and I was glad that I hadn't gotten it. The wait was long and the seating was limited, but I would defnitely go back there to have another fruit tart!

Just stand outside and you'll get a pretty good sense of why it's consistently rated so high. We came here around 11:30 for a brunch/lunch-ish thing and although the wait was long, the tables freed up pretty quickly. Food: Chocolate croissant - deliciously puff and the pastry was soooo mouthwatering delicious. The chocolate inside was bittersweet, which gives a great balance to the pastry. 4/5 Lemon tart - OMG. I've never had anything so good and I don't even like lemon desserts. The crust was very buttery, the lemon filling was just the right amount of tart, and the cream dollop on top really rounds out the dessert perfectly. 5/5 Chocolate hazelnut tart - It's like a brownie in a tart shell! The hazelnuts on top added to the whole tart and you can really taste the hazelnut flavor. 4/5 Croque Monsieur - It's an open face ham and cheese sandwich that is out of this world. My mouth still waters from it freshly baked out of the oven. 5/5 Pastrami Pressed Sandwich - The pastrami was so juicy and the horseradish gives the whole sandwich a great kick. 5/5 If you want to get coffee or drinks only, bypass the long line and go directly to their drinks counter in the back. The pressed sandwiches can take quite a while, so just to forewarn those that later on want to complain about the wait. It was well worth it. LOVE this place. Oh and FYI- prices are definitely on the high side so it's not something that I would frequent even though I'm living in the city. It's more like special occasions prices.

As per yelper's reviews, did the morning bun and the frangipane croissant. Both were very good but very sweet and very filling. Coffee was good. Wait was not bad on a weekday before 9 AM. It's loud if you sit inside. Glad I finally went. Next time I'll do the brioche bread pudding with fruit, or gougere.

Came here in high anticipation of their pastries but, as a native SoCal girl, I've got to say up front that Tartine has nothin' on Porto's. That being said, their lemon tart is really, truly amazing. Just the right amount of zing in the cream that was complemented by their perfectly baked crust. Their less-than-stellar eats were the fruit tart (which only had raspberries and blackberries and ZERO glaze), bread pudding, and coconut cream tart. Don't get me wrong, they were decently good but not good enough to wait in line for. In the end, the lemon tart definitely won over my heart.

The pastries are indeed delicious, and the coffee is carefully crafted. It's a very popular joint, and you can see all kinds of hipsters, suits, and everything in between. The 20ft-long lines during "peak" hours (sunny weekend days all-day long) are getting uncool though. The "Mexican Wedding Cookie" is delicious, and the bread puddings are amazing when they're fresh.

4.5 stars, only because their delicious baked goods are slightly on the pricey end. ÊBut you are paying for quality here. ÊI have tried the frangipane croissant ($4.25) and the lemon poppyseed tea cake ($3.75) and while both are delicious, I must say I like the tea cake better. ÊThe refreshing citrusy lightness perfectly balances the butteriness that I know must go into making such a moist cake. ÊBut the most surprising and delicious element is the crunchy sugary coating. ÊI am so in love with this dessert I found the recipe in the Tartine cookbook and will soon begin my endeavors to recreate this culinary masterpiece.

I need to come back! ÊThere was so much good stuff here and I just wasn't able to try it all. ÊUgh. Croissant - very good and moist and buttery Mexican wedding cookie - a solid performance Dark chocolate chip oatmeal with nuts - not that great, it was super thin and super crispy which is just not how I usually like my cookies so I'll skip this one next time On the list to try: the sandwiches, the tarts, and the morning bun I was a bit disappointed in the wait staff though. ÊThey were the unhappiest people on earth. ÊThe system is that one guy puts your stuff in brown paper bags and puts them on a table behind the cashier. ÊThen the cashier rings you up. ÊAs I was in line I thought "wow, all those identical paper bags stacked up on that table - pretty impressive they can keep track of which bag belongs to which customer" Êwell nope....they can't.

There is a reason why there is most often a line out the door to Tartine. This bakeshop shows the passion of the owners and their staff. The way they operate, baking through the day, bread out of the ovens at 5 pm is not like traditional bakeshops where the bake is done in wee hours the morning and by noon is off on taste and freshness. Bravo for the superb products you give to us. You live up to the hype, not often the case I find. I am in love with the Lemon Cream tartlet and the Fromage Blanc Bavarian. It is simply the best lemon tart I have eaten, and I have eaten quite a few, lol. The mark of a great bakeshop, in my opinion, is how well they do the common products. The simplicity of a well made lemon tart, the croissant or a country loaf of bread are often times so mediocre but here at Tartine, they are all spot on!! I have used the Tartine pastry book that came out quite awhile ago and now have been baking bread each weekend from the Tartine Bread book. Yes, you can turn out amazing breads at home with Chad's technique. In any event, I will close by saying, I will hit Tartine whenever I am in the city and continue to support this couple, who's passion for baking has paired so well, and given us such superb baked goods to enjoy! Don't visit San Francisco without a stop here!

Popped my Tartine cherry just last weekend after hearing raves of reviews from friends. We waited in line for about 15-20 minutes to place our order. I think it was the delicious aroma of the bakery, but I got into a frenzy and ended up ordering about $25 worth of goodies for myself... The morning bun was delicious! The orange glaze really makes their morning bun different from others. I also tried their ham and cheese croissant, which was absolutely fabulous. I have never had such a beautifully textured croissant. It was flaky, crunchy, soft, and moist all at the same time! I ordered shortbread, mexican wedding cookies, coconut macaroons, and their chocolate nib rochers. I think that their pastries are a lot better than their small desserts. However, the mexican wedding cookies are pretty fantastic.

This place is a frenchy heart attack. But they'll make it worth your while. Sweet or Savory this place has a killer selection of great food a drink, but make sure you're ready to stomach some butter, because it's in e-v-e-r-y-t-h-i-n-g. Except for the "side salad" which is just a little head of lettuce, but magically seasoned with lemon, salt, pepper, and oil. Yum.

With their lack of signage (same is true at their restaurant too), it seems like they don't want people to know that they're there and they exist. Luckily you can tell by the line out the door (or the address, smarty pants). Haha. We proceeded to wait in line - I didn't think it was sooo long but a few people ahead of us gave up and left while we were waiting. Inside was packed - some small tables and some big too - so it's communal. The staff varies from semi rude to semi out of it. And since there are so many people in there and in line, I got skipped over being helped a few times. It's kinda chaotic. I really wanted to try their Double Pain Au Chocolat but they were out that afternoon. So I settled for a croissant and a morning bun. Almost $4 for each - so overpriced - yet people still wait in line for it. After tasting it, they were both good. The croissant was flakey and moist, not oily. And the morning bun was surprising light with the hint of orange and cinnamon roll type quality. But worth the price and the wait - probably not and kinda overrated. Glad I tried it though and will be back for the chocolate pastry.

Tartine is ALWAYS crowded. Partly for the food and partly because it's just trendy. I found it to be hit or miss, but when you get the good stuff, it's heaven. I love the scones, almond croissants, morning buns and green salad. The cakes looks terrific, but I've never had them. While the pain au chocolat have great chocolate used in it, the pastry itself isn't the same melt-in-your-mouth delicate like the ones I've had in France. But really, how often do you get the perfect one ouside of the country itself? I also think they're heavy-handed with the bechamel sauce and it kinda ruins the sandwiches. Other than that- if you can find a place to sit and enjoy your meal- it's worth the wait.

Went here with two friends this past Saturday and I cannot help but give this place 5 stars just for their PHENOMENAL bread pudding. I mean, the chocolate chip cookie we shared was OK and the latte I had was pretty good, the macaroons we got were pretty decadent too but the bread pudding has been haunting my dreams since Saturday. The three of us shared a bowl and we were practically spoon fencing for the last bite!!! I went here once before with the same friends plus others as Andy was on and on about their bread pudding during dinner across the street at Platanos. However, when we got there after we ate, they were out of the bread pudding!! So I had the Scharffenburger chocolate mousse and it was pretty good, but my latte was bitter as hay. I didn't write a review as I was hoping to go back and give Tartine a second chance with their bread pudding. Boy am I glad I did!!! Or perhaps I should be worried as I already feel addicted and I can see my hips grow grow grow!!! Either way, I highly recommend a visit to this place...one day, I'd love to try them out for breakfast...their croissants look SO flaky...yum. I'm totally going back for more...again and again and again. UPDATE 1.8.07: I've gone back to Tartine several times since my last review and I've been disappointed pretty much each time. The bread pudding is still fabulous although this past Sunday they had one with whole, slightly cooked cranberries and they were just too tart. The combination of the crunchy, tart fruit with the sweet, melt-in-your mouth pudding just didn't work for me or my two friend who were with me. This same trip we tried out one of the almond croissants and they are in fact very flaky and we did enjoy it though it took all 3 of us to finish it. I think it was a little bit heavy on the filling but still good. However, all that isn't enough for me to cut out the one star I've decreased my rating to - what did, is the fact that EVERY time I've been there and asked for a large latte with ONE shot of espresso, I end up with the exact SAME latte my friend will get with two shots - bitter, bitter, bitter. Plus, I can't have a lot of caffeine either so I can never drink it and end up wasting money - no more you wicked barristas at Tartine!!! I'll stick to getting my lattes at Starbucks where they listen to my customized order. Also, the sandwiches we tried a previous time just weren't that impressive and quite greasy for my taste, and the quiche my friend got on Sunday was a tiny serving and not very impressive in taste (or so he said).

Anyone who has any sense at all would give this place five full stars. ÊI have read a few reviews that are kind of malicious and petty about Tartine, so I will salute their efforts. Ê Their bread is excellent, it is worth the horrible parking and even worse the yuppies. ÊFor a mere $4.95 you can eat the divine country bread for several days without it getting overly dry. Ê The other items I enjoy are the croissants, which are so buttery and flaky, you will swear that La Boulangerie's croissants are second rate .

Man, I wanted to not like this place. I was determined to cry, "Overrated!" after I finally sucked it up and ate here a few months ago. My Creative Writing students decided that having our last class off-campus was a splendid idea (of course they did, they're high schoolers) and the consensus seemed to be that the Mission was "literary" (no one felt like going all the way to North Beach). Of course, these being private school kids they were way more Tartine-minded then say, Happy Doughnuts-minded so Tartine is where we ended up. The queue was long and daunting, but I was visually in love with the culinary delights in the cases. Sweet or savory? Sweet or savory? I went for savory (quiche) and got an iced coffee to wash it down. I actually ended up spilling my coffee all over the coffee bar right after I got it while I was putting on the lid, but luckily the staff was very nice and understanding; they quickly cleaned it up and made me another. The quiche was very good, but I wasn't entirely sold until my last two visits. I went a couple of weeks ago with a very nice Swiss-French gentleman and ordered a chocolate croissant, which rivaled any that I've had in France (he agreed). I went again a week later to meet a former student and had the bread pudding and just about died of over-indulgence--so good! So yeah, Tartine. Of course it's good. I'd give it five stars, but it is a tad too sceney for my taste and I've never been able to actually sit down in the cafe, which in the end is okay because Dolores Park makes for a perfect picnic spot. I also haven't tried the food food, so after a proper taste of everything I'll have to re-visit my review.

Aside from delightful and attractive employees, this place strikes me as more scenester than delicious. ÊMost people (particularly girls) I've met in this city wax about how terrific Tartine is. ÊI've now been a half dozen times, always with someone who attempts to convert me, and I've never been wowed in any sense. First off, the coffee is Mr. Espresso, which is sort of crap.

ÊI'm beginning to think people in this city haven't had introductions to quality pastry. In short, not worth the wait, but I wish I could point you to a better alternative.

I just went here with a dear friend and I must say, this place rocked! We were quite decadent and shared three goodies between the two of us, plus had coffee and tea. I'm a fan of Mr. Espresso coffee, so that was great. The three yummies we had were the morning bun, the lemon tarte and the banana cream thing (apologies for not having the correct names). It was my first time. For health reasons, I can't have too many sugars, so I just took bites of everything. Oh my god! Everything was heavenly! I'm definitely going back again! Please note that the cafe is a bit small and can get a little crowded. I love that they are environmentally conscious. Finally, I hear that the bread goes fast!

Lots of hype to live up to. Smashed sandwiches (aka paninis) are pretty much my favorite food in the world, so I was psyched to try their interesting combos. After hovering around for a seat, we crowded awkwardly onto the end of a table, which wasn't ideal but it worked. We waited for our sandwiches while exercising extreme impulse control by not dipping immediately into the luscious-looking desserts sitting before us. Our sandwiches came and they didn't disappoint although...not the best either. I love rich foods, but these were really rich. Like, I felt like I was at risk of a heart attack immediately after. Pace yourselves with these babies. The hearty sandwiches took the sails out of dessert a little bit; I thought the bread pudding was great but not fantastic. I think I'd like this place better as a coffee-pastry affair rather than a lunch deal.

I was skeptical. All the accolades, the adulation, the superlatives. When the New York Times' Mark Bittman declared Tartine the BEST bakery in the entire U.S., I was agog. Surely you jest Mr. Bittman! But then I went to Tartine and was educated. Yeah it took forever to get the damned pastries (40 minutes!). And frankly, I'm not even that big on pastries, croissants and the like. But man, I'll be damned if those weren't the most delicious, flakiest croissants and rolls I've ever had in my life (I shudder to think of what the butter to flour ratio must be in their concoctions). Anyway, I've since converted to the Church of Tartine and will try to attend "services" on a weekly basis in the future...

My posts are getting shorter and shorter--sorry. All this eating, walking and partying with friends really takes it out of a girl! One of my last stops, before a birthday dinner for my friends at someone's house, was lunch at my beloved Tartine Bakery. Man, the lines at this place have gotten even longer! I didn't think that was possible. But, the wait is soooo worth it when you are talking about baked items this good. The reason I came: the "croque-monsieur" with ham, tomatoes, Bchamel sauce, cheese and their coveted country French bread (it sells out so fast you have to get their an hour before they come out of the oven--seriously). These things are just plain evil and I blame them for making me fat when I was living in SF (joking, of course). They are just insane and I love the pickled veggies that come on the side instead of chips. I also got a side salad of baby gem lettuce dressed simply. The perfect meal. I also grabbed some cookies as a thank you for my friend's roomie for letting me stay at their place and some coconut macaroons for the sweet fiends in my life.

Overrated. ÊWhen my sister comes to town we usually have an eatfest, which typically consists of some pho or dim sum consumption, some tapioca drink consumption and some baked goods consumption. ÊSo why is it that whenever we go here all the hipsters are crowding up the joint and no one remembers their manners? ÊWell I ain't going to dwell on that part. Nothing I've had here is memorable. ÊTo the point that I don't even remember what I had last time I was there. ÊI always remember what I've eaten at the Rigo-owned Boulangeries throughout the city.

Really, this place doesn't need another review, but upon seeing the negative comments, I had to add a five. Êthis is not possibly the best, it is the best bakery in town. Êyes, the line and wait suck, but the pastries can't be beat. Ê My suggestion: Êcan't really go wrong with anything, their specialty is the bread pudding, but I love the chocolate croissant. ÊEspecially if you are lucky enough to get it fresh from the oven. ÊQuality chocolate, flaky and crusty outside, buttery, and absolutely decadent. Ê Avoid the line by not going Sunday or Saturday brunch time and then take your pastry over to the park!

I don't know if there is anything I can rave about Tartine that hasn't already been, um, raved. I must be honest, however, I used my secret Yelping Êpowers to give you the exceedingly rare six stars. Then I mulled it over and took one half star for running out of chocolate croissants so often and the other half because the layout still frustrates me. Five stars nonetheless for you my darling Tartine, my always-there-for-me feel good place. (In case you were wondering, heaven for me: a rich chocolate eclair with a cold, creamy center juxtaposed against a warm well-made latte in a bowl... ohhh baby.)

Be ready for a 30 minute wait-- at minimum. The line gets long quick. There was so much hype about Tartine's bread pudding that we just had to have it. It was good. Not great. A little too mushy than we'd like. But from what everyone was having, everything look mouth- watering good. It's too bad we had really high expectations for the bread pudding.

One sunny day, I waited 20 minutes in line. But I needed to try this place cause I hard sooooo much. I tried bread pudding, too much butter and suger in this bread pudding. They gave me a looot for $3. I also got a banana pound cake, which was also $3 and I thought it was expensive. This was also too oily and my paper napkin was soaked with oil after 2 minutes of holding with it. I think it was good but it is not worth going to mission and wait 20 minutes and having to eat standing up.

I am in love. This bakery is soooo good. I had their bread while having dinner at Delfina, a restaurant next door to it, last night. It was the BEST bread I have ever tasted and I have been thinking about it every since! I don't know the name of it. But it's shaped kind of like a football (except flat on the bottom). But it's about three or four times the size of a football! It's huge! The crust is chewy, flaky and crunchy all at the same time. The flesh inside is full of air pockets and deliciously moist with a slight sour yeast taste. I just went back to get a loaf of that bread just now. Unfortunately, they bake it every night of the week EXCEPT Mondays! What a bummer. I don't feel so bad though. I got a croissant, which was fabulous! It is hard to find a really good croissant for some reason. But this one was French perfection. I also got a lemon tart for dessert tonight and a couple of pieces of quiche for breakfast tomorrow. I am in love with this bakery. They make very high-quality products. I am impressed and will now be a regular customer.

I felt like I need to be one step closer to pre-diabetes, so I went for my monthly dose of baked goods. Tartine was the choice bakery simply because their lemon tart is out of this world. I can eat three of those in one sitting, though I'd probably wouldn't since that would throw my one-meal-per-day diet out of whack. Everything about this bakery is just simply good.

I love this bakery! My favorites from Tartine most definitely are: 1. Chocolate pudding - so creamy, smooth, chocolatey, the fresh whipped cream and chocolate shaving on top really take it that one notch higher. ÊThe best choco pudding I've ever had...EVER! 2. Morning bun - it comes out soft, warm chewy and gooey, the piece de resistance is the orange zest. ÊSOooo delicious! ÊCinnamon, raisins and brown sugar are so typical, the orange zest makes it a stand out! ÊI can usually only eat half, I save the other half for later where it's just as delicious. 3. Almond croissant - warm, flaky, buttery, just the right amount of frangipane to make it a little gooey/chewy, definitely not too sweet. ÊAgain, I can only usually eat half in a single sitting, and it's still really good later on as a snack. Other stuff: I've also had the lemon meringue cake (much too sweet), ham and cheese croissant (good, but not as good as the almond), the chocolate hazelnut tart (um, not so much, too thick and dense), mushroom quiche (it's aiight...I wouldn't waste stomach space on this again), bread pudding (I really didn't like this at all - kinda mushy, eggy and unimpressive), the scone (really unmemorable compared with the morning bun), and the jambon and gruyere sandwich (kinda salty, but ok). The 'not so much' list seems long, but overall this bakery blows the rest away. ÊYou can definitely tell they work hard to make quality and delicious products, can't really ask for anything more.

Here are the things I tried: Bread pudding: I really liked it. I could taste the cinnamon, the eggs, and the milk, and big pieces of fruits definitely mixed very well with the custard. Chocolate croissant: VERY good, and it's something you've gotta try. It's true that you'll feel like you are eating a stick of butter, but I've haven't had a chocolate croissant that's not stingy on the chocolate. I'm very happy with it. It's huge too. I had to split it into two separate meals. Lemon bar: strangely, it's very sweet yet very sour and tart all together. It's very good. Lemon cream tart: it's not as sweet or sour/ tart as the lemon bar. It's still good, but I'd go for the lemon bar. My hubby doesn't eat sweets, and once in a while he'd have a lemon bar, but it's hard for him to find one that suits his taste buds. Even he thought the lemon bar here was good. Brownies: Not the best I've had so save the money. I would definitely go back for its other pastries. By the way, if you are trying to lose weight, don't go to Tartine. It's very generous on the goodies, which is the fattening ingredients :) I also went on a weekday cuz this place is famous of the line of people lining out the door on weekends. Even on a weekday afternoon, it was crowded. At least the wasn't a big line.

How the hell did this place get so popular? ÊI had high hopes for this place after seeing all the great reviews they were getting from Yelp. ÊI had a horrible experience here and would never come back even if they were giving away free food. The first thing I noticed was the guy behind the counter with the thick mustache and a tank top. ÊHe reminded me of L. Ron Bumquist from "Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas". ÊHe looked like he just crawled out of bed, and went straight to work. ÊHe looked pretty sloppy considering the fact that this is supposed to be a "five star" bakery. ÊIt didn't bother me too much until he walked by while I was eating and I caught a strong whiff of BO.... not cool at all. ÊI stopped eating after that. The food itself was nothing extraordinary. ÊI ordered the bread pudding since that is one of my favorite desserts. ÊI've had plenty of bread pudding in my life, and this has to have been the worst I've ever had. ÊI don't like my bread pudding too wet and this was practically soaked and was prepared sloppily. ÊThe cookies and other pastries just didn't do it for me either. ÊThe only thing that was pretty good was the shortbread cookie, and it doesn't take a genius to make a good shortbread cookie. I'm still shocked at all the support this bakery is getting. ÊI like to think I have decent taste in food and desserts which makes me wonder why my experience was so different from 1000+ other people. ÊMaybe I'm a little biased, I was comparing it to my favorite dessert place which is Extraordinary Desserts in San Diego, and this place doesn't even come close. ÊTo the San Franciscans who love their fancy desserts, try to check that place out next time you're in SD.

But Tartine didn't disappoint -- each and every morsel of our assorted breakfast goodies was absolutely amazing.

I had breakfast in the morning here and a round of bread in the afternoon. My breakfast was perhaps the best meal I had in San Francisco this trip. I tried 6 different dishes here, the highlight being the Croque and Chocolate Vanilla Pudding. The Croque can be had a few different ways: plain, ham, cracked egg and mushroom. I had it with ham. It was savory and delicious. Not to be missed. The Chocolate Vanilla Pudding simply was divine. I still remember every bite. I also had the Morning Bun, croissants, Chocolate Hazelnut tart and the Banana Creme Tart. While pretty good, not stellar. In the afternoon some truly fantastic breads are also available. Tasty with a nice crust and soft interior. The only complaint one can have is that it is quite crowded since the food is so good. There is a line to enter and order your food. Once you have your order placed finding someplace to sit is a cutthroat affair. Tartine is not to be missed.

Finally gave this place a try after reading the reviews on Yelp. I ordered the banana cream tart as well as a coconut cream tart. OMFG, are they delish. I ate half of each tart....in one sitting...it was so good. I probably could've devoured both tarts in one sitting. The fillings were very smooth and flavorful without being too sweet. The crust is very flaky, and the bottom is layered with chocolate...then the filling which is topped with whipped cream. i also swear there was a bit of caramel in it too.. yummm. I just wish these tarts were cheaper! However, the quality is probably worth the $6+. I came by around 3:30 on Friday and there were about 10 people in line. Service is pretty quick, so no worries there. I will have to come back at an earlier time to try the Morning Buns everyone is raving about!

Thank you Tartine!!!!! Not just for your fantastic representation of french pastries and delights, but for sharing the recipes with the world to make at home! ÊI first bought the Tartine cookbook never before visiting the cafe. ÊSo far the few recipes I have attempted have been a success which is pretty rare for me. ÊThe banana cream tart recipe had me feeling like a pro with bananas and a light custard encased in a buttery flaky crust, topped with fresh whip cream and chocolate shavings!!! Upon visiting San Francisco, I already had an idea of how good it would be, but I am happy to say that it was even better than I imagined!! ÊAnd I haven't even yet tried the croissants or bread pudding yet! Tres leches cake- do not come here and not try this. ÊCoconut chiffon cake soaked in sweet milk and layered with an indescribably good frosting. Banana cream tart- Êdecadent and light as a cloud all at once Chocolate Eclair- Êa classic elevated by the highest quality of chocolate and attention to detail Almon rocher- Êcrispy on the outside and chewy on the inside with a lovely almond flavor Croquet Monsieur with mushrooms- Ever so packed with burnt cheesy goodness and such a nice texture from the mushrooms and bread Nettle quiche- Êbest quiche I've ever had.

So back in my first review, I talked about how my friend introduced me to this place along with two other places and that every time I think of either place, I think of her and the adventures we would have together. She couldn't get enough of their croissants. In fact, when she moved to Paris, she said the croissants here were almost as good as the ones there. Maybe even better... that conversation was like two years ago. I've only been here four or five times, the most recent being last week. I had bookmarked this place a long time ago and left the following note: "Great food but hipster heaven." Now after going back, I have to retract that statement. Last week, it was more like yuppie heaven and former yuppies who are too old to be called yuppies but still have the superiority and money of one. Then again, I went before noon and as we all know, hipsters don't get up until noon just to be ironic. (I kid, I kid... I don't think anyone knows what a hipster is anymore and just like to throw it out to anyone who's pretentious... but that's not really the case... and I prefer hipsters over yuppies any day.) To be honest, there was a mix of people there, as you would expect from the gentrified Mission nowadays. The croissants are fucking awesome. That almond-filled frangipane (or something similarly spelled) croissant is great and the regular croissant is still really, really good. The food is five stars for sure. The major problems I have with this place is that it's too popular. I know, how can you really blame a bakery or any establishment for having quality products and having loyal fans? The thing is if a place is really popular, the smart entrepreneurs will find a way to upgrade their service by either relocating, hiring more help, or redesigning so that the place is more efficient. The line is just uncalled for. If I have to wait in line for more than twenty minutes, and still not even be able to find seats, then I'm sorry... that just doesn't cut it with me. Sure, the people who work there are cool, but that place is just too cramped for the amount of people that come here. They're lucky that their food is just really, really great. I just don't like the fact that I can't sit down and enjoy their food right away. I'll still come here whenever I'm in the neighborhood that early or when I need to introduce friends to their products, but I'm in no rush. When I go to Tartine, I buy a lot of stuff because I know I won't come back for another year or so and I need to get my fix satiated... and coming to Tartine is definitely an experience with both good and bad mixed in. If you don't mind long lines and love great pastries and desserts, this place is great. And even if you don't, I'd suggest going on a day when your tolerance level is pretty high (or when the line isn't ridiculously long) because it's worth it to go at least once.

Get the bread pudding. ÊSeriously... GET IT! ÊThe bread pudding is worth 5 stars. ÊThe sandwiches and croissants get 2 stars. ÊI would not order them again. ÊService gets 3 stars because I don't like to clean up after myself. ÊOverall, I still think this place is worth the wait in line but only for the bread pudding. ÊSeating was quite hard to find. ÊIt was also hard to navigate through the crowd of people without fearing that I would spill my bread pudding all over someone by accident. ÊHowever, the ordering line did move quicker than expected.

cute little bakery, seems to be packed most of the time. assortment of sandwiches, pastries, etc... some delicious, some just okay. on a Sunday evening, my cousin and i came here to try some of Tartine's stuff. we got a few items to try out, including Mozzarella & Tapenade sandwich, macaroons, biscotti, oatmeal cookie, and banana tea bread. the Mozarella & Tapenade sandwich was delicious. at first, the $12 seemed a bit too steep to me, but once we got the sandwich i realized it wasn't too bad considering how big it was. definitely bigger than your average panini/hot sandwich. the sandwich was very tasty, and i really liked that even with the cheese, it wasn't too heavy or overbearing to eat. very light and yummy. LOVED the macaroons & banana tea bread. i usually don't like macaroons, but there's are to die for. perfect crispiness on the outside, and just so delicious on the inside. if you're a lover of banana bread like me, try out their version with a bit of a hint of tea. i also love tea infused flavors, so this was definitely a plus for me. as for the rest, the biscotti and oatmeal cookie were just okay. both were kind of bland and boring. definitely will come back next time to grab some treats.

I took my Parisian friend to Tartine when she was visiting San Francisco. Not only did she declare their croissant the best one she's had outside of Paris but she said if she goes to Paris and gets a mediocre croissant she's know going to think "I can get way better than this in San Francisco!" and I've never met anyone as discerning of a croissant as her. I'm a sucker for the Morning Buns and Bread Pudding myself, but then again, I wasn't born and raised in Paris.

I have officially tried everything Tartine makes for breakfast. ÊIt's Nan C.'s fault. ÊAnyways, everything is excellent, and I am totally addicted to their open face grilled cheese sandwiches. ÊThe line totally sucks and I wish they'd find a way to better manage it -- also a "dog parking" spot would be great.

Came across this nice place after reading a review of Bi-Rite Creamery and another review mentioned this place. (thank you!) The line of people out the door made me think that this place must be the real deal and worth the wait. I was right. I checked the one page menu and decided on the fresh fruit Bavarian cake. It was awesome. The raspberries and blueberries were very fresh. I was glad that they accepted credit cards and that the line moved quickly. I really wish I had the room in my stomach for some of the super yummy looking pressed sandwiches. Maybe next time. As an out of towner, I will seek out this place again. (unless yelp or someone else tells me of another great place).

Since 2200+ reviews are posted already, I'm going to spare you the long review and avoid any repetition, but there are 3 things to remember: 1) Croque Monsieur (9.75) 2) Pain au Jambon Croissant (4.75) - they sold out on these goodies quickly. 3) Bread Pudding (3.50/6) Come early and come hungry!

Delicious sweets and hot pressed sandwiches (which are huge!) ÊVery simple fare, but strong flavors and premium ingredients = yum! Ê Favorite hot pressed sandwiches: Ê - Humboldt Fog Goat Cheese on Walnut Bread - Mozzarella & Tapenade (fresh mozzarella with house-made nioise olive and anchovy puree). My only complaint is only kind of a complaint... Êthe portions are so large, and the tastes are so simple, so sometimes I get a little sick of whatever I'm eating. ÊIt seems a little unfair to complain about large portion sizes, though, so I usually just fix this "problem" by eating half of my sandwich there, and saving the other half for later.

We stopped in here to quickly grab some cookies and other treats for dessert later that night. The place was absolutely packed to the rafters, with every table being taken and a long line going from the register along the display case and almost to the door. It was so long that rather than try to angle the stroller in, Loria sent me in on a solo mission and hung back by the door to entertain the baby. Having arrived in the later afternoon, I tried to peek through the line to see what is left. The cases were full of cookies, tarts, and breads, and each looked very inviting. For some reason I was feeling rushed, so I started pointing at random cookies without really getting a good sense of what looked best. I decided to skip the $6.50 miniature banana cream tart and ended up with a variety of cookies. As the line moved along the case, I inevitably saw this chocolate chip doodad or that walnut butter whatever, eventually requiring the patient woman helping me to bag my selections three separate times. Later that night, we dug in and are fairly disappointed. Nothing tasted bad, per se, but it all felt like pretty standard bakery fare. It all looked much better than it tasted, unfortunately, and a few of the cookies went unfinished. It's only later that I remembered that the place is renowned for its double pain au chocolat, but given how the rest of the cookies ended up, I didn't feel terrible that we missed out.

I've heard great things about this place so I decided to check it out for myself. I arrived around eleven in the morning and I had to wait in line for about ten minutes. There's outdoor seating which seems nice, especially when the weather is favorable. Inside, communal seating is the deal. I ordered a morning bun and a double pain au chocolat. Lucky for me, a fresh batch of morning buns came out of the oven when I ordered. The morning buns are delicious, I'm usually content with milk and cereal for breakfast, but I wouldn't mind eating these buns every morning. Not overly sweet + a hint of orange = YUM. The double pain au chocolat was great as well. So flaky and if you're a fan of dark chocolate then you'll probably enjoy this treat. I spent eight bucks total which is little pricey for me considering I only ordered two pastries, but they were both delicious so I shouldn't complain.

I'd heard about tartine bakery being famous, and even saw it on a show on tv about best bakeries in the US. They were featuring the tres leches cake. One weekend, T and I decided to stop in, based on its famousness. There was a line out the building and around on the sidewalk, it was a holiday Monday late afternoon or early evening. This better be worth it, I thought, as we waited. Fortunately, it went pretty fast. We decided to get one piece of the tres leches cake, one piece of a coconut fruit cake, and one piece of their lemon caramel cake. Price was fairly good. We got them home and tried them. Eh. The best was the lemon. The lemon was still only eh. They really tasted like not much of anything. Just a sweetness. I took a couple of bites of the desserts and thought wait, this isn't even worth the space in my belly...I want more little star pizza instead (what we'd been walking to pick up when we passed tartine). Between we two big eaters, we never ate those cake slices. They ended up getting thrown away. It wasn't bad, just not good enough to bother eating. With such a rep, guess we're in the minority!! PS this is not really a place you'd want to sit down and eat in at, there are tables but they're only so-so and it's very loud and full of people lining up to order. Chaotic. Just bring your stuff home and eat it there instead.

I've had the morning bun and the bread pudding here and enjoyed every single bite. The place is usually packed with the line going out the door. If the morning bun was warmed before they served it, they'd probably be to die for. But the bun wasn't warm so it tasted just alright. The bun itself was almost the size of my hand. The orange cinnamon sugar was delicious and finger licking good! I liked all my fingers after I was done. The food here is undeniably good but for the price tag, it's more of a treat than a staple. I will be back though, to try the cakes. Word of advice to people who go to get coffee, walk directly to the coffee/espresso counter to the right and skip the crazy line on the left!

WTF!!!!!!! I don't get why people like this place. The food is HORRIBLE! I went once 3.5 years ago and didn't get it then. I went again this last weekend. With a friend we ordered some cheese bread I don't remember the name, some chocolate cake like substance and the bread pudding. The bread was about the blandest cheese bread I've ever eaten. The chocolate cake was dry and the bread pudding was really eggy and flavorless. I can only guess that it's peer pressure that keeps this place going. People vote it up to feel cool about knowing a unique place rather then whether or not the food is good.

for a line of people willing to wake up before their 8 hours of beauty sleep is up just for a treat at tartine bakery shows that they're on to something...and i'm coming along for the ride. the first time i came was on a random weekday around noon time. after reading and reading about their infamous morning bun i thought i'd give it a try myself. me: hi, i'd like a morning bun. server: sorry we're sold out. me: what?! really? (in my head) but it's not even 2p yet? what do you mean you're sold out?? i came all the way here in the rain and you're telling me you didn't save me a bun??! apparently they only make a set number of batches of these damn buns every morning and once they sell out, that's it, done deal, try again tomorrow MORNING. yes, i was discouraged, but still had hope that i would eventually get my hands on one. two weeks later i came back at 8:30a and there was already a mini line forming inside the bakery, about to burst out the door. i got to the counter and realized that i made the cut!!! i couldn't even wait till i got home to sink my teeth into my warm, just out the oven breakfast. O MANNNN, now THIS is a morning bun! the taste reminds me of a palmier-croissant hybrid. they sprinkle a generous amount of sugar all over, with a hint of citrus. the outside is crispy, while the inside is soft and chewy. i finished the last bite just outside my home...that made my day. dear morning bun...i will be thinking of you every morning until we meet again =)

Tartine is all the hype you've heard it to be and then some so I suggest go early if you have your heart set on trying something specific!

The Croque Monsieur strangely came with sundried tomatoes and with barely a lick of mustard, so I think 'ham sandwich' is a more accurate description. The lengthy-but-quick line that snaked past the crowded tables was a bit of a turnoff, and not really conducive to a relaxing breakfast. Still, bonus points for being a proper bakery and having all the pastries I miss so dearly.

I am jaded, I will admit it right here-but nothing comes close to the Morning Bun-NOTHING! (not my exceptional baking skills, nor my moms or nana's for that matter!) Tartine bakers use an incredible real orange glaze with mini-disco sugar laid in between the layers, and when taken with a freshly made latte, is pure heaven on the tongue. The chocolate eclairs are fabulous-the pastry is perfection and they use a semi-sweet dark chocolate which I prefer-my only complaint is that since I am eclair queen and have had them here and abroad, I would think the custard should be thicker. When slurping up the eclair, it shoots out because its liquidy- Just give it up on finding a seat- its not worth hovering over the lucky ones who managed to find seating. I don't mind waiting in the ten minute line, and I certainly don't mind parking my butt nearby or walking to the park with my baked treasures.

I so wanted to like this place. I see the crowds on a sunny Sunday afternoon, I've witnessed the 5:00 pm rush for the freshly baked bread. I've tasted the cookies, croissants, and their lattes. I've even gone as far as bring family and friends to this place. Each time hoping that there will be some miraculous discovery of a tasty pastry. Unfortunately i feel compelled to write about how mediocre the goods are here. The last straw were the burnt ham and cheese croissants we had. Two stars for the lattes that come in a bowl, i like that. sorry tartine, let me know what i should be ordering. i really wanted to like you! ___________________________________________ UPDATE 9/23 So I've been back here a couple times now and I feel like I finally got it. As I sat there with my creamy chai latte, munching on my fresh raspberry tart, I finally got the wonderfulness that is Tartine. The cool breeze that swishes my hair as I take bite after bite of crispy and buttery shell that holds my fresh raspberries and sweet cream, puts me at ease and the warm smell of fresh bread tickles my nose as I sip my spicy chai. My friend got a cap and a banana cream tart that was delicious as well. So delicious in fact that I practically ate half, and by half I mean like 75% chocolate shavings and all. The cap was perfectly done, the natural sweetness of the bean was enough, no sugar necessary. Tartine is just simply wonderful.

At this point I only eat here when I have out of town guests, some of whom insist on eating here several times a day when they visit. Is the long wait annoying? I have never had a problem getting a table here, the key is to master the art of aggressive staring and quickly darting into a seat when someone is still in the midst of standing up to go. Many people are too impatient to wait so there isn't even that much competition, and generally everyone is polite. There is no better way to savor the victory of getting a table than by slowly sipping many cups of coffee, having a long chat with a friend, and devouring every crumb of food. I am very glad that they have added the new smaller size bread pudding, since the large bowl tends to take on the taste of scrambled eggs as it cools off. But seriously, how could you not love the food here?

This is a truly awesome bakery. Tartine's has by far the best flaky croissants and pain au chocolat in the city. For your savory needs, they have a delicious open-faced mushroom melt, and a uniquely tasty pressed cheese and membrillo sandwich. Scharffen Berger double-chocolate cookies and heavenly dark chocolate pudding are to die for. Espresso drinks are very good, and their mocha (also made with Scharffen Berger) is fantastically rich and chocolatey. Basically there's very little they make here that isn't superlative. Also, I ask you, who doesn't love checking out hot disheveled bakery chicks expertly applying chocolate frosting to a fancy looking cake? Nobody, that's who. That's gotta be worth 5 stars just there. Sadly, one star off for the ridiculously long lines and fight for seating.

Tartine is probably the best bakery in SF based on both things I've tasted from here and by the looks of everything in the case. The bread pudding with fruit is to die for, probably the best and most affordable breakfast on their menu. Window shopping here makes me want to try everything, the sandwiches, the pain au chocolat, the tarts, croissants, everything! That being said, the wait is sometimes out of control here. I've passed it up many a time walking by just because the line was at least 20 minutes deep. I don't mind the seating so much since it gives it more of a European feel but 20+ minutes to get a croissant!? I worry I might try to chew my ear off.

I suppose after 762 reviews there's not much I can add, but I am adding anyway. Coming here was pretty much the entirety of my goals for my last trip to San Francisco. It did not disappoint. Even standing in line for 45 minutes made me happy. It was a sociable people-watching experience. Everybody was in that line because they knew great things awaited them. The bread pudding is the best thing in the world. I don't think I'm exaggerating. My only regret is that I ate too much sugar to be able to get ice cream at Bi-Rite afterwards. Oh well! Gotta save something for the next trek up north.

Crazy, crazy lines, no parking, and slightly expensive. ÊNice presentation and good pastries. ÊNot a lot of space but the staff were friendly enough. ÊAlthough I hate those tip jars at places when the staff isn't waiting on you and you're supposed to bus your own tables. ÊIt's great that they also have biodegradable utensils made from potatoes, but they sometimes break on you. ÊDelicious lemon cream tarts and slammin' bread. ÊDecent paninis that are a bit expensive and only has a carrot for a side. ÊNice to go to if you're at Dolores Park and going to Bi-rite Creamery. Just took a star off because they raised their prices even more (March 2008)! ÊStaff was also not very friendly. ÊA new skinny blonde looked new and tired, ready to go home, but don't work in service if you don't like people be-yotch! ÊMaybe she was hungry.

The atmosphere is perfect, the staff is cute and friendly, the drinks are delicious and the pastries are to die for. I am obsessed with their bread pudding, and their mocha that is made out of bitter chocolate melted into hot milk with an espresso shot in it, and topped with creme freche in case that wasn't indulgent enough for you. But all this of course attracts all the people that make a crowd, and there is often a long line and very limited seating. I often end up sharing tables with strangers, which I don't mind but others may. On sunny days, though, they have outdoor seating.

A few months ago, a friend of mine took me here because she had heard that this place was the bee's knees. I was looking forward to something sweet and refreshing after a frustrating day, and everything in the display cases looked delicious. So we selected a few things and sat down to enjoy them, but alas, there was disappointment. First of all, their hibiscus tea has spearmint in it. I love hibiscus tea, and I really despise spearmint. So it was quite a crushing disappointment to find that my refreshment was tainted with that evil herb. There is no way that it can ever be necessary to put mint in hibiscus tea, which has its own beautiful flavor that stands alone. Next, we had the coconut cream tart. I love flaky, creamy, caramel, coconut, so there was no way that this could be bad... except there was. The puff pastry shell has dark chocolate shellacked onto the inside, presumably in order to keep in all the cream and caramel. However, that chocolate was hard as a rock, and my friend and I were completely unable to cut through it with the flimsy spudware utensils that they have available. Short of taking bites or manually breaking off ridiculously messy portions, it is impossible to eat. The components were good, but Êultimately, we didn't eat more than half because it was all over the place. The last thing we had was a meringue, which was fine. I have yet to eat a spectacular meringue, and there was nothing wrong with it. But it wasn't amazing, and after the disappointment of the tart and the tea, eating the meringue felt a bit like defeat. I might return one day, but I feel that any future experience will always be shadowed by the memory of my sub par first visit.

Either I took my happy pills today, or I know a good thing when I see it. ÊMust be the latter, since I don't take pills. From the moment I walked up and saw a line of people standing outside Tartine Bakery, endulging in the wafting beauty that floated out of the restaurant, I knew this place had something special. Ê I'm a big sharer - so my buddy and I split the ham and cheese croissant and each had a croque monsieur. ÊBeing French Canadian, I can't claim that I grew up in the streets of Paris. ÊBut bear with me, I know a good croissant. ÊThis place is outstanding! ÊThe fresh pastries and awesome coffee were a beautiful reprieve from an often hackneyed eggy breakfast. ÊTrue, seating sucks...but I think it adds to the feeling that you walked into your French aunt's kitchen to break bread with the fam. Ê A perfect start to a sunny San Francisco day. ÊWho needs happy pills when you've got Tartine?

Now something I can recommend whole heartedly: Tartine Bakery I just drool a little when I walk into the place. I went overboard when we first went here; we ended up in a sugar coma. I might as well have died and gone to heaven; but no, I was still in the Bakery with my friend slapping me silly. With a puffy red face I tell you: "You can never go wrong when you go here."

I kept hearing about Tartine and even tried to go there one weekend afternoon but the line drove me away. I thought, can it really be that good?! I'm sure it's just hyped up. So my foodie gilfriend came into town and on her list of places to go...Tartine. This time I had a plan. Go early. They opened at 8 a.m. on Saturday and I figure 9:30 should be fine, not too busy. I was wrong. There was a line and we lucked out getting a seat. Was it all hype? No! I love this place and it has made my, before I die I want to eat something from here list. We had the bread pudding - oh my gawd that's good! Chocolate croissant - it was actually still warm and oh so flaky it all melted in my mouth. We couldn't help ourselves and got the coconut tart, chocolate banana tart, and croque monsiuer to go. It was so good we didn't want it to end. The coconut tart was my favorite and when I die I'm taking it with me, to the grave. It was crazy crowded the whole time we were there except there was a lag from 10-10:15a.m. Other than that line, line line. I can't wait to go back.

Excellent bakery! We had quiche and croque monsier, followed by lemon tart. Just amazingly delicious. The only down part is that it is very crowded and impossible to find a parking spot. But it pays off all the pain once you take a bite. Take Bart to go there and just walk around. Mission is an interesting place to be!

This place ALWAYS has a line, no matter what time of the day it is. And I can see why... I ordered their famous bread pudding and was surely not disappointed. It was yummy - and I don't even like bread pudding!! It is on the sweeter side, so don't eat this early in the morning unless you like sweets for your first meal (I sure don't). You get a pretty huge portion for just $3. I also got the chocolate croissant. Also very good, maybe not as fresh as I was expecting. But then again, I went to Tartine at noon, so the pastries may have gotten a little stale over time. Pastries are expensive there. My croissant was almost $4. Service is fast and friendly. The waitors/waitresses all seem so happy to be there. It's kinda shocking for me, actually. Word of advice for first-timers: To expedite the orders, some waitors will ask you what you want to order before you get to the counter. So, I chose what I knew Tartine was famous for (bread pudding) and a croissant. Every bakery has to have croissants, right? But then as I approached the pastry case, I saw so many other AMAZING looking pastries!! Ahh! I regretted ordering the croissant! I could have that any day, but I've never seen some of these other pastries and they all looked SO good. Thus, if it's your first time at Tartine, be sure to check out the pastry case BEFORE giving your order. You don't want to miss out on something good!

The only problem with this place is how popular it is and the long lines to get your hands on the wonderful pastries. The morning rolls (sort of like cinnamon rolls) were so flavorful. Oh, and the muesli was very good too, excellent thing to be offered if you want something a bit more nutritious early in the day. Good coffee as well. I'm going back!

I know it's a tourist season already, but that doesn't mean that Tartine can hike up the price of pastries of less quality. What happened to the moist scone with crunchy sugar? it's all dried up and not sweet at all. What about my all time favorite morning bun? Why are they all dried up and taste like a cheap fried cinnanon donut? How about almond croissant? I can taste raw egg, not custard, in the filling. Don't scare me, Tartine. I can't live without your pastries, so clean up the bad act!

I'm in love...again! Over the weekend my friend and went to Tartine to pick up a souffle cake for a friends birthday. It was my first time there so while waiting in line I got to check out what everyone else was eating. Besides the cake we ended up leaving with a banana tart that I'm still thinking of even now, a lemon bar and two super sized cookies. The lemon bar was nothing special and the cookies were yummy but had a slight burnt taste. The souffle cake had to feed twelve of us so we decided on the larger size thinking that the small was too itty bitty. Boy were we wrong. We ended up eating less than half of the super rich yet yummy cake. I can't wait to go back again and try the brioche bread pudding with fresh fruit and get my hands on another banana tart.

My favorite thing to do for breakfast -- wake up early when all of the Mission and Castro are still hung over, walk right into Tartine because the line doesn't start until later, get a croque monsieur for breakfast and whichever delicious pastry screams loudest at me from behind the counter as a treat for later. I'm tellin' ya, don't let all the whining about the wait and cost keep you from having the delicious food and pastries. ÊTime your arrival to miss the line and don't think about the price until after you've taken your first bite.

Ohhh my! ÊThis place is FABULOSO! ÊI have only been there once, but I crave it every time I get close to San Francisco. ÊWhen I went I had the YOGURT AND GRANOLA, which was very good (lame, I know...I was feeling healthy). ÊLuckily, I had a bite of my husbands treats, he got the BREAD PUDDING, which is TO DIE FOR, and the ham and cheese croissants...which was crispy, buttery, and delicious.

Been taken there by my friend K. Gray ;) She knows I love me some sugar and sweets. Nice choices, at first you look at the display and its just overwhelming (I start to have an anxiety in all bakeries anyway). FInally I had some kind of custard Êand croissant + coffe - fresh and tasty, that kind of meal that would make your day or at least next few hours. The only thing to warn you all about is that sometimes there is not much space, so you might end up sitting next to the geek with a laptop or an old lady with her grandkids running around.

I was so disappointed by S Factor, I decided I needed to indulge. I consumed Êabout 5k calories here, and every calorie was delicious. Sadly, the line was too long, so I probably won't come here again. I got: the ham AND turkey croque monsieur -- I enjoyed the turkey over the ham. The ham was too salty for my palette fruit tart -- delicious! I would get this again -- my favorite! banana cream tart -- the bananas are fresh, the whip cream is light and not too sweet. The outside shell is crisp but not too hard. I'm not really into chocolate, so I didn't enjoy the chocolate shavings so much. bread pudding -- delicious warm or cold! chocolate chip cookie -- above average for a chocolate chip cookie, but I wouldn't get this again chocolate croissant -- crispy and flaky. high-quality chocolate that's not too sweet My pants were tight the next day, but it was worth it. :)

I gave Tartine three stars based upon the cramped conditions and almost frenzied environment that is Tartine. Ê If you ride BART specifically to get here I would suggest you get off in the Castro (bus or train) and walk over from there. ÊThe neighborhood from the MIssion train stop is sketchy especially if you go the wrong direction. OK-back to Tartine. ÊWe were stoked to eat here and on vacation. ÊWe arrived rather naively near lunch time and encountered a crush of people so dense that normally I would just walk out if I were home and not vacationing. Ê Because the crowds were so great we were literally given the ultimatum of eating croque monsieur (or nothing) because they refused to serve anything else. ÊThis really perturbed me but we had already waited in line and what else are we going to find in this hood? So, two croque monsieurs later combined with a free strangely tasty pickled carrot and 2 baked goods from the case and we had our lunch for about $26.00. Strategy for visiting here: ÊIf you are 2 people together then one should stake out 2 seats (you have to share tables) and the other should place the order and pay. ÊIf you don't you are VERY screwed and eating while standing up. Ê TIP: ÊGet your grub to go and walk over to Mission Dolores and have a nice quick lunch on the steps before entering this glorious historical mission. ÊYou are only a short walk from Mission Dolores so make your trip worthwhile. Ê The food here is very very good. ÊThe baked items are super. ÊIf you are a Type A east coaster like I tend to be then you may want to pop a Valium to prevent a massive melt down while navigating this too popular location. Anything as successful as Tartine would normally prompt the owner to expand or perhaps streamline their business model. ÊI wish I owned this little gold mine because I think I would eventually have a Tartine on every SFO corner.

This is one of my all time favorite places in SF. Seriously delicious, seriously well made food. ÊIf you can miraculously find parking and brave the ridiculous line, Tartine will not disappoint. ÊIt is every bit as good as it's hyped up to be. ÊYou may have to have a knife fight to get a table at this place, but trust me, it's worth it. I had a quiche for lunch and my friend had a panini. ÊBoth delicious, but the stand outs of course were the pastries. ÊWe selected a few but the one that is totally seared in my mind is the luscious lemon creme tart. ÊIt is literally the best I've ever tasted - including the second runner up at Chez Panisse. ÊThe standard baked goods such as the croissants are so perfectly executed. ÊButtery and flakey.. oh. Food orgasm. Side note: ever come across that beautiful coffee table recipe book at Costco or something? ÊIt's worth the investment because your attempts will come out pretty darn close. ÊThe ingredients are no different than what many standard baking recipes call for, so I guess it's all in their technique.

Can you believe that I've lived in the SF area for 11 years, yet I only discovered Tartine less than 6 months ago? Blasphemous. What else can I say about a business with over a thousand positive reviews? Their lemon squares strike the perfect balance of tart filling and buttery shortbread crust. The chocolate croissants (made with Valhrona chocolate, no less) are the closest I've had to the amazing pan au chocolat I was lucky enough to experience in France. And that bread pudding...oh that bread pudding. I could sing songs about that bread pudding, it's that good. I've been known to order a bowl-sized portion to go, eat half of it, and chuck the rest in the fridge to eat cold the next day. Yes, it is even amazing cold. If you take me to Tartine drunk, I may very well burst out into song. Just warning you. PS Take your goodies to go and have a picnic at Dolores Park.

One liner: ÊI fell in love with this place about a month before it opened and the sex is still great. This place is my favorite authentic-feeling French Bakery in San Francisco. ÊWhen they first opened, they had all these supermodel thin looking girls there and everyone was dressed in Mission chic vintage. ÊAbout a month later, plumpness set in and they had to rehire "normal" staff to lower the turnover of hysterical modelettes. Now this place just feels comfortable. ÊThey are making mint too with the line out the door on the weekends. The best: Ê * Bread like an armored rugby ball that tastes the best * Croissants that explode in a symphony of flakes when you break them * Amazing chocolate mocha (super tiny too!) * Croque monseiur and madame * Morning buns done extra right * Bread pudding in huge helpings (the best value per calorie) Pro Tip: ÊCall and order bread ahead of time and skip the lines.

I'd heard of Tartine and stumbled upon it during a Friday stroll in my neighborhood. I got there just before 5pm, and there was a line almost to the door. Not sure how long it took, maybe 10 or so mins? I didn't mind because I needed time to check out the goods and wasn't in a rush. Not being a huge fan of pastries and sweets, I ended up getting a chocolate-walnut thing (not sure if I'd call it a cookie) and the goat cheese sandwich on walnut bread. The chocolate-walnut cluster thing was pretty gooey and yummy. It was pretty rich so I had to eat it in small bites throughout the afternoon. The goat cheese sandwich was yummy, but was TOO much. I got three HUGE chunks of sandwich (thats six slices of 1" thick walnut bread). It was basically bread and goat cheese, and too hard to eat without pulling apart the sandwich halves. Since I wanted a real sandwich I ended up going to DPC up the street and buying ANOTHER sandwich, which was more than bread and cheese. However, I saved my goat cheese sandwich and ate it in small chunks for three days. It makes a yummy snack...not so sure about it as a sandwich. I'd go back to try other things only if I was in the area and the mood.

Sat outside here with my friend and a dog and enjoyed an awesome sandwich in the sun! Had the pastrami panini, and was pleasantly surprised to see it was actually more like a sandwich and a half! It had three pieces to it instead of two. I liked how the mustard was already cooked inside the panini, and the pastrami was super tasty!! For dessert I had the coconut cream pie, which was out of this world! It had a layer of chocolate between the creme and the pasty which was to die for. Would go back in a second -- also they have the mexican cokes there, an added bonus :)

Several people told me that they had the best almond croissant they had ever tasted, so naturally I had to verify this for myself. ÊI was expecting a line, but luckily when I went at 9AM on a Monday there wasn't much of a line. My sister ordered the almond croissant - flaky and buttery without being too sweet. ÊIt was perfectly flaky and straight out of the oven. ÊMy sister said she couldn't decide whose almond croissant was better - Tartine or Boulange in Cole Valley (she said Boulange's was sweeter, more dessert-like). I was underwhelmed by the vegetarian quiche I ordered - I could only taste the creme fraiche and eggs. ÊThe eggs were very fluffy but the crust just was alright.

The best bread pudding I have ever tried. The thin slices of peaches just give it that extra added touch of yum. I'm not sure how they get the brioche/challah bread to stay so moist, but whatever they do, it turns out perfect. The price? Just about 6$ for a bowl big enough for three people to share. Everything in the bakery looked so good that I can't wait to go back and try something new.

Came here on a Sunday afternoon, waited in line, and ordered the Jambon Royale & Gruyere (ham & dijon mustard) + a hazelnut tart + iced coffee. The sandwich took forever (ok they were busy), but it came out all fresh, toasty, and crisp. And it was hugeeee! There were 3 portions and I saw other couples sharing, and then even taking a piece home. The ham was salty, the bread was chewy and sweet, and the cheese and honey mustard added additional flavors. The pickled carrot they give you looks like decoration, but it's actually really good! The hazelnut tart is okayyyyy (could be more chocolatey). It looks better than it tastes, but since it looks so good it's still pretty delish. I kinda liked the communal seating arrangement and bussing your own tables! The whole place was really cool + hip.

A quick stop into Tartine is a right of passage. And one that took me 2 years to check off the list. ÊBut the magic finally happened this afternoon with two friends. ÊOver gigantic lattes and sparkling pink lemonades, we savored croissants, sandwiches, and delectable desserts. Things got interested when a (hopefully drunk) couple in the middle of the place started acting like porn stars, making out as if it were going out of style. ÊBut, hey... it's San Francisco! ÊWe're a liberal kind of town, right? Tartine is tiny, so good luck finding somewhere to sit. ÊThe line was never any shorter than out the door during the entire 90 minute period we stayed. ÊBut then again, the appearance of demand is probably what keeps this place is business, right?! I had the prosciutto-provolone panini with arugula. ÊAmazing. ÊI got not two but three slices of sandwich. ÊEach slice was practically one entire sandwich. ÊI was stuffed after two of them and I brought the third one home. ÊIt reheated particularly well. I don't know that Tartine will be my "go to" place going forward during my spontaneous cross-town trips from the Marina to the Mission, but they have a wonderful sandwich list, some world-class baked goods, and a cult-like base of patrons that will make you feel like you've just got to wait in line for 20+ minutes to grab hold of that buttery, flaky croissant. Ê(Hey, it's all worth it in the end, friends! ÊEyes on the prize!)

3 words for this place - Banana Creme Pie!!! ÊThat pretty much says it all! We have gone in on a Saturday afternoon, be prepared to wait in a long line so don't go if you're in a hurry. The place is super small, so don't expect to eat there either. We ordered a bunch of stuff to share among 4 people - lemon bar, lemon meringue, some wedding cookies, a chocolate chip & oatmeal cookie and the banana creme pie. The favorite among all of us were the banana creme! ÊI found the lemon bar and meringue were way too tart, it does have a really good lemon taste, but those were never my favorites to begin with. If I were in the area next time, I'll go early in the morning to avoid the rush.

Dining at Tartine can be a frustrating experience. You'll almost certainly be standing in a line snaking through a very crowded restaurant. When you finally order you'll be given a numbered flag with which to stake out space at the packed tables. Real estate is at as much of a premium here as anywhere else in the city. Prepare to feel like a buzzard, waiting for the last gasp of other diners' croissants. Plus, when we finally got seats, we were packed in tight and subjected to gusty door openings and closings. But oh man is it worth it. By a huge margin, these are the best pastries I've ever had. It's absurdly good. I bought a whole bunch to take back to Chicago. If I came here again though, I'd just get a box of pastries to go.

I LOVE LOVE LOVE TARTINE! ÊI seriously think about it at least once a day. ÊI would marry the banana cream pie if I could, the cream is pure lusciousness - they whip it to perfection. ÊI have freaking high standards for whipped cream and I give them a 10 freaking +. Ê10. 10. 10. 10!!! Ê You really can't go wrong with anything here. ÊI even wanted a wedding cake from here, but they don't deliver and the cake i wanted (passion fruit bavarian) won't stand up to heat so well and I'm having an outdoor wedding in August. Ê=( Well, why the 4 stars? ÊWell, it's the damn hipster staff - too cool for the patrons. Ê Maybe too busy being hip? ÊThey are just not helpful, stand around, look at with you this bored stare etc etc. ÊYou name it, they do it.

I love everything from their freshly baked pastries to their open faced sandwiches and coffee! My go to items are the fruit tarts, coconut creme and banana cream tarts! And if you want something rich and comforting their chocolate pudding is perfect! These items can be shared but once you have a bite of any of these you would want it all to yourself! Well, the portions are big so better to save some for later! The morning buns and almond croissants are quite delicious even on the next day. I've also tried their pressed sandwiches and they're also very tasty. Great place to chat up with strangers sharing your table or sit outside with the sun out. I could have given this place 5 stars but it's very easy to cough up your whole wallet as the items don't come cheap.

Finally made it to the famous Tartine bakery. ÊSince we're not from SF and the line is so long, we decided to get quite a few items (even though the items are quite pricey for my budget). Ê Bread pudding cup ($3.50) - delicious!!! soo soo moist, great flavor, and not too sweet. Morning bun ($3.75) - I don't get they hype on these. ÊJust alright to me. Coconut cream tart ($6.50) - delicious!!! Êand looks delicious too. Êthe crust is super flakey and not too thick. Êthe filing is rich and not too sweet. Êand the tart is topped of with roasted coconut shavings. Ê so delicious. Êhave to try the other tarts next time. Ê Chocolate chip cookie (?) - delicious!!! Êvery thin, crisp, buttery, melty chocolate. Even though the lines were long, and the customer service rushed/lacking, we'd still go back cause the food is delicious.

With over 2,000 reviews, one piddly little person (me) could not say it any better than the previous reviewers. ÊBut I'll try. Ê I live in LA but my heart is in San Francisco. ÊEven then, I make sure I visit Tartine every time I come to town. Ê I love the hustle and bustle, the visible bakery gnomes working in the back, the pastries perfected. ÊI have never had anything sub par. ÊThe lemon bars are super tart, rich, and delicious. ÊThe banana cream tart warrants a trip to SF all on it's own. ÊThe gougere annoys me because I never know how to pronounce it, but I brave the embarrassment and order it every time. Ê Sure, the servers take themselves a little bit too seriously and I never really feel cool enough to walk in there, but c'est la vie! ÊI will gladly sneak in and sneak out if it means a meal and treats from Tartine.

Bread pudding is too sweet for my taste. Waiting is usually long. My survival mode was turned on and when the server asked me what to order: "the largest bowl of bread pudding that you have, please" and then, I spent my time trying to finish the nice-but-too-sweet bread pudding and try to swallow it down with a glass of water. A small order of the famous bread pudding is nice but not too much. And yes, definitely will be back to try the morning bun....

I have no idea why, but I was sort of disappointed. ÊI've been wanting to try this place for the longest time and I finally came here on a weekday around 2:00. ÊThere was no line and I was able to find parking on the same street. At first I thought sweet! Found parking right away and no line! My lucky day! Since I couldn't decide what to get, I got several items to try and to share with the family. ÊI ordered the small bread pudding, banana cream tart, chocolate hazelnut tart and frangiose tart. Ê I did not like the bread pudding at all. ÊI'm not sure why, but it wasn't very flavorful. ÊThe bread pudding was with apples. ÊBanana Cream pie was good and not very sweet. Chocolate hazelnut tart did not have enough hazelnut flavor asides from it being on the top. ÊI think it would be best if hazelnut flavor was mixed in with the chocolate in the tart. ÊOf the four pastries, I liked the frangiose tart the most. ÊThere were lot of almond and was flavorful. Ê I'm not sure why, but I guess I just had a high expectation for this place. ÊThey didn't have the morning bun that I wanted to try. ÊMaybe next time I'll go try that and their cakes. ÊI still want to give this place another try.

I'm getting stingy with my 5 stars, but this one deserves it. Love it!!! Great bread. Very subtle nutty flavor. The pastries that I've tried are all outstanding. The lemon tart and the banana cream tart are both tops. Nothing here is in your face. The flavors and textures are subtle and never overly sugary. I also like their coconut macaroons, but I don't recommend buying the pre-packaged version. You need the freshness, so buy the macaroons there and eat it there. Can't wait until we go back again and try more items.

This place is absolutely FANTABULOUSLY AWESOME. ÊFANTABULSOME? It was the four of us and if we hadn't gotten there pre-1130am we would have done further damage to our bellies and wallets. ÊWe got the croque monsieur, the brioche bread pudding with fruit, the gougere, the morning bun, a croissant, and of course some coffee. The croque monsieur was the best i've ever had, oui oui, and the brioche bread pudding was fabulously carb-loaded and yummy. ÊThe gougere might have been the fave with a choux pastry like thing filled with bechamel sauce or cheese something delicious like that.

I was never a fan of Mr. Pizza Man, but my friend insisted that the owner's bakery was much higher quality than his pizza shops, so I gave it a go. First off, this place is not for the claustrophobic, but the ambiance makes up for that. All the staff are dressed up like extreme caricatures of Mission Hipsters. It's actually pretty cute, they go all out, from the greasy $300 haircuts to the handlebar mustaches and even Ben Franklin spectacles. I didn't even know that was a thing. I got an eclair, after my namesake. It was tasty, but seemed a little overfilled with that goo. I could have just suckled the nozzle of their pastry bags for the same effect. But tasty, nonetheless. They only lose a star for making you carry your precarious coffee teacup through this jumbling crowd of people. I can't imagine no one has been scalded/sued here before. Seems like there must be a better way...

This bakery is incredible! ÊA must-do if you are in the SF area. ÊEasy location near Dolores Park. ÊBeware the line can be long and curl around the side of the building. ÊIt is well worth the wait though. ÊThe smell of fresh baked bread and pastries rushes out of the doors, which helps make the line go faster knowing you have so much to look forward to. ÊIt sure tastes as good as it smells! ÊGo early, as they only bake a certain amount for the day. ÊAfter 5 pm fresh bread loaves are fresh out of the oven. We had the famous morning bun, which is kind of like a mild, not as sweet cinnamon roll and croissant all in one. ÊIt has a light cinnamon coating inside and as you take bites you will get hints of orange - it is AMAZING!!! It isn't too sweet either. ÊCrispy on the outside and soft on the inside with granulated sugar on top. ÊMmm. ÊWe also got an almond croissant, which was awesome. ÊIt was hard on the outside and soft inside as well, but was like no other croissant we have ever tasted. ÊMost croissants are very buttery - this one was not. ÊIt had a layer of almond paste inside and the top was decorated with toasted almonds and powdered sugar. ÊThis was the absolute best croissant ever!!! We went back the next day for more - this time we went at the latter part of the day and they ran out of almond and chocolate croissants and morning buns. ÊWe ended up getting an amazing roll with gruyere cheese, thyme and salt and pepper inside. It was really good. Need to go back for that croissant though.

ÊBeen here much? uh...chea! This review is for the... ***AMAZING DELICIOUS LEMON CREAM TART*** Those that know me know how much I LOVE lemon desserts. I've never tried the lemon tart. I would always get their lemon BAR. Hella-Hella yummy btw. But HOLY HOLINESS! This tart is gooooooood. It's like the fancy mother in her nice heals compared to the young lemon bar.

I get a little sad every time I think of Tartine Bakery being thousands of miles away. Every chance I get to go visit family in San Francisco, I stop by this bakery. The line is pretty much always out the door but it moves fairly quickly. I think in total we waited 20 minutes. Between my fiance and I, we grabbed an almond croissant, chocolate croissant, lemon curd tart, and bread pudding along with an espresso and coffee. The little sugar cubes that they provide for the coffee is darling. Back to the food, the almond croissant we got was 'to go' but I guess it doesn't travel well. Throughout the day it became hard and a little dry. Sad because we brought it back for family. The chocolate croissant was not as flaky as I would of liked. It was still good but I probably won't order it again. The lemon curd tart was to die for. I wish I can get one here on the east coast. The little flower garnish on top is cute. The curd is rich, creamy, perfectly sour and well balanced in sweetness. Lastly the bread pudding was really good too. I wasn't a fan of bread pudding due to its consistency but Tartine swayed me. The bread, I think it's brioche?, is a good choice.

Porto's Bakery in LA, thus far, has been my favorite bakery but I think we have a new contender here in SF. This place is overly cramped and even in the middle of the afternoon, it's difficult to find a place to sit here. I had the bread pudding, the coconut cream tart, and some random sandwich with asparagus and mushrooms that was already cooked because the three cheese sandwich that I wanted was going to take 20 minutes. I really wanted to try to the banana cream tart, but the coconut cream tart was still heaven in my mouth. THE best tart I have seriously had. Next time I need to try their sandwiches and more of their pastries, but so far this place is just amazing.

Wow, almost 2800 reviews!? ÊI'd heard about this place from a number of different friends, and apparently it's just as popular on Yelp. Ê Unfortunately, I have to say I thought this place was overrated - it's 2.5 stars from me at the most. ÊWe came here after dinner today to get some pastries to go, after I convinced my boyfriend to wait 35 minutes in line, which he was NOT happy about. Ê They didn't have enough chocolate stuff (in my chocoholic opinion). Ê I decided to get a chocolate friand ($2), which had a cakey bottom and a ganache-y top, sort of like a cupcake, but was shaped more like a macaron, and a slice of some decadent devil's cake ($5.50). Ê I didn't think the prices were too crazy, but then I picked things that seemed fairer to me (somehow paying $6 for a slice of chocolate cake doesn't bother me nearly as much as paying $4 for a croissant - this is admittedly totally subjective). Ê The wait, on the other hand, is completely ridiculous. The friand was yummy but nothing amazing. ÊThe bottom was very dried out and it would have been much better if the bottom had been moister, although it was the end of the day so I have to cut them some slack. ÊThe chocolate cake was...chocolate cake. Ê It was nothing to write home about, and although it said it was made with Valhrona chocolate (a fancy, rich chocolate that I normally love) I didn't taste anything extraordinary. Ê I've had better chocolate cake from Safeway and I didn't have to wait in line for 35 minutes to buy it. Ê They did have some quiches that looked really good and were reasonably priced ($4 or so a slice). ÊThey also had some delectable looking bread puddings, if you're into that sort of thing (I'm not). ÊThe croissants did not look great to me - kind of burned and dried out, but then it was the end of the day and I'm all about croissants that are practically dripping with butter. Ê If I hadn't waited so long in line this place would be a definite 3 star - nothing was bad, just nothing was outstanding. ÊBut the wait makes it a miss for me.

Whoa, the line at Tartine on a holiday Monday was ridic. Out the door almost. Almost all of the desserts/pastries were taken. I grabbed what was left; a lemon tart and chocolate chip cookie. The cookie was enormous and the lemon tart was very good. I also had one of their specialty teas which was also a great addition to the desserts. Total for 2 and the tea came out to $11. Next time I'll come early and try and snag a piece of tres leche cake. It looked so good. Boo!

Delicious, quality pastries/breads/desserts. Well thought out and well-made. 1.) Service: typically has a long line unless you go at random times during the workday, but the line goes by fast. The workers are pretty straight to the point and not overly nice but not rude or anything, they're just cheeeeeel! Parking I'm sure is a little bitch, but it's so close to the J, Mission street, Birite, Dolores Park so it's super central and the walk shouldn't be an issue. 2.) Prices: quite pricey for pastries, but it's quality. They use fresh ingredients and what not! Yet I wish things like the morning bun were like...warm. 3.) Banana Creme Tart: Delicious! Looked at the yelps and saw that this seemed to be a winner winner chicken dinner and plus I love these little bad boys. The crust was VERY hard to cut through but was VERY delicious - wasn't too sweet or overly buttery, it was just right. It had a very nice taste. The bottom layer was lined with dark chocolate and caramel...SUPER RICH! The banana cream itself was very good but I felt like I tasted more whipped cream than the banana cream/bananas but then again it could just mean the banana cream is more subtle, which is good. But this was a delicious one! Super rich...split it with my friend and we were super full after. 4.) Morning bun: Multi-layers little cinnamon-croissant bun thing! The inside is soft, and the outer layers are nice and crispy and flakey! You get the best of all different worlds - it's soft and bready, but the top is flakey and buttery. I liked it. But it didn't fit my taste at the time but it was still delicious. 5.) Short bread cookie: AWESOME! Perhaps one of the best short bread cookies I've ever had! Great texture. Its the kind where you bite into it and it just crumbles into your mouth. Next time I really want to try the sammies and the coconut creme/lemon cream tarts!

What makes this place special and what I miss about it, is the attention to detail. ÊIt is like they see every croissant, bun and tart as their own masterpiece. ÊEvery little slice of coconut or shaving of chocolate feels like it was brushed on by a meticulous painter. ÊYou really do feel like you have stepped into one of those paintings that used to hang at your nana's house and that you stared up at as a kid. My favorites: the exquisite devil's food cake (served warm), the clairs, and coconut cream tart--I am having a Pavlovian response just thinking about them. Oh and it is not just about taste. ÊThe smells are what draw you in. ÊEspecially early on a cold morning when the whole world feels like it is just beginning to wake up. ÊIt just draws you in. It's also a great place on Sunday morning--if you get there early enough--to sit down at the sidewalk tables, read the morning paper, have some coffee and enjoy life.

WOW, this place is goooooooodddd! I listened to my fellow yelpers and ordered the morning bun and the double pain au chocolat. The morning bun...speechless it was the best pastry I have ever had hands down and it wasn't even right out of the oven. It was very soft on the inside and had a crunch on the outside. I am dreaming of having another one now. The double pain au chocolat was also very good and the chocolate in the croissant is actually dark chocolate. I ate it up quickly, but would probably order 2 morning buns next time. This bakery is pretty pricey, but worth every penny since it is not something you can get at any bakery, guaranteed!

My friend was really concerned that they would be out of morning buns, but they had a ton. We ordered two of the morning buns, the ham and cheese croissant, the bread pudding, and the banana creme tart. First I have to say that I was not really too impressed by the morning bun or the bread pudding. I'm not quite sure why, but even though they were relatively good, I don't think it was worth waiting in line for. My boyfriend tried the ham and cheese croissant and really liked it. We put the tart in the refrigerator and had it the next day. And OMG, that tart was amazing! Chunks of banana in creme, with chocolate shavings on top, and chocolate just on top of the crispy wonderful crust. That item alone was worth the long wait.

Outstanding, beautiful, authentic french "tout beurre" style pastries. Where can you find croissants this good in the US? Try the creamy quiche and croque monsieur sandwiches on Tartine's house baked bread, as well. They are luxuriously delicious. Desserts like merengue rochers with almonds or cacao nibs, chocolate torte with gold leaf, or passionfruit-filled cake will break your heart. Get a latte to drink there, and you'll be holding a beautiful bowl of coffee that's actually worthy of the pastries here. Sit and savor it at the large table near the door and meet someone new. Well worth standing in line for. Take your time to savor your treats at the outdoor tables and watch the 18th St. gourmet ghetto crowd go by.

I loooove Tartine so much, but never ever go because it's so crowded, the fight for a table leaves me with too much anxiety. Once you actually get a table people are hovering and vibing you to leave. ÊIt makes for a pretty uncomfortable experience. Please please please open a new arena size location so I can have my Scharffen Berger pudding and eat it too!

The ham-n-cheese croissants (or whatever they're called in French) are flippin' amazing. ÊI mean "holy crap this is so good when it's hot and it's still just as good the next day, can I get one right now" good. Ê Yum. The line is long, there's no parking, people fight for tables.

This place is flippin' amazing. So amazing that I actually read Kate K's entire review wondering why she didn't give it 5 stars and I gotta ask... Did ya try the uhhhh... food? I really do not enjoy waiting in lines - in fact I hate it. Fighting for a place to sit in a dinky restaurant with zillions of other people watching the tables with hawk-like countenance... Not for me! Once my teeth sink into that first bite of a Tartine quiche it all washes away... The coffee is - I think - the best I have had in the city yet. Every single item I have purchased from this place has made me blurt out some form of expletive upon the first bite. When I am sitting there with my fresh baked snacky-treat of wonder and some piping hot coffee, I am in another world far from anything fake or mass produced. Worth the wait or any possible stress this restaurant could possibly exhibit. Top notch and a must see if you have never been. Stop in even if only to gaze with wide-eyed wonder at the treats that lie safely behind the glass case.

Okay, so I had been waiting in line so many times to walk away disappointed - never making it inside, as I would not even consider waiting in line for pastries... yes, staring into the window, watching others laugh and giggle as they devoured their tarts, cookies and other delectables... but, this time, I did. And when I entered the doorway (after a 20 minute wait outside), I could smell the sweet and savoriness of fresh bakes goods. ÊWe had the blah svoudngoidig or something like that. ÊI had the vegetable one (shitakke mushrooms) and dried tomatoes... mmmm, mushrooms. I would wait again.

Great coffee. My espresso machine is getting its valves spruced up at the moment, and I'm more than happy to walk the extra few blocks out of my way to get my caffeine fix here. I've never eaten here, but I've sat and sipped espresso while companions have, and they seemed happy, and everything looks and smells fresh and appetising. The queue is scary on weekends, but this seems de rigeur for anywhere in this town that can operate an espresso machine. Weird that there aren't more of them...

I've been to Tartine 5-6 times now and have never left disappointed. ÊOn the other hand, I have arrived disappointed by the ubiquitous line that seems to flow out the door, but that's more my timing than the fault of Tartine's. ÊIf you consider going to Tartine, try arriving before 11am, that way you can avoid the line. At Tartine, you can get a great meal for two people for less than what you would spend at most diners in the city, and mind you, the majority of those diners couldn't match the quality. Ê A Croque Monsieur (Ham), a jambon croissant, a chocolate croissant and a cup of coffee will run you around $20 and you and your mate will leave decently satisfied. Places like Tartine always amaze me. ÊTheir quality allows them to charge 20-30% more on most of their items without affecting their receipts at the end of the day, yet they choose to remain at a great pricepoint. ÊIt's great to have options if I wanted to only spend $4 on a nice breakfast. Ê$3.25 for a Sausage Egg McMuffin or a Jambon Croissant with gruyere for $2.95? Personally it's difficult to beat the combination of delicious, consistent and reasonably-priced food and Tartine Bakery is a great example of that.

I have to laugh at the previous review who said this neighborhood seedy. Seedy? No way. I mean, I guess compared to Pac Heights it may seem seedy but it's totally not seedy. It's safe, cute and not 100% gentrified yet (thank god). I really like Tartine. Last time I was there I had this French bread pizza delight. It Êwas French bread layered with sun dried tomatoes, ham and some kind of cheese. It was orgasmic. It was one of the most ununusal, most delicious baked goods I've ever had. Loved their flaky, buttery croissants too. The wait is a bitch, but I knew about that before going. It's tiny, cramped and crowded all the time. For me though, it's worth the wait. There are so few places that make baked goods consistently well. Tartine is one of those places.

[5-What's Not To Love?] Oh, yeah... the lines and the total lack of parking if you're coming from anywhere other than a hipster-pod. However these issues are not Tartine's fault. Merely the price one has to pay for a delictable double pain au chocolate, a wicked selection of pastries, and Scharfen Berger hot chocolate that is better than what is served at Scharfen Berger's own Cafe Cacao. I love Tartine unconditionaly... going so far as to have my last birthday dinner there. And while my companion and I did indulge in a cross section of sweets, it was the pressed sandwiches that made the meal. And those spicy little pickled carrots that come with croques and sandwiches! Ah! You can't always find a seat, but who needs one when Dolores Park is just a block away? Tip: get there at 7:30 when they first open for the most awesome breakfast breads you will ever encounter,

The first time i came here i got 3 orange morning buns and a slice of pumpkin bread. All of it was gone within the hour. The second time I bought 2 more orange buns, but was generous and gave one to my roommate. And was therefore able to eat dinner when the time came.

Something about this place annoys me. I don't know what it is. Maybe the crowds? Or the lack of space? Or the poor layout (makes it really hard to decide what you want when you can't see anything until about two seconds before they ask you "what can I get you" and you feel pressured to order because the line is so long, but you have no idea what you really want, so you sort of just pick. Or you get annoyed by the people in front of you who won't just pick and take forever to choose, and the line keeps growing behind you. But I digress). Anyway, everything I've ever eaten here is REALLY amazing, so that's the good thing. For me, definitely worth a visit every once in a while, but I'd probably end up snapping if I went there regularly.

Not true in all cases, but often when there's a line out the door, there's good reason. With Tartine, the wait is thankfully worth it. They get five stars not just for their execution of the classics, but for imaginative offerings as well. Standouts on my recent visit were the frangipane tart, the ham and tomato toasts, and the cake aux olives. Generally I need to be pulled from the counter in a situation like this, because really, there's nothing to stop me from ordering, other than the prices. Where Tartine is concerned, I've forgotten the bill by the first bite. Don't go if you're in a rush. And bring someone to talk to or something to read.

OH MY HAM AND CHEESE ORGASM . Yes... YES.... YEEEESSSS!!! And my friend is one of the bakers there- can't beat that! I only gave Tartine 4 stars, because I once was allowed to pre-order 6 ham and cheese orgasms, waited 40 minutes for them to come out of the oven....burned. BURNED, and they wouldn't let me have them! I had to drive all the way back home with plain croissants (not toasty warm out of the oven) and two ginormous cookies - which hardly seemed worth the hour and a bit I waited there for the good stuff. My disappointment was so great, that I've not been back since. So, only 4 stars, my love, Tartine.

Ahh, the fabled Tartine, we meet at last. The line was just out the door on a gorgeous Sunday afternoon. Sure, it's not the swiftest moving line, but I appreciated the wait because it gave me a chance to figure out what I wanted to eat. We also saw a guy walking down the street with an enormous red velvet/gold encrusted crown on his head. What? Like you've never seen that before? My friends and I settled on the Idiazabal & Membrillo pressed sandwich, which is lightly smoked sheep's milk cheese with quince jam melted between two crispy slices of country bread. It was cut into 3 pieces, one for each of us. If you've never experienced jam + cheese (whether it's brie or goat cheese or blue cheese) on bread, I command you to make yourself a hot sandwich with those ingredients right now. Weird combination, but oh so right on your tastebuds. We also shared a bowl of the bread pudding, which was more than enough for three people, after eating the sandwich. We finished up the apple slices and left a good portion of the eggy custard portion of the pudding; just too heavy for us. But don't get me wrong, it is delicious. Hmm, I think I would've liked it nuked in the microwave for a little bit though. Last but not least, we each had a Rocher with cocoa nibs. I love meringues, so this was right up my alley. We were lucky enough to grab a table, so we were able to eat all of this in the comfort of seats. I also got two Morning Buns to go. I ate one later that night and then the other one the next morning. Yes, my pants do feel a bit tight, thanks for asking. They taste like palmiers to me -- "elephant ears" (but they remind of a butterfly or a heart), those flaky, folded puff pastries coated with sugary goodness. The Morning Buns are crunchy on the outside and get softer as you get to the center. I ate mine in a circular fashion, so I was able to unravel the bun bit by bit. Ugh, now I'm hungry. I hate when this happens.

I love this bakery/restaurant and I a really glad that it is a popular as it is, but that becomes my problem with the place. Don't get me wrong, the food both sweet and savory, is wonderful... But the people who go, I don't get. Everyone there seems to be surprised that there are other people in line and that the tables are crowded. This would not be so bad if the customers were not so snotty about it. So by all means go and enjoy some of the best treats in the city, but don't give me stink eye because the line to order is right on top of your table.

I love this place - hands down my favorite food to get before 12:00PM. ÊPlus, it's proximity to Dolores Park combines with the great job they do on to-go orders makes it ideal for picnicking! Favorites: bread pudding (especially the apple), almond rochers, quiche, morning bun, mocha, croissants. The line can be a detriment, but usually I just read my paper or chat with my friends. ÊPlus, there's a big communal table so I never feel bad about going alone and hogging up one of the few tables they have. Ê I do need to try the cakes soon - the lemon meringue cake looks delicious!

This place is on my short list of places that any visitor to SF should check out. ÊI've probably been here 4-5 times. ÊI'd recommend the morning bun ($3) and the bread pudding ($3 for a small portion, 5.5 for a large). ÊThere is usually a wait in the morning but the line moves reasonably fast. ÊIf you go in the afternoon, then you run the risk of them running out of the good stuff. Ê I've tried 1 or 2 of the croque monsieurs (open faced sandwiches) and they are ok but overpriced at $9+ and come with one miniature, lonely marinated carrot. ÊAlso, the last time, the sandwich (which sits out all day), despite being tossed in the oven for a reheat, was partially cold and partially warm. ÊThey also have fresh baked bread after 5pm everyday but I haven't tried it yet (the loaf is huge). ÊSo go and get the bread pudding and morning bun (and maybe another sweet item that catches your eye).

Yes, there's always a line, but it moves pretty fast--or maybe I'm just lulled into a zombified state, as I gape at the frosted cakes and pastries in the glass case. Either way, time passes happily. Only three stars because not everything is good. No complaints about the service. What I've tried: Devil's Food Cake: really good. The browned-butter aroma of the caramel between the layers of dense, dark cake and thick chocolate ganache takes this simple but satisfying dessert to another level. My only complaint is that the layers of ganache are too thick, making the cake overly rich. Lemon Cream Tart: not so good. Though lemony and tart, the filling is also cloyingly sweet. Fragipane Croissant: pretty good. Exterior has a nice crunch to it (plus, you're not showered, with each bite, in an annoying flurry of confectioners' sugar and sliced almonds), the frangipane filling is delicate and not overly sweet (just right), but the croissant is much too big, and so the filling gets lost--unless you take the top half off and eat the two halves separately, which is what I did. Bread Pudding: ugh. Maybe I just don't like bread pudding that's lukewarm and has been sitting around in its own fruity juices for a few too many hours. I found the texture wet and soggy, while the taste was bland and lacking in richness, as if they'd used too many egg whites or milk instead of cream. Ê Some tart with a frangipane filing, topped with berries, almonds, and streusel: completely blah and unmemorable. Ê Cake aux Olives: hmm. Okay, I didn't actually eat this, but I peered at it while waiting to pay and it had a disturbing shiny, gummy appearance that wasn't appetizing.

Read that this place received an award for best bakery in San Francisco or was that California, I don't remember. The bakery was extremely crowded it was difficult to pick something out since there were hordes of people behind you. I only ordered a lemon bar and a loaf of the sesame country bread. I think the first thing you noticed about this place is the pricing. Pastry here was definitely not cheap. $3.00 scone and $3.50 lemon bar were not my idea of a cheap snack. However, they were good. The lemon bar on the other hand was extremely sweet, like biting into a cube of sugar. The loaf bread though was more reasonably priced at around $7-8 and it was huge. I felt like I was carrying an infant around. But a reminder, this is not your typical loaf of bread you buy at Safeway, so you need to finish it quick or it will turn to a piece of rock. I would like to give it 5 stars but the price was a bit of a turnoff but I will need to go back a couple more times to justify that. Overall, pastry and bread was good. Crowded and limited seating. Good location but a bit difficult to find parking.

3.5 I expected a lot out of Tartine reading all of the yelp reviews so i was slightly disappointed that this place didn't blow my mind. Êa good bakery, but i was expecting fireworks to explode after trying one of their baked goods after reading these reviews. Friday morning we still had about a 20 minute wait. Ê Morning bun- good, perhaps might have been better if it was warm. Êsurprisingly not too sweet with a good hint of orange. Êthe bun was way over hyped for me and since i dont have much of a sweet tooth, i wasn't 100% impressed. Croissants- plain was really good. Êi slightly prefered this to the morning bun since it was nice and buttery. Êchocolate- ok, better if it was warm. Gruyer- a baked roll-ish type good with grueyer cheese and cracked black pepper. Êa tad too peppery, but overall very fresh. very little table space here so grab a table fast. Êyou get your own water and plates and clean up after yourself. Êand the workers are still snooty. ÊSome seemed very annoyed if you weren't sure what you wanted and a few didn't want to give anyone the time of day. Êdefinitely not a place you feel you can sit awhile at- with tons of people standing around waiting for a table, you feel the pressure to wolf down your pastries and get out. it's a must do on many lists, i would come again if i was in the area but perhaps not make a trip out specifically for Tartine.

Yum, yum yum! Tartine is delicious! I went there for the first time on July 4th, and even though the place was packed, it was worth the wait. I got a chocolate tart and a brownie. Both were moist, delectable and (surprisingly!) affordable. The bakery itself is beautiful and welcoming, clean and minimal. Very earthy and simple. The staff was polite and thin! I guess they don't get a discount... Because it was so busy due to the holiday, I'm sad that I didn't get a chance to sit down and eat more (yes, I know I sound like a fat kid.

There's no better indulgence than a crispy, flakey, hot-out-of-the-oven double pain au chocolate croissant from Tartine -- melts in the mouth, especially if you dunk a corner into their house made chai! ÊActually, maybe a toasted slice of their sesame bread with jam or Nutella may be a close runner up. ÊOr, one of their many other pasteries or saveries made to perfection. ÊI'm hooked on this place and have been on a mission to try one of everything - with no disappointments. ÊProduct quality is a major plus. ÊHere's my overall assessment (pluses, minuses, and tips): Pluses: - Items freshly baked continuously throughout the day - Excellent value ($3.50 world class baked goods) - Warm, social atmosphere - Hip, friendly staff Minuses: - Long lines & wait (during peak times) Tips: - The best times to avoid lines are on weekdays -- early mornings (before 9am), mid mornings (10:30-11:30am), and afternoons (3-5pm). - For fresh bread, you can place an order by phone, usually the same day, and pick up bread around 5pm. ÊBread can be purchased in half loaves. - If you love to bake, the beautiful Tartine cookbook provides the same recipes used at the bakery. ÊThere are recipes of all levels of challenge, ranging from easier ones, like the bread pudding and tea cakes, on up to more complex feats like Bavarian cakes and croissants! ÊI've tried several and can attest to bakery-like results when I follow their recipes.

Top tier: Devil's Food Cake Brioche Bread Pudding Croissants (regular, chocolate, and almond) Bread (after 5PM only) 2nd tier: Morning Buns Brownies Quiches Sandwiches Mid tier: All other cakes Cookies All Tarts Low tier: Coffee That said, Tartine's 2nd tier food is better than every other bakeries' top tier. ÊSo really, the list should have started with "God tier."

Oh, TARTINE...how i love thee, especially the ALMOND CROISSANTS!!! The buttery and flaky croissant is filled with frangipane cream with brandy and topped with toasted almonds and powdered sugar. It is absolutely to die for! Tartine is notorious for long waits (at least 45mins out the door), so arrive early for the yummy goodies!

When is obscene amounts of desserts and baked goods not a good idea? Exactly. It's ALWAYS a good idea. Which is why when looking for my next apartment, proximity to Tartine Bakery is going to be pretty high up on my list of requirements. You may consider this crazy but I just consider it practical; Whether I have friends in town, am feeling sad and in need of a pick me up, am happy and need to celebrate, or am meeting someone to catch up over coffee, I always seem to end up at Tartine. Why, then, should I live so far away!? I can't seem to think of a good reason either. So here's to one day being your neighbor, Tartine. In the meantime, I will continue to make the trek to come visit you, wait in your long line and then sit in bliss while I stuff myself to the point of discomfort with all of your delicious treats.

We came in on a Saturday morning at around 9am. ÊWe ordered mainly pastries to tie us over while we did an urban hike. Ê Let me tell you that the dessert case that held all the goodies looked amazing. ÊThe cookies and cakes looked so delicious! Ê Anyway - on to what we got, chocolate croissant, gougere (sp?), and a currant scone, a latte and an iced tea. ÊThe total damage was about $17... not too bad considering what we got. Drinks were standard... although my friend got a non-fat latte and the barista used whole milk. Ê Chocolate croissant - still warm! ÊSo flaky and warm, it melted in your mouth. Ê Currant scone - I didn't try it but my friend loved it. Gougere - gruyere cheese, thyme and pepper baked into what looked like a giant bun. ÊHowever, the inside was hollow, it was interesting and had it been warm, absolutely delicious. Overall - I'd recommend this place, I want to go back and try the sandwiches.

I finally made it to this place after wanting to for over a year. Ê 5 stars for the crossaint...the best I've had since Paris! ÊSO worth the indulgence! 5 stars for the banana cream tart...I'm not a fan of bananas but after having this tart it may have changed my mind! 4 stars for the pressed sammies...tried the prosciutto and provolone one and it was good but not out of my mind good. ÊIt sounds pricey at $11.50 but this sammie is big enough to serve 2 and even possibly 3 if all girls. 2 stars for the unfriendly wait staff and the pretentious crowd who linger around hogging tables when other customers are spilling out the door!

Man, what else can I say about this joint? A spectacular bakery and a place not to miss in the Mission in SF. My favorites are the Croque Monsieur, aka, crack monsieur. Also the best damn lemon tart I have ever tasted. They say good food starts with good ingredients and this epitomizes that. ÊJust go man!! Jeez 2000+ reviews for this joint it's that good.

Stopped here for a late breakfast on a recent trip to SF. ÊIt was a weekday and on the late side, so the line was quick. We ordered a combination of breakfast items including pain chocolate, bread pudding with strawberries, and a quiche. ÊAll of the items were well done and incredibly tasty. ÊThe food was so good, my wife had to get an extra pastry to go. Ê The coffee was also very good and all in all this was a great morning (albeit full of calories) stop.

I am a fan but I don't think its worth waiting an hour for a coffee and something sweet. The coffee is good, the croissants are light, airy and very buttery and exactly what they should be. One friend had the bread pudding and while most of it was excellent the bottom was like others said, soggy. Another friend had a brownie and it was sooo dense it felt less like a brownie and more like a bar of chocolate. ÊWhile that's always a good thing, just don't call it a brownie, its not one. I love that there are free re-fills on the coffee, that makes a HUGE difference to me as I can drink allot of coffee. if there is no line I always want to go here, but I hate lines so never go here

Maybe it isn't fair of me to give this place an assessment based off of what I purchased.. but I will. ÊThis is a cool little place, another spot that everyone knows about in SF, and the line out the door proves it. ÊI saw some amazing looking pastries, but my eyes drooled more than my mouth. ÊI just had some sweets literally five minutes before stumbling upon this place, and I was in the mood for something a bit more savory. ÊTheir sandwiches/paninis looked amazing. ÊBut its a bakery, so we stocked up on some sweets for later.. a slice of Tres Leches Cake, a mexican wedding cookie. We were set on ordering a sandwich to go, and asked the hostess if the sandwich would keep for about an hour or so, she didn't recommend it and said we should get the Croque Monsieur. ÊLooked good but I was a bit skeptical since it is an open face w/ bechamel, cheese, ham, tomato.. definitely needed to be warmed up before eating. ÊBut she insisted it would keep better than the sandwich so we got that, and a ham and cheese filled croissant. Ê The croissant was delicious, too bad it couldnt have been thrown in the oven for a few minutes (we were staying at a hotel Downtown). ÊBut the Croque, albeit flavorful, was not very enjoyable at room temperature. ÊMy BF only had a few bites and said it wasn't worth it. ÊThat's when my woman-like ingenuity kicked in and I tried to warm it up using our blow dryer! ÊIt actually worked decently. ÊThe cheese melted, and although the bread obviously won't toast, it was somewhat warm. ÊThe pastries, croissant excluded, Êwere just so-so. I would go back to eat there and give them a fair shot to impress me.

I don't really think this place needs another review. The quality of the bread here is beyond contestation. Yes I just made that into a noun. I grew up eating cheap croissants and this place has ruined me. I can only enjoy them here now. Rich, crisp, and buttery, you can't have two. Can't really write too much about it, its an experience. Any bread item here is just stellar and I really like the pickled baby carrots with the sandwiches. The patisserie side of things is pretty damn good too. This is also the first bakery I've known to donate the day's leftovers. All that aside an amazing bakery that is mostly organic and they try to serve local ingredients as well. -1 star for the occasional lackluster service.

Time to update: Would all the contenders line up please and you will be picked in order from BEST to Meh: 1. Brioche Bread pudding- never had bread pudding before, but brioche can do no wrong. AMAZING. 2. Lemon Tart- A very hard thing to make perfectly but Tartine does it. The crust is so crunchy and the lemon is perfection. Lemon bar is great too. 3. Passionfruit coconut cake- The cake is so fluffy and the passionfruit creme is tangy, delicious 4. Chocolate mouse- to my surprise it wasn't too bitter like most dark chocolate and I can't see how anyone wouldn't like this- very good quality chocolate 5. Coconut creme pie- good flavor just nothing special 6. Eclair- cream filling was delicious, but i HATE dark chocolate and that's what covered the top-totally ruined it for me 7. The Bread- good, crispy crust and CHEWY mmmmm... like it, but Semifreddi's is still my first love (The BF hated it, but it's because he's french and american bread will never be good enough lol) Ok, I'm going to go work out now.. you go to tartine

I went here with my brother who raved that Tartine has the best pastries outside of Paris that he's tasted. I was suprised at the homey, slightly informal interior. I saw their cookbook and expected something posh, contemporary. The line was long and it was tough to find a table but what can ya do? if it's popular then the line is going to be long and it'll be busy. We had pain au chocolat, morning bun, and pumpkin bread. They were very good. My brother actually has better taste in pastries than I so I didn't appreciate Tartine as much as he. A good place for someone who likes fine pastries.

Seems that my life is all about waiting in line for something. Something I don't enjoy much, but like the rest of us, you have to. Well, Tartine is one business I don't mind waiting in line. I have never had bread or pastries this good. Many come close, but there is something special here. I bought their book and have a few trial runs at baking loafs. Still need some tweaking, time/temperature issues. Like a science project. In the meantime I will stand in line, content knowing the reward.

My sisters had raved about this place, so I made the effort to go when I was in town. The first challenge will be to find a parking space. I think we went by close to 2:00 and it took us a good 10-15 minutes to find a place to park, followed by a long walk to the bakery. Once you enter, you're confronted by a small shop full of delicious-looking goodies, accompanied by sky-high prices. $36 for a 6" cake? Yikes! Wife and I split a Turkey sandwich that was very good and large enough for both of us, and we also got a lemon tart and a chocolate-hazelnut tart. Both were great, but probably not worth the $6 each that they cost. My take is if you don't care about cost, then the food is great. If you do care about cost, you can probably get equal food elsewhere for cheaper.

Coconut Creme Pie- Super hard crust; it was so hard to cut! The inside of the pie was pretty good though. It was just so frustrating to eat the pie that I gave up less than half way. Bread Pudding- Soggy bread + fruit? It was alright but it wasn't ALLLL that. Shortbread- the bf liked it Lines- Don't be intimidated, it moves pretty fast so be patient. Seating- Awful, just take it home. Although I ordered to eat there and couldn't get a seat so my bf and I just stood and ate the goodies from the plate. That was lame. I'm gonna have to come back for their acclaimed Morning Bun and perhaps fresher baked goods and maybe I'll change my mind.

I don't live in SF, so when I need to get my Tartine fix it needs to be a carefully planned trip (i.e. on a weekday morning when everyone else *should* be at work). I've tried: - Pain au Chocolat - If you order one thing, it should be this. Delicious buttery flaky croissant goodness with dark chocolate. - Almond Croissant - Also solid, but I prefer actual almond paste rather than almond custard. But still, very good. - Fragipane Tart - wasn't too impressed with this. Too sweet and I'm more used to a more marizipan-like almond paste. - Banana Cream Pie - decent but not their best. You can tell their ingredients are fresh, and it's not overly sweet which is nice. Overall, I would highly recommend their croissants but I'm meh on the other pastries. I'd love to come back and try their bread!

The must-haves: Ê Ê ---morning buns: can't get them anywhere else. ÊHaven't eaten anything like this before. ÊIs it like a cinnamon roll or is it like a croissant? ÊIt is as delicious as it is schizo. Ê Ê Ê ---Banana cream tart: ÊI don't like banana in desserts, or banana cream pies. ÊBut since everyone raves about it, I gave it a try. ÊWow. ÊIt is no ordinary tart. ÊThe cream is light and airy, pairs perfectly with the lightly sweet bananas in a nice crusty tart. ÊEverything together is just perfect. ÊQuite large, good for sharing. Ê Ê ---Banana bread pudding: another dessert that funkily features bananas. ÊI tried bananas in my homemade bread pudding because of Tartine and it was awful. ÊTartine manages to make it so rich and tasty. ÊWhy is my banana bread pudding weird and tangy? Ê Ê ---Chocolate cake: chocolate cake is usually the last thing I'd order since it's so boring. ÊBut my friend brought me a piece of Tartine chocolate cake once and it was really delicious. ÊNow I measure all chocolate cakes against Tartine's simple yet perfect chocolate cake. The secondary-choices: Ê Ê ---Opera cakes: Êthey are good. ÊBut I have had equally good ones at Cafe Cocola. ÊAnd I am still waiting for an opera that tops or matches the one from my favorite cafe in Lyon, France. ÊMy friend and I were inspired to open up our own Opera cafe that sells nothing but Operas. ÊSo it's a pretty high bar to meet. Ê Ê ---Hazelnut tart: Êhas that nutty fragrance but slightly on the dry side. Ê Ê Ê ---Pumpkin tea cake: so I mistakenly thought it means it had tea in it. ÊBut it's just a pumpkin pound cake sorta thing. ÊDelicious? ÊYes. ÊExtraordinary? Go to the must-haves list. Ê Ê ---I bought my husband their macaroons and scones. ÊHe said they were good, but never asked for them again, so I assume they weren't magical. ÊActually he said the macaroon he had at Google was the best he's had. ÊNot sure how to take that. Ê Ê ---Lemon tart. ÊI have never liked any lemon dessert, so this was not my favorite. ÊBut if you like that extreme tartness from citrus-y fruit, you might enjoy their lemon tart. The to-be-skipped: Ê Ê ---nope, I haven't tried any desserts there that should be skipped. ÊBut the coffee here isn't all that great. ÊKind of a shame since it's really nice to have a cup of strong coffee to off set the sweetness of the desserts. ÊHowever, their chai latte is quite good.

Came here on a rainy Sunday, so the line was not out the door! Yay! Ordered the banana cream tart because of all the raving reviews about it. To be honest, I didn't find it particularly special. It was good, but definitely not worth $6.50. The place was too crowded, so there wasn't really anywhere to eat. The banana cream tart is definitely a sit-down type of food. We attempted to eat it in the car but gave up on that idea quickly. Got home and tried to cut it up since there's no way you can bite into it since it is pretty massive. The crust is thick and hard and almost impossible to cut through. The banana cream was good but still not worth $6.50 in my opinion. I would like to come back though to try other things.

One of the most hyped up places to eat in San Francisco, not to mention the country. Yes, this is the bakery that was deemed "Best Bakery in America" by the New York Times food review. The best bread you'll ever eat in your life, but it sells out quick . Cookies, cakes creams and pies, croque monsieurs, muesli, savory and sweet buns and delicious Four Barrell coffee. Check out the Wine Bar and the espresso counter. Don't leave without a sugar rush. This is my favorite place in the city, just watch out for the homeless folk when you sit outside, they WILL steal your morning buns. PS- there's no sign out front, just look for the line around the block.

Tartine, your line is crazy ridiculously long during brunch hours but I can understand why people would subject themselves to all the waiting.

its only a bakery you may say. or how good can bread, quiche, or tarts really be? keep saying that while you stand in line slowly inching your way into a indiscernible corner shop. take one bite out of a melt in your mouth gougere or the infamous morning bun and you will understand. so good you will forgive the 20 minute wait in line. besides this, a melange of french pastries can be found along with sandwiches and breads. try and grab a table, but be prepared to wait. personally, i've found there is no dignified way in eating the giant sticky morning bun other than employing a plate and fork. it's a giant puff of buttery layers, laced with cinnamon, and delicate hints of orange zest, quite delicious, still i prefer la farine's crisper, cleaner version. prices are on the higher side, but all items come in gigantic proportions. if you're inclined to try something savory, the olive bread was unlike any other. a thick slice, eggy and soft at the same time, it reminded me of a savory bread pudding. really, i don't think you can go wrong with any of the selections. Êthe one thing i do not enjoy here are the cookies. very thin, flat, and crispy, made with quality ingredients but a bit too crispy for my liking. i could rant on about the quiches, tarts, bread pudding, croissants, bread, and more but i've probably gained 5 lbs just from writing this. go see for yourself. now.

Don't plan on sitting down to eat here on a weekend. ÊHunting for a table just isn't that enjoyable. ÊJust get your food and go sit at Dolores Park. That said. ÊYou must get a gougre, a morning bun, and a small mocha. ÊIt will leave your body wanting more. ÊIf more is needed. ÊThe chocolate croissants are amazing if they are warm.

I'm picky about baked goods. ÊMost of the places in this town are a lot of hype and bad chocolate. ÊTartine is not one of them. ÊThe fine craftsmanship shows in everything they make from their cakes, to a wonderful croque monsieur. ÊYes, the line is always long and can make you a tad cranky, but believe me it's worth it.

This is truly one of the gems of the culinary experience in san francisco. From their delicious tarts to almost perfect quiche, tartine offers a fabulous dining experience for someone in the mood for either a simple launch or bakery based breakfast. Every thing I have had at the place is awesome. I do have to agree with general consensus about the time delay. Since it is so popular, the line can get a little overwelming. Do your self a favor and go on week days rather than weekends or holidays.

Tartine has really good bread if you wait for it to come out at 5pm. ÊThey change bread types every day. ÊThe crust is just perfect - crispy but not too hard - you can only get this type of crust with the right oven. ÊThe inside is really soft, but not the way Wonder bread is soft - the bread has a really interesting and varied texture. ÊA lot of people say re: Tartine, that you can only get this type of bread in Europe, or in Paris.. ÊI don't know about that, but I can say the bread is very good.

Finally got a chance to check it out today. The croissant is good. ÊThe crust is darker than I'm used to, like Semifreddi's, but does not taste burnt. ÊThe crust is more chewy than La Farine's. ÊLa Farine's croissant has a crust that is perfectly delicately crisp (when the climate is right); it is unrivaled in my experience. ÊThe flavor is nice--not overly buttery like Semifreddi's. ÊIt is $2.75, but it also feels heftier than La Farine's or Bittersweet's or anywhere else that I can think of. ÊWhat surprises me is that, despite its heftiness, the croissant is not dense. ÊThere is some elasticity to it, but not as much as La Farine's, which makes La Farine's so pleasurable to break apart and eat. The eclair was impressive. ÊIt is probably the best I've had. ÊIt does not taste of sugar, like most places do. ÊI could actually taste the chocolate of the coating (Valrhona) and the subtle vanilla in the custard filling. ÊNo overpowering flavors. ÊThe texture of the tender choux pastry was just right--not too crusty, and not soggy. ÊAlso, the choux pastry appears to be the one-piece kind where the custard is pumped into it at one end, not the kind that consists of top and bottom halves like a sandwich with the filling in between. ÊThe latter is bad for any eclair considering the mess it lends itself to making. ÊVery good. ÊIt did not feel heavy, but the proportion is filling. ÊTwo can share. Also noticed that they have pastrami sandwiches. ÊThey say that they serve it on bread that they make themselves. ÊI hope to give it a try soon. 8/22/2007 update I went back and tried their pastrami sandwich. ÊThe texture of the toasted/pressed bread was too much for me. ÊIt's too crusty and chewy and overwhelms the tender pastrami, which did have a nice flavor. ÊNice pickled carrots though--has a nice spicy flavor. ÊThe sandwich is very filling, so don't expect to be able to pack down dessert. 8/28/2007 update Ok. ÊI am really impressed now. ÊYesterday, I had the smoked ham quiche, the devil's food cake, and the banana cream pie (small). ÊThe quiche was very good. ÊNice fluffy thick egg filling and the ham (Niemand Ranch) was not too salty. ÊPerfect, crispy, flaky crust (although a bit charred in spots). Ê The devil's food cake bore a very good chocolate flavor and did not taste sugary. ÊI wasn't in the mood for it, but I had to try it anyway because it's so difficult for me to get to this place (and then have to wait in a long line for 30 minutes). ÊI was impressed with the quality. Ê It could really be shared by two because it is a bit heavy. The banana cream pie was what really impressed me. ÊI had never liked banana anything. ÊI saw the impressive crust and the cream and the chocolate shavings, and I decided I had to give it a try, too. ÊAfter the quiche and the cake, I was stuffed. ÊI had bought all three items at once because I didn't want to wait in line for 30 minutes again if I turned out to be in the mood for it. ÊSo, I had it five hours later. ÊIt sat in the car for five hours, and I was still impressed by it. ÊIt had the same kind of crust as the quiche and remained crusty and flaky because of the smart baker coating it with a layer of chocolate before placing the filling. ÊRight amount of caramel did nicely for the banana. ÊAnd the chocolate shavings on the top was delicate enough to break gracefully and not make a mess when I dug in with the spoon. The 30-minute wait was not a joke. ÊI waited in line 30 minutes to place my order and no table was available. ÊI was glad I ordered all three items at once. ÊWhen I finished my quiche and cake (and sampled a few nibbles of the pie), the line was just as long. 8/29/2007 update The Croque Monsieur is a thick slice of their country bread (thick crust) topped with Bechamel and cheese plus an additional item (tomatoes was the item on this day). ÊIt was good, but I can't say it's worth $8.25. The coconut cream pie was very good. ÊDamn good crust again (see above review re the banana version). ÊCould be even better with less caramel.

OK, maybe I need to scroll through the reviews more thoroughly, but I am utterly floored that there's no mention on the first page of Tartine's chocolate souffle cake. Sure, the croque monsieur is wonderful, but the chocolate souffle cake is beyond words. It is simply the most intense and satisfying chocolate experience I have ever known. It is something you eat with your soul, not just your mouth. You don't simply taste it -- you become it and it becomes you, like some sort of Zen ritual. The downside? They don't sell it by the slice. On the bright side, the six inch cake can serve about 10 people because of the concentrated nature of the chocolaty goodness. Take it to a party and I guarantee you'll be invited back.

Tartine lives up to all the hype, the long lines, the hard to park neighborhood, the long wait for a table. Ê It is all worth it. Ê Their baked goods are out of this world - passionfruit coconut cake - yum, coconut cream pie with chocolate at the bottom - yum, croissants, rolls, cookies - yum, yum, yum. ÊAnd if you want to grab a sandwich and coffee or salad - those are also very very good.

I've been going to Tartine regularly for the past two years, and have always left full, satisfied and happy. ÊI've always had a little bit of trouble finding parking and seating, but that's really just a part of life if you're used to driving around to small bakeries and restaurants in SF. ÊJust be patient, and everything will work out. Ê Worse case scenario: you can't find a table, so you walk a couple blocks north to Dolores Park and have a great picnic! ÊThis is one of those bakeries where literally EVERYTHING is delicious, rich & fluffy. ÊYou simply can't go wrong. The only reason I'm giving Tartine 4 instead of 5 stars is that upon my last visit I noticed the prices were much higher, and the lines much longer than I remembered. Ê$6 for a small tart, and $3.25 for a plain croissant seems too steep unless I have friends/family in town and am looking to impress with local fare. ÊAnd it's such a pain to wait in line on a weekend morning for a couple small treats...seems worth it only if you're buying a large quantity of their signature dishes that you really cant get elsewhere. Ê So take my advice. If you make the trek to Tartine, don't go for the simple stuff, go for the gold that isn't sold just anywhere. ÊMy favorites are the scrumptiously warm bread pudding with seasonal fruit, meringues with cacao nibs, chocolate cake, quiche, and gougere au fromage. ÊBon Appetit!

Tartine is everything it's billed to be: o) Delicious. The pastries speak for themselves. In addition to looking gorgeous they are delectable. They do a good job keeping the sweet things from being overwhelmingly so. The sandwiches all come on wonderful breads that really add to the experience. o) Crowded. I live a half block from Tartine and you can almost set your watch by the crowds. On weekends, it's always busy. At lunch, it's busy. In between lunch and dinner (say 1:30p-4:30p) there is a window during which the wait may only be a few minutes. The problem with the crowds is that while Tartine is absolutely yummy, waiting 40 minutes for a sandwich or a tart seems a bit excessive. Exacerbating this is the feeling that the servers are never in a hurry. o) Expensive. $10.50 for a cheese sandwich is too much. I'm fine with places taking a long time. My problem with Tartine, and the reason for the 3 star review is that the service could be so much better if they committed to getting people in and out of there more quickly. They haven't, and so most trips here are an exercise in frustration for me. That's partially my fault, partially theirs.

As a bakery I'd say between 4 & 5 stars... BUT, this is really more than a bakery, they serve food as well, and that is the problem. While the bakery goods are very good, and at times even excellent, and the coffee is top-notch (good ole Mr Espresso, none of that nose-in-the-air Blue Bottle stuff here), the savory items leave a lot to be desired. The sandwiches are HUGE (which is good) but also very greasy and lack in subtlety. ÊAs sort of a Mission version of Berkeley's Cafe Fanny they have managed to avoid the pretentious staff issues that mat Fanny -- but, they also seem to have missed to delicacy and quality of Fanny's food. So, go for breakfast or a mid-morning coffee... but, for lunch, there are better options.

This bakery was hyped up as much as possible....read numerous reviews in 7x7 and even a snippet in GQ magazine...all raving about the morning buns. Finally decided to wake up early on a sunday morning, in the rain, and headed down to the mission for this exquisite, amalgamation of flavors concentrated in doughy goodness. This morning bun is truly one of San Francisco's great items to eat. Period. Also tried the croque monsieur with smoked Niman ranch ham, and I also highly recommend this as well. To describe the country bread they use, it's crunchy on the outside and soft/mildly chewy on the inside with a sourness that is not overpowering. Excellent bread to go along with the combination of the ham as well as the gruyere and tomatoes. Also purchased but not yet consumed include: chocolate croissant, eclairs, banana cream tart and lemon cream tart (desserts to share at a later meal).

Any place that sells bread pudding for breakfast is a winner in my book. I was a bit dubious about all the hype, but it was TOTALLY worth the hike through the rain. This is not a frou-frou bakery. No crazy works of food art here. Solid, quality french style pastries at typical prices. You probably can't go wrong here, and I can't wait to go back and try more things. Ambiance is a bit lacking, as the place is small and crowded, but how can you not be happy with croissant in hand? Go outside and roam the neighborhood instead.

I used to come here a lot with my sisters. If any one of us came back to San Francisco from college, vacation, etc., we usually made a trip out to Tartine to catch up on the news and gossip. Love the: Meringue Cookies Bread Pudding (get a small, plenty for two people cos it;s so rich and creamy) Banana Creme Tartlet Passion Fruit Cake Over the years though, it's gotten less and less exciting to go there because of the huge lines and the lack of a sitting space.

Here's the scoop on Tartine. Their baked goods are AWESOME. Only problems are that 1. You can get really old waiting in line. I have seriously waited in line for 20-30 minutes before. It's crazy. 2. Far worse than the line is the attitudes of the people behind the counter. Basically they are snooty hipsters that treat you with complete disdain and attitude. Part of the reason that the line gets so long is not just that it is popular, but that the counter staff drags along at a snails pace while simultaneously treating you like crap. So that being said, baked goods - awesome, vibe and wait - really, really AWFUL. You make the call.

Oh country bread you are the best bread in the world. I can't say I am a huge fan of their pastries and such because they are merely distractions on the path to country bread. The country bread is what its all about. You can get a decent pastry many places. I happen to be a fan of Destination myself. But you can only get this amazing bread at Tartine.

I went here at night, and it was still pretty busy. The bakery is pretty small, so you're almost forced to wait in line right next to people dining there. We ordered items that were already ready, aside from drinks so we didn't wait long to eat. But if we had, it would be worth the wait. The coffee and tea was very tasty. My husband and I bought their chocolate chip cookies (I wish I took a picture) that were already packaged to take home. They're the thin, crunchy chocolate chip cookies. They seriously tasted the way they looked. Fabulous. They were crunchy, yet soft in the middle. Just the right amount of chocolate chips, not too much and not too little.

If your in the mood for some good breakfast treats, phenomenal bread and taste of pastries that just overewheml your tastebuds, tartine in the Mission is the place. With so many options, fresh made breads and heavenly flavors, its hard to say no. The quich of the Day had sundried tomatoes and ham. Delicate and fluffy eggs coated the roasted veggies in a flaky yet sturdy crust. Delicious. The Êlemon bar was citrusy and tangy, not too sweet and went fabulously well with a cafe latte. The only drawback was that they offer no flavorings for the lattes which didn't work so well for a sweet vanilla craving. The food is so good that they can get away with it! The croque monsieur was amazing: country crusted baked bread, wild mushrooms, sundried tomatoes With eggs and gruyere cheese. Probably one of the best croque monsieur I've had, even better than the ones I've had in Paris. I was eyeing the bread pudding topped with local apricot and peaches.. crust just oozing with hot steam as the tray came out of the oven.

Disappointing, esp. after reading reviews. ÊOur SF apt is 2 blocks away. ÊWent there 3 times during our 10 day visit. ÊDoesn't measure up to Clear Flour back home. ÊWe had croissants, scones, bread pudding, sticky bun, yogurt w/ museli, quiche, chocolate croissant tea and cafe au lait. The croissant is one of my favorite bakery items, so I'll start there. ÊThe dough seemed correctly prepared, but incorrectly cooked. ÊFinished product exterior was burnt on bottom yet inside was mushy, even after letting sit for 30 minutes to let cool after they served it to me (right out of the oven). ÊThey apparently should be cooking at lower temperature for longer and letting rest before serving. My SO makes excellent scones that are light and flaky (after 10s of tries). ÊWhile these were clearly better than 99% of the rocks that American bakeries produce, they were still a bit ameturish and nothing to write home about---moderately flaky, moderately dense. Bread pudding (apple for us) was one of the stars for us. ÊMoist, not overly sweet, great fruit topping that wasn't overcooked (good texture). ÊQuiche was good, but far from Thomas Keller's level of creaminess. ÊSticky buns had an extra layer of raw sugar on top (besides the caramel) which made them hard to eat. ÊYogurt museli was awful---thin yogurt with soggy, tasteless granola. Such a mixed bag that I can't imagine recommending it to anyone. ÊWe also hit Thorough Bread and Pastry and Acme Bread and found both to be superior.

I wanted to try something different than the regular stuff at Boulangerie, and after hearing all the rave reviews I was fully expecting to have a new contender for the best bakery in San Francisco. LOL NO. The customer service is so bad. One guy behind the counter was chit chatting to some girl Êabout some band. When I asked her if she was in line, she scoffed and said "YEA I'M ORDERING." Sorry, I didn't realize the workers don't actually serve you. THEN we ordered our pastries and the people behind the counter literally sat there dazed for a good minute or so staring out into space...so weird. The pastries were burnt. They were nothing special. The chocolate croissant had the consistency of the croissants at Costco, yea you know the ones, only with only a few more flakes and bittersweet chocolate in the center. The almond crossant was better, but still burnt on the top, and the price was pretty high for the product. I should have never strayed from my beloved Boulangerie, never again.

Finally bought into the hype that is Tartine. It doesn't even have a freaking sign in front and yet you just. know. What to look for: young hipsters, aging hipsters, yuppies, yuppie moms, yuppie expectant moms, all on line for over-priced yet quite delicious morning buns, croissants, etc. I went here with a friend for lunch and was immediately taken aback by the high price for the pressed sandwiches (over $10!) and immediately asked the woman behind the counter if they "came with anything" and she gave me a weird look and said "nope." My friend ended up ordering an olive tapenade sandwich and I decided to go with the "less expensive" zucchini quiche. VERY glad I did not get a pressed sandwich and also glad I am incredibly aggressive when it comes to table-hunting because that place was packed with a near-constant line out the door. Anyway, back to the sandwich! It took like half an hour to come out and it was a greasy, olive-y monstrosity. OK maybe I'm biased because I despise olives, but my friend didn't enjoy it that much either. So maybe they give you a pretty big portion, but it's almost all bread. All the grease combined with the strong flavor of the olive and anchovy tapenade was not very pleasant. We did however enjoy an almond croissant and a lemon creme tart in the end (after I stood in line for another 15 mins). So, all in all, I would say that you should go to Tartine just to see what all the hype is about, but if you hate waiting in lines and can't even imagine paying over $10 for a "pressed sandwich" or croque monsieur, this is not the place for you. I think I'll be back someday, maybe just for a coffee to-go and a dessert or pastry.

OK. First off I would like to say the food itself is worth 5 stars, but the service sucks! All of the workers I have encounter there that day only one girl behind the espresso bar made me feel welcome. I was in Hayes Valley and wanted a place to eat. For some reason I thought of Tartine, so I googled it and my friend and I was exactly 1 mile away. We walked there to find a long line out the door, but we were already here might as well try it. I wanted a Banana Cream Tart, but they were out so I settled for the Coconut Cream Tart. It was HEAVENLY! I also pre-ordered half a loaf of walnut bread to be picked up at 5 pm (3 hours later). There wasn't any place to sit, so we had to order to go. When I wanted to know the different flavors of bread they offer the girl had this "OMG. Do I really have to tell you the flavors" look on her face. I thought that was uncalled for. I just wanted to know the damn flavor of the bread so I can order it. OK. My friend and I walked around the Mission and came back 30 minutes before 5 pm to pick up our Êbread. Yes, we had food in our hands because we hungry, and finally there was a place to sit inside. We sat down and started eating our food (outside food and our desserts that we ordered at Tartine). While we were eating I can see the worker staring and talking about us (I was facing the mirror, so I saw whatever was happening behind me as well). I know it was rude of me to bring in food, but we really were hungry. If the bread came out sooner we would have left and eaten everything at home. Anyway, the whole time we kept getting constant stares at the two workers.. Êugh.. I was so annoyed. Overall, the service was ehh... but the desserts and bread was absolutely delish! :) I would definitely come back for the food because that overrule the customer service.

This place is the Mama's of SF bakeries. Their morning bun and other pastries or OK, but nothing worth waiting in that long line for. Boulange has better food. The quiche is underwhelming and $9 for a loaf of bread is just ridiculous. Acme bread is so much better and a fraction of the price.

OMG OMG OMG! OMG! oh and OMG! I tried Tartine's on a recent SF trip and I am SO glad I did. This was the best French bakery I've ever had. This is also my first french bakery I've ever had hahahha but it be damn good. Ordered the Seasonal fruit bread pudding, chocolate au pain thing, almond croissant, and cinnamon orange morning bread thing that looks like a cinnamon roll. Everything was sooooooooooooooooooo good. The bread pudding has a very eggy creamy taste. It was really good, but I would not order it again (rather save my tummy for the other even more exquisite baked goods. Glad I tried it though. The chocolate bread thing was my fav. The chocolate had great cocoa flavor baked to perfection. Croissant was so damn good as well. The slightly burnt exterior had such yummy toasty flavor. The morning bun was saved for the next day's breakfast and it was still amazing the day after!!! Overall, I would consider this place a MUST TRY. Warning, it does not have a sign so use your smart phone. There is a tote hanging with Tartine printed on it inside the window though. Only bad point is the line. I waited about 45 minutes.

After hearing all the raves about Tartine, my wife, who is French, convinced me to take her there. We went for the bread, which is described as Country French. The line was long, the music playing was so loud you could hardly talk to anyone and the ambiance was forced French (tres pretentious). We had two disciples on line in front of us, raving about how wonderful the bread was. We actually were very excited. The counter person finally took our order, in a manner which was borderline rude and uncaring. When we asked to see the bread that he had already packed, he reluctantly showed us the masterpiece, which was burnt on the outside. When I asked him for another bread, he said that this was the way they were made, and there was a French word for the method, but he couldn't remember the word! Well, as feared, when we ripped open the bread outside of Tartine, the inside dough was not properly cooked. It was also sourdough, which doesn't exist in France. This bread is not French!!! We've learned our lesson, and will stick with good, old Baker's of Paris for the closest thing to French bread we have around here.

Wow, I just realized I've never written a review for the amazing Tartine. What is wrong with me? This is the most heavenly baker I have EVER been to. I have not had one thing from Tartine that hasn't knocked my socks off. Really and truely. Their croissants are the kind that when bringing them home the bag arrives soaked with butter (nothing is better than a yummy buttery croissant). All of their pies, cakes, tarts, quiches, etc. are just amazing. If I lived closer to Tartine, I would be one fat lady. Love it!

mmmmmm baked goods. my friend and i came here on a saturday afternoon and boy was it difficult to find parking. i suggest barting it if you can avoid driving. the line was out the door and along the building but the wait wasnt too bad. we were there for maybe 30 mins at MOST.. in fact now that i think about it, it was probably 15-20mins. anyways baked goods are all fresh. i got myself a raisin bun and a croissant while my friend got a lemon tart. the bun and croissant were amazing. crispy and flakey on the outside and soft and buttery on the inside. i didnt try the tart but my friend gobbled it up. she said it was super creamy and the caramel center made it even better. however theres a chocolate layer on the bottom and breaking that thing was no easy task. she struggled splitting it up. it can get pretty stuffy inside so we took some tables outside in the gorgeous sun. if you want, take it to dolores park for a quick picnic! good times at this place. awesome bakery

Today I went to this popular bakery on my second time after I hadn't been there for long time. Because first time, I took an eclair and coffee, it was less than ok.... chocolate was too sticky and chou was lil soggy. However having been watching long long line everyday made me want to try one more time. then now really understandable why they can make crazy line! Banana chocolate pie is so amazing! airly whipped cream, crispy dark chocolate, savory pie dough, melty caramel, sweet banana and castard..... hummm yammyyyy....... but coconuts passion fruit cake was ok. I thought white flake covering sponge cake was white chocolate, but actually it was coconuts flake, which lasted like paper in my mouth. Wish it would be white choco. That would be perfect! Anyway defenetely I will go back to get banana pie!

830 am on a friday and still a wait. about 45 min after getting in line, we had ordered: 1 croissant, banana cream tart, ham quiche, 1 eclair, 2 morning buns, 1 coffee. all incredibly amazing. the croissant was the BEST ive had - so buttery. and the tart was also delish except the crust was much harder than i expected. Êthought the eclair was ok but that may have been bc it was overshadowed by the deliciousness of everything else. the morning buns were hot out of the oven and u could taste their deliciousness and orangey-ness that wasn't too overwhelming as it kind of melted into a buttery goo on your hands. yum.

This place is amazing and actually worth the wait on a sunny day. My friends and I love to go sit out in Dolores park with a picnic of food gathered from Tartine. The hot pressed grilled sandwiches are fantastically savory. The last time I went I ate a soppressata with provolone and broccoli raab pesto. So good. There was also a bread pudding that I've dreamt three times about. They served it up with fresh nectarines. I hope they still have it when I go back next week.

Tartine is one of the best bakeries I've been to around the country (mainly the cities of SF, LA, Boston, NY, Portland). I've tried a lot, and this is one of the few that I both remember, and make a point to return to whenever I am in San Francisco. I've never shown up for lunch, just breakfast. And I usually get the Morning Bun and Bread Pudding. You can purchase their cookbook, and make the bread pudding at home (very easy). The morning bun isn't in there though, so you have come in to get it.

Finally made it to Tartine! This has been on my bucket list forever! I was definitely impressed. Came in early Saturday afternoon. There was a bit of a line... but nothing like I was expecting from what I have heard. Plus the waiting gives you a bit to look around and decide what you want to try! Of course I had to try the morning bun. Delicious, moist, just sweet enough. It was great with iced coffee. We also tried a lemon bar. Delicious lemon curd, and a thick, shortbready type crust. Fantastic. I will for sure be going back because there were so many other things I wanted to try. The quiches looked to die for and there was this asparagus tart that I couldn't keep my eyes off of. They even have wine!

I'd love to give this place 3 1/2 stars but decided to go a half star up instead because I don't have that choice. ÊWhen I started going there 2 years ago, this place was great. ÊEvery pastry was absolutely stellar and perfect. ÊIt was a real gem and locals' secret. I went recently, in the evening, on a Saturday night and was surprised to see a long line, not of punky, tattooed locals, but Prada-wearing Euroflash and camera-wielding tourists. ÊWeird since the Mission is still so grunge and alternative everywhere else. Ê We bought cookies, eclairs, a chocolate tart, some meringes (we go crazy at bakeries.) ÊI have to say everything was delicious but not as good as I remember. ÊIt just didn't have that *loving* *homemade* *French* touch that was once there. ÊIt's still worth going to but not as good as you would expect it to be considering the hype. If you want true French style pastries, go to Napa. ÊI haven't found anything in CA that even remotely comes close to Bouchon Bakery in Yountville. ÊBouchon is still a bit more American (portions are small but larger and a bit less delicate than a real Parisian bakery) but it is absolutely and totally out of this world delicious, even after all these years. Hmmm...should write a review of Bouchon Bakery...

I am conflicted about reviewing Tartine because I don't want to contribute to making the lines longer, but at this point the secret is clearly out. Food snob brother, spent many years in Paris, came to visit me out here, I already loved the place but decided to test it on him. Two of us wandered over at about 3 on a Friday afternoon (best time to go), he went back EVERY morning for the duration of his stay. I'm a morning roll girl - the only thing Tartine has ever done wrong is run out of them.

The best bread pudding. The best croissants. The best chocolate cake. The best frangipane tart. The best country bread (either the regular kind or the one with walnuts) and a damn good cafe au lait in a real bowl like at home. Basically, the best boulangerie for breakfast or afternoon sweets... And, yeah, I'm French: I've done them all! Note: It's a 5-star rating for the food only because I live nearby and always take it to go but they indeed have a problem managing their growth. If I had to eat there every time, I think the crowd would spoil a bit the experience. But if you can get one of the two tables outside... Aaah, merci Tartine!

My criteria for a five star rating? Planning the next trip while still at the restaurant/bar/store/club/whatever. Tartine warrants a five star review. I have tried several things from Tartine (mainly because my friends are delightful and love to share): bread pudding, pumpkin bread, the morning bun, quiche, croque monsieur, and the almond croissant. In general I love bread pudding, but wasn't totally enthused about the banana pudding- too much chocolate and carmel and overall sweetness for me. However, the other fruit-based bread pudding that was brought out after the banana looked fabulous. The quiche was phenomenal; the lightest and creamiest ever. I took a bite and was actually shocked by the flavor and texture. Mmmm. The other highlight was the almond croissant. It was airy, almondy, and moist. One of the best I have ever had. Five stars Tartine. I am already planning my next trip....

Annoying, to say the least, and it put the servers in a bad mood, too...because not one of them was pleasant to anyone else in line.

So finally I tried Tartine last week. It was good, indeed. BUT! The portions are too big to be authentic. Many yelpers say the pastries are like in Paris... hmm, I would say twice as big. Why is that matter? Well, when you have a croissant twice the right size you cannot have that particular fluffiness. The dough is great but it's too dense. A perfect croissant should be feather light and flakey. Despite what I just said, I still think they have one of the best croissant in SF. I also tried the famous bread pudding, which was tasty and contained lots of fresh fruit. But where is the brioche in it? It was almost only the pudding. For my taste it was not well balanced. The bread completely disappeared in the custard. I loved the fact that it was light but I missed the crispy golden top... Maybe it's just me. However, the chocolate hazelnut tart was excellent! Moist, pure dark chocolate in a thin crust! It was a real heaven! My husband who is French had a croque monsieur, which he enjoyed but found it too big and heavy because of the bechamel-like thing under the ham. He said he's never seen that in France. Which is OK, this croque is Tartine's own interpretation. So again, it was good but half the size would have been more enjoyable. I enjoyed a cup of cappuccino which was excellent: strong espresso with a amount of foamy milk. Oh, I almost forgot to mention the freshly baked country bread that we took home. It was right out of the oven, steaming hot! I would say - without exaggeration - it was one of the best bread in my life! At home I cut a slice and when took a bite... It's hard to explain... It was sooo delicious! The crust was so thick and crunchy and the interior was so yummy fluffy with lots of holes... No doubt, Tartine's bread is excellent! The verdict: This place has many drawbacks including the long waiting line, the lack of seating possibility, and in my opinion the too big portions (I prefer to taste several small things rather than being full with one), but despite these, I would definitively go back because almost everything they have looks and the ones I tried tastes really good! On the West Coast, probably the best bakery!

The cakes and cookies are fab - I like the hazelnut meringues and biscotti especially, but I went there for a lunchtime sandwich, which was not good. 1. The bread was cut too thickly 2. the whole thing was drenched in oil, making it uneccesarily heavy and greasy. I was able to eat less than 1/3 of the sandwich and I felt quite queasy. 3. It was very expensive - $13 for a sandwich! My advice - stick to the sweet things and give the sandwiches a miss!

It's a good thing I don't live too close to this place .... it's a formidable opponent to my (already fragile) self-control! Any bakery that uses Valrhona chocolate in its Pain au Chocolat obviously takes its craft seriously .... an absolute winner in my books. Lose yourself in the warm, freshly baked morning buns, frangipane croissants and ham/cheese croissants .... gorgeously crisp on the outside, soft and buttery on the inside ..... Hold on, I need to wipe the pool of saliva off my keyboard.... It really is worth the wait to sample the pastries here, you can almost taste the love that went into making them!

I love their Lemon Cream Tart and Banana Cream Tart. ÊThe lemon cream tart is just a perfect blend of sourness and sweetness. ÊI'm generally a big fan of lemony stuff and this is the best lemon tart I've ever had. ÊThe lightly whipped cream on top of the lemon cream helped to dilute the sourness. ÊJust perfect. As for the banana cream tart, it's huge that i like it because I usually don't care for bananas. Êi hate the fruit and i steer clear from any banana drinks. ÊBut their banana cream tart is different and I love it: the banana cream isn't overpowering; there is a thin layer of chocolate that lines the inside of the tart (in between the tart and the banana cream) which makes a huge difference. ÊI'd definitely get it again. I didn't like their Frangipane Tart though. ÊI don't know what to make of it. ÊI didn't like the almond slices in it nor the pastry.

hands down Êmy favorite ptisserie in the city .I cant go there and not order a banana cream tart. The coffee is also brilliant- however make sure you order a double shot if you actually like your coffee to taste like coffee. the chocolate souffle cake is amazing also- made with scharffenberger chocolate

Tartine is so good, I don't even know if it is worthy of review! ÊThe only downside to this incredible bakery is that now, no other baked good compares (well maybe Arizmendi, but they're different). Clearly, I love Tartine - I'm a dessert, cake, baked-goods addict and it fulfills all of my needs! ÊWhen friends and family come to visit, a trip to Tartine is top priority. ÊIn fact, the only thing my dad wants to do in San Francisco when he's visiting from Wisconsin is eat morning buns at Tartine - go figure. I could go on, and on and on... but that would be boring so here's a list of my favorite things: Bread pudding - heaven (and potential heart attack - be careful!) - I recommend getting it when topped with bananas and chocolate (not a very frequent combo) Lemon tarte - the best lemon "thing" I've ever had - the lemon filling is to die for. ÊMy friend and I joke that it tastes incredibly light and airy so it must be good for us! Banana cream pie - mmmmm! Quiche - their quiche is probably the best quiche I've had. ÊIt's very creamy-tasting, but also feels pretty light. ÊI love the earthy flavors of the veggie quiche - I think they use thyme and sage. And for those who prefer something a little more healthy - the muesli - I occasionally get the muesli to counteract whatever other sweet I'm eating. ÊThe yogurt is plain and soupy - just like I like it - very European. ÊI love the coconut flakes and the apple that give it just a little sweetness. ÊI recommend pouring lots of honey on top! Enjoy - nothing you order will be bad!

I don't know how they did it, but the greatest asset this place has going for it is the incredible-never-ending-line outside. This is probably because of its high traffic location, and the incredibly small interior. ÊThe line is a self-perpetuating beast. ÊThere is a reason night clubs don't let you in even though they're empty... just to make it seem oh so cool. I caved to the peer pressure voice in my head. Ê It's hard to give this place an objective score. ÊThe baking is pretty good. ÊLots of butter and eggs make anything pretty good. ÊIs it all it's cracked up to be? The jury is still out on that. Ê I'm sure the city has many excellent bakeries that deserve our business but don't have the hype. ÊThat said, Tartine is a good place to impress out of town visitors ;-)

Stopped in here while visiting my BFF who insisted we must have dessert at this James Beard Award winning bakery. Ê I really wanted the soft gingerbread since I'm obsessed with all things of the ginger variety but instead, we ordered the chocolate hazelnut tarte and the banana cream tarte to share. the hazelnut tart was delicate with the perfect juxtaposition between salty and sweet. the real star imo was the banana cream tarte. sweet, creamy, light... you must try it when you're in the city or you simply have not lived. Êso decadent... Êi'm drooling just thinking about it!!! nsfd - not safe for dieters. ÊLOL.

We've had many things at Tartine and a few of our favorites are - meringue cake, morning buns, bread pudding, rochers, Êsandwiches, frangipane croissants, and banana pie. ÊEverything is very rich with loads of butter,and the portion sizes are generous for most items. ÊWe even made a special trip to get the fresh baked bread that comes out of the oven late in the afternoon, and that too was fantastic Ê- crusty crunchy on the outside and the inside has lots of air bubbles characteristic of nicely made artisan bread. I'd give them a five star for the food, however, they run out of many items at around noon, including those yummy morning buns and frangipane croissants, on the weekends. Since people make a special trek to the shop driving for over an hour to get there (like us), and the demand is so great, why can't they make enough of the best selling goodies!!

What's your mood, Tartine makes a yummy pastry for it. ÊIt's hard to find good savory pastries, but the olive cake and the croque misseur made with Humbolt Fog cheese are great to have along with your eclair or Caramel coated chocolate tart. ÊThe pastries are subtle and delicate with great texture (i.e.flaky to the person who just complained about crumbles). Ê I love everything about this place, except of course, the line out the door; it looks terrible, but I always make it through in pretty good time (i.e. it keeps moving). ÊI wouldn't go there for the coffee, but it's Mr. Espresso, pretty good.

The Frangipane (Almond) Croissant is the best ever! ÊIt's crispy on the outside, buttery and almondy on the inside and so soft. ÊIt's so much better than the one at Bouchon Bakery. ÊAnd order Frangipane anything, because the tart is just as good. The Banana Brioche Bread Pudding with strawberries is good too, although not as life-changing as the croissant. Croque Monsieur with Turkey, Gruyere and Seasonal Vegetable (we had asparagus) was nice, but we only ordered it because they were out of the ham (which was the most popular and probably most delicious.) ÊI loved the crusty bread and well, everything because who would've ever thought of putting asparagus on a sandwich! Cappucinos and lattes are nice and huge. ÊDon't skip that. Yes, the line is long, but there's a good reason. ÊDon't be like the people I always see that can't wait and leave and miss out on the best bakery ever! ÊThe line moves pretty quick.

Forget the Morning Bun that everyone raves about... yeah it's good, but it's not "roll your eyes into the back of your head and act like Meg Ryan from 'When Harry Met Sally' good." No, for that, you need to order the pain au jambon- Niman ranch ham with Gruyere cheese in a croissant. ÊThat is the kind of food that wars get fought over.

My Format: Price, Atmosphere, Selection (of products), Customer service, and Final thoughts. Price (5 Stars) Most of the treats in here are a little on the pricey side for what you would pay normally for them in a common bakery. But this is no common bakery and the treats are anything but. The price reflects the ingredients and craftsmanship put into them. $3-4 for something super sugary and highly fattening. Millions pay the same amount for Starbucks stuff, so why not these...? I never spend more tan $12 or so anytime I visit so it won't break your bank. Atmosphere (5 Stars) Always lively, inside and outside seating, a stone's throw away from Dolores Park. Staff is friendly and informative. Selection (5 Stars) Everything a bakery can make is made here. Pastries, cakes, cookies, fresh bread (made fresh at 5pm i hear, expect a long line) along with other stuff like coffee and dutch chocolate pudding. Customer Service (5 Stars) Friendly staff, always more than 2 people working cause of the busy nature of the place. Final Thoughts... This place keeps me coming back to S.F. time and time again. I stop here prob 75% of the time I go to S.F. The eclairs are divine and my favorite. Truly a landmark eatery that you should visit at least once. The only complaint I might have is the lines, but its just that good.

After all the great reviews I had to try it. ÊI had consumed a giant burrito for lunch (I couldn't help myself) so when ÊI got to Tartine I wasn't starving nor did I have a huge sweet tooth. ÊSo instead of the famous tarts I decided to get a sampling o some of their smaller desserts. I got the shortbread, biscotti, a lovely white puff looking item, a small chocolate cake type item and a cafe au lait. ÊAll were great and the perfect treat for a Sunday afternoon. ÊI can't wait to go back and sample more of the scrumptious desserts.

Tartine KILLS me. So glad I live on the east coast. For now. My perfect death would come while slouching on a chair outside Tartine, with a major LDL block in my aorta, a chunk of a custardy Tartine gougere lodged in my throat, and my fist squeezed around a macaroon. I feel that everyone would accept this more easily than if I died in any other way--- they'll expect this of me, it'll be easy to let me go because they'll know that death came to me as bliss overruled my biology. Nah but forruh. The staff is quick and efficient and the place is always bustling with San Francisco's most adorable young families. Unbeatable bakery, and they just put out a cookbook bursting with valuable secrets. Boyfriend just made their signature shortbread-- it brings tears of butter to my eyes.

I came here anticipating a huge line since this place is popular, but there were only 3 or 4 people in front of me. Good start! The tables inside were all occupied though, so I sat outside, which was refreshing since the weather was actually nice and sunny! Anyway, onto the important stuff. My mom, sisters and I had the... -Ham and cheese croissant.. best thing I ate there! No joke! It was THAT GOOD. The ham and cheese were high quality and the croissant was insanely good. Flaky and browned to perfection on the outside, buttery and soft on the inside. My explanation doesn't do it justice. You just have to have one and see for yourself! -Banana Cream Tart.. second best thing! The combination of banana, egg custard, chocolate, and that flaky crust is heavenly! -Fig tart.. REALLY good! The figs were perfectly ripe and sweet and I loved the crust on this one. It was a firmer crust, not so flaky, but broke more like a thin cookie. And the creme-style vanilla bean custard was light and complemented the fruit perfectly. -Bread pudding.. I've had better. I love bread pudding, so it was kind of disappointing that theirs wasn't better. -Morning bun.. I've never had a morning bun before, but if this is what they usually taste like then I want more!! Haha. It's like a cinnamon bun without all the nasty frosting. Instead, it's sprinkled with sugar and orange zest! Yuuummmmmm!!! I gave this place 4/5 because I've had better experiences at western-style standalone bakeries (especially at this price). From consistency to selection, this one is up there in the ranks, but the only thing I would return here for specifically is the ham and cheese croissant. Just my opinion!

and then the heavens opened up and sent down Tartine bakery, filled with all kinds of wonderful things that make me ignore the fact that a button popped off my velvet blazer and my jeans no longer button. Êthe open faced croque monsieur is an absolutely amazing Gruyre covered delight with a twist- sun dried tomatoes...you had me at ...sun...okay so that doesn't really work here but still it's so good you will go running back. i've had turkey and ham and i actually prefer the ham but if you bring me home a turkey one i won't smack you. and while the bread pudding with seasonal fruit was good, i have to admit that i was a little underwhelmed but i think it's more that everything else is soo amazing that bread pudding that's "just" good kind of fell flat for me...it was definitely a little more wet and eggier (i totes made up that word) than how i usually like my bread pudding...it was like someone put bread into flan....so not bad but not great..just good the real star of the show is the banana cream tart. i've had this twice and i have no shame digging into that bad boy and having cream all over my face. give it to me banana cream tart. i love it because it's so complex you have to be smart to eat it. the pastry crust is coated in dark chocolate then filled with bananas and sweet cream. it's then topped with shaved chocolate and powdered sugar. KILL.ME.NOW. i don't like fake banana flavored crap so I was a little weary when my friends brought this back...but my fears were quickly killed after one bite. the cream is just the right amount of sweet and there ain't no fake banana flavor here. it's an indescribable party in your mouth...well i guess that's a lie because i just wrote it...this cream tart must be related to charlie sheen because it's all kinds of winning

Ah the legendary Tartine. ÊFor my first visit, I made the mistake of coming late in the day, when only the rejected items remained. ÊAnd yet there was still a line! ÊHad a sad looking scone (which tasted like animal crackers), some coconut macaroons and a lemon cake, none of which were extraordinary. Returned for breakfast and a much improved experience. ÊSampled the almond croissant (wonderfully crispy, generously filled with rich almond paste), the morning bun (buttery and flaky), and the bread pudding (a bit disappointing as it was more of a custard). Ê Not the place I'd choose for a relaxing morning reading the newspaper - with its crowded tables, lines out the door, and general commotion. ÊFor strictly breakfast items (not the cakes or tarts) I'd also say that places like Thoroughbread are just as good for nearly half the price.

I've never had anything here I didn't love. Sandwiches (which are good sharing size), pastries, espresso, everything is great.

What a great way to start the day in SF. Worth the 20 min. bus ride + 15 min. wait in line. It was going off and it was a weekday at 9:30. All the tables were taken, including the outside ones. Patrons were finding any surface they could place a pastry on and lean up against to enjoy the spectacular morning selections. I was impressed with the variety of options, from bread pudding with fresh fruit to almond crossiants (what we shared this trip). The desserts they were bringing out looked amazing as well. They have several small 2-bite size dessert options for $0.75 (small commitment if unsure). The workers were helpful and seemed to enjoy their jobs. Oh, and the cafe au lait in a large bowel was totes tasty!

I have been hearing about Tartine's fantastic breads for years and decided to trot over to pick up a loaf. I chose the walnut bread and headed home with visions of toast with butter in my head. I got home, got out the toaster and sliced open the bread and....to my horror it had huge holes throughout. You couldn't put butter or jam on it without having a plate full of slosh. The flavor was mediocre. What a disappointment. All this for $8.75!/loaf. My sens is that either it was loaded with too much yeast to Êspeed up the rising process (which ruins the quality of the bread) or it wasn't allowed to rise twice to improve the quality of the bread with small compact holes. ÊOn the other hand, their croissants are, in my opinion, to die for.

I would have to agree with Sirina K. on this one. I had the Pain Au Chocolat, which was ok, not as good as France,ok! My Cappuccino was one of the best I ever had, 2 stars for that, but it's not your coffee. ÊI thought $10 for a coffee and a croissant, the staff would be a little more friendly and attentive. Of course, I was wrong. Every time I asked a question I got a response as if I was at Starbucks and I thought a tall was actually a large! So I wasn't up on the Tartine vernacular and serving procedures. ÊThey give you a sign to take to your table, but I didn't know that I had to wait in line, AGAIN! for my cappuccino and get attitude from not one Mission hipster, but two! I then had to get a glass of water in the friggin' kitchen, literally! When I asked for a glass of water the guy looked at me like I was a street person asking for a freebie. Here's the kicker: They ask you to bus your plates again in the kitchen, where both tubs were full to the gills with dirty dishes next to, yes, the water, where I had to serve myself, earlier.

You can't go through the Mission without seeing a long line wrap around the corner of Guerrero and 18th all because of this little bakery/cafe and for good reason. ÊEverything I've had here is phenomenal. ÊThe most recent item I had was a sandwich and boy are they pricey ($10+).

If you're trying to cut down on carbs, a bakery isn't the place to go. But if you are going to treat yourself, Tartine is incredible.

disregarding the long line and once-in-a-while moody and rude wait staff, their pastries are some of the best things ever baked! it gets crowded so you're lucky if u find a table. but if you're patient ppl are in and out of there. some outdoor seating too. its also down the street from delfina and bi-rite. amazing location if u ask me :) morning buns are must! but go before 2-3p ish otherwise its very likely they will run out. It does vary though, i went close to 4pm on a sunday once and they still had plenty. their gougere bun has gruyere cheese, pepper and other spices, most amazing savory pastry to ever exist! their other cakes and tarts are really delicious as well but can be a little overpriced (hazelnut tart) everyday around 5pm is when they release their fresh baked bread, but i have yet to go and try it out. next time!

Best bread I have ever had. ÊI am not going to elaborate, as there are numerous blog posts, newspaper/magazine articles and book on the bread. Ê I would dash up there some random early evenings just to grab a loaf of boule, drop by my favorite grocery store or farmer's market to grab heirloom tomatoes, butter or triple cream cheeses (Brillat Savarin or Delice de Bourgogne) and eat it fresh that night. ÊIf I have leftover I would make some soup or stew and dip this damn thing in. ÊOr being inspired by Zuni, I would roast a chicken and put slices of bread under the chicken when it is resting out of the oven to absorb drippings. Unfortunately they only have their heavenly bread in the evenings. ÊThey are out of the oven around 4:30 to 5. ÊThat is why I docked one star, especially that parking in Mission is so hard to find during that time. What am I supposed to do when I am craving the bread in the morning? ÊHunt for Anthony Bourdain's old pal, Adam Real-last-name-unknown? ÊIf they have the bread coming out fresh from the oven throughout the day, I would give this place 6 stars. Ê Oh, they have other goodies too, my favorites are the gougere, souffle cake, eclair and croissant (both regular and the frangipane version).

We met one early morning in the springtime...do you remember? I saw you looking at me....You, filled with chocolate. Me, waiting patiently to eat you. You were beautiful, so delicious looking. I had to have you. And then I did, along with about three other things (morning bun, banana cream tart to name a couple) from this place. After a carb induced coma in Dolores Park, I awoke with stars in my eyes. I look forward to the day we meet again.

When I first heard of Tartine from people in the 'hood, I thought there was no way this place would be that good. The line to get in, the attitude from other customers, the religous following it had from the foodies, it all turned me away for almost a year. Then one day, early, in the middle of the week when there was no line, I tried it. It was great! The food really was that good. I was absolutely shocked. There was a genuine reason all these people where willing to endure the "tartine gauntlet", to snack on some truly amazing food. ÊLove the food, but avoid it on the weekends when things are just too crazy. Addendum: How could I forget to mention the Tartine pick-up only location that is going in just down the street? For those of us who would rather grab some treats and head somewhere less cramped, help is coming soon.

This bakery is so good I moved to the neighborhood to be near it. I'm not kidding. Although my thighs are wishing we'd chosen a different neighborhood, my taste buds couldn't be happier. It's true the lines are long and a fair amount of jockeying for position, hovering, and patience is recquired to get a table. But one bite of a buttery ham-and-cheese crossaint hot from the oven washed down with some extra dark coffee and I've forgotten the lines and the crowds.

Yeah, yeah. ÊEveryone loves Tartine. ÊOr finds it woefully overhyped. ÊOr thinks the molasses-slow service, sidewalk-spanning lines, or (sometimes) snooty employees cancel out the sheer deliciousness of the product served. ÊI say, so the fuck what? ÊDon't go if you're in a hurry. I love their pumpkin tea cake, mini thyme-gruyere gougeres, and meusli with yogurt. ÊBut the fact that they're the only place in SF (as far as I know-and please, please, correct me if I'm wrong) that serves a sandwich with BROCCOLI RABE, sopressata, and fontina on it earns 'em five stars in my book. ÊWhich, incidentally, is a cloth-covered pea green notebook flecked with food stains from errant cauliflower florets and leaves of kale. On a recent visit, two of Êmy friends ordered the above sandwich while I opted for prosciutto, provolone, and arugula. ÊSomehow, only two sandwiches came to our table (we were all on separate tickets) and I was left waiting for 20 minutes. ÊUpon investigation, a member of the waitstaff emerged shortly to apologize and explain that my order had been lost in the shuffle. ÊAlready downing a piece of sando from my dining companion's plate, I said it wasn't a big deal. ÊWhen my food finally arrived, brought by another gracefully apologetic server, they gave me a full refund and offered me a free cookie. Ê See? ÊTartine is awesome.

Ê Beautiful decadent deserts that scream with delight, wonderful open faced sandwiches that can create a collision with all of your senses ( my favorite is the shitake mushroom with fromage blanc), lovely iced teas (hibiscus), gougeres, bread pudding, all those cakes, and cookies and sweets.

Luscious quiche, flaky pastries, delicious coffee and a long lineup of customers to match: Tartine is worth visiting, but come early and come hungry. The breakfast pastries are a hearty size, and baked freshly every morning. Be prepared to squish into a table between other noshing customers, but it's OK. Once you start eating, you'll forget everyone else is there. For breakfast pastries and coffee, or something more hearty (like a Croque Monsieur or sandwich), it's difficult to do much better. All their goods are baked fresh daily, and ingredients, including flour and eggs, are organic and local whenever possible. We arrived on Sunday morning at 9:00 a.m. for a 9:00 a.m. open. There were already about 50 people in line ahead of us. We ended up eating at around 9:30 after a rather chilly wait on the sidewalk of Guerrero St. ÊIf you want to be first in, come at least 20 minutes earlier than opening. Outside seating is also available.

this is the third time i went to Tartines. I went with some friends for a light dinner and small dessert. ÊAs usual, i was impressed by their amazing food. My friends ordered the sandwiches, which were hot and delicious. I was fortunate to have a sample of them. They told me thumbs up on the food. I had dessert before dinner. I order two meringue cookies that was light nougat and almond which was light to the mouth and very sweet with a strong taste of almonds. I also ordered a friad (spell check?) that i must admit was not as impressive as the meringue cookies. But it was still very good. For the dinner part i had a open faced sandwich with spicy turkey. The only downside to this was they overcooked it, but they admitted to this and apologized by giving me their pudding for free. Both were still good, especially the pudding. I think it was because it was free. That is one of the main things i like about Tartines. It is a very down to earth place and they always have given me special discounts. I love that place not only for its excellent food but also it's homey service. It really makes for a great meal and I always try to turn people on to the amazing place that is Tartines.

I started going two wks after they opened and since then I have converted many many people to this mecca.....NYT named it best bakery in the USA in 2007.

PLUS PLUS when SoCal lack of good food places parents come into town, we hit it big time....So it's not just me making it up that this place is the BOMB.

Tartine is great but they seriously do not know when and where to stop! they overload everything, so you feel as if your sandwich is just saturated fat over saturated fat over saturated fat inside some carb! I HATE how I feel after I eat it, as if I consumed two pounds of butter marinated in heavy cream! I love most of their desserts, and their sandwiches have great potential if they simplify them a bit! I wish they would stop overdoing it! I love their clairs ...Their coffee is great, and I love their espresso. Their staff is efficient, and for the most part friendly.

Macaroon- dry. Don't buy it. Banana Creme Tart- delicious if eaten correctly. I didn't like my first bite because I only scooped the upper portion and got a mouthful of frothy cream. But after I was able to cut my fork through the tough crust (use a metal fork because my plastic one broke), the combination of the cream plus a banana piece plus the crunchy, chocolaty crust was delightful. Open wide! I really wish I could return to try the bread pudding. A couple next to me was eating it. Loudly. And complimenting every bite.

Maybe it's played-out to say this, but I LOVE Tartine. ÊI came here when I was younger, unaware where I was, but loving the pastry. ÊThen I had an internship at a production company, and they asked me to pick up morning buns. Ê When I got to Tartine, the line was out the door, but I waited and got myself an extremely hot, gooey, orangey morning bun and it was definitely worth the wait. Now that I work in the Mission, I have to stop myself from coming here every day-- it's slightly expensive. ÊStill, I've tried a good portion of the menu, and these are my recommendations: -morning bun, obviously -croissant (really perfect) -cocoa nib meringues -sandwiches are amazing (if you don't like picked things, beware of the innocent looking side carrot), I had an olive tapenade/ cheese sandwich here that was pretty tasty I didn't really enjoy the bread pudding because it was too sweet for me, but most things are too sweet for me. ÊI've never bought a cake here, so I don't know about that, but I'm sure they're great. coming here is always a pleasure

I had read so many great things about this place and it is on 7x7's 100-Places-To-Eat-In-SF so why not?!? Apparently the bread is worth the wait, and wait we did. The line was out the door and it only got longer. I then realized that the fresh bread we wanted wasn't going to be available until after 5 pm. Quick look at the watch - 4:40! Would the bread be ready in time before we got to the register?? Oh, it was a nail biter but we made it and piping hot from the oven, nearly burning my hubby's arm and side. We also ordered the bread pudding and eclair. The bread pudding was delicious. Rich and not too sweet topped with fresh berries. You could taste the sweetened condensed milk (at least that's what I got out of it). The eclair was eh, as I think the pastry got soggy from the watery custard. The custard had good flavor - light, full of vanilla beans and not too sweet. If only the pastry had been a bit crispier, it would have been perfect. 1-star deduction for parking. It is easier if you park a couple blocks away and walk there. I also didn't see a sign for the place but we figured it out since there were large groups of people milling around out front. They should also work on their customer service. The cashier looked like she really didn't want to be there (no smile or anything) and was half baked. Not to mention in the middle of our transaction, no words, just turned around and left us there. Plus, she was interrupted 3 times by colleagues, asking for ice, etc (weren't there other people they could ask? like ones who weren't in the middle of helping customers).

I have to agree with everyone here. The croissants at Tartine are pretty damn delicioso! I used to live around the corner from Tartine and made my way through their door only a handful of times. The Lemon Cream Tart was pretty amazing. Top with unsweetened cream to cut the sweetness from the lemon custard. The Devil's Food Cake is well, how do I explain? Valrhona dark-chocolate butter cake, layered with caramel and chocolate ganache? I love you. My only negative thought: their hot pressed sandwiches are yummy but extremely, extremely greasy and floating in butter. But minus that, all the sandwich combinations are delectable.

The one positive thing about being furloughed one day a month - I get to go to Tartine during the week in the mornings when it's not quite so busy! Ê(And I do make an effort to do this!) ÊI have a hard time deciding what to get and am rarely able to hold back on just ordering one thing. I have to get a morning bun...if not to eat at that moment, to eat when I get home or even the next day. (It's almost as good the next day if I warm it up properly - add a little moisture & warm it low in the toaster oven.) The seasonal bread pudding is super yummy. ÊIt's on the softer side. I'm not a huge fan of apple skin in my sweet/baked goods, but it's still pretty good. Berries and peaches are the best though. For me, the gougeres are almost as good as the morning buns. They're warm, cheesy, peppery - slightly creamy in the middle. yum. YUM. Before I had one, I saw Elisabeth Prueitt make her quiche on Martha Stewart. (I don't regulary watch it, but happened to see that she was on & did see it!) She made it look so easy & quick, but obviously delicious. ÊThe quiche is good. Again, it's on the softer, creamier side (like a good quiche should be), and oh-so-tasty. I've tried a couple of cakes and various outings and a few cookies here and there. I have nothing bad to say about any of their food whatsoever. The line might look long, but they know what they're doing and the line moves quickly. (Well, it can only go so quick - which is why i like my furlough day.) My mouth is watering just thinking of all of the goodies at Tartine.

I drove around for an hour to find this place because of the rave reviews. ÊI left after ordering 1 of each: morning bun, frangipane croissant, eclair, and cappuccino. In a word, uninspired. ÊThe morning bun and eclair were quite good. ÊThe eclair especially so. ÊThe croissant was huge and looked beautiful, but was all flake and no softness, no chew to it at all. ÊIt literally fell apart at the touch through and through. ÊThe cappuccino was bitter and why when there are 6 customers waiting for their coffee is there only one barista who is apparently taking her hollygolightly time? Êi get that it's quaint and all, but honestly, the shop is tiny, there isn't a lot of room for customers to be piling up while the single barista is lackadaisically preening. Ê Not to mention that I spent $17 for three pastries and a coffee. ÊFor my money, the croissants are cheaper and much better at Boulange. ÊAnd I need to find a place that will make a pecan sticky bun worthy of crying over. ÊThe Tartine morning bun is good, but it's got this distracting orange flavor to it and no pecans. And the boulange sticky bun is terrible. ÊIf you're in LA and want a fantastic sticky bun, go to Europane in Pasadena. ÊTheir's make me cry with serious happiness.

I don't mean to be a Debby Downer, but this place just isn't worth the wait. After living around the corner for several months and always seeing lines spewing out along Guerrero, one Sunday morning my boyfriend and I woke up early to try Tartine. About $17 later, we strolled to Dolores Park to enjoy our chocolate croissant, bread pudding and museli with a cup of coffee in hand. Our favorite pick was the chocolate croissant, because, let's be honest, who doesn't love something that's pure butter and and chocolate. The flakes melted in my mouth. Definitely stick to the croissants here. We found the bread pudding to be much too custardy and bland. The museli to be down right unappetizing, but shame on us for ordering museli at a bakery. Our second and last visit was to pick up some tarts to celebrate a friend's birthday who doesn't consume dairy products. After waiting in line and asking what tarts they had that didn't have dairy products (butter was okay), the helper laughed at us and said, nothing, this is a bakery. How rude!!! Lucky for us Bi-Rite was half a block away and was able to both meet our request and pleasantly serve us. I won't be going out of my way to visit Tartine in the future.

Lots of visual eye candy, stainless kitchen hardware and not enough substance. Does not even come close to Bake Sale Betty, ÊFanny's, Êor the Cheese Board. Lenox Mass. training is not the Berkeley Gourmet Ghetto. The morning buns are far superior at La Farine, the croissants are served without jam and butter (lame) and I make better cafe au lait at home with our espresso machine. My home made pizza with dough from Trader Joe's is far superior to their a.m. croque monsieur. Considering that it is in the Mission, and there are not many other places like lt there, I guess it is acceptable to take your parents to or out of towners Ê( a place like Fishermen's Wharf).

This is the best bread you will find in the city. Only served from 5 PM until they are all out, it is best to call them ahead of time to get an advanced order and just pick it up right at 5. Some of their bread (and only $7 for a loaf), some cheese and wine from the bi-rite market next door, and you have San Francisco on a platter. I have only had the coconut cream tart and it was fantastic. I will be looking forward to getting the banana cream tart with shaved chocolate on the top. TIP: be sure you have time to wait in line on the weekends. The line can be up to 30 minutes Also the prosciutto and provolone pressed sandwich with their bread is the best sandwich you'll find in the city. A must place to eat with friends/visiting relatives!!!

When I'm in the city visiting my friends, I always make sure to grab some of their fantastic bread for home. Make sure to get there asap as they run out very fast! I also make sure to grab some chocolate croissants..the best I've had in a while. They're super fluffy with just the right amount of chocolate..a marriage of chocolate and croissant..what's better than that? Their bread pudding is also divine. As with any bakery out there..make sure to get there way before closing time..preferably in the morning when they are fresh and right out of the oven! I'll be back, Tartine!!

wow! this place is great...got there at 5pm for some fresh bread, cookies and choc cake. Bread = 5 stars choc chip cookie = 3.5 stars, nothing special just a good cookie. Choc cake = 5 stars, really well made, and great taste without being too sweet. Only down side was the wait...about 15-20 mins with the line going outside and down the street! but it was worth it!

There is no way to avoid redundancy when discussing Tartine. Amazing. Delicious. Orgasmic? Yep, all of the above. I went here with a big group and happened to be one of two people watching over the food for seven while everyone gathered water, forks, etc. So there we were standing at the bar table by the window with two cranberry pear bread puddings, a mushroom and sundried tomato croque monsieur, a few morning buns, croissants and of course, coffee for me. People in line outside were clearly staring at us and we thought it was just because the food looked THAT good (it did) and then we realized they thought it was all just for us two girls. I wish it was. We did probably end up trying a bit of everything and I have to say my favorite thing are the morning buns. So fresh, flaky and soft on the inside these buns are simple perfection. Simple perfection is also descriptive of Tartine itself. The only complaint is a lack of seating and the long line, but as we found waiting in line and eating while standing can be pretty entertaining for everyone.

Came here with some friends and we all ordered different pressed sandwiches, all of which were fantastic. I also couldn't help myself in buying $20-30 worth of baked goodies for the road and to take back and share. Everything I ordered was tasty and delicious! The only downside is that it reminds me of a more expensive version of Porto's (one of my favorite places to go, but unfortunately located in LA).

Joining the chorus of praise- the bread is amazing. It's just as bread should be, tough and crunchy on the outside to protect the fluffy and slightly moist innards... Sesame pairs nicely with avocado and tahini and the olive loaf is amazing with a nice cold-pressed olive oil. The walnut is the most flexible and can be used with sweet or savory toppings. You are going to be happy so long as you do not waste your day on a country loaf (sorry, Dan). Also, since the bread is dreadful on its second day (rather, not the bliss it was when it was fresh), I recommend ordering a half-loaf. YES, you can do that- so very nice. I've heard the sandwiches are too greasy, the pastries are over the top and the coffee has only been served to me hot ONE TIME. My five stars Êgo to the bread alone.

You'd figure a bakery that is Êknown for their delicious croissants would be capable of making an eatable sandwich, Tartine Bakery is definitely not one of them. I got in a 15-20 minute line hoping to get a sandwich that was meaty and cheesy while my GF was going to order their infamous croissants that she saw on the food network. I picked up a menu when I got near the front line and saw that their panini sandwiches were $15 bucks. I'd figure there was no backing out since we had waited and went ahead and treated myself out considering it was my birthday weekend. 15 minutes later my turnkey sandwich came out and was black and burnt. I took a few bites and thought to myself, "WTF is this", the sandwich was so burnt and hard it almost broke my tooth off. Because It was 1pm and hadn't eaten all day, i went ahead and finished a third of the sandwich until my stomach wasn't growling anymore. In the end, the roof of my mouth was shredded and cut and my jaw was sore. In addition, the sandwich could have used more cheese and a non-deli type of meat. This is another example of a joint being highly popular just because it was featured on the food network. I'm definitely not returning. BTW, my GF said that the croissants were burnt as well!

Tried the banana cream tart based on the other reviews... OH DOUBLE GEE GOOD! Definitely a must! I also tried the lemon tart which was too much for one sitting, so stick with the banana. Also had a sandwich there... can't think of it bc it was eclipsed by the banana creme tart, oh yeah I had the coque monsieur which isn't quite like a french coque monsieur but whatever. that was aiite. Basically you go for the banana creme tart... even if you're not a fan of bananas you still go for the banana. capiche!

Tartine bakery is insane. The bavarian passion fruit cake is legendarily good. The croissants are so buttery, flaky and delicious. The coffee bar inside is very good as well.

Expectation is the killer to everything. This place is honestly not bad without the excessive hype, but with all the expectation I had, it was just okay. I ordered the mushroom croque monsieur and it was pretty decent. The melted cheese on the bread and the herbs were two of my favorite parts, but the bread was really hard to work with because it was so hard. I also tried the croissant, the mexican wedding pastry, as well as the quiche. The croissant was very crispy and buttery, but i wouldn't say it was amazing (i expected to be aaalot better). The quiche was too heavy for me because of the cream and egg in it. All in all, good place to have breakfast if you are not in a hurry (never seen this place without a line out of the door, I waited for 30 minutes and I think that's considered pretty short) and have some spare money on you (not your cheap neighborhood bakery!).

2286 reviews so far -- so basically, every bay area yelper has reviewed this place? guess i should too. on the sunday mornings that i spend in SF, i go to cornerstone church, which is about 2-3 blocks away. the fact that it is SO close to tartine bakery really provides some incentive for me to wake up and get myself to church. all the other reviews are right. the banana cream tart and lemon tart really are that delicious and so worth the $12.75 i spend when i buy both at once. the banana tart actually has chunks of banana in it too. try them!! oh, and the morning bun's pretty good too.

OFFICIAL RESTRAINING ORDER This document hereby states the aforementioned yelper is no longer allowed within *100* yards of this eating establishment after a prolonged history of unwanted and untoward behavior directed at this bakery that can only be described as somewhere between obsessive and perverted. ÊYelper agrees to participate in a class titled "Healthy Relationships: What is and is not stalking according to California law." ÊFurthermore, Yelper agrees to close his Etsy page selling voodoo likenesses of their signature products including the Morning Bun and ham/cheese croissants. ÊIn exchange, bakery agrees to try and make their baked goods less tantalizing and tempting, especially in the early hours of morning when the aromas of butter and sugar permeate the thick SF coastal fog. ÊAlso, bakery agrees to affix a warning label to every baked good sold on the premises, stating "WARNING: This baked good has been known to cause unpredictable and erratic behavior in otherwise normally-functioning humans. ÊSide effects include daydreaming about the infinite layers of buttery crumb of a warm croissant, and an inability to stop muttering words like "gooey" and "sweet" and "I want this now or I will cut you." Ê Yelper agrees that if restraining order is violated, punishment will be to eat a Costco muffin.

I had a few hours to spare before my flight out of SF and i knew i had to visit one more place (I am always on a tight schedule when i visit SF-since there are so many friends and places i miss there). I dragged my friends on a rainy sunday around 3:00 who could probably care less about a french bakery i had heard of in a foodie magazine. We stood in line, in the drizzle, for 30 min. Finally time to order: I got the chocolate hazelnut tart although i was looking forward to the croissant filled with chocolate but they were all out, and I goat cheese on walnut bread sandwhich, friend #1 got bread pudding, and friend #2 got shortbread cookie. The tart was lovely...smooth chocolate-y goodness with a hint of hazelnut. The sandwich was not worth $10-- i mean the bread was pretty good and the goat cheese was standard but thats all there was. I didn't care for the bread pudding, it was rather cold and had big slices of apples on top an lacked flavor. The shortbread was nothing special. oh if you stand in line for the restroom you get to see them take out the fresh bread from the oven...looked heavenly. i don't know if i would make way to the mission just for tartine again..but if i were in the area i would definitely drop in.

There's something about Tartine that doesn't quite do it for me, food-wise. ÊThere are some things I love, and some things that jut don't hit the spot. As far as the ambiance and the staff, both are thumbs down. ÊThe place is always crowded, it's poorly laid out, the wait in line is incredibly long even though they usually have two people serving and at least one person ringing up. ÊThis is a neighborhood place, but if they have regular customers I wouldn't be able to tell, because the staff never acts like they know the customers (or want to). At the end of this review I'll given an example of the staff attitude. The Good: Scharffen Berger chocolate pudding Ê(I think they switched to Valhrona but it's still divine). bread pudding with fruit - Êthe portions are massive. ÊSeriously, if you're on a budget, get this. ÊIt'll tide you over for the whole day. ÊIt's very eggy pudding; Êmoist, almost wet, and the fruit is always fresh. ÊI don't think tart fruit and eggy bread pudding necessarily are the best combination, especially when the fruit is al dente and the pudding is mushy, but the fruit is so good, and the pudding is so good, it doesn't matter. ÊYou will not really taste the bread chunks - the pudding is very moist, so the bread kind of dissolves. ÊSort of the texture of white bread without the crusts, so not chewy at all. morning buns - huge, rich, chewy, sticky. Êperfect texture. ÊProbably a thousand calories each but who cares? all of their baked breads are amazing - but then, you can barely walk a block in San Francisco without finding amazing artisanal breads, so that's not a reason to go across town to Tartine. The Not-So-Good: quiche - good custard base, but the crust is so saturated with butter (or whtaver they use) that it is extremely greasy the banana cream tart - this is in a pastry shell lined with chocolate, then a banana custard with huge chunks of banana, topped with whipped cream. ÊThe pastry shell is so hard you could crack a tooth. Êthe custard is bland, and the chunks of banana are huge. ÊIt's like trying to eat an extremely hard cookie while eating a banana straight out of the peel. ÊThe jawbreaker + mush + lack of flavor just doesn't do it for me. ÊAnd they're expensive, about $6.50 each The ham and cheese croissants are almost disgusting - way too rich, and salty. Many of their savory items have so much butter (or whatever it is) in them that they are overly greasy. ditto for many of their pastries. Êtheir croissants are massive but just too rich. ÊAnd by rich I mean greasy. ÊI have to think if they used a little less butter, their food might taste better and be less unhealthy. So, an example of the staff attitude: ÊToday I went in, got some stuff to go then went back to use the bathroom. ÊIt's in the back of the cafe... in an awkward location, by the bussing racks, near the spiral staircase that goes upstairs... There was someone in the bathroom and two other people plus a group of three friends waiting to use it so there was quite a crowd. ÊI tried to stand out of the way but then some staffer came along and shoved a stainless steel cart into my butt to get past me and go up the spiral staircase (which I hadn't even noticed). ÊMind you, the cart was what was in the way, not me! ÊSo I moved it to a spot where it wasn't blocking the staircase and two seconds later someone came along and moved it back where it had been! ÊAnyway after a seven minute wait, I was like third in line to use the bathroom and Little Miss Thang comes along from the cash register where she had been ringing people up and tells me to move, that "the line is over there" Êpointing to some random stretch of hallway that looks exactly like the random stretch of hallway that I am standing in. ÊAnd she said it in a tone that implied I should have known that. ÊI said, half joking "you should put a line on the floor so people will know" and she replied, in all seriousness, somewhat impatiently, "that's where the bakers walk" (again in a "you should know that" tone). ÊI said coldly "I don't come here often enough to be familiar with the walking patterns of your bakers" and she went off in a huff. ÊMind you, after I moved at her direction, I kept having staff push past me, so it appears she just made up "this is where people waiting for the bathroom are supposed to stand" (I mean, what are the odds that they had a staff meeting about it and decided on some imaginary patch of floor where people were supposed to wait for the bathroom?). ÊMoral of story - they have staffers who go out of their way to put down customers. ÊAnd by the way? where I started out was *less* trafficked than where she put me. ÊAfter I moved I not only had staffers brushing past me, I had customers with dirty dishes trying to buss them.

I get what reviewers are saying about the hype and here is what I think the deal with the mixed reviews on this place is: There are a few items in the pastry case that are "meh". ÊIf you happen to order these, you will be let down - particularly if you heard the mouth-orgasm-pastry-lust reviews from friends or online. ÊThis is what happened to me the first time I went. ÊI enjoyed everything fully but was not overwhelmed. Then I went back and tried something I normally would not have picked first - the frangipane tart. ÊThat thing blew me away hard...I worked in a french bakery for years in college and I can be a baked goods snob...but this thing was completely perfect. So, despite the "meh" level coconut cake and yummy but not mind blowing banana cream pie, this place gets 5 stars because there are few things that are so perfectly made that makes up for anything else that they have ever or will ever do. Also, to be clear, even the worst thing in the place gets 3.75 stars in my opinion.

They had a 4 piece orchestra band on a Thursday evening...that was cool! I think their sweet stuff maybe better than some of the savory. The keish was really heavy. The coconut macaroons were the best I ever had because its crispy on the outside with the toasted coconut and soft on the inside. I can't wait to try their coconut passion fruit cake that a lot of people seemed to have. They give generous slices of everything. I also want to try the open faced sandwiches that looked good. On a nice day, the outside seating would be fun!

I tried a few different things here- the Coconut Passion Fruit Cake, Croque Monsier with turkey, and the Soppressata sandwich. All were good, but none were amazing.

I've walked by here several times afterhours, and invariably someone else in the walking party raves about each and every bit of heaven he or she has had here. ÊSo last week I stood in the line. ÊThe event: driving up to Tahoe for a weekend at friend's grandparents' cabin on the lake, and since have always been taught it is polite to bring something delectable as an invitee, I'd hit on the perfect solution. What I forgot was to bring was a cooler. ÊThis was problematic because many of the cakes/pies/pastries have the lifespan of their ingredients outside climate controlled conditions, the a/c in my car is currently busted, and passing through Sacramento would be like a thousand degrees hot. ÊAfter the very nice people in front of me in line lamented re the perishablity of bread pudding, the very nice woman behind the counter suggested the cookies, and I ended up getting an assortment of five of every cookie they had. ÊWonderful idea. ÊUpon presenting the brown cardboard box with the silver Tartine sticker, eyes lit up and we had grandparents getting powdered sugar all over their faces as they dove for cookies. ÊCan't beat happy people and beautiful nature. Also, since the wonderful experience with the cookies, I went back yesterday to try some of those perishables which were denied to me earlier. ÊI got the hazelnut chocolate tart, the seasonal bread pudding, and a coffee, and we took our goods and biodegradable utensils over to Dolores Park to enjoy the sugar in the sun. Ê I can't wait to return.

Tartine hardly needs my vote -- but it's the principle!! Their fresh baked ham and cheese croissants, their bread pudding, their coffee -- ALL to die for! GO GO GO.

I am almost feel silly writing the review, because a) most everyone knows how amazing it is already Êb) I would hate for one more person to be in line in front of me! Ê My favorites that I've tried thus far are: the ham and cheese croissant, the almond frangapaine croissant is unbelievable and other favorites are the morning bun and bread pudding. The chances of finding either a table or parking are not good, but if you plan for the extra time to stand in line, it's worth the wait. Their coffee (Mr. Espresso) is also solid.

I am a very particular about bakeries, and it doesn't get much better than this. Yea, the line is long just about any day of the week (except last Wednesday at 9:30 a.m. when I was waited on within 2 minutes...), but I always need the long wait to decide which of the heavenly treats I want. My faves: the lemon bars are luscious, tart, sweet, and incredible. The bread pudding hearty, so fruity and very satisfying. And my most recent find is the devil's food cake. Not sure if there is more cake or fudge filling. It's not a subtle cake. Kind of goes right to your veins. ÊYou can't miss with this place, and you can watch the bakers through the large window from the street. There's a great neighborhood vibe too.

I like how the employes are chill and not in your face and fake like other places. Being "real" is important to running a business not "fakeness".

Honestly, hands down the BEST Bakery I have been to. I went about 3 years ago on a girls trip up the coast. My cousin introduced us to TARTINE. We went for lunch, then back for dessert that evening and back for breakfast the next morning. ÊI tried to save my leftovers but it didn't last the 6 hour trip home:( I called my husband at home and told them they had a cookbook. He ordered it for me off of Amazon for Christmas. I kid you not, tastes just like the real thing. Everytime I make something from it people love it. If you have lunch or breakfast or dessert at just one place in San Francisco go HERE.

The day you go to Tartine is the day you pretend you are not a vegan. Well that is if you are me. There is no way to escape butter, eggs, and cream in these delectable delights. I personally adore the coconut tart. It made me nearly fall over. The coffee was excellent as well. The staff was helpful and friendly. For a city as bustling as San Francisco, I was impressed with Tartine overall. There is no way to overshadow the quality of this bakery.

OMG! that line was out he door no matter what time of day it is. My favorite is the 'cake aux olives' and the crossiants. I don't care if the prices are high I love the ambiance and the food. Service is fine and you have to try the bread that comes out at 5pm a taste of Paris!!!

There isn't much here about the sandwiches, but the mushroom crouqe monsieur I had was one of the best sandwiches I've ever eaten. ÊMaybe it really was the best.... We didn't wait in line very long and ordered three different sandwiches. ÊEach one was amazing. ÊWe took our food to Dolores park, spread out our blanket, and had a wonderful feast/picnic. ÊBTW, the park is a great reason to be in the neighborhood and shouldn't be missed. ÊMake the effort to climb up the hill for outstanding views. The pickled carrot that came with the sandwich was a real treat too. ÊWhen I'm in SF, this will be a for-sure stop. Ê ÊMaybe next time I'll try a dessert.

First off, I absolutely adore this bakery and cannot rave about it more. The chocolate cake is to die for and so utterly rich and decadent that more than likely, you have to share it with a friend. The morning buns are flakely and delicious and have the perfect balance between pastry and cinnamon sugar topping. I also had the ham and cheese panini for lunch, but unfortunately wish that I had opted out of the dijon mustard or at least asked for less of it. It was so overpowering that the sandwich was no longer tasty. Tartine is well worth the trek for me to the mission but I only go there so often due to the sky high prices.

I think, and have thought for years and years, that Tartine was one of the most delicious and beautiful little bakeries around. ÊI still do. ÊHalf a block away you can smell the butter and yeast and sugar; an intoxicating aroma that pretty much sums the place up. ÊAs a carb and sugar junkie who tries to limit my refined carb and sugar intake- this place is deadly. ÊActually, that whole stretch of 18th is deadly (Delfine, Pizzeria Delfina, Bi Rite, Creamery...) Their sandwiches and very nice. ÊEspecially their croque monsieur and madame. ÊThe one without meat, with mushrooms, is so well done. ÊIt used to come with little pickled carrots. ÊSometimes I would get the endive salad with it which was very crisp and refreshing and lemony. Their coffee is decent. ÊTheir desserts, like their bread, are perfection. ÊTry the eclair. ÊOr the lemon tart. ÊOn occasion I've thought that their bread pudding needed some work. ÊBut otherwise everything I've ever had has been lovely. ÊIt is a bit pricier than what you may expect if you don't live in SF ie sticker shock...I've at times grabbed some food and sweets to go and dropped $20 to $40 before I'd realized what had happened. ÊBut worth every life-shortening penny...

Strolled in on a Tuesday afternoon and I was surprised to see there was still a morning bun left for me! ÊI've heard so much about it, I eagerly snapped it up. ÊDefinitely yummy with it's orange cinnamon goodness, but I have to admit that I like the morning buns at La Farine in Oakland a little better. ÊHowever, the pastry that I can't get enough of is the banana cream tart! ÊRich chocolate, creamy banana... Êmmm...

Oh my goodness. ÊThis place seriously has the most amazing pastries I've ever had. ÊTake your choice, you can't go wrong. ÊThere is always a line, always. But of all the lines you will wait in, this one is so worth it! And it is tiny and cramped and usually crazy busy and hectic feeling, but all this is worth it, seriously. I have been there two times and neither time have I gotten to eat in the actual restaurant, but I cannot wait to go back. ÊTry one savory and one sweet. ÊTwo amazing choices are the ham and cheese croissant (buttery and tasty and melty!) and the morning bun (buttery and gooey and sweet and chewy)! The pain au chocolat is also incredible!

Tartine! I dream of your croissants and your lattes in bowls. Seriously, the croissants are French-grandma-flaky-golden perfection. The open-face sandwiches looked similarly epic (thick-cut country bread and what looked like lots of hot, golden-brown, melty cheese seemed to be the theme of these) although they were completely out by the time I arrived to the counter. There's also a little coffee bar inside that sells Blue Bottle and, unlike most oversubscribed Blue Bottle stores themselves, actually makes a delicious, hot, foamy latte. We came to Tartine following the SF half-marathon on a busy Sunday and waited in line for about a half hour before ordering. However, something about a long wait for buttery breakfast pastries and caffeine makes San Franciscans more than a little cranky, and we felt so pressured to order and immediately leave that we pointed at a few pastries at random and ran out the door to a bench in Dolores Park as quickly as we could. Although the aforementioned plain croissant and the pain au chocolat were delightful, the gougere (a big fluff of pastry filled with gruyere, then salted and peppered) and the bread pudding (lushly covered with apricots and blackberries) didn't quite live up. Perhaps the gougere would be better warmed, and the bread pudding better when immediately served. If Tartine were a neighborhood bakery in which I could stop by and grab a croissant and coffee on my way to work, or sit down to savor them with a good book, I'd petition Yelp to give it more than five stars. However, I'm deterred by the rushed atmosphere, the customary out-the-door line, the cramped seating, the hipster waitstaff...but I suppose you can't quite expect less from a neighborhood gem in SF.

After reading the numerous amazing reviews and being taunted by the over 900 pictures of deliciousness posted by Tartine fans, this was a must stop on our recent adventure to San Francisco. Once inside Tartine we selected bread pudding(next time I'll pass, too eggy for me), macaroons, Coconut Passion Fruit Cake(I'm determined to make this my future Wedding cake), Bavarian berry cake(delicious and quickly devoured), and completely missed the banana cream tart(which was one of the items I specifically went for). ÊOh well, there's always next time. Goodies in hand and we were off to feast at Mission Delores Park just around the corner. ÊWhat a great view and the place where my partner of 10 years decided to propose! ÊI definitely want the Coconut Passion Fruit Cake for my wedding cake. ÊYUM! Couldn't have asked for a better moment, fantastic views, scrumptious yummies from Tartine and now a beautiful ring Ê:)

Tartine Bakery is my BUTTER HEAVEN. I come to San Francisco just to get a taste of their decadent, flaky, Morning Buns glazed with a deliciously sweet orange glaze. Other must haves are almond, chocolate, and regular croissants. Those things are the most outrageously big croissants ever! They should be outlawed for being oh-so addictive and good. And let's not forget their bread. By far the best bread. Tartine has perfected the art of making bread. The bread is crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside and immediately when you take your first bite and you hear that satisfying "crunch" you know that can only mean one thing: it's Tartine bread. Although I hate the Tartine lines, it is always worth the wait in the end.

Tartine is good, but way overrated. ÊEverything tastes pretty good, but they use a lot of butter and egg in everything. ÊThe line usually moves pretty fast, even if it does go out on the street.

Saw this bakery featured on a tv show the week before my California vacation, and after seeing the host talking about their pan au chocolat with a lusty passion that made me almost cry, put it at the top of my list of places to visit. ÊWe were able to park on the street a couple of blocks away which was great. ÊSmall quaint bakery/sandwich place with a small bar as well. ÊThe place was packed, and seating is definitely limited, though outdoor seating provides a great spectacle of downtown frisco! ÊI, of course, had the pan and a glass of white Bordeaux. ÊMy Êcousin had the banana cream and a tall glass of ice cold milk. ÊI just couldn't believe how awesome and perfect that croissant was! ÊI had saved my "hungry's" All day for this and savored every flaky and perfectly chocolatey bite. ÊThe croissant was made from real whole ingredients and the flavor showed. Not greasy, not dry. ÊThe banana cream tart was light and exactly what one would satiate those banana cream cravings with and be in banana cream nirvana afterward, no regrets. ÊIt comes down to ingredients with these kinds if things. ÊTartine seems to take no short cuts. To sum it up? ÊGO!!!!

ÊI was utterly disappointed that they were not making the almond croissant but next time im in san fran its first on my list. ÊThe coconut cream pie was great, Puffed cheese Pastry one wasnt my favorite and I wouldnt get that again considering all their other choices, chocolate croissant is good but 2nd to the ham and cheese.

The wait? ÊHorrible. ÊFinding a table? ÊRequires patient hawking experience. ÊThe food? ÊTasty. ÊBut the best thing EVER? ÊI think not. Luckily, the lines actually move. ÊBTW owners of Tartine, those benches lining the place is useless. ÊI wish I could sit out there to eat my food but then I would be blocking the line. ÊGuess the ones in line can sit for a few minutes while waiting.. The Yum: (mind me, coming from a person that doesn't have much of a sweet tooth) *regular croissant- crispy crust with layered, buttery and flaky interior; Êsharable size *ham & cheese croissant: more moist than other croissants they offer. Êpicture the regular croissant with a extra dose of flavor from the melted cheese and ham; ask for it heated..it is even better that way! *frangipane croissant- my fave (although received mine slightly darker, a little burnt, than preffered). Êbeautiful almond filling in the center and slivers of almond on top. *bread pudding: good but not the best thing ever; sometimes they add too much fruit though..and I prefer more carbs than fruit served in my bread pudding *croque monsieur- the first time I had this, it was heated and way too hard- far past crunchy! Êabout to cut my gum status...not good. Êi just gave it another chance and ordered the ham and sun dried tomato and it was not heated again. ÊThis time, it was perfectly crisp. *spicy turkey sandwich- definitely not my fave..the broccoli rabe pesto with the spicy turkey was definitely overpowering for me..leaving an aftertaste in my mouth.

Also stopped by here on name recognition alone...after Pizzeria Delfina, which is another review for another day (http://www.yelp.com/userÉ). The goods: - Was a bit coughy so got the $3 White Peony white tea and added a little honey for a really fragrant and clean taste drink. It comes in a little cup and saucer - along with the tea bag in a metal pot, which you can ask for hot water refill. - For eatings, it was the $3.50 tea cake which was like a chocolate cake but with a hint of ginger(?) and sure went well with that white peony tea. Was going to split it, but others did not enjoy it as much. So toughed it out and finished it by myself, yes! - The $2 Friand (http://static.px.yelp.coÉ) was on the rich side, but worth a try.. - Also got a $6.35=small Coconut Cream Tart (http://static.px.yelp.coÉ) and recommend that if you're into coconuts. I was. Still, everything is a bit on the pricey side for sweets ITTET, but what can you do? The atmosphere: - There are two sections when entering, depending on what you're ordering. If you want only coffee/tea/drinks, then go to the right side where there's a drinks "bar" and cash register. If want sweets, then it's the left side (http://static.px.yelp.coÉ) - a line, yep, but it moves quickly since there are two registers. This is where the display case of sweets are, with menus placed around if want to look at first. You can order drinks in this line too, but then pick up at the drinks register side. - As this place is crowded - most of the time is my guess - open seats amongst the wooden tables and chairs (http://static.px.yelp.coÉ) get taken up fast (noticed a few communal sharing of tables though). We had to stand by the counter (there is also a table at the end of said counter, with coffee refill pots and sugar, honey, the usuals). - The counter overlooked Guerrero St., which was not too bad of a view on a weekend; two wooden benches are located right outside (http://static.px.yelp.coÉ). - On the 18th St. side, there are metal tables and chairs (http://static.px.yelp.coÉ). Other yelpers have posted really good pics, and I didn't have my camera. So, thanks for letting me snagged your pics AngelaA, AnnL, AmyD, CookieMonsterN. The coolest part of the hour we were there was seeing how diverse their customers were - probably every single SF-neighborhood type showed up. :) *In These Tough Economic Times

So I heard about it on "The Best Thing I Ever Ate" I'm not proud, I gave into the food network. All I can say is thank you (chef who's name I can't remember). Thank you so very very very much. Sweet Lord, the double chocolate croissant is definitely up there with one of the best most amazing things I ever ate. First of all when I got this pastry, it was still warm. STILL WARM people, are you listening? The crust crackled when I took a bite (meaning the croissant was perfect, they aren't supposed to be just flakey but also crisp - yes I've been to France, and yes I know what a good croissant is supposed to be like). ÊThen I could actually SEE the butter glistening in the center of it, oozing out. The mouthfeel was something between orgasm and winning money. It's a double chocolate croissant, so they use two rods of excellent chocolate. It's deep, rich, chocolatey, buttery. Delicious. And with the great coffee they serve I was a very happy girl. I don't live in SF anymore, but damnit I will be back!

I am a Missionite. I love this neighborhood and the little places that lend to all the hype that can make/break the Mission. Tartine Bakery is one of these places, as evidenced by the thousands of reviews for it on this site (among other things). And I am writing my first-ever Yelp review to tell you exactly why you should not stand among the sheep in line for them. I have been to Tartine Bakery many times as I used to live a couple blocks from them (and now live an eternal 5 blocks away). Not once have I ever been treated with anything but icy hipster coolness--admittedly, not a great customer service practice, but, frankly, many places in the Mission are manned by life-long baristas who think they're too cool for a job in the hospitality industry. So I'm not gonna hold Tartine Bakery to the fire for this one--it unfortunately comes with the Mission territory. (There are, thankfully, notable exceptions, such as, say, Bi-Rite Grocery & Creamery down the block, where I am always greeted with a smile and lively banter.) So as I was saying, I knew I wasn't going to Tartine Bakery for cordial, friendly service. I was going for the good food. Well, well, well. Was I in for a surprise. It was this past Saturday, the day of the NorCal Grilled Cheese Invitational in Dolores Park. The place was a mess but we had melted cheese on the brain, so we headed over to Tartine Bakery to help ourselves to their overpriced but delicious pressed sandwiches. (I had my eyes set on their three-cheese concoction.) We waited in the obligatory line for about 25 minutes, then a skinny dude behind the counter with hair on his face and hanging onto his face told us they'd run out of bread. UTTER DISAPPOINTMENT. But, OK, that's fair--not his fault, maybe they didn't expect to get so much business that day. We settled for their open croque monsieur sandwiches; he takes down the counter-top sandwich menu. Raggedy hair dude puts them into boxes to-go (without even asking if we wanted to stay and eat them there) and we ask, "Are they warm?" He says no. I ask if he could reheat them, and he gives me the wariest look on earth, as if I was asking for some outrageous thing. But he does it--warily, warily. Sigh. All right, we pay. Just as we've handed over the dough and the register girl's rung it all up, we see--no joke--like 10 loaves of bread behind her. "Excuse me, we were told there was no bread to be had?" "Oh, yeah, uh..." (makes look one makes when one has been caught lying) That's when we notice everyone behind us has ordered sandwiches and raggedy hair dude has even put the counter-top menu with all the sandwiches back up. Everyone's ordering to their heart's delight! What gives? As the girl notices that we're taking this all in she says, "Oh, well, a sandwich would've taken 30 minutes anyway." Excuse me, but whose prerogative is it to decide how long I am willing/able to wait for a meal? If I want to wait 30 minutes for a sandwich, I will, thanks. I'll make that call. Further, when we told her that we'd been told there were no sandwiches and therefore would not have ordered these cold, re-heated croque monsieurs otherwise, she didn't even give us the option to order sandwiches. Disorganized. Sloppy. Rude. Terrible. Plus, our sandwiches were gross. I can buy overpriced sandwiches almost everywhere else in the Mission, and I can get more conscientious service too.

Cozy little pastry and coffee shop, constantly busy throughout the day. I was a little sad they didn't make any banana cream tart that day, I mean that's why I came here! I had to settle for the Frangapine Tart. It wasn't the same but still a real treat. Soft flaky outside topped with a fresh fruit spread and nuts. The Tres Leche cake was very moist and not too sweet, but I didn't care too much for it. I'll have to stop by on another day to catch the morning buns and banana cream tarts! A bit pricey though so 3.5 stars.

Update: 9/22/06 Ê I just got the new Tartine cookbook. . .now I NEVER have to deal with those counter people EVER again!!! Ê ÊI can bake my own banana cream pies!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Bwaha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Does Tartine need another review? Ê No. Am I going to do one anyway? Hell yes. I stumbled upon Tartine one day by accident. ÊI was going to Carl's to get a doll cake and Carl's was gone and Tartine was there. . .looking all cute and smug like. ÊWTF? Ê What in tar-nation happened to Carl's and where else am I going to get a purple ruffle cake with a doll stuck in the top of it? ÊSure, a buttercream laden bright purple cake with a half naked doll shoved into it is cheesy, but a girl sometimes needs a doll cake when everyone else forgot to get her a cake and she doesn't feel like making herself yet another birthday cake (can you hear the violins?). Ê So here I am, another year older without a birthday cake. ÊI would have thrown myself on the ground and had a tantrum (worst yet, the tile in the entryway still spelled out "Carl's" in a deliberate attempt to mock me), but that would have taken effort and I was worn out from feeling sorry for myself. ÊSo I decided to check out what was what. Ê So this is back in the beginning when Tartine was not yet TARTINE and so they were still at least trying to be nice behind the counter. ÊIt was not yet crowded and you could take your time browsing the deliciousness. . .ah, the good old days. ÊMy first items there were a banana cream tartlet and a piece of lemon pound cake. ÊPerfection. ÊDelicious - the crust on the tartlet was the best crust I'd ever had. ÊEVER. ÊI went and sat in Dolores Park and shamelessly devoured both items. ÊOver a month's time I eventually went through almost the whole display case and then had to retire and get away from this vortex of sweet evil. Cut to about six months later. . .Tartine is now TARTINE. Ê I hate to throw the dreaded "hipster" moniker out there but what the hell . . bloody well infested with hipsters steaming up their tortoise shell glasses with their macchiatos and getting tufts of whipped cream stuck to their nose rings. ÊThe line was sick, the counter staff was overwrought and bitchy but the goods in the glass counter still looked lovely. ÊI ordered my two faves plus a few other items as I was going to take them to a friend's house. ÊI also got some cookies 'cause I wanted to try them. ÊMind you, Tartine bakes their items "a la francais" which to most people would seem too dark but dark usually equals flavor so I understood their motives. Ê One of the items I got was a rocher which is a meringue based cookie usually studded with nuts of some sort. ÊI ordered four of them because I was going to snack on them. ÊAll told, I was spending about $40.00. ÊI had my pastries put in a box and the rochers in a little bag so I could snack on my way home to Oakland. ÊAs I walked out of the bakery, I took a bite of the rocher and . . .gack. . .it was burnt. ÊIt was still light beige on the outside but the inside was dark and the nuts were burnt. ÊI am not a cheapskate. . this was not about the $1.60 I spent on four cookies it was more like if this were my bakery I would want to know my stuff was sub par, right? ÊWouldn't you? ÊSo I waited in line. ÊGot to the counter person and told her NICELY that the rochers were overcooked. ÊI didn't say burnt. ÊI kept my tone low. ÊShe rolled her eyes at me and told me that that's how they were supposed to be. ÊUm. ÊOkay. Ê So instead of pulling my pastry chef card, I just said, well they taste burnt to me and I'd like my money back please. ÊEyes rolling again. Ê And she says all hell of sarcastically and loud, trying to embarrass me. . ."So you want your, like, dollar back?" Êeyes a'rollin' . .and I say, "Uh, like, yeah. Ê. . your cookies are burnt and if you're going to charge 50 cents for something that costs you two cents to make, you might as well bake them correctly." Ê ÊShe tsk'd me. . .that sound that people make when they are annoyed at you . . .I got tsk'd!!! ÊWTF!! Ê So sadly, I avoid Tartine . .. but sometimes, if I am rolling with my sweetheart, I make him run in and get me one of those heavenly banana cream tartlets. . I can't help it. . .they are that good.

It was the eve of the Thanksgiving holiday, and I knew I needed to prepare myself for the days to come. ÊWhat better way to prepare for the holiday than to splurge at Tartine Bakery. Ê I met up on this nice sunny day in the city with my husband, friend Eric, and fellow Yelper Daniel L. ÊDaniel L. grabs his food first and mans the fort (aka table right outside) while Eric and I wait in line to order our food. ÊWe approach the glass case filled with glorious sugary goodness. ÊIt nearly brought tears to my eyes. ÊI felt like it was some kind of sick joke to have me pick a few items from this plethora of sweets. ÊAlas we order and head back to the table with two-open faced sandwiches, two eclairs, a coconut creme tart, banana creme tart, and tres leches cake. ÊWe join forces w/ Daniel L.'s lemon tart and open faced veggie sandwich. ÊEverything was delicious, but the tres leches cake kicked the ass of everything else. ÊMoist cake w/ a flaky bottom layer brought me straight to nirvana w/ every bite. ÊOh yea...it was that good. ÊThe ecliars were soft and flaky, filled with creamy custard, and topped with a dark chocolate frost. ÊBanana creme tart (my second favorite of the "meal") was basically a banana creme pie in tart form with chocolate on top. ÊThe twist here is the crust was lined with chocolate and CARAMEL! *drool* Tartine, I fell in love with you that day and I promise to return soon. ÊA big thank you to Daniel L., Eric, and Marc for ringing in Thanksgiving with me by indulging in sugar bliss.

Wow......Is all I have to say...I am seriously in a loss for words....This place sent me to a far way place that sweetaholics dream about and I am literally coming down from drifting on a cloud of pure decadent delight!! I could not have thought of a better way to have celebrated this wonderful Labor day then to have spent it at the oh so wonderful (Now one of my go to spots) Tartine Bakery enjoying some of the most decadently... out of this world pastries desserts that San Francisco has to offer (and do I mean Out of this world)!!! Though what made this day especially enjoyable was to have enjoyed it with 2 of my closet, most awesome major sweet tooth yelper buds Daniel L. and Kent P.! The line coming out of this place tells it all. Immediately after walking within the bakery I was bombarded with images of beautiful fabulous looking pastries sitting behind a glass case calling to me I'm here Shannon... Look at how fabulous and wonderful I look... and I taste delicious!! I f I could, I would have tasted everything (which we almost did lol) we decided to share a few decadent Items First the absolute Decadent Dark Chocolate Pudding (and when I say decadent, I mean decadent) seductively rich, dark and creamy with a dollop of cream in the middle- garnished with shreds of dark chocolate...Looked beautiful, tasted beautiful. We also had a heaping slice of the Tres leches cake (This was amazing and probably my favorite of all) Imagine a thick, fluffy, white, creamy, rich moist slice of heaven that just literally fell apart tenderly in your mouth....Mmmm...wow. We also ordered a Morning bun...which was nice- a little dry though it had great flavor.Rasberry Fruit Tart -which was both Daniel and Kent's favorites, which I am not a huge fan of tarts, however this was a delight- light creamy though not overbearingly sweet garnished with succulently fresh sweet raspberries (perfect summer dessert) We also ordered a mouthwatering open faced sandwich with fresh portabella mushrooms, thick succulent fresh sliced tomatoes entrenched in a wonderful melted Swiss cheese toasted to perfection...All accompanied with our beautiful foamy latts served in big beautiful over sized cups....Which might I say Êwere Phenomenal and one of the best latts I have had in a while!! It is noisy and there is only one exit which makes it a little crowded- however, despite the chaos of people and difficulty trying to get a table, it is certainly worth visiting and well worth the drive. As for everything else you will not be disappointed. I had a wonderful time. I would highly suggest meeting up with some friends to try this fabulous place (just be prepared to stand in a line for a little while) Thankyou Daniel and Kent for making my Labor day a memorable one!!

I dreamt of morning buns and sweet pastries with cream and heavenly goodies from Tartine Bakery. ÊFor months I've obssessed with the idea of finding the time to get to this place. And..............DISAPPOINTMENT crashed my world as soon as I had my first bite of my first Tartine pastry: ÊChocolate Hazelnut Tart. But I refused to accept that such famed bakeshop was all for nothing. Ê So, I went back again and again and again............ ********** 1st Visit: (Excitement turned to Disappointment) 1. ÊCHOCOLATE HAZELNUT TART: ÊMade with Sharffen berger chocolate. So disappointingly DRY. Lacking in flavor. Where's the chocolate?! I left it alone after 3 bites. ÊComplete let down! ********** 2nd Visit: (Hopeful but Cautious) 1. ÊPEACH PUDDING: ÊToo sweet. Creamy. Fruity. Nothing else. Just okay. 2. ÊOLIVE BREAD: ÊThis was like a square semi-firm savory bread pudding with plenty of black olives and ham. ÊTender and smooth. ÊVery good and unique. ÊI was actually still craving this after 3 weeks. *********** 3rd Visit: (Final Decision) 1.CROQUE MONSIEUR: With Turkey. ÊIt's like eating a gourmet pizza or focaccia. Bechamel sauce. gruyere and pleasant taste of fresh thyme. It was very good. Ê It even came with 2 whole pickled carrots. Cute addition Êand complimented the saltiness of the bread. ÊWas it worth $9.25 for a slice of gourmet bread? ÊAs good as it was, I don't think so! 2. ÊROCHER W/ ALMONDS: Like a meringue cookie. ÊAiry. Light. Good.. Tasted like popcorn. ÊNot bad for $0.75 but nothing memorable about it either. Overall: There you go, after 3 visits and about $50 worth of pastries later, I guess, it'll be fair for me to say that Tartine serves good pastries but not great. ÊSadly, the pastries did not live up to the hype. Ê Would I go back again? ÊI definitely will if I'm in the area and if I'm craving their olive bread and ham. ÊMaybe even the Croque Monsieur but I will think twice before spending $9.25. ÊTheir coffee was just okay--too acidic for my taste. One thing I was able to confirm though--the staff at Tartine were very nice, helpful and friendy. None of those staff with attitudes as some Yelpers experienced. ÊTartine is a cute and cozy bakeshop, as San Francisco as you get--bright, hip and happening.

Lines were long but moves quick. Shared a jarbon with gruyere hot pressed sandwich and it was huge. Comes in 3 pieces and it made both my and my friend full from the sandwich (about $12 or $13?). My friend and i were hit really hard with a glop of horseradish that really opens up your sinuses, not pleasing at all. But that didn't take it away from the delicious classy jam and cheese. My friend ordered the side salad ($4?) and she couldn't eat it because she said the lettuce was really bitter. It's a cute place to come and eat and hang with hipster friends. Next time, I would definitely get dessert. The eclairs looked sooo awesome. Kinda bummed I didnt get it.

After a stressful day at the airport, this sweet-toothed junkie made a beeline for Tartine. ÊA typical long line greeted me, but nothing would deter me from getting my tarts, cake, and the impossibly perfect croissants. ÊRain and sucky weather, but I was happy as a clam since I was in one of my favorite places in San Francisco. ÊIt was my turn. ÊI heard Fred Astaire singing into my ear, "Heaven, I'm in heaven, And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak." ÊWith darting, greedy eyes, I requested the last almond croissant, a Rocher almond (flaky meringue with toasted almonds), Mexican wedding cookies (aka Russian tea cookies, the best I have had outside of Paris), a slice of passion fruit lime Bavarian cake (gorgeous-looking, lime moistened genoise with passion fruit Bavarian cream topped with thick shavings of coconut), a lemon cream tart, a gougere, and I grabbed a bag of oatmeal currant cookies (more like flaky crisps that just melt in your mouth) at the counter. ÊOutta control glutton alert! ÊYes, I overdid it, but I have a reputation to live up to. As usual, Tartine satisfied my sweet tooth. ÊEverything is made out of super fine ingredients and they know how to whip cream better than a professional dominatrix. ÊA dollop of it sits on top of their winning tarts, so definitely get one of those. ÊThe banana cream tart is a must. ÊLayers of crumbly puff pastry, a polish of chocolate, slices of slippery fresh banana, creamy yet not too sweet custard, finished off with the creamiest whipped cream and sprinkles of chocolate shavings. ÊThe lemon cream tart is also wonderful. ÊIn fact, after also having a delicious lemon bar, I will say that Tartine does lemon desserts with amazing consistency, always mouthwateringly tangy with just a hint of sweetness, like the delicate citrus taste of kumquats and yuzu. As far as cake, try the lemon almond pound cake. ÊLike I said, they are expert with lemons. ÊA slice of this is wonderfully tart and sweet at the same time. ÊIf you love hazelnut and dark chocolate like I do, definitely get the opera cake. ÊIt is worth a bullet. The croissants are just incredible. ÊFlaky and crispy on the outside, the inside is warm, soft, not too buttery, and the whole thing just unravels with perfection. ÊThe almond is my favorite and it sells out fast. ÊIts presence in your belly means the angels are on your side. ÊA great second choice is the frangipane--brandy and almonds, delish! Those who enjoy dessert but do not care for sweet items, the bread pudding fits the bill. ÊIt is housemade brioche topped with a swirl of caramel and fresh fruit. ÊHoly Batman, if you like cheese and bread, you want gougere. ÊIt is a freshly baked ball of bread lined withe gruyere and fresh herbs. ÊThe sandwiches are so good, too. ÊTheir croque Monsieur has a following. ÊIt is an open face sandwich (think of pizza) with gruyere, herbs, topped with smoked ham, Cowgirl Creamery, or shiitake mushrooms and seasonal vegetables. ÊIf you are an early riser, nothing will put a bigger smile on your face then the morning bun. ÊEssentially a croissant rolled with caramelized sugar, it does this neat trick of being sublimely moist, gooey, and flaky at the same time. ÊAs if that was not enough, a surprise of orange zest makes a jack-in-the-box appearance and you know that Tartine has you good. I have no complaints about service. ÊLines move along. ÊThey have always been patient and nice. ÊEveryone seems happy to be here, and why not, with all the superlative baking, it smells just divine. ÊNo questions, Tartine, I am a lifer.

After the recent release of Julie and Julia, it seems appropriate to review this famed bakery, brought to national prominence by accounts of Julia Child shopping here before she left us. This obviously raised my expectations for my maiden voyage here. The line was not bad with three or four people ahead of us, but it was a weekday morning (I can imagine the madhouse on sunny weekends here). Because of my affinity (aka addiction) to chocolate, my first three selections were reflex action: Scharffenberger Plain Brownie, Scharffenberger Nut Brownie, and Pain Au Chocolate (did someone say Chocolate croissant?), all between $3.00 and $4.00. Just before reaching the cashier, I noticed the baker sliding a hot tray of savory goodies into the display case. Without knowing what it was, I added one to my shopping cart; though it looked like their version of pizza bread, I later learned that it was their vegetarian Croque Monsieur. Since it was still piping hot, I HAD to (devil made my do it) take a few bites before hopping in the car. I must admit it was delicious, as most things are when they first leave the oven. The veggies were perfectly cooked and the bread literally melted in my mouth. As I drove home, I couldn't help but think about the goodies in my trunk. Unfortunately, things did not go as well when we arrived. The Pain Au Chocolate was a bit on the burnt side, which left a bitter taste after I warmed it in the toaster oven. The brownies were pretty good as the nutty one had more character. The disappointment was when I looked at my receipt and discovered that I paid $9.25 for my Croque Monsieur. Yes, it was Êsubstantial. Yes, it came with pickled carrots. ÊYes, it was good. But no, I didn't expect it to cost $9.25. In my frugal mood, I might say, "I could have nine Sausage McMuffins from the dollar menu instead." Overall, I'd say that the food is a-ok, perhaps blaming myself for heightened expectations. The price of the last item obviously dropped my jaw and that critical half star from being fan worthy. Maybe I need to come back as a blank sheet of paper.

The quiche, croissant, mousse and bread pudding was absolutely exciting and so fresh. No wonder the line goes out the door. There was also an eclair stacked in the bunch with bavarian cream inside that was so creamy. This is definitely somewhere I would want to visit when I have more time.

picture if you will, a very sunny day in SF, people milling on the sidewalks, walking dogs, making out, pheromones in full effect. then picture if you will an outside table of 4 fat girls and one "fat on the inside" girl with a table full of incredibly crafted pastries. the passing of the plates for sampling of the wares was well oiled, not for the faint of heart, not for the weak. we were there to eat, moan orgasmically, and lose all sense of decorum as we fearlessly ate the last bites of the pastries we preferred most, even in one devil may care case, licking the plates clean. i try to imagine what it is like for mere non-fat mortals to walk by a gaggle of hot fat girls stuffing their faces and what they might be thinking to themselves, plebians in our champion court. i could concentrate on this for awhile, if i didn't want to tell you about the fluffy heavenly quiche, a banana tart, wedding cookies, a berry tart, and something or other with cocoa nibs. everything was perfect, beautiful, and delicious. tartine, oh sweet tartine, let us run away to a remote location and make hot sticky sweet love under a shade tree. you got me all messed up, baby.

OK. ÊHere's the unbiased (minus-couldn't find parking so ima-gonna slammit) review: ÊTartine is actually good and prices are reasonable (except bev's-- $3.50 for a SMALL mocha!). ÊI've lived around the corner for a year+ & been there all times of day, line/no line. ÊHere's what's wrong aside from that crazy line on the wkds and people taking my parking: ÊThey BURN croissants (and sometimes morning buns)-- various flavors @ various times; you have to watch out when the almond croissant are heavily coated with confectioner's sugar-- a sure Red Flag. ÊMost of the Savouries w/o ham lack flavor 'cause they'll slather on the bechamel (but if you like that kindof thing...). ÊCOOKIES NEED HELP: Don't make a mexican wedding cookies in the Mission; chocolate chip cookies resemble frico (thin and airy, anti-tollhouse proportions), ganache bites need more BITE (umph! chocolate!) ÊHere's what's amazing: ÊQuiche (smoked ham OR shiitake), Gougere, morning bun!!!, Jambon croissant, bread pudding, Scharffenberger pudding; coconut cream anything-- Did I say Gougere? Chewy and crisp on the outside, pillowy and rich on the semi-hulled inside... Throw some scrambled eggs, gruyere &roquette into one of those and you've got yourself a fiesta frances... Destination patrons, here's a tip: Point to what you want then check it; if they give you something wack ask for something else- Empower yourself, you just waited 20 minutes!

The line for Tartine is guaranteed to always be there when you are really hungry or hungover and are dying for a delicious pastry or cheesy greasy baked good. ÊWhile the line does not serve any food, there is a really tempting smell coming from the exhaust fans, which makes you salivate for about 35 minutes as you are all but forced to watch the pastry chefs roll out dough, pull sheets of fresh treats out of the oven and cover things in sugar. ÊO, what fun! ÊBy the time you actually get inside, sometimes you have ingested enough air-borne butter from the fans that you arent hungry.

Pre ordered several of the sourdough loaves to take home (almost caused our bags to be overweight.) I gave five stars, even though the lines were long and I HATE having to send someone to "save" a table and chairs. But what else are they supposed to do? It's a bakery, not a restaurant. I'm glad for them that they have lines out the door. I wish that much success for us all.

delicious, great pastries, very busy. the coffee is great. is kind of the place you "come get it and eat it and go". the staff is not so friendly some times, but the food is fantastic. ill recommend it if you are in the city you better come and see it for yourself. it's very expensive for a place that's not offer wi-fi or better service such as bussing or table service... Ps: not vegan place at all... and you have to bussing your plates please!!

This has to be some kind of cosmic joke. I went to Tartine for the first time ever today, as it's close to the BF's and we wanted some Kuchen to go with our Kaffee. The 5-star reviews must either be from people on crack, or else people who've never eaten outside the US. The croissants looked over-cooked, the lemon merigue cake thing looked charred & everything else just looked plain unappetising. Maybe they figure that they don't need to bother anymore, as they have enough folks fooled. The BF got the lemon tart Êand I had a taste of that and it was totally forgettable. This was his third visit and probably his last, according to him. This is a Swiss man who's a serious foodie. I didn't get anything, which is pretty major for a sweet-tooth like me. If this is meant to be some of the best that SF has to offer, then god help us. 1 star only for so not living up to the hype.

Tartine is officially getting an extra star from me because of their Almond Croissants. Christ they're good, I can't believe anyone would bother recommending the chocolate ones. Before I sat down to gorge my face with the almond ones at a friend's brunch I was severely mislead by whoever recommended the chocolate ones. Damn them, extra star for Tartine.

I'm sorry, I have given it two more chances and just do not enjoy the food. I had a yogurt and muesli thing that was totally flavorless - neither ingredient being tasty (and I do like good plain yogurt). I also had a few cookies that looked incredible but were super boring. And I believe I also had a chocolate croissant that was good but nowhere near worth waiting in line and dealing with the clerks who either lose track constantly of who they are serving or serve multiple people at once without explaining that they're waiting on your items from the back (or whatever).

You ever been with a dude who is fine and he knows he fine?!?! ÊWell that's Tartine in a nutshell. I'm going to keep it real. ÊYou good, but seriously, you ain't that good...recognize! We came here labor day weekend (yeah, I'm lagging) because quite frankly my hubs has a slight addiction to this place. ÊI, not being a breakfast or a line (yes, expect it) person, had yet to try this place. ÊTypically, we would just do drive-bys before dropping him off to work so he could get his fix on BUT I finally caved because you would have to have the IQ of Jessica Simpson not to notice the following they have here (jus sayin). Ê So we actually got there before it opened and that got us about third in line (real talk). ÊTo the homeboy who tried to avoid the line and swoop in front of me...don't do that. ÊMy hubs naturally wasn't having it and took care of you right quick so take that as a learning lesson. ÊUnfortunately, the clientele are not the only ones that are rude and pretentious. ÊThe guy at the counter nearly overcharged us and the hubs had to correct him and when we handed him a bill, he actually got an attitude. ÊComplaining it was too early for that. ÊSeriously, because we will gladly take our bill somewhere else which was what we were about to do when they decided to take it (that's right). Ê On to the grub. ÊI ordered the Banana Tart that everyone raves about and a Rocher with almond. ÊThe hubs ordered the bread pudding and the morning bun. ÊBanana Tart was a major disappointment. ÊCenter was aiight but the crust was so freaking hard. ÊI mean I was struggling with my fork to cut into it. ÊWhile we are on the subject of hard (don't go there) , the morning buns my hubs swears by was like a rock. ÊI was finna have a bf (umm, bitch fit) when I took a bite of the hubs bread pudding. Ê ÊAh, and their it was. ÊThe taste I was looking for. ÊIt's damn good. ÊI admit it. ÊI'm not even a fan of bread pudding, until now. ÊThe Rocher with almond was sweet goodness too. ÊI just don't know if it's worth the line or the attitude. ÊSince I'm a believer in second chances (yeah right, it's so the bread pudding) I will give it another go but not on a weekend and not at peak hours. ÊBut like that fine guy, I will kick you to the curb, so watch it Tartine!

It's been pointed out to me before that I am an idiot, and usually I'm not really in a position to argue. ÊTartine, you prove that point all too well. ÊIt's taken me repeated beatings by your unfathomably poor service to finally understand that you just really suck. ÊI had an inkling of this my first two visits, but I was blinded by your above average food. ÊIt's steadily gone downhill from there. ÊNot only have you finally made me realize that you're an overrated waste of what could be a great spot, you've made me lose faith in my fellow man. ÊWho in their right mind would wait in such long lines to go to this place? ÊI never run into my friends there, I never run into anyone I know there. ÊWho are you people? ÊDo you honestly have nothing better to do and think that it is some sort of status-y symbol to waste your life in line only to be treated like crap? Ê I once pre-ordered 12 of their morning buns (excellent, but dead to me now) and was told to pick them up at 8:00am. ÊI dutifully stood in line with all the other moronic lemmings only to find that they decided not to bake enough and my order was canceled. ÊNo apology given, just the blank stare of inferior breeding. ÊWhen I saw that there was at least 12 in the pastry case, I asked politely for my order to be filled from there. ÊReasonable, right? ÊApparently not, I was told that if I ordered 12 then there might not be enough for others. ÊReally. ÊHonest to god that was the response I got. ÊThat should've tipped me off right there. ÊWith that business model in hand, Tartine shouldn't have lasted more than a month or two, but never underestimate the idiocy of the mildly idle wannabe rich. Ê I twice went in to round up a nice breakfast only to find their cases 2/3's empty and stocked with the most boring of pastries (terrible, dry, tasteless oversize croissants). ÊAdd to that, their decision to serve mediocre coffee and again, I was left wondering why this place even existed. ÊIf you decide to cruise through on a couple of rave reviews alone, you really should at least try to MAKE ENOUGH TO FILL YOUR CASES, not to mention be consistent and caring enough back up your wares with equally good drinks. I twice went in the late afternoon to drink wine outside, and was told when asking for additional wine glasses, that they had no more clean ones. ÊAgain, really. ÊOne time, I purchased a bottle of wine, which was then opened for me and presented with NO glasses. ÊWhen I asked for just two, I got the ol' we're out of clean ones routine. ÊWhen I asked what I should drink the overpriced wine out of, the counter person sighed and said she could probably hand-wash some. ÊAt this point, I was willing to go home to get my finest plastic cups because I was afraid the task of hand-washing was going to be too much for this person, but I decided to challenge them with the task. ÊThey were very put out. ÊThe wine, by the way, was far too expensive for the quality and far too cold for something that red. ÊIf you only know how to do pastries...just do pastries. ÊDon't try to be something more if you can't tell good coffee from bad and don't know enough to not deep freeze a bottle of Merlot. Ê So really, what the hell is up with this place? ÊHow can they blow it so badly and yet still draw the kind of long lines that are omnipresent. ÊAre the owners and patrons alike just that ignorant? ÊWhat kind of strange brainwashing is happening here? ÊI know I'm not missing anything because I've been there and, well, I know I'm not missing anything. ÊAnd while we're talking about the lines, if you're stupid enough to waste your time in one, please be aware that there are other people in the world and step aside when, say, a mother and stroller need to get by. ÊOr I guess you could bark at them to walk in the street and dodge traffic, that would be more in keeping with the customer service provided by the establishment you wasting your life in front of. Barely above average food, lousy beverages and atrocious service...all in a prime location. ÊI cannot wait for Tartine to disappear and be replaced by something actually worth waiting for.

OK....I visited my sister up in SF and saw the line for this place and read a few yelps and decided i had to go. It was only 4 blocks from her house and I do like me a good pastry! I got the morning bun, the chocolate croissant, the almond croissant and a brownie. Everything was burnt. Like black on top and bottom. Super crunchy...aren't croissants supposed to be pleasantly fluffy? Well this wasn't. On top of that each item was like $5-6...ya...you can choose between a complete sit down breakfast meal at some nearby cafe with waiter service and hot food prepared especially for you or get 2 charred black croissants after waiting in a line for 20 minutes. The brownie was good (but heck I can make a good brownie). I honestly want to give it only 2 stars...but I don't know if I can be that mean. (ok, wait, I did it.). Until i have a good pastry from this place which may be a long time from now, two stars. Boom. I would like to go back and give it a second shot but for now I am going to say that this place is all hype. Noe Bakery just up the hill is more better.

The shortbread cookie is butterbutterbuttery, and so great. I get once in a while on my lunch break because it's a block away from my work. It's only a dollar twenty five, and it is just the right size. I eat it crumb by crumb and boy it is delectable. If you eat it slowly it is like cookie butter. I tried this place a few years ago and thought it was only pretty good. The latte I had was good because it was large, but I think comparable to other coffee establishments. I had some tart cream pie or something and it was fluffy and creamy, but not my cup of tea. The inside of the place is always so crowded with people, and the line is ridiculous on weekends and even sometimes at lunch. On hot days in the mission it is excruciating to be inside the room. Also, the outdoor seating is nice, but whenever I wait for the 33 I find it uncomfortable when the patrons just kind of stare at you while sipping their coffee and eating their tarts.

YUM. I adore Tartine Bakery, with their Weight-Watchers-Unfriendly goodies and that delicious smell of things baking. I am rapidly expanding from my current addiction, the frangipan croissant. My last dangerous obsession was the bread pudding and before that, the chocolate hazelnut tart. I am sending them my lipo bill, but before I do that, could one more Humboldt Fog sandwich really hurt? Their quiche, pastrami sandwich, and croque monsieur are all excellent, too! And there are usually cute boys to watch while you eat at the outside tables.

Now, I am generally not a breakfast and sweet tooth person, especially when it comes to pastries. However, my world has turned upside-down after a friend took us here on a San Francisco gourmet trip. lol First of all, I loved the ambiance of the bakery/cafe. It was small, cozy, personable and smelled divine! There is a wide selection of pastries (some of which I have never seen before), pies, tarts, cakes, greek-style yogurts, sandwiches, soups. Almost anything you can think of. I think it would be a great place for casual brunch dining with your family and friends. The customer service was surprisingly efficient, polite and considerate, based on how packed and busy the restaurant was. For example, when we asked for a glass of water, even though we ordered to-go, the waitress gave us two cups of water, filled in coffee cups so that it would not spill. My friends and I ordered: 1) Opera Cake: many, many layers. It looks dense and delicious but you'll be surprised upon the first bite because it is incredibly light and fluffy. I was also amazed as to how thing each cake layer was. It seemed to intricately made and I loved the chocolate marzipan topping. Would definitely come back and try other cakes 2) Quiche Lorraine: tasted like homemade goodness. I really enjoyed it because the cheese filling was smooth and light. The cheeses did not overpower the eggs' delicate flavor. Tartine must have used a variety of cheeses in the quiche because I discerned many cheeses in each bite. Of course, the crust was also nice and flaky. Although the bottom was a bit hard to break through. They offered vegetarian and normal cheese quiche with bacon. I've made quiches, maybe 3x at home and this is the first place I've been to that tasted closest to being homemade 3) EClair: I love eclairs, but it is generally very hard to find one without an overwhelmingly sweet cream filling. I enjoyed this one very much because the flaky, buttery-ness of the pastry actually came through; so there was a good juxtaposition between the sweet, velvety cream and the pastry dough. 4) Greek Style Yogurt: to be honest, this is probably something I wouldn't normally order because it tasted a little bit murky and sour. However, it could also be because I generally don't like flavored yogurt. Simply put, it is greek style, probably made from goats milk, yogurt mixed in with special cereal grain and other stuff. However, my friend, who ordered this and is a health nut :) seemed to have liked it a lot. So, as you can tell, I really enjoyed Tartine's and plan on bringing on family here for brunch. It would probably be a good idea to bring friends/family so that you can sample all the delectable treats. I would definitely try the Banana Cream Tart, Quiche, a cake, a sandwich when I come back. Also, it is important to note that they make everything fresh, including the bread for their sandwiches, daily; fresh enough that you can taste it and smell it as you step into this quaint establishment. Overall, I am giving a 5 stars rating to Tartine's and am anticipating my return here. NOTE: Tartine Bakery also has its own cookbooks (2): Tartine and Tartine Bread. I have read from David Lebovitz, past pastry chef from Chez Panisse and famous author of Ê"The Perfect Scoop," that Tartine's brown bread is delicious enough to be made into an ice cream flavor!

Absolutely the best pastries & baked goods in the city. Everything I've had has been 100% deliciousness and could hold its own against any bakery in the world. Others have said plenty about the food. But I have given up on Tartine. There is absolutely NO REASON why it should be such an ordeal to patronize this fine establishment. It once took me 30 minutes to get a sandwich. Usually, getting a pastry and an expresso takes at least 10 minutes if there's any sort of a line. Then, there's never anywhere to sit and getting from the regsiter to the door is an American Gladiators-style gauntlet. Instead of just complaining, I'm offering these suggestions. 1. remove the counter along the window, no one ever stands there even when the place is really crowded. put some 2-person tables! 2. move the self-serve coffee urn out of the corner, just put it on the bar in front of the espresso machine. 3. push the big pastry case back towards the kitchen to open up another foot of floor space. 4. I know you're supposed to bus your own table, but not everyone does and there's usually at least a couple tables that are unusable because dishes have piled up. Tartine needs a busperson. 5. They have two cash registers, but no dedicated cashiers. There should be two people who do nothing but work the registers. That's probably the biggest thing, the slowness of conducting the actual transaction. 6. a wider lane from the register to the door. it's impossible to get through there without body checking someone. 7. scratch #3, they should move the pastry case to the window along 18th street, so you come in the door, move past the goodies, tell them what you want, then order your coffe drink, pay at the register and follow along the south wall back to the door. this way, people would circulate counter-clockwise along the perimeter of the room with tables in the middle. Tartine, if you at least make some sort of effort to improve service and efficiency, I will gladly buy lots of pastries from you, especially the ham-and-cheese croissants.

Don't go expecting an egg and bacon breakfast but if you're craving bread pudding or a delicious pressed sandwich from this upscale patisserie and cafe then you're in luck. Mission residents line up around the block for what's on hand here. Try the buttery scone with currants or the $6 chocolate hazelnut tart. YUM. You can also get Tartine bread as a starter at neighbor Delfina and if you try Radio Africa & Kitchen at Coffee Bar it's served up with edamame and eggplant spread.

**Cue Homer Simpson Voice** mmmmmmmm......breeeeaaaad puuuudddinggg (drool dribbling from mouth on to chin) Seriously, if you haven't been to Tartine you should get your butt over there - but do it early because the line is known to wrap around the block. My friend and I got lucky enough to snag a table right when we walked in but we had to fight off hoards of hungry couples rolling their strollers over our toes. I doubt you can go wrong with anything that you order here but as you can tell from my opening line, the bread pudding is off the hook delicious - it's more "eggy" than "bready" and is stuffed full of sweet cranberries. Pair it with a latte and you'll be in pure morning bliss.

I met a friend here, and we took our sandwiches to Dolores to eat. ÊI (vegetarian) had a Humboldt Fog sandwich, which was probably one of the more decadent grilled-cheese offerings I've ever eaten. ÊI don't usually leave food on the table, but I had to pack half my sandwich to go. The bread is pretty amazing. ÊAcme over in Berkeley taught me to love walnut bread, and Tartine does it really well. ÊThe cheese was great too. ÊIt's from a cute little dairy called Cypress Grove - one of my favorites. Ê My sandwich came with some apple slices, which went well with the theme: goat cheese, walnuts, and apples. ÊMy friends, however, came with pickled carrots, which were much more exciting. Ê I'll be back whenever I can, as long as someone else is paying. ÊThey may even get me to pry my wallet open for one of those delectable desserts...

I don't suppose there is much left to say about Tartine. Amazing pastries. I went on a dessert binge last week and almost came in my pants. I had the bread pudding (with seasonal fruits... peaches and berries when I got it): delicious. Then I could not refrain from trying a croissant (the French genes kicking in...), and I wasn't disappointed: flaky on the outside but buttery and moist on the inside... one of the better croissants I've had outside of France. I also got a taste of the chocolate pudding: very rich but delicious too. Expect a long line at pretty much anytime of day (but it's worth the wait), and you'll be lucky if you get a table. But it's only a block or two from Dolores Park if you want to get your pastries to go.

Update (02/11/07): Lines are still exasperatingly long, but I've discovered two new loves one savory one sweet I think this justifies the addition of an extra star. Finally got a chance to try the country bread loaf and to my luck it was just coming out of the oven. Yes I love it when things are perfectly timed. I had some camembert in the fridge and just slathered it on the loaf, it was the best midnight snack. My second love is the rocher, ordered mostly out of necessity as most of the sweets were gone and the pickings were slim. It was good but I would recommend just one as the sweetness can get overpowering. Original Review (8/19/06): I used to love coming here, that is until I had strategize and devise a scheme just to find a decent seat with my buddy. It's a bakery, so why should I have to act like I'm in a 007 flick just to sit for 10-15 minutes? Yes I definitely don't like the complacent folks that sit around hogging seats for those that don't intend to stay there long. I can't justify standing in line for 20 minutes either. But I'm going off on some bitter tangent. Here's what I love about Êtartine: It's a slice of France in the mission. The sharffenberger is a must try, the epitome of chocolate goodness. The tarts vary depending on the seasons, I lean towards the late summer/fall seasons when you can order a persimmon or pomegranate tart with a warm cup of coffee. ÊI also liked the passion fruit/coconut bavarian, and for the savory side try the croque-monsieur or butter croissants. I recommend going in the afternoon on a weekday when it is less likely to be packed. If it's a nice day out then do what i do, take it to go, and walk towards Dolores park.

While Tartine Bakery is definitely tasty, I'm not always in the mood for the hectic and crowded mayhem that greets you on a typical weekend at this fine establishment. Yes, the food is good, but is it really worth the 40 minute wait and mad rush to find a table? Not so sure. For those that haven't had the luxury of visiting "San Francisco's best bakery", know that you are in for a treat, but come at your own risk. The lines are INSANE and once you get your food, good luck finding a place to sit! I've now paid four homages to Tartine. The first time was on a week day after work, when I came to pick up a loaf of their freshly baked pain au levain. Apparently it comes out of the oven around 5. I was there by 5:30 and I got one of the last loaves. ..which are huge by the way. I also enjoyed two different flavors of meringue type cookies- one with cocoa nibs and the other a delicious almondy concoction. The second time I went to Tartine was on a Saturday morning around 11. And of course the lines were out the door. I had a lovely soy latte and the apple bread pudding. Their bread pudding is made with brioche. Why they can't sell this divine bread on it's own is beyond me. My third visit was again on a Saturday morning, but this time I was pleasantly surprised- at 10:30 I would have expected more chaos. Instead, the line was only slightly out the door, and it took only 15 minutes or so to order. ÊI tried the berry bread pudding, pain au chocolat, and banana cream tart. The pain au chocolat was buttery, flaky, and brimming with soft chunks of dark chocolate. The bread pudding was, of course, stellar, and the banana cream tart was amazing (although I was on such a sugar high from the first two delicacies, I didn't eat much of it). Most recently I went to try their famous frangipane almond croissant. And now I understand why it is famous and why you'd better get there early to ensure you get one. This pastry is one of the richest, most decadent and buttery creations imaginable. Even better than the pain au chocolat, whose taste I had previously thought to be insurmountable. The crispy, flaky, buttery delicacy is filled with an almond paste and topped with thinly sliced almonds. To summarize Tartine is an excellent and well frequented bakery, I'll be going back, although if I chose to return on a weekend, I'll prepare myself for a long wait.

Tartine is a favorite of mine- a real diamond in the Mission's very charming and culturally rich neighborhood. ÊThey are open 12 hrs/day 8am to 8pm and there is a constant flow of locals that try to time their visits to avoid the lines (which are evident at 8:05am on Sat/ Sun mornings). ÊMy favs include the coffee (yes it's that good), croissants (plain and almond), fresh juices - which run out quickly- but rest assured that in a few moments there will be another batch of fresh goodies emerging from the magical ovens. Their quiche, croque monsieur, bread pudding and tarts are all top-notch. ÊI love their angled ceiling mirror that gives you just enough of a glimpse behind the scenes as items flow from oven to cooling-rack to display window to your plate in seconds! Ê Best new discovery- the Rocher with cocoa nibs (a meringue with a caffeine kick that pairs perfectly with their coffee) Ambiance: Well lit with huge windows, outside seating in limited, silverware and paper napkins Cost: $12-15

I try to be a good guest when I am invited to dinner parties; I bring the host some desert from Tartine Bakery. ÊChocolate mousse, chocolate pudding and banana crme tart are great for sharing after dinner. Tartine Bakery is famous with its croissants too. On a warm day, I love stopping by here to pick up croissants and coffee, walk over to Dolores Park for some people watching and enjoy my picnic. Some of my friends love their 5pm freshly baked walnut bread. I will recommend that if you do not mind the wait. Parking is horrible in this neighborhood.

Dang, no wonder this place is such a big deal. ÊEven before you step into the store, you can start to smell that delicious fresh-baked bread smell as you walk up to this little bakery.

With 1000 reviews already in place, I know I will just be echoing everyone else's sentiments: ÊTHIS PLACE ROCKS MY WORLD!!! ÊI can't seem to walk out of there without a box of pastries (that I reluctantly share) and something in my hand to munch on while I exit because standing in line and smelling all that baked goodness is enough to make me ravenously hungry! ÊI love the seasonal bread puddings - always moist, tender and perfectly sweetened. ÊThe open-faced croque monsieur Êis positively delicious (almost a religious experience for me). ÊThe scharffenberger chocolate pudding is rich without being cloying. ÊThose morning buns have a way of putting me in a super good mood. ÊI don't know that you can have a bad anything at tartine, so just pick anything up and walk yourself over to Dolores Park to relax and enjoy the fact that Tartine exists to make us these tasty treats!

Tartine definitely has an impressive reputation, I'd heard of it before even moving to SF! Still, the idea of spending an hour or more of my weekend waiting in line isn't very appealing so I hadn't been until yesterday. Well I wasn't the least bit disappointed! There wasn't a single item in the pastry case that didn't look incredibly yummy. I settled for a really excellent piece of chocolate cake and the pressed pastrami sandwich, although the croque monsieur was incredibly tempting. I wasn't a fan of the ridiculous amount of horseradish on my sandwich, but my companion's ham sandwich was seriously tasty. The thick, soft, bread they use is just perfect. Next time it's definitely another sweet treat and the croque monsieur for me!

Def. one of the best places to get pastries around. But I was with my old boss the other day and he's like "I just want to tell the owners that if they they would work faster they could get more people in and wouldn't have to raise prices all the time." He's got a point. I mean, I'll give it up for Tartine- even $4.00 for their plain croissant! But come onnnnnn. Why the hell is everyone there so slow? I was in there last week with an industry friend and we were seriously shocked at how shabby the staff was. I've also heard they don't pay well, which would explain a lot. However, speaking quality, Tartine is the shit and can do whatever they want....and probably will continue to do so.

Shopping List: Ê 2 - Ê4" Frangipane Tarts: Ê Ê $12.50 Ê 1 - 10" Tres Leches Cake: Ê$62.00 We rode in an uncomfortably packed J-Line Muni, and got off on Church & 18th Street.

ÊAfter a few sips we realized the staff was starting to close up for the day. ÊI went to the cashier and before I could say anything, she said with a saccharin smile, "We're closed." "Oh, can we still buy a cake?" I asked. She flippantly responded, "Not really. ÊWe've been closed for 10 minutes." Instead of leaving with tarts and a cake, we left with a full dose of sour service. ÊDon't let the waitress's red hair and porcelain-like skin fool you. ÊShe delivers service like KGW: Kim-chi Gone Wrong.

Went back there three more times for desserts to go, so just wanted to update my review. Finally got their loaf of country bread. I think it was $7 and it was a heavy piece of thing! It was warm and the crust was really crunchy and the inside was chewy goodness! However the crust was a bit on the hard side. I could see myself chipping a tooth if I wasn't careful. But it was so good, that wouldn't stop me. The mexican cookie was eh. I also had the almond rocher and the cocoa nib rocher. It has this light texture that's chewy at the same time. Really good and a great deal at 85 cents a pop. All the times except the first time, I was in search of the morning bun...and they ran out each time :( Ê Oh if you are at Tartine's, drop by next door to Pizza Delfina. Dee-lish!

I keep falling in and out of love with Tartine. Sometimes their food is really good other times it's disappointing. The last time we came we had the frangipane tart and coconut tart. The frangipane tart was really dry and you could barely taste the fruit. The crust was almost impossible to break through. The coconut tart was pretty good because the bottom of the crust cup is layered with dark chocolate. The coconut filling is good too but we had the same problem with the indestructible crust. I think we'll stay away from the tarts for now.

The croissant here is the best I have ever had outside of France...maybe even better--something to truly crave. Everything here is amazing..the only downside is that it is small so getting a table can be a bit of a hassle...and on the weekends if you show up in the latter part of the morning the line is intimidating. ÊSo go early. The bread (which I've had at Delfina) is something to be tried at least once...I'm trying to recreate it using their cookbook but no luck so far.

On a recent trip to S.F., I made a special trip to Tartine based on the rave reviews on Yelp, standing in line outside the bakery in the cold. I really didn't taste what all the fuss was about. The pastries are pretty, but in no way to they compare in flavor and texture to the fine confections served at any of the neighborhood boulangeries near my flat in Paris. The croissants didn't have the same chewiness and bite. The tarts didn't have the balance of flavor. And the bread pudding was just okay. Everything was pretty pricey too, and it's so hard to get a table there.

There is no need for more mention of Tartine's myriad annoyances so I'm basing this review solely on its positive attributes. Like the bread pudding, which is only sometimes too soggy, and the morning buns, which are only sometimes supported by a coaster of burnt syrup, and the sopressata, fontina, broccoli rabe pesto sandwich that is so so good and packs a wonderfully spicy wallop in every other bite. But the main attraction at Tartine for me is the idiazabal and membrillo sandwich, which is inconsistent but is the only dish to incorporate membrillo that I have ever found since being introduced to the stuff. I prefer to pair membrillo with manchego, but the idiazabal is a fine substitute and really, being served membrillo makes me so happy that they could give it to me on a cracker and I'd be thrilled. One word of warning: watch out for the gougeres. I don't know if the Tartine version is a warped version of a good thing but I've purchased these several times in the hopes of biting into a crispy ball of peppery cheesiness only to be stuck with a burnt ball of crust with a soggy base of wet dough. Despite the painful weekend lines and other minor irritations, I'm glad Tartine is there when I need it. edited after my return to Tartine after an eight month separation: Cake aux olives. Get it. Not only did I not have to wait for even a minute for a table but something pushed me to try this for the first time and it was worth it a million times over. Not too wet and eggy, just perfectly cooked with pieces of olives and pancetta. I also must pay some lip service to the previously neglected scones, which are the only ones I've ever had coated in rock sugar and consequently are the best I've ever had as well.

Everybody loves a french bakery! ÊHow can you resist all those pastry delicacies in the windowed case? You can't. ÊThis is one of SF's really good frenchy bakeries, of which we seem to have a growing number (thanks in part to Bay Bread). ÊI tried the pastrami pressed sandwich which was very large, nicely crusted on the outside and filled with lots of gruyere, pastrami and a spicy dijon horseradish mustard. ÊWhenever I go to a french bakery, I always get a few extra things to take home with me and so I also got a slice of quiche lorraine and a croissant filled with ham and cheese to go, both excellent.

I don't get the hype...at all. I went on a saturday for brunch, but ended up having a late lunch instead. ÊIt took quite a while to find parking (to be expected of course), but this review is not based on the impossible parking, only the food and service.

This is easily the best bakery in San Francisco. I would recommend every single thing, but my favorites are the ham sandwiches, the banana cream pie, and the chocolate pudding. The bakery is less crowded during weekday afternoons, and is much more pleasant if you can get a table, especially one with a view, so you can watch all the women in their yoga pants come in and throw back 1,000 calories. Seriously, though. This place is infested with beautiful, toned ladies, who are serious about their pastries. They know what they want, and they've obviously been here before. Maybe this is the one caloric splurge in their otherwise immaculate diet. (??) Try living with one of the managers, you'll start thinking you ARE a morning bun.

I have to agree with the other one star reviews - the food is good but not worth the trouble. ÊFighting rude patrons some with strollers who are pushing their way in completely ignoring the fact there is a line and you can't move forward so stop pushing the stroller into my ankles before I kick it. ÊGet to the counter to deal with rude staff who think they are doing you a favor by charging exorbitant rates for baked goods and sandwiches.

ÊFighting your way back out and trying to decide if you should stoop on the curb and eat since there is no where to sit Êor if you do find a space inside, you get elbowed and bumped the entire time you are eating.

Over priced, over rated, bad service, and not worth the hype. This seriously has to be one of the most over rated places to eat in the city. Ê I have many many MANY gripes with this place.

ÊIt's not a big deal, but whatever.... What's important is that the food isn't really that great. ÊAnything that has to be prepared (e.g. the sandwiches) takes a good hour before the androgynous hipster will bring you your food. ÊWhich will undoubtedly suffer from one or both of two perils, it's cold or slathered with a pound of dijon mustard. The pastries are ho hum, I've had some that are kick ass, but I've also had some that I had to spit out right away. As with a lot of things in the mission these days, the hype is way too much to handle and ultimately the restaurant just doesn't deliver.

Croissants cost $2.75 and chocolate croissant $3.25. ÊThe bakery has just found a way to reduce the endless line of customers.

ÊNever in my life have I seen a 30 minutes wait to get a piece of bread or a croissant. ÊSo yes the food is somehow good but not worth the wait, the price and the always disagreeable service. A few words on the almond croissant, it is nothing close to the fabulous version we can find at Bay bread and all their bakeries. Tartine's almond croissant has no filling and is slightly burnt and dry. ÊIt now costs $3.25, what a joke. Another reason for one star, this place often runs out of croissant early in the morning, they run out of bread very quickly after releasing them from the hot oven. ÊThey have many waiters at the counter but often only one behind the cashier so people just wait with the food lining up behind the cashier. ÊAt one point I have seen the entire store full of customers just waiting to pay. ÊThese problems are not new and the manager/owner doesn't seem to be worried about it. ÊThey could have a fast line or something, no they prefer to keep their customers wasting their time in line. ÊOnce I tried to give the exact change to the waiter after ordering a pastry but she insisted I had to go to the cashier before paying and before getting my pastry. ÊThey are simply careless about their customers and the great food doesn't appeal to me anymore because of that.

Go mid-week, around 10 or 11 am for utter deliciousness. ÊFour Barrel espresso drinks. ÊCloser to the cashier is where they keep the savory pastries and croque-monsieur. ÊThis is heaven when there isn't a long-ass line, hellish when there is.

I'm with Michael E on this one. I finally gathered up the courage to wait in the 20 minute line to try a dessert and grab some coffee. I tried their Mango/Coconut tart and had a double cap. Coffee was fine and the tart was ok. I'd love to try more of their stuff, they had so many tasty looking things. However, I think the hype and wait for this place is a bit out of control...I can't deal.

lovelovelove in the form of pastries & open faced sandwiches. the perfect place to have lunch and dessert all at once. (eat outdoors if you can). and then walk down to delfina & bi-rite creamery for dinner and dessert. this has got to be the yummiest street in all of san francisco. you can't go wrong with any of the chocolate desserts, and it is blasphemous not to order the banana cream tart. thanks for never being busy (but always tasty!) when i go :).

my friend brought me here once for lunch and yes, packed, but we got a seat right away. there is a fast turnaround as long as you're not waiting for the table where there's a guy with a full cup of coffee, a half eaten tart and a book in his hand. we both had the sandwiches, and it was dee-lish-ous! it was a fork and knife sandwich and i was so stuffed i didn't have room for dessert ... at that time. i bought a dozen of different items and shared it with the coworkers. oh and this place is really close to dolores park, so on a sunny day, why not take your food to go if there are no seats?

#25 of 100 on 7x7's The Big Eat SF 2009: Loaf of bread straight out of the oven at Tartine (bonus: sliced while still warm and slathered with Brillat- Savarin cheese from Bi-Rite, down the block) http://bit.ly/1VmqYA #25 of 100 on 7x7's The Big Eat SF 2010: Loaf of bread straight out of the oven at Tartine http://bit.ly/a1POhh OH MY GOD. $7 loaf of bread + $7 Brillat-Savarin cheese. Kind of pricey for a fella who enjoys kraft singles and wonderbread, but I'm willing to splurge every once and a while. Despite the long line, this is worth it. The bread is delicious (we showed up around 5pm to get some of their fresh sesame bread) and the cheese from Bi-Rite sealed the deal. Brillat-Savarin would be more popular than Brie if it was easier to pronounce, since it is a totally creamier and tastier triple-cream. I don't think I can ever go back. My recommendation? Get some bread and cheese and eat it at Dolores Park. You don't need to be a hipster to do this.

I love sweets. I'm a carbohydrate whore, I'm not going to lie to you on that. Tartine is rarely passed up if I'm going through this neighborhood (especially if one can find a parking space). If there was hail the size of golf balls, and a line stretching around the block at Tartine, and I found a parking space, I'd take the bruises and scrapes, and perhaps even those moment of unconsciousness for a dessert. I have yet to go wrong with anything at this place, from their delightful bread pudding (man oh man, it always calls my name with a sexy European accent) to the gougeres. I was in here yesterday with a friend of mine who doesn't really like sweets (yes, he's a heathen, I know) and I sit down indoors (there was no line when we strolled in, for a rare change) and I get a slice of their almond lemon poppyseed pound cake, and a cafe au lait. I of course, being the lady that I am, offer up a bite to my friend, along with the offer to buy him something, and he declines. As I start to nibble away at the slice, he says "wait...let me try some of that" and proceeds to eat some of my cake. He does this often, so I forgive him. After a telephone with my mother, where she politely demands that I bring her back something, and another round in line, we exit with another slice of cake, and a gougere. Walking down 18th, tearing off pieces of it to hand to my friend, he stops and pauses and says, "Wait, can we go back and get another one?" Yes my friends, it's THAT good. I want to move in here, and gain 50 pounds from the butter and sugar alone. It'd be worth each and every calorie. I have never had a problem with service here, though the line and location can get crazed from time to time, it's worth it. Also, all their to-go containers are biodegradable, they care about the environment AND they taste good.

Thursday 11:36-11:44am. some thoughts in my head while waiting in line at Tartine: ....oh there's always a line here...i wonder if they have ever considered expanding the place....i love their bread pudding...it's thursday freaking morning! doesn't anyone work in this town?...i don't care...i can wait...it's worth it for the bread pudding...BREAD PUDDING!!!....but seriously is there ever a time that this place doesn't have a line out the door. i wonder what they put in the bread pudding that makes it so good....hmmm. yeah, a latte. they make really good lattes. organic coffee and organic milk...i hope they aren't out of the bread pudding...haha...that older lady is reading a copy of the onion.... funny...oh...hmmmm...double latte...oh, and i love milk over the bread pudding!!!....i definitely want the bread pudding...great! we can share an open faced sandwich AND the bread pudding....that makes me feel less guilty about eating a whole bread pudding...oh no, did i park my car in a street cleaning zone?...i better go make sure...BREAD PUDDING, BREAD PUDDING, BREAD PUDDING....wonder where we can sit?...if that person moved over to the table with the other single person we could sit there...oh bread pudding!...well we can sit outside too. there's a few empty tables outside....better go get one....a bowl of bread pudding...most definitely....

To the tall hipster chic with the short blonde hair, I'm sorry I annoyed you by buying 5 items for a surprise b-day breakfast for my love. I'm sorry I asked if there were any morning buns because after you proclaimed, "What you see out is what we have" I realized how stupid my question was. I'm sorry that I then decided to get a berry torte, because you clearly wanted me to go away. I'm also sorry that when the morning buns showed up 15 seconds later, I said yes to wanting one when you asked me, which made you roll your eyes. I'm really sorry I made you roll your eyes...that takes a lot of effort. I'm sorry that you apparently hate your job and hate all the people that come into the bakery. I guess you have a habit of doing this (or so my boyfriend says..he knew who you were right off the bat) so it must really bother you when people come in to buy Tartine's delicious baked goods. You're obviously too cool for school. Tartine = 5 Stars Tall hipster chic w/ short blonde hair = 0 Stars.

I was jogging with my friend David when it came to me: my ideal day. It would be an entire day spent at Tartine. I would begin with the morning bun and a latte and catch up on three months of unread New Yorkers. When lunch rolled around, I would order one of the hot pressed sandwiches, perhaps the mozzarella and tapenade. Then I might take a walk around Dolores Park to work up my appetite, and return for a mid-afternoon snack of bread pudding. As evening set in, I'd shift to the wine bar. Then I realized it --- this was an achievable dream. I told a half dozen or so friends I'd be at Tartine, and said they should drop by during the day. Yesterday was the day. I began with a large latte, which came in a big white bowl and was made with Mr. Espresso coffee. The morning bun was as good as I'd remembered it --- flaky, buttery pastry with caramelized, crunchy sugar and a hint of orange. My friends Sheila and Chris showed up, with their dog, Simon, then my friend Emily. We sat on a bench outside and talked about how difficult the semester had been. Then we headed to Dolores Park, where Simon ran around, played catch and made friends with some of the other dogs. David showed up, and we went to Pizzeria Delfina for lunch, a small but worthwhile diversion from my all-day Tartine plan. We returned to Tartine after lunch, and met my sister and Kelly. Katie and David both got the bread pudding. There were two choices: one topped with banana, and the other topped with seasonal fruit; yesterday, it was strawberry. The small-sized serving comes in a coffee cup. It's not big, but it's enough, because the pudding, made from the bakery's house made brioche, is so rich. Five o'clock rolled around, and I was getting a little tired. I decided to save the wine bar for another day. But before I left, I picked up a banana cream tart, some macaroons and a few meringues with cocoa nibs and took them over to Emily's. We sat on her sofa and devoured the tart. It was delicious, as everything I have eaten at Tartine has been. The bananas are lightly blanketed in a caramel sauce, and tucked into a flaky pastry shell lined with dark chocolate. This whole concoction is topped with freshly whipped cream and shaved chocolate. Steven showed up a little later, and we gave him some of the macaroons and meringues. I still had a couple meringues left over, so I ate one for breakfast this morning. Kelly introduced me to them, and I am glad she did. The meringue is crunchy and sweet on the outside, and a bit sticky and gooey on the inside. Its sweetness is cut with the earthiness and crunch of the cacao nibs. I never did get to any of my New Yorkers, but it was a great day, and a perfect end to the semester.

This is by far my favorite bakery in SF! ÊWhile some of my friends have complained about the line, in my opinion it is well worth the wait. ÊTheir almond croissants are the best outside of France and their morning buns are scrumptious! ÊI have enjoyed almost everything from this bakery including their lattes. ÊMy only wish is that they had more space to sit down because fighting over chairs when you are trying to eat your heavenly croissant is not fun!

Now I know anybody who has ever tried Tartine loves it soooo much and I'd be a liar if I said I didn't (their morning buns are almost too amazing for words and they have fantastic sandwiches), but the line and crowded atmosphere are a little overwhelming.

So, if you make it there on an off time (almost never) it's great, although their coffee leaves quite a bit to be desired...

Despite the fact that its always shoulder to shoulder crowded, line out the door with hungry sweet-toothed peeps... the girls at the counter always manage to be super efficient in a very friendly way. Not that fake, i have to smile because my boss said so, friendly but genuinely friendly as in they manage to chit chat with you during the split second you have to order your morning buns. Kudos to that! I mean, that's some serious skill. So mouth watering treats AND cool people is totally five stars in my book.

tartine takes the morning bun to a whole new level of goodness. Êi usually pick one up on my way to work at least every other week. Êthe coffee is awesome too, but i wish they had larger to-go cups. Êalso, the employees are very nice and laid-back, they don't seem to annoyed with their jobs. not too crazy about their sandwiches... i had a croque monsieur once and it was over cooked... to the point where was no trace of goo left in the cheese. if you have issues about your personal space, avoid this place like the plague on the weekends. Ê ps: if you decide to dine-in, please be considerate and spend the appropriate amount of time at your table.

Amazing. Perfect for when you feel like going to Paris, but can't quite make it there. Probably best not to live near it if you have a weakness for delicious pastries and don't have a fast metabolism. It is really hard to resist! Be prepared for a line.

my mom was the person who introduced tartine to me. Êafter going to the flower markets early in the mornings on saturdays, she would treat herself (and the fam) to bags and boxes full of baked goodies! sure, the boxes and bags were grease soaked by the time they arrived, but holy cow... i always felt so lucky to get something so decadent for brunch! the trick is to cut everything you buy into quarters so that you can ration it out and try to spread out the intake of heavy richness throughout the day (if it can last that long). Êeverything is good and nothing is "little" or small in taste. Ê the sweets (croissants, dense cookies, scones ets) and savories (filled croissants, quiches, pizza-thingys etc) are all worth the wait in line or the wait for arrival! Êthankfully, i haven't really had to deal with the massive lines (unless it was during a festival or peak hours) nor the attitudes at the counter (just impatience and a bit of pride). Êall the more reason to visit the parents more!!! Êwho wants to deal with the hassle of finding parking, waiting in line and ordering when mom can do it for you? Ê(i'm such a brat!)

Great pastries, but totally not worth the wait. First, you have to hope that someone will get up. Second, you're lucky if you can sit in privacy. Third...it's just a hot mess filled with yummy pastries. Seriously. Ê There's a lot of hype about this place and I can see why: Mission District with "cool people". I'm not cool and I don't live in the Mission, so it's really an inconvenience to go to a place like this.

The line is always so long every time I come here, especially on the weekends. But the food is so yummy that I'll just have sacrifice the waiting time. My favorite is their chocolate croissant.

I do not want to come across as this bitter, curmudgeonly discontent. I once loved the product that came out of this place. Oh yes, and I do know that a lot of you fancy your sweets and from the looks of it you will stand in line for what amounts to an eternity. Not I, never again, this spot does not justify me spending a half-hour of my day, immovably fixed, just so I can get me a sugar high. I have my reasons for avoiding this corner (at all costs). So many reasons in fact, that I have compiled a small list that I wish to share with any that are interested. If you are ready...here it goes. 1.) The Wait: ÊI don't know about you but when I see a line, oh say, out the door and then half way down the block. It does not prompt me to want and stand in it. All I know is that hair grows faster than this line moves. I am not sure if a long line indicates phenomenal fare or sluggish service. I now tend to think the latter applies...which leads me to... 2.) Customer Service: ÊThere has never been or ever will be, a slower moving set of servers then these overworked, "pastry punks". You'll have better luck washing a cat (if you've ever tried washing a cat, then you know what I'm talking about), then having any one of the lovely ladies move any faster then they necessarily have to. I have never once seen this place use both cash registers. Which can be rather annoying. I'm not sure if the employees here are burned out by the time they finally get to me or just simply jaded to the entire customer service angle. They seem to under staff purposely, just to have the patrons (suckers) loiter around like a pack of ravenous animals, waiting for their rations. And speaking of loitering... 3.) Deplorable Design: The layout of this joint, renders it nearly imposable to even begin to obtain any semblance of contentment. If you are lucky enough to find a seat, chances are you arrived right when they opened and sprayed your spot (like the dog that you are) to make sure that no one else would stake your claim. Then once you have your seat, it makes it very hard to give it up. So, those that have claimed their center of operations, end up lingering for much longer then they normally would. I completely understand why people loiter for as long as they do. It's like when you were a kid and your cousin wanted to play with a toy that died at the bottom of your toy box and you have not touched it in who knows, how long. Suddenly, you become maniacally possessive over this thing and you wont hear of anyone merely gazing at it. But I digress (or regress). This is what it's like at Tartine. For those of us/you who are of the unfortunate, just hang around until you find your own. Oh, and good luck... 4.) The Guilt: Now, I'm not sure how many of you are of either the Catholic or Jewish persuasion, but I must say this...guilt is something I assume a lot of us live with (on so many levels) and feeling guilty for something as pleasurable as consuming amazingly crafted treats, is but a small price to pay when compared to the other guilty pleasures of life. Like, religiously watching re-runs of Zena, Warrior Princess on Lifetime or The Oxygen Channel. Anyway, I have to admit, when I was a patron, I always felt a pang of guilt, not only because of the vast caloric intake but also because of the truly shitty experience I had just imposed upon myself. Well...I've learned that you do not have to be treated like a complete imbecile in order to receive decent service and product, no matter how tasty the tidbits may be. Wow, I feel much better now that I have gotten this off my chest. Whew, thanks for listening...how much do I owe you?

After avoiding the ominous line out front for months I finally decided to give Tartines a try today. ÊI was kind of disappointed. ÊThe quiche is good, the pastries look incredible, and the espresso rocked but alas, the place is full of table vultures. ÊThese are hideous creatures that pounce on open tables with their trendy purses and claim them for themselves even if they are still in line outside. ÊWTF? ÊIf someone would invent a table vulture spray that I could use here I will gladly take Tartines to 4 stars, until then...caCAW CaCAW bitches!

It gets a little crazy-bananas on the weekend. It is indeed worth the wait, but if at all possible I'd recommend avoiding it during peak hours. Unless you have extreme patience and can meditate in line. Aside from that, this is the best bakery I've encountered in San Francisco. Their crossaints are authentic, the homemade bread is phenomenal and the pastries are super good and not too sweet. It is a husband and wife team, which is awesome. I hear they are opening another bakery and a restaurant as well. ÊYum yum.

After circling Coffee Bar for 30 minutes looking for parking at close to 10am today - no coffee pumping through my veins for THREE hours after waking up - on the last lap, I told myself, "if you don't find a spot, recoup your cranky mood, peal out with a big skid mark, and burn rubber to Tartine. If there's a spot out front, you're meant to eat a stick of butter coated in sugar and cinnamon (aka a Morning Bun), and should not feel one iota of guilt." That's how good Tartine is. The one thousand calorie tic tac ... the splurge that makes pms, bad drivers, no parking, and one red light after another, worth every single bite. Good to the last crumb.

When i go here i know to always expect a line, which i think is an indicator of how popular and good it is. The whole place has Êa really cool ambience. People sit there and chat with their coffees or read their newspaper. One time i went in there, there was two ladies eating a sampling of like 5 desserts...EACH. If i had enough stamina to stomach that much sugar i'd do it too. Anyway, everything there is pretty good, hot chocolate is nice, as well as the mousse, but the sole reason i go there is for their ultra delicious, yummy, flaky, tart in your mouth lemon bar. It really is the best lemon bar that i've ever had. I may be biased because i love lemon flavored stuff, but it really is a great mixture of just enough lemon flavor and yummy crust. It's definitely something you have to try if you stop by.

I made a special trip here last time I was in San Francisco. This place is so rustic in its appearance and food, which I absolutely adore. I'm a huge organic fan, so I really appreciate that they use local, organic ingredients whenever possible. The croissants are just incredible. They are flaky and slightly crispy on the outside and soft, buttery, with distinct layers on the inside. I had to wait in a long line, but it was well worth the wait!

Had an awesome lunch. Figured there was no way it was going to live up to all the hype, and I was prepared to go away disappointed and feeling way too full for 1pm. But I couldn't have been more pleased. Turkey sandwich was exceptional, and it came out as three huge slices featuring their house bread. Totally delicious and my dining companions felt the same way regarding their croissant and sandwiches. There was a bit of a wait, and it is hard to find a table, but it was worth it.

Tartine is the little cafe of my dreams that I would love to open up one day for myself. The small, corner location is ideal for weekend brunches or even just a quick pastry on the go before work. The presentation is clean and simple in the bakery case and each item screams out richness and decadence. A personal favorite of mine is the passion fruit bavarian cake covered in toasted coconut. The cake is always moist and soft and counters the creamy and tart bavarian perfectly. I love watching the action in the back behind the counter as the bakers keep the baked goods flowing to the front. One day, I will have my own place and I can only hope it be half as good as Tartine.

let me start this review off by saying that i have never EVER been crapped on by a bird in my life...... so one day while waiting in the ridiculous line that always encompasses the surroundings of tartine before it even opens something hit my head. a couple minutes go by and again, something hits my head. what the eff! i look up and there's a disgusting pigeon shovelling old bird crap over the side of the ledge and onto my head! that was uncool to say the least! anyway, no deducted points for that since it was external and not quite tartine's fault. and i will still claim that i have not been crapped upon. i have had crap pushed upon me, but no fresh stuff so far. my fingers will be crossed for life! anyway, tartine has some of the best paninis i've ever had. blanc and banana is my favorite! fromage blanc with jam and bananas on their bread, SO good! their almond croissants are unbeatable, no doubt. i haven't found anything nearly as delicious and gigantic as theirs. and the chocolate pudding is silky as can be. i don't even enjoy chocolate pudding all that much but tartine's i will eat. oh and their morning buns! when they come right out of the oven i feel giddy! this place makes me excited!

This place has great food. I love how it is located in a rather inconspicous corner; you can find it based on all the people waiting in line! The morning bun I had was delicious; it's made like a cinnamon roll dipped in sugar. The BF had the banana cream tart which he said was amazing too, especially with its caramel at the bottom. As we were leaving we asked about the bread they make daily and it turned out they made some of it earlier that day so we bought one. I thought it was a little expensive @ $7 but it stayed warm in the car for at least an hour and smelled absolutely divine. Delicious!

I thought Tartine would be another overhyped place especially since it was on the 100 things to try in SF but it is not! Parking is troublesome but the atmosphere inside is relaxed yet upbeat. We waited in line and ordered the morning bun since it was recommended as the must eat and also a cup of bread pudding. I have never been a fan of bread pudding and tried to persuade my mom to choose something else but she was determined. Thankfully she is sometimes stubborn because I tried it and loved it! The rich flavor of egg is delicious and the bread really soaked up the concoction well. My morning bun was a little hard but it was to give a good texture and a bite to the delicious fistful of sugar! Really enjoyed our quick treats :)

Morning bun: sugary, sweet, & delicious!!!! ÊWell worth the $3 bucks spent. :) ÊI went on a weekday before work, and it was already crowded. ÊI can imagine how much more crowded it would be on a Saturday or Sunday morning. ÊThey had other desserts there that looked really, really good too. ÊI can't wait to come back and try them. Ê:)

The line went out the door but my Membrillo & Idiazabal sandwich made it all worth it. Why didn't I think to smother freshly baked bread with a lightly smoked sheep's milk cheese and quince jam? We shared a breakfast roll and a chocolate croissant. Excellent and excellent! The cocoa was a little weak but the service was nice and the food was delicious. It's a little pricey for pastry and sandwiches but you're definitely paying for baked goods that are a step above average.

Tartine........such a sweet, delicious name (It means a french open-faced sandwich) for a bakery/cafe that is so delicious, I could eat the walls. Its enticing aroma is evident at least half way down the block and across the street. I actually feel sorry for the people that live on its block--if I did, I would weigh probably over 200 lbs! EVERYTHING and I mean EVERYTHING is so finger licking delicious, you can't go wrong ordering anything on its large hard-to-decide-what-to eat menu. For me, it is easy..The Bread pudding!!! I CRAVE the bread pudding( so yummy--they use brioche bread)..... and I love the seasonal fruit topping, which is always such a nice surprise to see which fruit is selected when I order mine. My favorite is the peach/blueberry topping, then the strawberry. Everyone that works there is amazing and wonderful. I love Trevor, Aaron, Josh, Kerry and Nathan. They are the BEST! So, if you live in SF and have never experienced a journey to Tartine at least once..SHAME ON YOU!!! I own BOTH their amazing books ( CHAD, you blow me away with your bread. PERIOD!!) their really cool Tartine cloth cross-body bag, that I wear everyday! CHAD, please excuse me when I say ( and I hope I have your permission) I WANT TO MARRY TARTINE! ( and I promise I will be faithful and never complain of a headache :-)

the wait is pretty atrocious and they do sell out of items quickly (damn you! i wanted to try the banana cream tart and morning buns), however, the offerings we had were pretty good. - ham and cheese croissant: delicious! Êtheir croissants rock! - gougere: heaven on earth - croque monsieur: good, would have been awesome if freshly out of the oven - frangipane tart: the least favorite of mine. Êkinda bland imo.

Their banana-cream pie can mend a broken heart. The eclair is comparable to cuddling a small puppy, and sometimes better. I've never tasted something that instantly turned me on, until I met their Lemon bar. From the cakes to the bread- it's all good. Clear your schedule though- you're bound to be waiting in line for awhile. Bring someone to flirt with and the line will move nicely.

So! I woke up this morning, a brand New Year and decided to go for a bit of an adventure - trek over to the mission and have a double chocolate valrohna croissant (or pain au chocolat) some of their organic coffee and a piece of quiche to go for lunch later... I had gone to Tartine when it first opened years ago and thought it was "o.k." but since then it has won a number of awards and I saw a clip on the Food channel about their pain au chocolat...and thought I have to try this again! ÊI had put this off for about 6 months but today was the day. ÊYes there was a line - but no biggie as long as the food warrants the wait. ÊOrdered my pain au chocolat, a piece of chard chantrelle quiche and a cappucino. Ê Are you ready? ÊYes, indeed the pain au chocolat was light, obviously had a lot of butter and chocolate - but was completely, and I mean completely tasteless. ÊI don't know if they left out the salt or they just think the fact that it's high quality chocolate that it should do the trick but trust me quality chocolate that is tasteless doesn't cut it - ÊI have spent a lot of time in France including a year living in Paris and 22+ years in San Francisco, and not only do I know my chocolate but I also know my pain au chocolat...this was so mediocre I didn't even finish it. ÊI kept taking a bite hoping it would get better, that I would taste something other than buttery pastry with a chocolate tasteless goo but had no luck. ÊAnd a note on the cappucino I ordered? ÊNo foam - what kind of cappucino is just milk and espresso - yes, it was smooth but if I had wanted a latte I would have ordered a latte. Ê The quiche? ÊIt was o.k. but nothing compared to the very light oh so delicious quiche at Castagna on Chestnut and Fillmore - a new authentic French bistro owned and run by two French brothers (one a chef). Ê I am writing their review next given I have visited this restarurant 4 times in the last month. ÊTartine? Just not the best experience all around but glad I went and got it out of my system :). Ê By the way Roses Cafe at Union and Steiner has very tasty Êpain au chocolat Êif you are in the mood....Roses will be my go to spot in the future for a pain au chocolat craving.

Not much I can say that will be any different from the hundreds of other reviewers, so I'll just keep this one short.

Be ready to wait in a long line, so hope your sweet tooth is patient! It was worth the wait when I ate my Chocolate Hazel nut tart but only because they no longer had any other tarts available! The lady said they were really busy today, I thought..."aren't you always busy, shouldn't you be prepared." Anyways, I really wanted a banana cream pie tart but they were out so I settled for the chocolate hazelnut and was not disappointed. The chocolate was moist and sweet and the crust was to die for! My sister got the fruit tart and this was just as delicious! The peaches were just the right amount of sweetness with the same crust as my chocolate tart. $6.50 is kind of pricey to me but I guess you're in SF and it's convenient...close to Dolores park. Not a lot of sitting room, so be prepared to take your dessert to go. Overall, will return if I'm in the area but wouldn't make a special trip out here.

ÊWHAT THE HELL WAS I THINKING!?!??!?

ÊMORE ÊCROSSAINTS, PRESSED SANDWICHES AND DELICIOUSNESS FOR MEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!! *******previous, idiotic review by me below******* Ê i was told that the crossaints here were amazing. Êbut we didn't get the crossaints. Êmaybe that was the mistake. Êi got the open faced sandwich which was pretty good. Êbut the desserts were pretty average.

tartine- the ultimate "make it all better" place- y'know the feeling guys, you say/do something stupid, your girlfriend is more pissed than Kanye not winning an MTV music award, and the look of luvin' ain't the twinkling you see in her eyes... what are you going to do? One answer- Tartine her. With more orgasmo-chocolate options than anyplace in the ferrybuilding, you can instantly make it all better with _anything_ you get here- chocolate pudding, chocolate cakes, Êeven chocolate choclate- and watching those amazing bakery mavens frost those Êcakes is easily the hottest food-porn you'll Êever see- and its live dammit! As the waves of choco-extacy crash over her, all unhappiness is forgotten, and you're in like flynn....for the moment. The morning buns are awesome, the mochas there taste like liquid dark chocolate, and the Ham and Gruyere pressed sandwhich is more than worth the trip over from across the city (I do it all the time). Just be prepared to wait in line- its worth it. Oh, and if you see an open table- jump on it like a tickle me elmo, once it gone, its gone baby gone.

"That Damn Tartine." is how my new friend refers to this establishment. i assumed she was calling it that for the uppity crowd that it attracts. but she called it that because they are always out of exactly what you are looking for, or have just closed the doors, or the line is too long. personally, i just want to have a seizure when i go near the clientele. the conversations i've had to endure while waiting in line have spooked me away from this place. this place. that damn tartine.

i'm always at la boulangerie. Êafter hanging out in dolores park and 45 minutes after ice cream at bi rite, i was craving something more savory to eat. Êso, we hit tartine. Ênone of the sweets sang to me. Êthe toasted sammiches, well, to borrow from that love to hate rachel ray, "yum-o". Êthat's the only way to describe the delicious proscuitto/provolone/arugala sammich i had. Êthere were THREE sammiches in one order. hello? portion control anyone? not that iw as complaining. Êevery bite was delicious. Êthe saltiness of the meat, the perfect crunchiness of the bread. Êoh, i wanted to save a bite for maybe a snack or lunch tomorrow, but nope, i devoured it all. the croque monsieur was, imho, not as good. Êthe bread was superthick, and the tomatoes threw it off-- tasted like pizza. i like my croque mosieurs a bit more virgin than all gussied up. Êbut, put it in front of me and i won't refuse it.

OK, so the less-one star is for portions. They are HUMONGOUS. And frankly, unnecessarily so. For $14.24 I ordered the sorpressata (pls excuse sp) and was given a big box with Êthree huge half-sandwiches inside. I would much rather pay $10 for two. Oh well, maybe they make 'em so big so you'll give the rest to a street person. Remind me to hang out near here when I'm homeless! Other than the outrageous portion size, I thought I had died and gone to sandwich heaven. Crusty, buttery grilled bread and a house of happy inside. Don't even know what's in it. Don't care.

i was so impressed with Tartine that i bought the cookbook and tried making some of dessert at home. I have successfully made the Lemon Meringue cake! The lemon cream on this cake is just heavenly. The combination of the lemon cream, sponge cake and caramel is just perfection.Unlike newer bakeries, Tartine uses a more traditional method in their pastry. I came down here for a breakfast, and had both the lemon tart and quiche. Both are very yummy. I wish there are more bakeries like these.

I'm always hesitant about giving a full 5 stars in any review, but after some consideration, and fond reminiscing, I suppose Tartine deserves it. I've heard that the food here is supposed to be European or European-inspired, but I'm only an amateur, so I don't really know specifics. (However, a friend of mine who just came from a European vacation says that the Tartine offerings are comparable to what she had over there, and that Tartine even holds its own against a lot of bakeries she visited.) I ought to dock them a star for not having more sitting space. With all the well-deserved hype, recognition, accolades, and popularity that this place has garnered, you'd think they'd take all their earnings and get a new table or two. Luckily for these bozos, the food is good enough that I'm willing to take my bounty and eat standing up at the bar --- although on nicer days, it's pretty neat eating at one of the outside tables. Personally, you can't go wrong with anything here. One weakness might be the chocolate cookie, which was very yummy to me, but was surprisingly wafer-like, and I'm not used to my cookies feeling like wafers. The mushroom croque-monsieur was a tasty, hearty treat for a creeping vegetarian like me ("creeping" because, although I've cut down on meat, it still sometimes makes its way into my diet every now and then). I got that with a side salad, priced at 3-something dollars, which might seem kind of pricey for a side salad, but trust me, the taste is worth it. Other times, I've tried the bread pudding, which is as legendary as you've heard from everyone else. After coming back a few times, I realized how weird it was that I've never had any tarts at tartine, so I tried a lemon cream tart and it was better than cheesecake --- which is saying a lot for a wannabe Golden Girl like me. Also get a cup of coffee. The brew is pretty good, and get it for here so you'll save paper and you get to use the cute little cup and saucer. PS to another review here that references the "annoying yuppies and hipsters": I totally feel you on that one. But they're mostly harmless and surprisingly conversational. I guess good pastries and sandwiches will mellow out just about anyone. I'll probably keep snacking and dining at Tartine long after the hype dies down. I've been in San Francisco since 2000, but didn't become a Tartine fan until this year. I've never been one to eat at places that are momentarily trendy. I eat somewhere because I, me, and myself like it very much. And it's a bonus when I get to bring friends who like the food, too.

during a short bay area romp this weekend, i had to drag my traveling companions to tartine for a visit. & through the magic of their banana cream tart, with its light, flaky, chocolate-coated crust, delicate banana custard & surprise caramel center, Êi think i made at least one of said companions a believer. their lemon tart was just as heavenly as the last time. they had run out of morning buns. maybe because it was well past morning when we went. d'oh. i don't mind so much now that the place is small & lacks seating - with dolores park so close by offering a great picnicking alternative, they really don't need it. if i ever move to the bay area, i would seriously consider living in the mission just to be close to tartine!

Although I didn't get to try much from the menu, I'm glad it gives me a reason to come back! First of all, I arrived at this place around 1pm on a Friday and there was a line out the door. ÊMy friend highly recommended this place, so we decided to wait and normally I wouldn't. ÊAs we were waiting in line, I noticed a sign that said they sold out of bread, so I assumed that is definitely something to try here. ÊAnyways, after waiting for about 45 mins, we made it to the front and I decided to get their chocolate pudding. ÊThe only pudding I had before is from the grocery store so this was definitely a treat. ÊThe pudding was very delicious and I definitely recommend for anyone looking for a light treat (although it does get filling). ÊI only give this place four stars because I didn't get to try anything else but next time i'm in SF i'll check out more items and hopefully come back with a five star update. ÊAnyways, only tip is that I think they only accept cash, so come prepared.

Solid 4 1/2 stars. This yummy bakery is responsible for the creation of my very own "walk of shame." If you ever see someone that doesn't quite fit in with the other well put-together, somewhat yuppy, Tartine visitors, that's me. Tartine is one of the 3 in my Fat Foodie Trifecta, my holy trinity located on 18th street. I've been lucky enough to be a hop, skip and a jump away from Tartine (not to mention Delfina and Bi-Rite Creamery). Going to Tartine to load up on fruity bread pudding, savory quiche, chocolate friands, cheesy gougeres and most importantly, the sinfully delicious morning buns in the early morning before the rush is a plus. But on those off-days, when I can't seem to pull myself out of bed early enough but am in dire need of a chocolate croissant or fresh loaf of bread is when the shame begins. I know better but I always rush, hoping the line hasn't grown too much - I can sacrifice looking presentable for a taste of Tartine, right? No big deal. Or not. With my beat-up college hoodie, pj pants, the boyfriend's slippers, lopsided ponytail and sleep still in my eyes, I make the walk to the end of Tartine line. There's when I pry open my eyes to gawk at the goodies in the glass case and just in time to notice others around me are eyeing my less-than-stellar, "had a rough night...or life" look. I stand around, embarrassed that I didn't make sure my pj pants were the ones that were still whole and not the hole-y ones. After 12 minutes of trying to hide the hot mess that is me, I finally hear an upbeat, friendly voice reminding me why I'm subjecting myself to this, "Hi there! What can I get for you?" The insecurities fall away as I point and squeal at the all the things I want. "I want that...and that...OOoOoh...and 2 of those...and definitely THAT! THANK YOU!!" She packages them up neatly and sends me on my way. As I walk out, I rip a chunk from the buttery croissant and smile - the people are still staring...but I'm okay with that. Because Tartine is worth it.

high expectations however overall it was a disappointment. Waited almost an hour to try their raved morning bun, but when it was my turn to order they sold out! I ended up getting their Frangipane Tart, banana tart, and coffee. ÊCoffee was a disappointment as well as the frangiane tart. ÊBanana tart was good although I had better ones elsewhere. ÊMy friend raved about their breads so I'll order it in advance and try it out hopefully it will meet my expectation this time

I am so happy to return with an update, and tell the TRUTH! This place is so full of itself, it trips on it's own feet. So sad. First, it's damned expensive. And I'm not cheap! lol Ok, went for only the second time, because I could not bring my desire up enough to go again. But, my mother was in town, and she LOVES bakeries. Told her about this, and thought it was Êa good chance. Went for lunch, we were going to get a sandwich to share, then saw the croque monsieur coming straight out of the oven, with ASPARAGUS too and could not resist. Boy, some people never learn! Just as bad as the first time, same ol' problems... A good sandwich should be so much better than the sum of it's parts. And this one is actually SO much lesser! It's like a deconstructed c.m. Big mistake. Total waste of time. Then, had a banana creme tart. I'm sure there are lots of DUMB people who will rave about this one! ÊIt's crap. The tart crust is hard, flavorless (butter? probably. taste it? Nope). They line the crust w/ dark chocolate, ostensibly to keep the crust from wetting. Um, that damn crust needs some wetting. Might be edible then! The filling was fine, even good. I love banana creme pie. In fact, might be my favorite. Again, this was a lame "deconstruction" having some idea of singling out each part, making it "perfect" and falling FLAT on it's face. Someday, I'm sure I'll go a third time, 'cause I love Mark Bittman, and he loves Tartine! But it will take a long time again, I'm sure. Especially to wade through the MOUNTAINS of attitude and cool just gushing through this place!

All I can say is YUMMMM! Buttery, flaky, baked goodness!!! Morning bun, croissant, pain au chocolat yum yum yum...the best one was the morning bun, which is basically a croissant with cinnamon sugar, but the rest were definitely delicious as well. I think these would be the best breakfast pastries I have ever eaten, hands down. Next time I'm in the bay I will for sure make this a stop just for another one of those morning buns.

Get here early. ÊI arrived here at 7:55AM on a Saturday after my stop over at Dynamo Donuts and there was already a line formed 12 deep. ÊWhile 12 people aren't many as the morning moves on the line gets longer and longer. The morning bun is really good and worth waiting for. ÊThe pain au jambon is very tasty. ÊIt's flaky and buttery with a nice crust then when you get inside you're hit with jambon and cheese. The quiche is great too, the crust is also flaky and buttery the filling is perfect with their seasonal ingredients. ÊThe gougere I can't comment on, I had it left over as my sister took half to her husband and the girl at the bakery packed us the wrong things. My other sister said she's had better pain au chocolat, it's not much since I've never had it but... The frangipane croissant wasn't so great, it didn't really taste of almonds. Croque monsieur wasn't ready until 9:30am so I guess that'll have to wait for next time.

Do you have a knack for baking? Buy the Tartine cookbook - definitely not for beginners, but if you love to bake, which I do, it's an excellent choice. The book pays a lot of attention to detail - ingredients, kitchen notes, beautiful photographs, etc. Absolutely to die for recipes - both sweet and savory. Love the bakery, love the cookbook. If it's ridiculously busy, it's because they're doing something right - and rare. And if you bake it at home, you won't have to deal with the crowd.

Oh how I wish I could give Tartine five stars. ÊTheir Pain au Chocolat is decadent, their Croissant with Frangipane (almond paste) is to die for, and their general location and atmosphere are wonderful. ÊBut every time I have to wait in line for 15 to 20 minutes or call ahead three days in advance for a loaf of bread, the more I find my relationship with Tartine one way and dying. ÊIn fact, after a recent discussion over IM with a friend, I've come to realize that Tartine is truly a whore. Ê Friend: So are you doing Tartine this Valentines evening? Me: I could, but it's probably going to be busy. Friend: It will be. Me: I don't want to deal with a place that doesn't love me. Friend: ...and for sure, for sure, for sure, no bread. Me: You know, I think Tartine might be a cheap ... well expensive ... whore. Friend: They don't love you. Friend: That's really it. Me: Tartine blows. Friend: They suck. Me: I hate Tartine. Friend: Exactly. Me: We should write a Yelp review... it could be quite an amusing review. Friend: ...stuck up and can't even make a cookie right, so screw Tartine. Me: Their French pastries are good. ÊDo they make you feel dirty when you leave? Friend: You know, they kind of do. ÊI walk away feeling shame in how they treated me. Me: People give you the look; it's the walk of shame when you leave empty handed without bread. Friend: "... it's 5.05... are you a retard to think we still have bread, retard." Me: Nothing to show for your expensive relationship that lasted minutes. Friend: It's a high maintenance relationship where the partner doesn't put out. Me: Well, unless you book three days in advance ...and only if they feel like it. ÊAbusive relationship, in all honesty. Friend: ...and you have to pay by credit card. Me: ÊThey do that to make sure it's worth their while. No one likes to get a sack of nickles after giving you their "best." Friend: Plus nothing [no bread] on Sunday to Tuesday. Me: Hey, even they have to respect the Sabbath. Friend: But you bring up a good idea... next time I'm at Tartine, I will pay by nickels. So there you have. ÊAn abusive relationship made worthwhile only when you take a bite out of one of their French pastries. ÊNow, I'll just go wait in line at Tartine...

i'm sitting at home in san diego dreaming of tartine bakery. from their desserts to their sandwiches to their cappuccinos--down to the simple dressing on their side salad--everything i've tried here (and i've made a point to try it all) is absolutely superb. once i caught a glimpse of a pastry chef in the back hand pitting cherries--cherry juice was running down her hands and she was stained red up to her elbows.

I've been here before and didn't have a memorable experience but yesterday, my husband and I decided to try it again - we should have stayed home. I have to admit, the food was good but I didn't like the service at all. The staff seemed a little...arrogant. First, I asked about the ingredients in the quiche, the woman tells me there are two, ham and tomato/chard. I ask what else is in the first one, she tells me (while looking at me like I'm an idiot), "Ham." So I say, there's no cheese and she says, "Yes, there's cheese." So again I say, "what else is in the ham quiche?" I didn't even care anymore, I was just pissed that she was being a jerk face. ÊBTW, there was cheese in the Tomato/Chard quiche too. On to what we ordered: chocolate walnut cookie, hazelnut biscotti, croque monsieur, and pastrami with no cheese nor mayo (my husband is particular about his sandwich spreads so he carefully studied the menu and he doesn't like cheese or mayo). I have to admit, the croque monsieur was pretty good however, my husband didn't get his pastrami sandwich for 22 additional minutes. On top of that, it had mustard and something else that wasn't listed on the menu that of course my husband didn't like. Needless to say, I didn't enjoy the attitude nor the wait. I also didn't like that the non-specificity about the ingredients that they use. Tartine prides themselves on using only the best products well, why don't they tell us what they are. And when customers are asking questions, why not answer - with a smile. And get the pastrami out before the customer decides they no longer want it. Oh yea, and this sandwich that my husband got late with the ingredients that he didn't like cost $13.50...he only ate the meat. I doubt that he ate $13.50 worth of meat and the more I write the more I doubt that Tartine deserved a 3 - wish I could do 2.5.

I imagine that in heaven or in a place that has long been bought out by capitalism, there are a million tartines and then you never have to wait in line. ÊHowever, in San Francisco, there is only one, so, if you get there hungry, be patient and stand in queue. ÊYou won't be disappointed. ÊBesides, the fact that you could close your eyes and circle your finger and anything you land on would be a delicious adventure, the staff is obviously fed such yummy joys daily to keep them cheerful, friendly, helpful and quite delightful. ÊIf you have the time or can't decide where to go, spend it standing in line at tartine, you'll choose your dessert first and then if you still feel hungry, you can order a sandwich or beverage that will make you feel like an english schoolboy at tea time. ÊEnjoy, because it may be a daunting choice to come here again!

several friends and i visited tartine around christmas time. the place was packed and stayed that way for the 2 hours we spent enjoying food friends and family. the perfect trifecta! we waited about 10 minutes to occupy a nice table by the coffee bar but other than that, we all thought it was incredible. several of us ordered sandwiches, some coffee and of course a nice bottle of house red for 15 bucks! the pastrami and the bread is to die for. i'm a huge pastrami fan and this place does not dissappoint. the bread pudding was tasty and i'm looking forward to coming back to try some of their bakery goods. all in all, i would tell you this place is a great value and incredibly delicious. eat here! be prepared to wait a bit though!

Living just around the block from this so called spectacular place I often get to witness the "craziness" of the lines and patrons sitting outside feeding their delectables to pigeons. I admit that they make quality pastries, and i believe the bread is made of tears... it is amazingly good, BUT it is only ready at 5 o'clock each day. So after waiting 30 minutes with annoying people on their cell phones, a sweaty, cranky Êcounter person informs me that the bread won't be ready for 30 minutes. I understand having a policy and all, but possibly post that somewhere so that one would know they didn't have to wait in line. ÊMost of the annoyances of this establishment come from the patrons themselves. They block driveways over and over again, I mean I didn't realize that their need to have a morning bun was more important then kids going to school. It is definitely over the top bad behavior. Non patron related, I just don't get why a place that is so particular about the quality of their ingredients and presentation choose to serve Mr. espresso swill as their coffee. And if you happen to just be getting a cup of "self serve" drip coffee... you have to fight your way back through the line to get it. It seems like bad planning on the layout Êto me.

Sometimes I eat bascially vegan, run 20 miles a week, and live my life in a way that defines a "healthy lifestyle." Then I drink Saturday night, wake up Sunday morning, and the little man inside my belly screams "TARTINE BAKERY!" So I brave the line, order the cheesiest thing I see, and sit quietly at a table in the corner while the grease fills my arteries. Then I get back in line, order a morning bun, and go home with a smile on my face. Sundays are those days. Thank you Tartine bakery for being my guiltiest pleasure.

Went there for the first time yesterday... I had heard about it but never got the chance to go. I was stuffed from lunch but decided to stop by for coffee and a pastry before dinner. Can you tell that I was on an eating fiesta?? :) Long line in the front but it moves pretty fast... I wanted to try the banana cream pie, morning and pain au chocolat that everyone has been posting about. They had already sold out... granted it was already 5pm. But looking at this line, I would imagine that they would have still had plenty of stuff. I got a lemon tart, coconut pie, frangipane croissant and a cappucino. The pies were good (I am typically not a fan of lemon pies...) but the frangipane croissant was amazing!!!!!!!!!!! I've had these in France and this one beats most of the ones I've had. I think this place is more of a bakery than a patisserie. If you are craving traditional french breakfast (croissant, pain au chocolat, buns...) then this is the ultimate treat!!!!!! The bread is fantastic too.. next time I want to try a sandwich. Advice: Get there early in the day for best selection.

tartine has a place of nostalgia in my heart and nostrils. as a newbie in the city, my boyfriend and i were sucked in, not by curiousity of the crowd, but, simply, the smell. we had already eaten breakfast around the corner at dolores park cafe, and sat down for another at tartine. as for those who are bitter about waits, well, it's mostly just the weekend and honestly, it's a great place to have a good conversation. i went there during a dismal apartment hunt to perk up by means of quiche, endive salad and a glass of vouvray (awesome wines by glass-- and yes, wine is also good as a breakfast drink). i was "forced" to sit at a table with a lady who turned out to be amazing-- we talked for two hours. now if quiche can't bring generations together, i don't know what can! anyway, all the best boulangeries and patisseries in paris cultivate a wait. consider it, uhh, culture.

I got a giant chocolate chip cookie, and a coffee. My girlfriend got a cappuccino. We seemed to be charged $5 more than what we should have, but it was so crazy in there I didn't want to say anything. The coffee was good, the cookie was good. The people watching is great when you sit outside.

Well my never-ending search for a pastrami sandwich in the bay hit the wall again at Tartine. I ordered the pastrami and got a loaf of bread instead. Both the top and bottom bread was sliced 1" thick. The bread was the European type so it was extra crunchy after they pressed it in the sandwich toaster. In fact, the bread was so crunchy it took all the skin off the roof on my mouth on the way down. Now onto the filling, there was very little considering the 13.50 price tag on that badboy. The sandwich also came with Gruyere cheese which was interesting because the pastrami sandwich traditionally has no cheese, i guess it works because it melts well in the press. Overall, the sandwich was a disaster. I'm positive that the sweets are good because everyone in there was ordering them, however, I don't have a taste for cake or pastry.

We have lived in Paris and consumed a lot of croque monsieur but ÊTartine's croque monsieur is the best I ever tasted-I like the vegetarian option the best. We always order two to go, a pastry nosh for dessert, and then take it all on over to nearby Dolores Park for a picnic. Perfect SF lunch; been doing this for years every time we visit SF, and its always great, foodwise as well as hangout wise.

I *heart* Tartine's pastries. Let me help you count the ways: (1) morning bun: I like it when it's more on the well-done side because it's more crispy and less doughy. There's just the right amount of fruity taste that it doesn't overwhelm the entire pastry. (2) fragipane (aka almond croissant): With my love of all things crispy, how could I possibly not put this on my list? The exterior is crispy, including the topping of almonds; and the almond paste does not taste like it's drenched in butter, even if it probably is. (3) ham and cheese croissant (I can't remember the real name): Can anything with cheese ever go wrong? Oh and did I mention it's crispy as well so it's twice the goodness. (4) tarts (specifically coconut and banana): The whipped cream is luscious. The fillings are superb. There's a hidden chocolate surprise in the crust that may overpower the taste but since I love chocolate, I don't mind. (5) passion fruit cake: Real coconut shavings on the exterior. Filling of passion fruit mousse on the inside. It only tastes like it's good for your health. (6) cookies (specifically Mexican wedding and almond meringue): Just try it. I shouldn't even need to write a description. (7) open-faced sandwiches: I prefer the ham but that's a personal preference. Ask them to heat it up so it's crispier. (8) freshly baked walnut bread: Warmed bread with real walnuts (lots of them) can never go wrong. Atkins diet doesn't stand a chance! I don't heart... (1) ...the snooty service. They all seem to be hired from the We're Too Hipster for You Temp Agency but I'll make that sacrifice because of the food. (2) ...finding parking, unless you drive a Mini Cooper and so can fit into those spots not actually large enough to be a real parking spot. (3) ...the slow service. If you see the line out the door and past the benches, expect to wait 25 minutes before you're served. I think they deliberately work slow because serving fast is a violation of their credo. (4) ...the sandwiches. It's not that I dislike them but they are the only things that taste oily. I wiped my mouth of the oil after every bite. (5) ...the amount of gym required to work it off. Check out how much butter they use when you're in line staring at the prep area. You won't be deterred from buying though.

I wanted to like this place after reading all the raving reviews, but once I reached the front where all the pastries were (after having trouble finding parking and then waiting in line for a while), I was turned off by the high prices and far-from-spectacular portions. I'm not from the Bay area and I guess I am not used to the typical high price-small portion deal that's prevalent in most SF bakeries so it was hard for me to fork over $3.75 for a smallish morning bun. Ê Ê Ê Ê ÊThe morning bun was delicious though. It had lovely sugary glaze that had a hint of orange, and the pastry was cinnamon/sugar goodness. I enjoyed it but I've definitely had better, bigger and less expensive morning buns elsewhere. Ê Ê Ê Ê ÊEverything looked really delicious at Tartine and the tarts looked very enticing and were fair sizes for the price. It probably is one of the better bakeries in SF and I was glad to try it once, but as everything is $4 and up, I probably won't be coming back. Visiting San Fran is already expensive as it is.

Everything baked here is very high quality Everything here is also pricey and heavy, like "this croissant contains several sticks of butter and now that I have eaten it I can feel it oozing out my pores" heavy. ÊIt's also often very busy and crowded, although I suspect some of that will abate once their Valencia St. bread shop opens. Overall great for picking up a special treat to take away, but not a great place to just hang out with a cup of tea. ÊTry the breads and cakes- I think they are usually better than the cookies.

If you're feeling like you don't give a shit about calories, which I never give a shit about, try the pastries. The coconut tart is unreal. Do NOT think that you can stop in for a quick bite.

Great spot, I go back again and again for the breakfast pastries and the good coffee. They do a great job on flavor concentration and beautiful presentation even with the high volume - don't let the small space fool you, this place is very busy.

This may be the best bakery in the city...The food is delicious as the the hot pressed sandwiches are made on their homemade bread each morning. These sandwiches are unbelievably large and thus are perfect to share. Full of unique ingredients. Enjoy the Fromage Blanc and Banana if you want something a little sweet. Use local cheese (cowgirl fromage blanc), sliced bananas, and quince jam. Their quiches are also excellent - light, fluffy, and flavorable as a quiche should be and the crust is flaky and sweet similar to their pastry dough. Not to be missed, and great to take home for later. Finally, you cannot leave tartine without some kind of cream tart. My personal favorite is the coconut, but the banana cream is also delectable. The place is always bustling and it has a wonderful crowd of people who gather around to enjoy great food with great company and conversation.

ÊBut be prepared to wait and to fight for a table -- it's worth it. Another solution is to take it to go and have a picnic in Dolores Park

What else can be said about Tartine? ÊNot much. ÊPlace is unreal and the daily lines prove it. Here's my short list if you're a first timer. ÊBest to bring a few friends and share... Gougere - best thing. ÊIt's a little puff pastry of pepper/cheese love. Ê Bread pudding - very tasty, very filling. Ê Quiches - amazing. ÊI'd been going to Tartine for a year before I tried one. ÊThat's a year of mistakes. Ê Croissants - pretty good, not my favorite but seem to be a hit. Morning bun - I'm not a fan. ÊSome like it and I think it's one of their most popular items. ÊDon't make it the only thing you get, that's all I'd say. Their coffee isn't the best, but they make a damn good cafe au lait.

Having never experienced anyone lining up to buy a pastry and coffee, I admit I was transfixed by the dedication of San Franciscans...once we got inside I was delighted with my morning roll with orange glaze plus coffee chosen with restraint from among many luscious baked goods. ÊIn flooding the sidewalk outside Tartine each weekend, regular customers demonstrate their strong attachment Êtoward this singular neighborhood bakery, surrounding it as one would a precious gem. If you are in the neighborhood, stop by--it is worth the wait.

If you are looking for the most other-wordly pain au chocolat experience, look no further than Tartine. I am not a fan of most pastries but honestly cannot resist Tartine's chocolate crossiants, made with Scharffenberger chocolate and surely a lb. or two of butter. I also really like how the lattes at Tartine are served in bowls - there is just something so comforting about cupping my hands around a bowl of hot coffee...Ah but a word to the impatient, Tartine is not a place to go when you're in a hurry, or when you have a big group of hungry people...it is always packed with locals and given the recent James Beard accolades (naming Tartine's two owners the best pastry chefs/bakers in the US), I'm guessing the line will only get longer...

Yes. There is a long line to enter but it is well worth every second. Of course, the desserts are excellent. Lemon tarts....mmmm. However, in addition, the sandwiches and the quiches are money! The latte, from what I've heard from a very reliable source, is excellent. Tartine is also located in a very vibrant neighborhood, with Dolores Park close by. On a sunny day, it is just great to come here, grab a bite and go exploring the city.

ÊAnd open sandwich with lots of cheese and tomatoes... and lemon cream tart with REAL.. and I mean real whip cream on top.

ÊPecan tart - a bit bland and not rich enough for me). ÊThe ambiance was surprisingly very plain and was bustling the entire time in the middle of the weekday.

If I were only rating Tartine's bread, I would give it 5 stars. Ê However,with a name like Tartine the pastries should be over the top sensational, and to me, they are just good, some very good, but not WOWIE, ZOWIE! After spending time in Paris and experiencing French Pastries (such as those made by Pierre Herme') I have to rate the pastry aspect of the bakery as OK but not over the top sensational. Add to that, the obnoxious scene and the haughty know it all staff, and I'd much rather spend my money Êdown the street at Bi-Rite Market where the customer is appreciated. Ê I live in the neighborhood, so when I'm in the mood for calories, I get Bi-Rite Ice Cream. Tartine is, however, a nice stop for the bridge and tunnel crowd. Additionally, ÊTartine is inconsistent, they once served me a croissant that was slightly burnt on the bottom and then insisted that it was supposed to be like that...as if I have traveled all over the world for the last 30 years, spent considerable time in France, and wouldn't know when a croissant is burnt! Later for you Tartine!

3.5 stars... Tartine bakery is a great little corner cafe that has a decent selection of breads, desserts, paninis, sandwiches, and a few other items to sit and enjoy in there or to take and go. You can choose to get a waitress service for the tables inside or the outside or you could wait in the line (which can get pretty long) and pick what you want and pay right there. I tried both the bread pudding with seasonal fruit (cup for $3.50) and the banana cream tart ($6.50) which is made with chocolate and caramel. Sadly I was disappointed with both but I just know by looking at the savory items and some of the other desserts that they really know what they're doing here and some of the other options would have been much better. The bread pudding didn't quite adhere to itself too well and I found as though it wasn't savory nor was it that sweet, it was just sort of bland. The banana cream tart was the most difficult dessert I've ever tried to eat. It was too large to eat by hand so I got a plastic fork which couldn't sink into the pastry shell. Neither could a plastic spoon or a plastic knife. I then went to metal and a fork and knife barely made it through so I had to use some elbow grease. By the time I was able to break into this fortress of dessert I made such a mess it was borderline funny. The taste was pretty good but I have no idea how anyone taking this to their office, to a park, or someplace would have eaten it. Their lemon bar/tart and cinnamon rolls looked heavenly though so if I were to ever go back for a snack I'd probably end up with one of those.

uhhhhhh...i really dont see what the fuss about this place is about except for this quiet, quaint little bakery bustling with people from all walks of life... 4.5 stars on YELP, decided to give it a try...IMO its only 3.5 or maybe I tried the wrong things again =[ Parking in the area is a nuisance, circled around several times before we were able to actually find parking. Ambiance - reminds me of Betty's Bakesale (another sandwich/bakery place) but with more pastries & baked goodies and also a bit more expensive. Food: Prosciutto+Provolone Sandwich - decent, but super heavy (i.e. the spray or oil they used to grease the grill/press the sandwich was seeping through my fingers after only eating a portion of the sandwich). ÊI cant seem to pinpoint the type of bread it is, but it is a bit thick. Spicy Turkey Sandwich - surprisingly same toast issue, but tasted better in that it was more flavorful & tastier. Hazelnut Torte - they use Scharfenberger chocolate, which is a bit rich. ÊThis needs to be enjoyed with a tall glass of milk. Rocher with Chocolate - very light and airy pastry-like. Bread Pudding - im not too fond of this but my bf wanted to try and he was not a fan, glad we only got a cup of it and not a bowl. Coconut Macaroons - one of the better macaroons with a light lemon-y center. ÊThe crust is solid and the insides are moist & soft, very similar to Ici's Macaroons. Price - WHOA WHOA WHOA, i literally spent like $40 here for lunch (since sandwiches ~$11/$12 and the baked goods are NOT cheap) ÊIMO, pricey. Oh yeah, the wait for the food was not too friendly either - hmmm...not sure if I'll come back, but if I do, I'll need to give the morning bun (was too full to consume anymore) and this amazing banana cream torte (they ran out when we got there) a shot.

I finally decided to make the trek over and wait in the long weekend lines this past weekend when I had to go into the office on a Saturday. ÊI waited for almost 30 minutes - but let me tell you - WORTH THE WAIT! I ordered the ham and cheese croissant and a large latte. It was so good I have been thinking about it non-stop! I spent some time in France this past summer, and the croissant at Tartine was BETTER than anything I had in France (and these were not touristy places either).

If you are one of the many San Franciscans that hasn't been to Tartine, Êget yourself over there. There will be a line out the door, but it moves quickly and this place knows how to make bread and pastries. Face it - if Delfina serves their bread, you are guaranteed this place is good. Best breakfast pics: the morning bun, any croissant (can you say butter?!) and the croque monsier. Lattes are delicious and doubles are served in a bowl! With these tips, your experience will be better...... 1. Be prepared to stand in line 5 - 20 minutes 2. Go with someone so while they hold your spot in line, you can go inside to the separate drink counter. Order, pay, and take drinks back to comfort Êyou in line. Otherwise, your drinks will be ready 10 minutes after you start eating. 3. Do not expect a quiet or private experience. Seating is limited and it is cramped. 4. Don't hesitate to ask for your food to be re-heated. While the food was recently baked, it tastes much better hot and they are happy to do it. 5. Buy shortbread cookies - a lot of them. If you are too full to eat them, take them home. I promise you will be happy you did! Why not 5 stars? Because it doesn't have the ambiance I like for a breakfast/pastry place. It's not a spot to hang out and sip your coffee because there are 20 people waiting for a place to sit down. And you don't want to be the rude guy reading while others are waiting to sit down and eat.

I ordered the banana cream tart and hot chocolate. The crust of the tart was very hard, but the banana cream made it all worth it. I was regretting that I ordered the $6.95 tart, but the sweet banana glaze, fresh banana slices, and light whipped cream made the $6.95 seem reasonable. The price for the hot chocolate was average along with the taste but the cup size was petite. This corner cafe with no visible name gives the urban feel of a loud atmosphere, and semi sticky shared tables. But the cafe does provide an issue of The Onion!

There's probably not too much I can add to what's already been said. The line moves fairly quickly and gives you the time you'll need to try to decide on that one (or two) things to eat. We had a group of 5 for my first time there and ordered 6 items (which was kinda gratuitous) which we all got to share. Finding a place to sit might be difficult, but we were lucky enough to swoop in just as a group was leaving.

I still stand by my opinion that their food is outstanding but I'm a little disappointed that Tartine has raised its prices. I LOVE the treats but the price point is just getting too high. $3.75 for a morning bun is a bit much. It's really good but it's still just a bun, not a meal. Here's one less person in line as often.

I know it is near sacrilege to say it, but I don't really dig their pastries all that much. ÊNow, I am a girl that digs on the butter and the cream - the more fat the better is my usual motto, but sometimes the pastries at Tartine taste pretty much like I am eating straight lard.

ÊIt also doesn't help me like their pastries any more that I have to wait in line for 30 minutes to get them, invariably with some dude talking really loudly into his cell phone or some kids who are tired of waiting and turn to brattiness to combat their boredom.

I won't wait in many lines but I have several times over for an orange morning bun from Tartine. If you're looking for a little more room try going very early on a weekday but either way the food is consistently delicious. I'm also quite fond of the bread pudding made with seasonal fruit and the Croque Monsieur.

Suffice it to say I no longer eat croissants elsewhere for fear that I am wasting my croissant quota for the week and instead save it for the slim possibility that I may actually wake up at a decent hour on the weekend and wait 30 minutes in line around the corner to enjoy one of these amazing treats. Sounds incredibly pretentious, I know, and I slightly hate myself for it, but these are hands down the best croissants I have ever eaten.

The pastries here are delicious, though I usually get the bread pudding. For me, that's saying something: bread pudding is stupidly easy to make at home, and when I go out I usually go for something I can't do myself. Tartine's brioche bread pudding, though, it's something else. Mostly I stop by for the bread, though. There's no line at 6:00 on a Wednesday, and the bread is fresh and hot from the oven and still too sticky and squishy to cut. I buy a loaf for $5, then put half in the freezer for later. Even re-thawed, it's better than any other bread in the city. Updated 5/3/11: I really can't think of anywhere else that's been this good for this long. Five stars it is!

The sandwiches are fabulous and the pastries are otherworldly. The coffee is good too. However the whole experience is utterly, totally ruined because the place is packed with people and not that clean, and standing in line bored for 45 minutes turns a fun, vivacious party into a surly and depressed group of jerks. I don't like malls during the holidays and thus I don't like Tartine. Even the thought of going back there totally stresses me out, because it was so good and I really want to go back but I feel I may have a nervous breakdown if I ever have to experience that teeth-grinding experience again. Try to con someone into going and getting takeout for you and you will absolutely love it.

The owners are amazing, talented people and the bakery itself is outstanding. I may be a bit biased, but every person I have ever brought to this bakery has been blown away.

When I first saw how pricey the items were, I was a little skeptical, but it was worth EVERY penny! I had the Prechutto and Provolone sandwich which was superb!! The flavors were incredible plus it was a very large portion. I also had the eclair which was very rich and a chocolat lover's delite. Very laid back place, only downsides I could find were that it's a really small place with limited seating and you have to bus your own tables.

I feel obliged to chime in here. It's Tartine's fault that I can't eat a croissant from anywhere else. The morning buns are a dream, but I can't handle the mess on my way to BART. When I have time to sit down, I have the bread pudding, or the best a bowl of mushy bread can ever taste. It's hard for me to branch out. I've had bites of the Croque Monsieur's and Madame's, and ogled over others' hot pressed sandwiches. But I can't get past the plain croissants - at the same time, why should I if they're so damn good?

Five stars for food. One star for attitude. I agree that tipping is a great idea and would prevent people from having a shitty attitude. However, if all you've been given by the staff is shitty attitude, I don't see how a tip, which is given at the end of the service, is going to suddenly make the shitty attitude go away. Anyway, I believe that people should not have to pay each other for common courtesy. Tips are for excellent service, not excellent attitude. I'm not talking about normal levels of "she must be having a terrible day" shitty attitude. I'm talking "I work in a fabulous bakery and therefore am something special and you're an incompetent moron who's dared to sully our floors with your giant clodhopper feet" shitty attitude. And, yeah, some stuff looked burnt. Honestly burnt, not butter- or sugar-browned. It's too hard to get to and the attitude left me cold, so I'm not going back. There are plenty of other very good bakeries around, or I can just make my own.

I cannot understand why everyone raves about this place. Yes, they serve tasty cakes and desserts. But so do a bunch of other places. I too saw the line snaking around the corner but they were quick and I got my turn within 5 minutes. No complaints there. I tried their fruit pudding and an open faced sandwich. The pudding was ok, but the open faced sandwich was mediocre. For $9.75 I would have expected a lot lot better. Maybe these are not their best dishes but I dont think I will go back again. There are a number of other nicer bakeries in the City that serve much better food for the same price.

I can't believe Tartine actually exists. How can a bakery create such magic in its ovens? The brownies disdain being sickeningly fudgy, opting instead to let their chocolate flecks melt on your tongue. The lemon tart flaunts a crisp, clean, and creamy lemon custard on an impossibly tender shortbread base that makes me want to cry. And the bruschetta, fresh cakes, and the brioche bread pudding all looked scrumptious. I think I may need to give up baking. Such bliss will never be attained in my humble kitchen.

I love the mix of fruits and almond paste in the almond frangipane, and the coconut cream is custardy and flaky perfection. ÊTwice now they've run out of banana cream, but that's probably due to poor timing (both weekend afternoons) and the item's popularity. ÊEach time, I've waited 20-30 minutes to order, but it's always been worth it.

Remember the feeling of disbelief and overwhelming jealousy as you watched those brats in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory walk into Willy Wonka's sugary haven? You try and put yourself in their shoes and wonder, where would I start? The lemon candy tea cups? The chocolate waterfall? The giant licorice whip flowers? Ah, too many tooth decaying options to choose from!!! I had a similar feeling upon entering Tartine... Charlie and the Chocolate Factory haven of the 3-D adult variety. Sweet or savory? One of both. Savory is easy, going with the quiche. Now for sweet............................................ coconut cream, banana cream, seasonal fruit, passion fruit.... Too many options.... Close eyes, purse lips, wave pointing finger around... pick a spot.... Open eyes.... Banana cream it is! My method, while unorthodox, proved quite effective. With a wonderfully flakey crust, full slices of banana, rich banana cream, topped off with dark chocolate strips, I was in that diabetic bliss I'd fantasized about as a child. The half an hour line was worth every second.

I had heard amazing things about this place, and for the most part, I was not disappointed! We tried a few things,a friand,(small chocolate cake about the size of a truffle, filled with chocolate ganache.: it was a little more bitter than I personally like, but i realize some people really enjoy that kind of chocolate. So, can't totally knock it. Same thing for the chocolate cake, more dense, and bitter than we like at my house. The shortbread was incredibly good, it melted in my mouth. I will definitely be back for that. We Êtried their scharffenberger (sp?) cookies. It's a good thing they're small, because they are very rich. Although very enjoyable. We also brought home a lemon bar. As much as I love lemon on a variety of things, and I do like the tartness.....This was too tart even for me.

I want to give only two stars but the baked goods were so lovely. I only had the coffee and it was ok. ÊI bet the baked goods are super and the sandwiches are great...who knows. ÊThe coffee was expensive for the beans they use (Mr. Espresso which is average) and they charge too much for about 6 oz of semi weak coffee (half of my soy latte was soy foam...I think that is considered a cappuccino but what do I know...) It took forever to get my latte, I had to wait crunched in between LOTS of people stuffing their faces with the above-mentioned baked goods and their screaming children... TANGENT: if you are going to a cafe that you KNOW is tiny and you KNOW is crowded on the weekends, why in the world would you bring your giant stroller, wheel it inside, block an entire walk way and then ignore everyone who is trying to get around, including the wait staff trying to do their jobs? that just makes me want to kick things...mostly people and their progeny in the above mentioned giant strollers!

"Besides having sex with other guys, this is by far the gayest thing I've done all week," comments my buddy Ben as we find a place in Dolores Park to settle down with our Tartine breakfast pastries and Pellegrino this past Sunday. We had both separately had rough nights the previous night, so I was definitely looking forward to some tasty food. As it was my first time, I was a little wary of the long line I saw forming outside, but Ben assured me that it would move quickly. The only problem is that as you creep your way forward, you pass the pastry case and those lacking will power can only hope to leave without ordering an extra 3 or 4 things... Anyway, on to the food. We both ordered the Pain au Jambon (like a thick piece of toast with gruyere cheese and smoked ham). Mine with sun-dried tomatoes, his with asparagus. And OKAY, I COULDN'T RESIST, I admit it, I have a problem... by the time I got to ordering, I somehow also threw in a Lemon Cream Tart , a Frangipane Croissant (with brandy and almonds), and a Morning Bun (like a cinnamon role without the gooey icing, plus an orangey kick). The Pain (the Pains?) probably would have been a little better had we eaten them immediately, as by the time we got settled in the park, it had cooled a bit, but they were still delicious (if not just a little difficult to eat). I saved the other pastries until I got home, and all were excellent (the tart has an amazingly smooth filling and a sweet, buttery crust). The croissant and morning bun I've actually been picking at the past few days, and they're still delicious. I'll definitely be back for more!!

Really fantastic bakery (and they have a cafe, too). Scrumptious chocolate souffle cake, delicious mexican wedding cookies, fresh macaroons, croissants, lemon tarts, pecan pie, you name it. Reasonable prices, too. I haven't had any of the hot pressed sandwiches, but they sound yummy, and judging by the taste of everything else, must be pretty good.

i'm sure everything that can be said about tartine has, but i have to review it so i can add them to my chocolate list... these are some damn good pain au chocolat. the melted chocolate that oozes out and drips down your chin adds to their orgasmic qualities (the chocolate covering your teeth quickly detracts any sexiness from yourself). my friend says tartine's are the most like those in her part of france. since she was born there & i've only visited via the travel chanel, i'll have to take her word on it. but what i stand in line for is the bread pudding. it's funny too because the first time i had it i wasn't too sure if i could handle the texture. in fact, i almost wanted to gag by the time i got to the end of it. but it triggered something in me and now i cannot get enough--brioche covered in caramelized fruit with little pockets of custard, mmmmm. other yelpers have mentioned a chocolate bread pudding but i have not yet had the chance to meet that one. one day at costco i saw their cookbook for sale. shameless as i am, i quickly jotted down the bread pudding recipe. however, i'm afraid of fucking up a good thing and have not attempted to make it yet.

I've only tried their morning bun because I never had the guts to pay a lot more for something that doesn't equate as a meal. However, I can't resist ordering the morning bun; it's just heavenly! The bun comes out very warm, crispy, and fresh. There's a hint of a tangy and sweet taste that makes such a unique combination of flavor. Êit's just perfect! I go to work early in the morning and having the bun for breakfast puts me in such a delightful mood that as I walk to work while eating the bun, I fall in love more with the city (the Mission area). Not that many food can do such a thing for me, but the morning bun elevates me in such a way that I feel excited and secure for whatever is going to happen that day.

This place does not need another review but.... I can't help but say good things about this tiny bakery in mission dolores area. ÊSaturday morning... 11:30 AM -- parking wasn't that bad actually.. park above dolores park much easier than mission area. ÊStood in line for about 20 minutes then got really lucky and a group was leaving so we did get their table right away. ÊWe ordered a panini, morning bun and lemon cream tart to share amongst 3 people. Ê Everything was of utmost quality. ÊThe morning bun was not sticky but flaky and crunchy. ÊLight but buttery at the same time. ÊThe panini was ok, very rich I wasn't digging the meat cause it was a bit heavy/salty the pesto was brocolli pesto and quite unique. ÊThey cut it into 3 pieces for us too so that was really an extra nice step. Next time I would like to try the croque monsieur.. looked awesome. ÊLastly.. the heavenly dreamy fluffy creamy decadent lemon cream tart. ÊPure delectable goodness on the inside, perfect thin tart crust, perfect whipped cream on top. ÊBefore we started I bet that with all that food under our belt, we wouldnt be able to finish the tart.. it was gone within 5 minutes. ÊSplit the sandwiches and morning pastrys/desert and you're tab won't be as high.. Ê$5-10 bucks for breakfast/brunch. =)

Everything here is spectacular! I came here years ago and came again just last week. The pastries are still as yummy as ever and it remains a very popular local bakery. All the cakes and cookies are really unique and tasty. I especially liked the lemon tart. The quiche was extremely flavorful and satisfying too. So good and popular, but they still keep the prices down, very commendable. My friends and I were very happy, borderline giddy, as we walked out of there.

there's always a line everytime i go there, but not too bad of a wait. Ê small, crowded space -- not a good place to bring work, but a good place to read, check e-mail, breakfast/brunch/lunch & chat with a girlfriend. absolutely THE BEST almond croissant & chocolate croissant!!!! Ê the almond croissant is sooooo gi-normous i can only eat half (that says alot cause i can definitely eat quite a bit of sweets in one sitting, that i gross my husband out at times), PLUS they defnitely don't skimp on the marizipan (almond) paste :) the chocolate croissant isn't as big as the almond but they make up for it by using bittersweet scharffen berger chocolate (yummeee).......... the banana cream tart was probably the best one i had, but i'm not a big fan of banana cream tart -- probably better to have on a sunday afternoon but it was friday night & i should have gotten chocolate......... the chocolate chip cookie was okay but though it was large, it was too thin & crispy for me (love chewy cookies) & the brownie was good but not the best even though they used scharffen berger chocolate. the frangipane tart was ok a little too dry for me and i was REALLY disappointed with the Êcoconut passion fruit bavarian cream cake --the cake was so dry, the passion fruit's tartness Êwas overpowering, the coconut flakes were large, dry , hard to chew & the cream was heavy -- there was no balance or cohesion with the texture, taste & density -- it just didn't make sense............. it was especially disappointing after having the BEST lilikoi cake @ kilauea bakery in kauai -- the cake was soooo moist & the passion fruit itself was light creamy with a very slight tartness that wasn't overpowering -- just the right sense of balance. Ê so now i'm just sticking to the croissants..........& very happy with that UPDATE: ÊAWESOME bread pudding!!!

As we walked down Guerrero looking for Tartine, we noticed a huge line form on the corner of 18th & Guerrero. ÊWe figured this must be it, and it must be good if all these people are lining up to get some delicious fresh baked pastries. ÊAnd it was good! ÊWe got their bread pudding brioche and their pain au chocolat. ÊI don't normally like bread pudding, but this had a good combination of fruit, creamy egg flan, and sweet bread. ÊThe pain au chocolat was warm and filled with rich dark chocolate. ÊVery delicious, we came back the next day and once again lined up for a ham and cheese croissant and morning buns.

Caution : Over-indulging in their heavenly creations may cause euphoria, Êweight gain, and addiction. Tartine's dark chocolate coconut cream tart is hands down the best tart ever created. ÊYou can tell with every bite that they DO NOT skimp on ingredients and know how to keep the flavors well balanced. ÊI've recently tried their Croque Monsieur sandwich that can be topped with either shitake mushroom or smoked ham. ÊI am usually not a big fan of ham, but when paired with the flavors of Gruyere, herbs, and peppers, it's enough to make Vegans convert.

It is for you if you don't mind waiting in a line that goes out the door just to get something from their counter, and have spent too long circling to find a parking space.

The Banana Cream Tart is a flaky pastry coated w/dark chocolate with caramel, pastry cream, bananas and sweet cream.

Yeah, yeah, it's great...blah blah blah. But you have to go at off hours during the week so you can get your lovingly baked, buttery crack in a flash (15 min.), instead of waiting an hour in line on the weekend because Hans the tourist can't decide on lemon or coconut and Jenny with the baby stroller just wants to order everything 'cause it's "so yummy!".

I've been to Tartine at least 5 times, and there are three things about the Tartine experience I feel stand out and people need to keep in mind before entering... 1) ÊParking: it can be a nightmare, especially during those nice weekend brunch times. ÊBe prepared to circle, and circle, and circle around...just be patient, there is some turnover, and don't be afraid to go several blocks out. 2) ÊGetting a seat/table: Êthis place is small, and you have to keep an eye out for that person or persons that look like they're on their last bite, wrapping up to leave, and then be bold enough to ask if they'll be leaving soon or just swoop in before someone else takes the spot when it opens. ÊThere are also benches and tables outside. ÊIf it's nice out, you can just grab the food to go, and have a picnic at Dolores Park, just one block up. 3) Êand most importantly, the food: Êpastries are excellent! ÊThe tough part is deciding what to get because everything looks SO good. ÊYou start from wanting a slice of their Tres Leches cake, and then think that the Lemon Tart looks really good, so you'll just get that, too, Êto have for later...then you come across the bread pudding...and you end up ordering 3 desserts and finishing them all off before you leave the place. Ê(Guilty on multiple occasions!) :)

For a place with this much hype and long lines, they should be ashamed of their quality control. ÊI stopped going there a decade ago after the third strike - a rock hard morning bun following burnt croissants on two occasions. ÊHowever, unwarned, my Mother ventured in on her visit yesterday. ÊShe bought an "almond pastry" covered with powder sugar hiding the fact that it was way overcooked, browned and tasted dry and burnt. ÊIt doesn't matter how good they are when their good, when they pass of s**t as food when their bad.

This is easily the first place that comes to my mind whenever a non-native to the Bay Area visits. ÊI can't think of a better place which blends the vibrant, yet calm nature that is San Francisco. If it is your first experience, I highly recommend starting off with either their (ever famous) brioche bread pudding or morning bun. ÊA perfect complement to both items is their ridiculously flaky chocolate croissant. Throw in a cup of coffee, and you won't be able to take a smile off your face for the rest of the day. Also, I'd recommend the seating outside. ÊIt is a bit more of a wait since you have to try and vulture for tables, but it is well worth it if you like people watching.

Not quite sure whats up with the line at this place, oh yeah, HYPE!! I laughed when I saw they were a James Beard winner, in all fairness I think they won it on their bread, which I have never tried,,I have however tried a lot of the baked goods ( I believe in benefit of the doubt).. 1. Banana Cream Tart - tasty, but why the chocolate? 2. Lemon Cream Tart - bland, tasteless, taste like lemon concentrate. 3.Mexican wedding cakes - dry (chalk dry), tasted old & dusty 4. Bouche de Noel - boring Maybe people don't know what good baking taste like and have settled for this mediocre place. ÊMaybe its because I bake from scratch at home and understand the love that goes into baking..seriously if anyone wants good mexican wedding cakes, send me a letter..I would be happy to make your taste buds happy.., OH yeah, I don't rate customer service at most places, I am there for the food, good thing too, if I did they would have 0 stars

i would say if you can score a seat, the dining experience feels quiant and lovely. otherwise it feels claustraphobic and crowded. tartine is overflowing with a buttery goodness aroma... i would recommend one of their sandwiches for a heartier meal.

I think pastrami was better than the spicy turkey. otherwise a chocolate croissant + one of those giant latte bowls = one amazing breakfast.

You would think my very first review on Yelp would be for somewhere in the city I live in (NY). ÊI guess that's how impressed I was with Tartine. Ê A friend and I were visiting the area for the weekend, and came here on the recommendation of another friend and a pedi-cab driver in SF from Brooklyn, for a quick bite before heading up to Napa for the day. ÊIt's true, the line was out the door, but the smells coming from inside were amazing. ÊAfter much debate, I got a chocolate croissant, almond croissant, and the coconut cream tart (not really breakfast food, but I love coconut). ÊAlthough good, nothing too impressive about the almond croissant. ÊBut the chocolate croissant, WOW! ÊButtery and flaky on the outside, creamy on the inside. ÊMost chocolate croissants have solid chocolate on the inside, but not these. ÊI had heard this place was featured on "The Best Thing I Ever Ate," but forgot to check what it was that was eaten. ÊI was happy it was the chocolate croissant, as I had ordered it without knowing, and I would definitely say it's the best chocolate croissant I've ever had. ÊThe tart was good, but I decided to eat it the next day. I'm sure it would've been much better eaten day of. ÊI wish I would've seen the reviews about the morning bun. ÊI would've bought that too! I also ordered a latte to go. ÊAlthough it took a few extra minutes, the barista took the time to make my drink. ÊA good, but different experience than your quick chain places. Parking is also difficult here as its in a residential neighborhood.

i don't go to tartine frequently enough and always ask myself why i don't go more often when i do make it to tartine.

I saw this place on food network , the best thing I ever ate dessert edition and the man was raving about the chocolate croissant. I planned a day in the city and set tartine on my to do list, specifically to try the chocolate croissant. The line was out the door, but twenty minutes later we were in front of the display case. Everything looked scrumptious. I chose the croissant and I must say I was disappointed that it lacked the main Ingredient, chocolate. Minus three lack of parking, unfriendly male cashier with long blonde hair and disappointing croissant

If you love pastries , this is the place for you. Let me tell you first of all you will have to wait at the very least thirty to an hour in line before stepping foot into the bakery. However they do have a side coffee bar inside that you can run in to grab a cup of jo and wait in line again. Thats what we did. Onto the pastries. Can I say delicious? Im not a big fan of sweets but what I had was quite yummy. I was with 3 other people so we tried almost everything things. I will only write about what I ordered. First it was the pain au chocolate something like that. It was goooood, flaky crust, crispy, and jamm packed with flavor. Next we have the Eclair, probably, the Êbest eclair I have ever tasted! Filled with custard this thing ooozed of it every bit. It got quite messy. Onto the Morning bun I believe it was called something like that. It reminded me of a sugary cinnabun, with an orange twist! ÊI tried a whole bunch of other stuff but don't feel like ranting any longer. All in all this is a stop that you must stop by at least once in your life . THUMBS UP!

Love this place. The smell of butter wafting makes me so hungry! The wait is sucky, but the merengue cookies and muesli are worth it. Also, they do tastings at the wine bar, which i think is nifty. It's one of those places that is conducive to good cafe conversation.

Excellent sandwiches - one is probably enough for at least two meals, and probably buttery enough to clog two hearts. That thing they say about "eat, drink, and be merry" is definitely true with regards to this place. The meringue cookies are orgasmic, and the coffee isn't bad either. The lines are a little long, and it's a bit crowded, but those shortcomings can usually be forgiven.

Wanted to "grab something to go" before heading to an appointment in the East Bay--whoops. ÊI knew there would be a long line, but somehow still thought it would be quicker than it was. ÊAnd then when I got up front they told me it would be another 15 minutes if I wanted something other than a croque monsieur, which was disappointing but obvious and I should have expected it. ÊSo I went with the sundried tomato croque monsieur, and even though it was one of the unhealthiest breakfasts I had eaten in a while, damn, was it worth it. ÊDefinitely need to go back when I have a whole morning to waste--I mean, spend in the best way possible.

OK....so I ended up here because I just kept seeing all the great reviews on Yelp. I purchased a slice of passion fruit cake, a lemon tart, a lemon bar, a bowl of bread pudding, a cup of chocolate pudding and some kind of round pastry with the word frangipane in the title. I tried a little bit of everything when we got home and I must say that I was truly disappointed.

Okay! agree that the pastry and things they have in the store are good and delicious. Love the eclair, banana cream tart, and the almond croissant.... DELICIOUS! ÊBUT, they are a little in the pricey side, and the server I had today was very rude! So, I don't know which one should I weigh more while there are other competition with almost the same good quality of food and taste, and cheaper than this one with better customer service? Hmm... Anyway, it was worth a try and hopefully I would remember to come back and try different things... since parking was also a nightmare to find! But overall, it has good stuff and the place is cute.

Sunday morning my sister and I decided to run to Tartine from Pac Heights to work up an appetite for some pastries. We rolled up to a long line that went out the door. The wait wasn't too bad (~15 minutes) and it was well worth it. We split a chocolate croissant, a slice of pumpkin spice bread and the currant scone.

Tartine is always crowded and there are never seats for you and your friends. You'll probably get felt up in line but that's only cause people are so eager to get to the yummy baked goods that they forget you need your personal space, heck you'll prob forget too. Just pick one, or maybe two, ok stop at three things to take away. The bread pudding is good for people who don't like things that are too sweet. This place is so worth the trip!

tartine is hands down, the best bakery/cafe in san francisco. i would be blind if i dont realize how tartine's devotion to clean and scrumptuous goodies reflects their success in their own craft. i've been there twice already, and so far i've ordered the almond frangipane croissant, olive bread (savory), fresh muesli and chocolate pudding made of valrhona chocolate!...im like the walking advertisement for tartine, because i've brought 2 of my girlies there..and they ordered the bread pudding, lemon tart (very cute!), banana tart, quiche, et al. all are made at their bakery/kitchen, located at the back of the cafe. OH YES. i love how their big gynormous oven is located beside the restrooms.. AHHAHAHA.... i really know where my food from tartine came.. :D ... BUT THE THING is.. the waitresses are kinda snobby... seems passive and stressed out... they need to be more inviting and interactive. BUT tartine is the booomb.! :D Êregardless of the snobby waitresses.. lol next time.. i SHALL order a drink there, haven't ordered a drink from tartine, but one of my girlies did.. she ordered a hot chocolate! :) OH YES! WORTH THE WAIT ......... JAMPACKED WITH PEOPLE GOING IN AND OUT, BUT IT'S GREAT TO WAIT AND SEATING ISN'T BAD AT ALL... people come and go, so you get a table after you paid! hehehhe

Stopped here briefly to get a couple of things to go. ÊThere was no wait at all and the place even had available seating. ÊGot the bread pudding (to go) - the portion was good and cheap - only $3! ÊI never know what to expect when I order bread pudding since it seems to be different every place I order it. ÊThis was more bready than others, but a creamy bread with a thin layer of custard and sweet sauce. ÊIt was delicious - not too sweet. ÊAlso ordered the Dark Chocolate Devil's Cake, which was SUPER rich, and a slice of Lemon Meringue, which was a little too moist for me. ÊBoth cakes were nothing out of the ordinary, and I'd venture to say that both may have been a bit below what I'd expect from such a highly rated bakery. ÊMaybe we chose the wrong things, but definitely order the bread pudding.

The line is always long but it moves quickly the food is good. This place is really a bakery first and a cafe second but the sandwiches are not too bad. The croissant is de.lic.ious. Not too buttery but crispy-flaky on the outside and moist on the inside. And they gave us apricot jam! The morning bun was so-so. Their house coffee is suitable, even for coffee snobs like the Boyfriend, but seating is a nightmare. There are a few tables outside and a few tables inside as well as a long window-side ledge. People like to sit around over empty coffee cups just talking so this is really a place where you have to use your best unobtrusive hovering skills. If you order a hot drink other than house coffee, there's a separate bar where they'll make your drink and call your name. You pay for everything right after you order and then just go hang out until you hear your name.

OMG!! yes OMG!! I'm salivating again just thinking about tartine and all the yummy goodness that I saw and did not get to eat. If I could spend all day in one location before I die, I would probably choose Tartine. Even though the line was long as expected, it was so worth every minute. Everything looked so scrumptious and smelled so damn good my stomach kept gargling while I looked hungrily at other people grubbing. Unfortunately I was on a budget so I couldn't splurge as I normally could (pre-recession style) so I settled on something sweet and chose the pain au chocolat, one of my faves and it was just so amazing. The crust was flaky and warm, just out of the oven and the chocolate was melted just enough so that it blended wonderfully with the bread. SOOOOO GOOOODD!! Plus I had the refillable house coffee (and I happened to be standing at the counter right next to the coffee kiosk) so I kept going back for more. My cousin got something savory (we do this so we can share something sweet and salty), the quiche lorraine (which had lovely bits of bacon mmmm) and it was just warm enough and crust nice and flaky. Once again SOOO GOOODDD!! If I could go back everyday I would, but luckily I can't afford it and I don't live in SF (which is good cuz I would become ginormous otherwise). But I highly recommend anyone that's passing by SF to go, please go, this place is a serious delight for all lovers of damn good food. I will even overlook the lack of seating available because the food is that great ( I hate places that claim their food/coffee is great and use that as an excuse for their interiors being ridiculously small and cramped).

Yes, there's a line, but how else can you build up anticipation and get to watch what other people are eating. ÊThe banana cream tart seems to be the favorite at 11:00 a.m., saw them at half of the tables. ÊI had the Hazelnut Tart ($6), which wasn't very sweet, but it wasn't what I expected. ÊThe plain croissant ($3.25) was as good as it gets, crunchy on the outside, soft and feathery on the inside. ÊMy friend was making um, um sounds while she was eating her chocolate croissant. ÊThat tells you how good it got for her. ÊThe quiche looked yummy. ÊActually everything looked yummy and mouth watering. ÊWhen you walk to the corner, you can smell the butter oozing out of the place. ÊFollow your senses. ÊI finally figured out why that street corner is always overflowing.

Tasty pastries. quick friendly service. gotta self bus your own tables. pretty crowded= wait for tables. it was pretty warm inside (guess the heat from the ovens wasn't circulating that well) food was decent, watch out for the pickled carrot (bit strange)$2 for a tiny chocolate tart thing... seemed a little steep. eclectic art on the walls. nice airy space with lots of light and outside seating.

my absolute favorite bakery. best bread. best croissant. banana cream pie and coconut cream pie are also very yummy and naughty. delicious lattes. it's not a dainty french bakery - don't get me wrong - i enjoy those as well but this is just no holds barred baked goodness it's probably a good thing i don't live close by because i don't think i'd be able to stay away. this is a treat for me when i'm in the city. parking in this area is tough. you might have to walk a bit. there's usually a line and looking at the display case while you're waiting to order can be torture but one bite and mmmm.....

This place is phenomenal. They were sold out of bread but they luckily had everything else I was dying to have. I got the chocolate croissant, morning bun and the banana cream tart. The croissant must have weighed in at just under a pound. It was the richest, heaviest, butteriest thing I've ever eaten and it was amazing. THe morning bun was also delicious, but the banana cream tart was one of the greatest things I have ever eaten. Puff pastry with banana pudding, whipped cream and chocolate shavings? Yes please

Went very far out of my way to try Tartine. ÊBought three items so I could taste all that Tartine has to offer. ÊI understand the hoopla and the hype but a little piece of me thinks than anybody who uses that much butter in the croissants will make a tasty treat. ÊThe outside of the croissant was miraculously crunchy, flaky and buttery. ÊI found the inside to be a little dense but the flavor and taste of the croissant was unparalleled. ÊThe ham and cheese croissant with gruyere and Niman Ranch Ham - come on. ÊThats just too much. ÊI ate it 2.5 hours ago and I'm still full. ÊThe morning bun is ridiculously perfect. ÊA perfect combination of cirtus, cinammon, sugar and the same crusty flaky perfection of the croissant in different form. ÊI'm not usually a sweets person but that was excellent.

coconut cream pie. Ê I don't typically order it, but it was calling my name. ÊPerfect to split between two people, maybe even three girls. Ê Thick rich crust that satisfies as much as a cookie with its crunchy dark chocolate lining, decadent cream, and the dense whipped topping with a touch of coconut shavings didn't even make you feel sick or too heavy but hit every spot possible.

ÊBanana cream pie is REALLY light and yummy.. I almost thought it was HEALTHY eating it (who am I kidding). ÊI tried their chocolate chip cookies last time. ÊSO addicting.

ÊMy husband who doesn't normally eat dessert or cookies decided to eat all the cookies and half the cream pie... that itself deserves 5 stars :)

I am a big fan of pastries, especially desert pastries. This place has the BEST chocolate eclairs I have ever eaten. Most chocolate eclairs you will find has dough that is dried out and lacks taste. As well as chocolate that is hardened onto the eclair. But at Tartine it is perfect. Their dark chocolate that they use is of perfect consistency for a pastry, and tastes amazing. The custard filling that they use makes you feel even more in heaven. You have to try it. Another pastry I would recommend is their morning buns. But be warned they are very addictive.

ÊYes it has unusual time frame when the bread rolls out which is 5 pm and not in the morning. ÊChad told me they need the oven space for delicious Pastries made by his wife in the morning. ÊIn which case I can go on and on about how good the bread is but I'll let people of the yelp to decide.

When you think Tartine, you think, amazing looking space, gorgeous cases filled with amazing desserts, writer of a fabulous cookbook and a friendly atmosphere. Well, when you actually get here you you are met with a drab looking entrance, and a claustrophobic, unremarkable space. The desserts are pleasantly displayed but are among the worst I've ever had in my life. A quick breakdown of what we had. 1) Tres Leches Cake. I don't want to pull the Yelp cliche "I've had better at (insert name of chain)" but....... I really have had waaaaay better Tres Leches cake at my local random mexican bakery. This one's super light and airy, reminiscent of tiramisu. A light, coconutty, un-tres leches-y slice of nothing. 2) Chocolate Chip Oatmeal Walnut Cookie. Extremely thin, Pepperidge Farm consistency. Not good. Not rich. Not even worth writing about. 3) Buttermilk Scone. I know some Bisquick when I taste it. Had some currants in it. Tasteless. How is it possible to make such a flavorless scone? The worst. The cashier was aloof and awful. All in all Tartine is among the worst bakery experiences I've had. What are these people thinking? Are there any repeat customers here? My Tartine cookbook, which never actually inspired me to bake anything from it, is going in the thrift store heap!

Warning: they only serve bread after 5 PM! I came here in the morning to get a loaf of sourdough (which was rated the best in the city by... someone), only to find a line out the door and a sign telling me that bread comes out of the oven at 5 PM. Bummah. Instead I got a morning bun, which was good, but nothing mind-blowing. Without the orange sugar on top, it would have been totally blah.

It was a so so visit today. ÊI had the chocolate eclair and two others had the bread pudding. ÊMy eclair has a nice dark chocolate and a crispy shell, but the shell is neither that flavorful nor is the filling anything to make me jump up and down. ÊIt was a cross between heavy cream out of the carton and slightly thickened cream. ÊEverything was dripping all over because it looked like the eclair was cut in half to get the cream in. ÊBut it was so liquidy that it would not have stayed in easily anyway. The bread pudding got low to luke warm ratings for the second time in two visits. ÊToday's was simply too dry and bland. ÊThe pears were nice, but they did not make up for the lackluster bread part of the bread pudding. Unfortunately, a less than thrilling experience considering the 20 minute wait. On an up note, the service was pleasant and efficient. ÊWell done to those behind the counter.

Love coming here to try things; their range is fascinating, they do not necessarily possess a specialty like Fleur de Cocoa in Los Gatos, but are very adept and well rounded, as can be seen in the skill and flavor palette of the pastries. Bordering on "great" for some, but have so far fallen on mostly "very good" so far. Service is attentive, and have met some very warm, friendly staff (hey, hey, not in that way), so plus points for good service. Incredibly crowded, not the place to come to if you are in a rush but if it's a day to just "roll with the punches", this can be a great place to just come and get to know someone, cruise over the lines of a bestseller, laugh with a foodie friend, people watch... When you find your corner in Tartine--at the standing area, the few seats near the coffee bar, the large communal table, the outdoor chairs--it's that small, romantic, Franco-American Mission pastry love affair you can quite memorably call your own. Some things I have tried: * Bread pudding, one of their trademark products, always a bit different day after day. Not exactly my style but very tasty, looks incredibly succulent; my mother, a fan of British desserts, loved it. * Savory Quiche, very good brunch fare; rich, tasty, not mind blowing but still very good. * Croque Monseiur, not exactly traditional--there are a number of additional ingredients du jour--and left open face, it's satisfying and very good but again, not mind blowing. * Slice of Shortbread and Mocha (with a huge dollop of whipped cream). Excellent, very delicious Shortbread! Altogether came to $4.25, about the same price as a scone and coffee at Starbucks, but ten times more comforting. * Pain au Chocolat, HUGE but still classic. Buttery, super crisp, nice bitter smooth dark chocolate. Yum, delicious! A bit expensive, but I suppose it's due to the largeness of the pastry. Definitely coming back; favorite Sunday odd-hours spot on a cold winter day.

Finally made it here today, and luck struck for sure as we scored a table amidst the chaos - primarily due to the kindness of another group that agreed to cram around a tiny table for our benefit. It was a little stressful trying to figure out what they had while crammed against others in line, but the food was good. We had the morning bun, the proscuitto and provelone panini and the mushroom and leek quiche. The morning bun was great, loved the orange glaze. The panini was massive, fed three of us. Between the morning bun and the panini we were a little overload on the fried/grease, so definitely a treat! An SF gem worth checking out for sure.

We came here after our dinner at Cha Cha Cha's for dessert. ÊMy friend had been raving about this place for the longest time! ÊSo... of course... since we arrived at night, most of the goodies were gone. ÊYet, they still had a line out the door. ÊWe took our goodies togo because all their tables were taken. Ê I had a slice of their Passion Fruit Lime Bavarian Cake. ÊOK... Let me tell you... it's the REAL deal. ÊMost places in the continental US don't really have real passion fruit in their desserts or juices. ÊThey use passion fruit juice concentrate (or extremely microscopic droplets of the real fruit) and then mix it with other citrus juices, so that in the end... you don't really taste the passion fruit. ÊYou taste the orange juice or what ever else they mixed it with.... But you buy it because they market the product as "Passion Fruit blah blah blah..." and then you become disappointed because you just don't taste it. ÊThat's just my taste bud's opinion. Ê So, honestly, I did not have high expectations for this dessert. ÊI expected it to taste citrusy and more like lime and coconuts than anything else. ÊFirst bite... and I was back to a tropical paradise. ÊThe tangy sharp flavor of passion fruits was SO THERE! ÊOh my goodness! ÊI can't believe it! ÊI'm not in Hawaii or Fiji... and yet... I am actually tasting passion fruit on my tongue... ohhhh... I am so savoring every single luxurious bite. ÊI take another bite, close my eyes and just let the flavors mesh and melt together on my tongue. ÊI feel the creaminess of the cream, infused with passion fruit. ÊI don't taste the lime really... but maybe because it is sour and tangy... just like passion fruit. ÊThe flavor of the passion fruit definitely overpowers the lime (IN A GOOD WAY)...personally, I think they can just omit the lime and leave it out of the name! ÊI can feel the coarse and crunchy texture of the coconut as I chewed... and know that it is fresh (well, fresh as in picked off the tree overseas, shipped to CA, off the boat to Tartine, and chopped open onsite fresh)... I expected dehydrated dried coconut flakes... not the real, honest to goodness, fresh real real real (I still cannot believe it is real) shaved coconut! I was so so sad to finish my dessert. ÊI told my hubby that had I known it was this good, I would have bought the whole damn cake! ÊHe said that we probably couldn't finish it while it was still fresh... ha, that's what he thinks! ÊI could have eaten that whole cake in a day and not share it with him! Ê=) Ok... so the downer is that I take two stars off because after the waitress packed my slice of cake in a box, she actually licked the cream that got onto her finger... I did a double take...

Beware: ÊLong Lines. ÊNo Parking. ÊCostly pastries. ÊBut, you will die happy. ÊThe croissants have a crispy exterior and a delicious fluffy interior. ÊThe choc croissant was delicious. The cookie I had was OK but I could've bought a whole package of Oreos for the price they charged. ÊDidn't try the bread pudding, it was all gone when I got there. ÊThere's limited seating and the coffee is good. They had a note by the register telling you that due to the cost of ingredients, transportation, etc., they've had to raise their prices by 30%. ÊIf you have time to kill, then waiting in line is the thing for you if you really wanna eat here.

things you might need for a day-long excursion to sonoma: 1. a car and a dd 2. some monies for sippin' on wine 3. an ass ton of pastries for the ride there i realize long lines can be discouraging. waiting for 15 minutes in that brutal san fran cold can be a hassle, i know, but there are deliciously flaky, skull-sized croissants at the end of the rainbow. the chocolate was my personal fav, but the ham and cheese seemed to hold its own, lasting an entire day in a hot car for the sole purpose of squelching our hunger after a long day of drinking. thanks for your ham and cheese hangover protection, tartine.

I came here to have a dessert before dinner - that's right folks, dessert always comes first. Unfortunately -- it seemed like the desserts were all cleaned out! Perhaps Monday nights are not the best nights to go. Instead, I got a hot chocolate in a bowl (yummy), and my friend ordered a chai latte. I had to have something, so I ordered a macaroon cookie. The macaroon cookie was DRYYYYYYYYY -- like saharan. But my hot chocolate more than made up for it. It was perfection. I also love drinking out of those french bowls -- it brings out my inner Amelie. We sat at the communal table, which is always nice. I really wanted to try something fun though, like a chocolate pudding, or bread pudding, or another type of pudding.... I've had their bread before, right as it's come out of the oven -- so soft and warm... MMMMM.... but apparently they only do that Wed-Sun after 5:30pm. I think it's a place worth going to, but maybe on the right day.

Have you ever had two jobs? If yes, have you ever realized that you are responsible for opening both businesses on the same morning, and they happen to 'open' at the same time? If yes, did you call someone from each location to attempt to solve the problem yet were unable to get anyone to pick up (since it's 9:30am on a Sunday morning), thus leaving you the nearly impossible need to be at 2 places at once? If yes, were you a little stressed out? The answer for me this beautiful sunday morning was YES to all of the above. Don't worry, I am super woman and was able to get both locations opened, didn't need to fire anyone and didn't get fired myself and managed to stay calm during the process. How you might ask? Well I have a superman of a husband that went to Tartine Bakery this morning before they openend and stood in a line 30 people deep to pick up some morning buns and coffee for his wife to enjoy at the job she was actually scheduled to be at this morning. He saved the day by picking me up and transporting me between 1 location and the other with pipping hot coffee and soft fresh sugary morning buns in hand. Once crisis was over, businesses were open and customers were happy I was able to sit down, enjoy my yummy, gewy sugary, flaky taste treat of a breakfast and reflect on 'jobs' well done. And an added bonus - he also picked me up a coconut cream tart that I have to look forward to for dessert tonight : )

On a recent trip to SF with my boyfriend, we both concurred that Tartine was our favorite part of the trip. It's a casual eaterie, where you get in line and pay, then get a number and scout a spot to sit. The baked goods look sumptuous and heavenly, but I was in the mood for a croque monsieur. My boyfriend ordered the swiss quiche with bacon, but my croque stole the show. It was an alternative croque- with shitake mushrooms, gruyere and tomato (stewed or dried-not sure.) It rocked my world! We each had cappuccinos- so perfect you want to swan dive in. The place is popular, so scouting a table was challenging, but oh so worth it. The place has rustic decor and quirky bread themed art. I am already thinking of when I'll return. I will have to try a croissant. They looked out of this world. The staff is knowledgeable, cool, but not unapproachable- a real foodie crew. Sweet experience.

The first day I tried to go to this bakery there was way too long of a line out the door. However, because the reviews of the chocolate croissants I waited. What a waste. After a long wait in line I ordered chocolate croissants but, they were out. The guy told me it would be 15 minutes for fresh ones so I chose to wait. Big mistake! After 30 minutes I checked on my order and they said it was going to be at least 7 more minutes. By this time I had enough and asked for my money back. Did I mention the standing room only space and blaring music? On the off chance it was a bad day, I tried again Sunday morning at opening. Again a long line. This time I got my chocolate croissant. It was good but, just as good as any other bakery (I worked in a European bakery for 6 years). I also tried the morning bun noticing that on both mornings a local was eating it. I figured he knew best. The morning bun I must say was quite a treat. Rather than your standard cinnamon bun, this one had orange and sugar. It was a wonderful pairing. My husband liked it too. I had a chance to check out another bakery in San Francisco called the Chestnut Street bakery (Marina District). I would recommend this place over Tartine bakery any day. I had the most wonderul red velevet cupcake (better than Kara's cupcakes), the place was not crowded and a lot more comfortable.

well, i'm mixed..i thought the plain croissant and the bread pudding were fantastic...but the chocolate croissant was pretty crappy. actually, it would have been really good if the chocolate was slighly melted. maybe it was my fault for letting it sit for a few hours - see, when you bit into it, you basically got a block of bitter-sweet chocolate in your mouth. disappointing. oh, and the asian counter girl there has a real attitude. someone should fire her... but the other girls at the register were very nice. am i being too bitchy?

Fantabulous pastries! I've been dying to go here for such a long time, and I had the chance to go with my friend for brunch. We went all out and got a slice of ham and cheese quiche, an almond croissant, some bread pudding, and a banana cream tart. OMG... I was in heaven. The quiche was fluffy, subtle, flavorful, and just so amazing! The almond croissant was out of this world, with the perfect crunchiness, great filling, and had a pleasant denseness. The bread pudding was good, but was the least favorite of the bunch. The banana cream tart was the perfect sweetness, allowing the natural sweetness of the banana and chocolate be the strongest flavors. The crust was also perfect. I can't say enough good things about the baked goods at Tartine Bakery. Definitely lived up to the hype!

my favorite things about tartine: * morning rolls, pretty much everything. since the food needs no more reviews, how about the less talked about things... * there's always a long line on weekends -- keeps me from going too often and saves my blood sugar, waist line and cholesterol from hitting dangerous levels. * they aren't open when i pass by in the morning on the way to bart -- Ê-- saves my blood sugar, waist line and cholesterol from hitting dangerous levels. * when i walk by in the morning i love seeing the pastry chefs (would they mind being called bakers?) Êrolling dough and working their magic. i have a crush on whomever is working that day. * i'm convinced that the best street crossing in the city is crossing 18th st in front of tartine early in the morning...if a gust of wind comes down 18th from diamond heights, the air carries with it a blast of tartine pastry goodness that only dissipates from my nostrils when i'm assaulted by the piquant odor of the 16th & mission bart station steps. * this one time? i bought a morning roll? the very cute girl working the counter smiled at me and told me she made sure i got the best one in the case. that didn't just make my day, it made my month. though like a dope i didn't follow up, as the place was (as usual) insanely busy.

Solid bakery. croissant was absolutely heavenly, and was probably the best thing I ate followed closely by the lemon bar that was divine, not overly sweet but with a lasting rich and deep flavor. The latte was decent, but in a really cool cup, and I thought the bread pudding was pretty good. I'm not a connoisseur of bread pudding by any means, but I really liked the fruit, but not the abundance of moisture. Again, no expert with the croq mousier, but it was pretty good. The bread was really good. I also had a chocolate chip cookie which was really tasty. It was huge, and had a strong molasses flavor, which I enjoyed greatly. I'm a bigger fan of large doughy cookies and this one was thin and crispy, but for what it was, it was excellent. The service is good, but don't expect to be quick about eating here. It can also be hard to find a table. We ended up sitting outside, which I always love. We had some great people-watching. Overall a strong bakery which I would certainly go back to.

My friend recommended that I come here and I obliged when I was walking through the Mission. I wasn't disappointed - in terms of both its reputation of trendy hipsters frequenting its premises and the quality of their bread. After a somewhat lengthy wait in line, I got a morning bun and a frangipane tart. I hope they didn't make the morning bun in the morning because it was late afternoon when I went there. Nevertheless even if they did, I wasn't able to tell since it tasted anything but stale. While the morning bun was more simple in taste, kind of like a delicious cinnamon roll lacking in frosting and cinnamon (I know... bad analogy), the frangipane tart was bursting with berry and almond flavor. Well worth the wait and the price. Next time I come I'll be more prepared in some trendy hipster clothes.

Pastries like the ones you'll find at Tartine are hard to come by, at least in San Francisco. ÊI'm addicted to their croissants and hot cocoa. ÊI know that's nothing fancy, but they do the staples very well. ÊThe croissant is flaky and buttery, not spongy like it is at most other bakeries, and their hot cocoa is rich and very aromatic.

Awesome sandwiches, fresh ingredients and their famous bread. ÊI love the prosciutto one, you can ask for it hot pressed WITHOUT oil so it's not so greasy (and actually it's good w/o being hot pressed at all but they say don't allow that anymore for health reasons). ÊYummy hot chocolate! ÊOf course their desserts and pastries are great but that's pretty well known already. ÊLine is always long, often out the door but it's worth it.

Oh my goodness gracious! ÊTartine's pastries are sooo delish and they also bake the best bread I've ever tasted. ÊThe long lines can be a bit of a drag, but it is definitely worth the wait. ÊI always make sure to stop by this place whenever we're in the neighborhood (most likely on the way to dinner at Delfina) and pick up a few treats--my favs include their morning buns (dripping with orange cinnamon sugar!), scones, banana creme tarts, and bread pudding. ÊI also recently discovered the wonders of their bread. ÊIt's really hard not to order one of everything they have, but since I am trying to lose some baby fat, I try to limit myself to a few items each visit.

killer desserts and pastries. i love the bread pudding. add a cup of extra hot coffee with 2 sugar cubes and a big dollop of milk (hahah) and a seat outside in the sun, and i'll be happy. maybe a little too happy. i like the banana cream tart, but i would prefer the bananas to be creamed and fluffy and not just sliced. the devils food cake is yummy for a few bites, but too dense for my ideal cake. i've always had better scones at arizmendi, but these are not bad by any means. tartine is best when it's not inundated by globs of wannabee trendy folk. for real food, the sandwiches are rather tasty and filling. why not just make two halves instead of three pieces? i look around and most people can't finish the second piece let alone make it to the third. i had an unsatisfying late lunch experience at tartine. ok, it's crowded, like a pack of sardines, but does it take nearly an hour to make one three cheese sandwich? just grill the mofo. whatever, i don't hold a grudge against them.

i've been wanting to try this place forever, and today i finally had a chance. i drive down there and realize it's also right next to pizza delfina, another place i've wanted to try. so, to try to kill 2 birds with one stone, we have lunch and pizza delfina and decide to grab dessert next door. after a lovely lunch, we stroll over to tartine and run into a big line. ok, no big deal, people put their order in, pay sit down. hmmm...perhaps their system is not perfected though because the line doesn't seem to be moving. it took us about 10 minutes after we ordered our banana cream tart to go, to actually get to the register and pay, perhaps the girl is new. anyhow, the tart itself is delicious. flaky crust, ripe bananas and just the right balance of cream and chocolate. i also loved that the cream isn't overly sweet, allows me to just keep eating (perhaps not a good thing actually...)

ÊI'll say the croissants did look good - but I went at lunch and didn't want to pay $3 for a croissant I wouldn't get to enjoy until the next morning.

Tartine is my favorite bakery in the world. Imagine walking into a packed french bakery where the food is perfect and they are playing old skool michael jackson on the radio? Yes. That's tartine. The line is worth it. Things i love: the daily bread pudding, the chocolate pudding (although i ask for extra creme - that little dollop is not enough) and the warm sandwiches with pickled green beans. I usually get the black forest ham and cheese. My sister loves the lemon tart.

crowded, over priced and attitudinal. morons score a table and then get in the *ALWAYS* long line so that there are people standing around who have food and would have eaten and left by the time the moron who dropped his bag on the one empty table actually gets anything to sit down with. pricey. high quality ingredients, but it always leaves me feeling a bit too squeezed in my pocket book. Often burnt. I know many americans are used to way underdone baked goods, but they serve stuff here so past the *done* stage its no longer caramelized, its carbonized. The pressed sandwiches are good, but they are inconsistent with the application of mustard and I have had a few so smothered in hot mustard that i couldn't eat them. i order it with the mustard on the side now, and ignore the hipster cashier behind the register who thinks putting my mustard on the side is like, ya know, WAY too much trouble.... this place has been a sacred cow almost since the day it opened (which i was present for) and i wind up going here because others love the chichi abuse they get, but i would NEVER pick it if i had a choice and i usually leave annoyed. the best part about tatine is the interesting folks i have met while standing in the line or sitting elbow to elbow with. but it's a sad thing when the people watching is the best part of a bakery... try mission pie over at the corner of mission and 25th. delicious and way better energy.

Good but questionable wait. We accidentally passed by and saw the long line and decided to come back and try the place. We didn't mind the line because it actually moved pretty fast but we had quite a rude server. ÊShe was grouchy and look mad that we were ordering so much, if you get her beware (she had a sharply cropped ear length dark hair). So we ordered the morning bun, couple of chocolate croissants, the bread pudding, macaroon, some type of savory cheese pop over and coffee. We never got the macaroon because the server forgot to pull it out of the case. The bread pudding was wonderfully sweet and soft and a pretty good size for $6. The morning bun has a great orange taste that is so fresh and I love the sprinkles of crystalized sugar. I liked the chocolate croissants but wish there was a little more dough to it and not all flakey crust. The savory cheese thing was a great compliment to all the sweets. Overall I found this place a good place to try but I wouldn't be a regular. Still mad about the server too....what a grouch to be working at such a "cool" place.

My favorite bakery. ÊAnywhere. ÊIn the world. Ê And in my favorite bakery, nothing compares with the frangipane croissant which is crunchy, flaky, sweet, nutty, sticky, and buttery all in the same glorious bite. ÊThe morning bun is in the SF Big Eat list (ie, Top100 foods of the city), and for good reason. ÊAnything with that much butter and sugar must be incredible. ÊThe sweet breads are dense but moist, and like pretty much everything else here..... buttery. But the beauty of a 10am visit is that you not only get one of the best pastries in America (here, you must understand I am not at all exaggerating), but you can also pick up a sandwich or croque monsieur for lunch. ÊI haven't tried a sandwich yet that I wouldn't rate highly, but the pecorino almond sandwich has these hints of sage and lemon that will blow your mind (ok, here I might be exaggerating just a bit). ÊThe croque is available monsieur (w/ meat) or madame (w/ vegetables only), but either way, the fresh country bread, bechamel sauce, and lightly browned gruyere provide the perfect base. 5 stars for the bakery, 4 for the coffee bar which has always been good for me, but never great. ÊCoffee aside, I find the baristas here a little kooky-- talking to themselves and rocking as they gently pour the drinks. ÊLiterally, this has been the case with like four different baristas-- are they trained to do this? And ever so briefly, I must comment on the lovely bathroom. ÊIt always has fragrant and fresh flowers, not to mention clean surfaces, which you can't say for every public bathroom in the Mission, now can you? To close, I'm reading a lot of controversy over The Line. My take: ÊWhat line? This is a well-executed structure for giving the hungry customer enough time to make a thought-out decision about just how many friands, bars, sweet bread slices, croissants, etc. she's going to take home this time. These are difficult choices, people, especially when EVerything you see is delicious and perfectly done. ÊWere there no line, I would probably still stand between the bakery case and register for 15 minutes.

Lives up to the hype. 10 minute wait on a Saturday afternoon. ÊI ordered the ham quiche, brioche bread pudding, morning bun, and sopresseta panini. ÊQuiche was mouth-watering, orgasm in my mouth. ÊThe best quiche i ever tasted. ÊI am stuffing my face with the morning bun as we speak. ÊBread pudding was amazing. ÊFlan-like texture with fresh blueberries and apricots. ÊWas divine. ÊThe sopresseta panini was not good. I personally didn't like the broccoli rabe pesto. ÊBut had left-overs, and tasted better cold then hot. ÊWill definitely come again.

Looking at the line of people hungrily waiting to order their fix, one may wonder if it's all worth it? ÊHell Yeah it's worth it. ÊThe chocolate pastries are sweet, but not too sweet, and are sooo chocolately, they are beyond compare. ÊThe only comparison I could fathom is Citizen Cake. ÊBut the staff there is SOO pretentious, it's no wonder they don't have lines along the block trying to get in. ÊSo jog a few times around the block so you could feel justified in eating what you stood in line for.

This place is a buttery haven in the mission, shelling out the pastries and attracting lines of hipsters. But I must say, it is usually just ok, not fantastic. I suggest that you skip the greasy croissants and wait until after five pm for the breads to come out of the oven.... Now those deserve 5 stars for sure. I just can't give em' five starts overall, because: (a) some of the other pastries are sub par, and (b) why on earth must I wait until after five for some yummy bread?

I don't have patience for eating here on the weekends. Not when I know I can have a smoother, more relaxed brunch somewhere else. That being said, when I'm buying a cake for a special occasion, there is nowhere else I think of than Tartine Bakery. There's a cake that's like strawberry shortcake, only much, much better. I recommend a slice of that next time you're there. Their pastries are terrific, but so unnecessarily large. Makes them feel like more of an American bakery than French one.

On an incredibly hot and sunny sunday afternoon (yesterday), the boyfriend and I were driving down lovely 18th street in the mission/dolores area when hunger striked and he whisked us off Êto Tartine. I was extremely hungry, but Tartine's menu wasn't working for me. I nutted it up and ordered the Jambon sandwich and a pellegrino...I couldn't have been happier. The food was excellent, the staff was very nice and the place was crowded. Even though it wasn't entirely their faults, I am gonna minus them a star for the pidgeon that slightly attacked me while I ate outside at one of their tables. Overall I had a good experience, I will revisit and try their deserrts.

The chocolate souffle cake alone is enough to warrant frequent visits and inventing any reason to celebrate and buy a cake... the most delicious chocolate cake I have ever experienced, a lot like an incredible dark chocolate truffle, only the size of a cake.

I dream about Tartine. Literally. Since I've moved away from San Francisco, my trips to Tartine have been few and very far between. The bread pudding, almond croissant and ham and cheese croissants are my absolute favorites. They don't skimp on filling in their croissants. The almond paste in the almond croissant is heavenly. It's topped with lightly toasted almonds and powdered sugar - delicious. Their lattes come in large bowls and usually give me a good caffeine buzz. Before I leave to go back to Chicago, I always pack an extra croissant or two for the trip home. IMO, the best bakery ever - even better than Thomas Keller's Bouchon Bakery.

Insane. 952 reviews on Yelp doesn't lie - Tartine is phenomenal! I made my first trip to Tartine yesterday, a Friday, at 4 PM, and got a table outside immediately. As recommended by the cute guy ringing me up, I ordered the pressed sopressata, fontina & broccoli rabe pesto sandwich, and a heavenly almond croissant for dessert. I don't know why people have complained about the prices of the sandwiches and baked goods - after all, the ingredients are fresh, organic and locally produced. What is there not to love? I would have given 5 stars if they had heated lamps outside. It was freezing, and there were no more tables inside!

Yes, it's good (really good), but the space itself is also uninviting, (partly because) the place is chronically understaffed, and I find $7.25 for a loaf of bread too much, regardless of how good the bread is...my point being that most baked goods, particularly pastries, are prohibitively expensive.

I was so excited to come here...after hearing so much about this place and reading the rave reviews. I ordered 3 things: croissant, lemon poppyseed cake and fruit galette (sp?). I gave the last 2 items to my mom and sister and had the croissant to myself. But alas...although the croissant was buttery and delicious on the inside, it was BURNT on the outside and although that might have been a fluke, they were selling at least a dozen burnt croissants to unsuspecting newbies like me. It was like eating a barbequed pastry. But I'll try again next time -- just got lucky on the parking this time, so who knows when I can drive 25 miles here again??

so i make a trip up to san francisco with my friends, and my brother recommended this place. Êa friend of mine told me to walk past and hit up a pizza joint that was a little further down the street. Êso we tried to walk past tartine, but the amazing bakery aroma of the place locked us down, and we just had to go inside (we were starving). apparently the line was short at that moment, because it didn't start from outside (it was about 4pm and we waited about 10-15 min). KIND OF A SMALL PLACE not the best place to go with a bunch of people. Êit's hard to find a seat, and there's always a lot of people there. Êwho the hell goes to a bakery with a large group anyways right? SOMEWHAT PRICEY... ÊKINDA the menu items seem a little expensive, but the quantity makes up for the price. Êi ordered a prosciutto and provolone pressed sandwich that cost $11.75, but i got stuffed because it came with 3 large halves. Êsome of my friends got ham croques for $9.25 and they couldn't finish them. Êby the way, the water is obviously free and it's self-serve. Êi must warn you, it definitely has a metallic smell, and a funny taste, so it might be worth it to buy a beverage. THE FOOD IS DELICIOUS the flavor matches the aroma. Êi love the fact that they make their own bread. Êthe origninality makes everything taste that much better. Êthe sandwiches and croques come with miniature pickled carrots that are quite tasty. Êwhat really sold this place to me was the banana cream tart. Êit's not the easiest thing to eat, but the taste is rich yet not too sweet. Êit hit the spot right on the money. you can't lose coming here. Êit's definitely a trendy little spot in the mission of san francisco, so it's a great place to visit for out of towners. Êfor all you sf natives, i'm pretty jealous.

I had the best ham and cheese sandwich (The Jambon Royal & Gruyere) of my life here, and an amazing lemon tart. The sandwich was huge, you could make two meals out of it. I see why some people say it's the best bakery in the US. There's a bit of a wait (because it's so good!) but totally worth it. The staff is friendly and patient during the lunch rush.

line was out the door but sooooo worth the wait! it better be considering i don't even like pastries! we walked in and there were so many delectable delicious choices! Everything looked fresh and perfect! we settled on the almond croissant, chocolate croissant, ham quiche, and bread pudding! i know sounds like a lot don't worry we saved a little to savor for later! :) amazing! i think the almond croissant was the best! the quiche was also great! everything is huge and delicious! Definitely recommend the grapefruit juice as well! This is a MUST!

I know this place does not need another review. But I find my waistline expanding and for that, if anything, I'm writing something at least to justify the weight gained. It's a Sunday ritual for me, and is also one of the stops on my list as a tour guide when friends are visiting from out of town. Beware of the line, it can be long but it's well worth the wait. The place also gets hot. I prefer to scope out a seat outside (next door to Delfina) or the bench facing Guerrero. Get a glass of champagne and a pastry (you'll want all of them) but my favorite are the tres leches cake, the coconut cream tart and the bread pudding (get the bowl for $6 and share with a friend). You won't be disappointed.

Tartine Bakery, WHY DO YOU RUN OUT OF DERICIOUS BAKED GOODS?!? Well, I guess I can't really blame you, but it still makes me sad that I didn't Êget to eat them. I was hoping to get a Chocolate Crossiant Êbut they were sold out. My friend and I shared a Frangipane Tart, which had almond filling and season fruit filling. It was delicious and flaky! Next time, I will go earlier and get a Chocolate Crossiant and a Morning Bun...and maybe everything else on the menu.

My wife says this is the BEST bakery she has ever been to, and I would totally agree.

Terrible service. Ê Ê ÊPS. I was coming here 3 times a week! clearly making them at least $120 dollars a month...which stopped immediately after I just decided, I might give away my comfort (busy, loud, no place to sit) for the food, but never loss of respect to myself for their attitude.bye bye. I kept it going until the the last straw. No matter how good the food can be, I'm the customer, is my money, I'm paying and for a business to be GREAT needs to #1 have great service. #1. ÊFor the price I'm paying and the ambiance I'm getting (no where to sit, I have to wait 15 minutes to order and then another 15 minutes to get my food) You know what? ÊYOU BUSS MY TABLE. Yes, I get it, you're great and WE must accommodate to you, but you are also super wealthy and make thousands of dollars, so just pay your staff more or hire someone else to buss our table. #2. You better know the names or else!.... the will look at you as if you're out of this world. seriously. --not only know them but PRONOUNCE Êthem right. ÊYes, one time, I try to order something new (French name) and I could not pronounce it, she just stand there saying "what?" "what?" .... not tried to at least move to where items where so I could point... very arrogant attitude. You feel rushed, you order sandwiches only at the front and other coffee (except house coffee) at the other side, if you are new you might figure this out when you been waiting for 10 min on that long line!. I understand that they are busy and these girls work really really hard, I understand. But we "the customers" the people who pay for your check..want to have an enjoyable day with our coffee and your delicious pastry and no matter how tired or busy you might be, you should treat every customer as if they are NEW to your place (because many people are) and not treat them as if you're doing them a favor, no matter how good and popular your place is. When I came with my mom, it was the same thing, she's 60 years old and never been here, of course I raved about your things...but she could not decide...there are so many things and the counter girl seemed annoyed when we did not know what when she asked..and no..I'm not going to the back of the line, Please just wait 1 min!... #3 you better order 1 or 2 items only (unless you been here so many times that you know the names of all!) because the line is long, once you start getting to the front you might be past the section you're ordering and then, you might not remember the names! sounds simple, but they are not accommodating, the seem rushed, you have to go back and check the names of things to go back and tell her...(I was ordering 5 different types of cookies) and she would not help..instead she gave me this attitude, did not at least try to move a *little* to the cookie section so I could point or tell her...Geesh she's behind the counter and can easily move. Ê I said " Mexican Cookie" and two other more... she repeated back.. "Wedding Cookie" and the two other more... Êwell...I don't work here..I have not memorized the names...so I'm confused... I go back and check.. and it saids " Mexican wedding cookie" ..Ok!... Big deal!.. so I go back and say, yes, the "Mexican cookie" and she saids. "THATS WHAT I SAID"...... what? Ê she said "wedding cookie" and that's sure to confuse a person...but is not big deal, why did she make me go back and check when she could just explained is the same one or the entire name. I'm ordering 5 different types, I have not been here enough times to memorized the names of your things!... Well...This woman THREW MY BOX...yes! maybe she things I didn't see her...but I did...she was suppose to put the box with cookies somewhere so the girl in the cash register could ring me up and give me the box... I saw when this woman threw the box! and said something to her coworker...... #4 Normally, no where to sit. Ê So you bought a coffee and a sandwich or a pastry? well you have to wait 15 minutes or eat standing. If you come with family or friends...so annoying that theres no where to sit. Enjoy while it lasts, nothing lasts forever. The day will come when a new Pastry store opens up with a much bigger space and better customer service.

Really great place to grab some food. Though I may be more inclined to order out however not living close to this place I'm either eating there or in Dolores Park. Be ready to stand in a line and though the line moves quick if your planning to sit, plan on asking people if they mind sharing a table. You will also have to wait 10-15 min for anything ordered from the kitchen ÊBecause it isn't convenient to eat here it gets 4 stars but the food is arguably 5 stars. I do plan on eating here again and defiantly trying the sweets they offer but the sandwiches are delicious! Recommended!

Absolutely fantastic croque monsieur, breads, cream pies, and morning buns. The recent addition of organic Belgian beers makes this a nice afternoon stop, too. It's no wonder this place is so ridiculously busy. The staff are efficient at moving the huge lines through the small storefront.

This probably goes without saying, but Tartine is basically the definition of happy morning food. Be prepared for an insanely long line that will leave you questioning yourself for staying in it for a mere pastry, but if you can be patient, bring your iPod, and get a fresh, warm morning bun (the best pastry they have), you'll forget the line altogether. Awesome spot to pick up an assortment for friends...they'll be happy that you did. The quiche and the souffles are also well worth sampling. Early a.m. is by far the best time - when everything is still piping hot.

One of my favorite bakeries of all time. ÊI did a stage back in the kitchen one day bc this place inspired me to consider a career change into the culinary world. Ê I love that they take the fundamentals of European pastry and give its own uniquely Californian character. Ê My favorites are the croque monsieur with the pickled carrots, the coffee & capuccino (Mr. Espresso), gougeres, morning buns (made from croissant dough!), and the banana creme pie (flaky crust lined with dark chocolate) -- and I don't usually like desserts! ÊThe latter is not overly sweet like a lot of American desserts and has fresh bananas sliced in. ÊThey also make a great passionfruit cake. ÊI must try to recreate the desserts with the new cookbook they came out with since I am now out on the east cost :( Ê The line out the door is worth the wait. ÊFor those of you who don't like communal eating and like a lot of space, you won't like it here, but if you're into people watching and the serendipitous conversation with a local, this is the place. ÊI keep running into old college friends here randomly, too.

If you have a craving for baked goods in San Francisco, this may very well be one of the best spots for it. I came here the first time with my brother and his fiancee about a year and a half ago. Nestled in a street corner, it looks much like any other bakery/coffee shop from the outside. Only when you get closer do you see that the interior is completely packed with a line of people extending outside. It's a small place so it is not uncommon to have to share tables with strangers. But that is always fun as you get to meet different people. I'm not usually much for fancy pastry but was won over by the gruyre roll. It's tasty with interesting after flavors of cracked black pepper. The quiche has also been killer. Topping that off with a cappuccino makes for a great Sunday mid afternoon snack. There are just too many things to choose from so I guess I'm going to have to come back and sample everything. =)

So I dragged everyone over to Tartine on our recent trip to SF. I had seen the owner of this place on Martha Stewart and wanted to see what this place was about. After finally getting there and waiting in line, we ordered lattes and a bunch of desserts. It was a cute little place and after coming from the terrible restaurant from Chinatown we kind of wished we had had lunch there. Everything was good-but nothing had the wow factor.

ÊIt is semi transparent with a mysterious burnt flavor. ÊI feel like they boil it in a huge stock pot. ÊI can't prove it but that's the sense I get.

DELICIOUS. Crowded and expensive, but so, so tasty. Terrible for you, but so worth it. And surprisingly unpretentious in spite of their rep. Though if they're out of what i want for a third time in a row, i might knock 'em down to 4 stars.

Whenever we crave for a good dessert we make our way to Tartine. ÊWe've brought visitors and friends alike. ÊWe even pick up cakes when going to a party. ÊPeople love this place, and how could you not. ÊAlthough nothing compares to a French croissant, I truly think this place come close. Everything is amazing. ÊWe never order one thing, it's always multiple pastries and you can't forget the bread pudding. ÊI wish I worked/lived closer because I'd be there all the time. ÊThe atmosphere is always welcoming, great outdoor seating and those beautiful white flowers always peaking out of the front window and freshing up the bathroom. ÊI love it!

Amazing. First time I came, I had the ham and cheese croissant (as good as everyone says it is; the croissant is so flaky; it's amazing!) and the frampaigne (???) tart. The tart wasn't that great. But today I went back and the Banana Cream Tart was MIND-BLOWING. Seriously. The chocolate on the edge of the crust really kicks it up a notch, plus I think it's Valrhona. Their source their ingredients really well...and the cream was really yummy. Their iced coffee gave me a buzz for 3 hours (and I've gulped down 4 Red Bulls in a night before) and almost made me want to skip dinner. :( Fortunately, I grabbed a Proscuitto Provolone Panini to go. The bread was amazing. Perfect for panini's. Lots of holes but so crunchy... Will definitely be back. They had an awesome-looking Coconut Passionfruit Bavarian that I want to taste next time. Very carb-tastic. Plus, it's right next to that great pizza place, Bi-Rite, and Bi-Rite Creamery. The Mission is so foodie-happening!

I once asked my friend Brian - who is a professional pastry chef and teacher, who co-wrote a 1,000+ page book on bread/pastries/baking, who is a consultant for one of the big bread manufacturers that you see on your grocery store shelves - "Which is the best bakery in San Francisco?" He then turned my question on its head and asked me, "Best bakery for what?" Oho! Well, "bread," I said, of course. And without skipping a beat he blurted "Tartine! They know what they're doing there. The have the best bread in the region, hands down. They make the other guys seem like amateurs." I've been told by Tartine fans that people will line up around the corner before opening so they can get their hands on some of this heavenly bread stuff, and that it will sometimes sell out within an hour which is why you have to be there early. They've got all kinds of pastries and breads, and the masses typically show up to eat 'em. I've only been in a few times, and each time it has been crowded. ÊTheir desserts are yummy (I have a thing for anything that's named "cookie" or "chocolate"), but as of yet I have not personally tried the bread, which is the thing that people go here for I guess. However, if Brian the master-ninja-baker says it's the best, then it's the best - you better bet your muffins on it...and then, BUY some from Tartine to replace them. Have a happy time visiting Tartine and stuffing your face with deliciousness!

Sorry, as much as I really wanted to, I just couldnt get into the food here. I love croque monsieurs, croissants, and bread pudding. So we had all 3 in our visit.

Eat at the Tartine Bakery based on the number of reviews on yelp. ÊI was not disappointed: fabulous food!

veryy goood brunch food or dessert treats! - always a line waiting out the door, and rarely that easy to find seats after ordering, but worth it or I highly suggest buying treats and taking it to Dolores Park and having a picnic (permitted that the weather is nice) I've gone twice and have tried the following: - Banana Cream Tart (I dream of this...very sweet but so yummy to eat in bits and pieces, best part being the tart that is shelled in dark choco...makes the tart that much yummier) - Morning Bun (on the 7x7 list again, had a orange hue, very cruncy and yummy) - coffee (Delicious, a little intense, definitely feeling it after 1-2 sips but so good to accompany the sweets) - ham quiche (delicious, pretty dense for a quiche) - mushroom croque monsieur (veryyy goooddd and a nice brunch meal when starving, very large in portion) OVerall everything is absolutely tasty, only bad parts are: - price, very pricey for what it is, but i guess worth it - space is always crowded and crazy - always a long line ...but i guess thats what you have to pay for if you want such tasty delicious foods

I feel blasphemous saying that I didn't like something from Tartine. But I didn't. Typically I love anything with bananas in the mix so I was excited to try the banana bread pudding. While the bananas had a nice brulee on them, the texture of the bread pudding didn't work for me. I like a bread pudding where I can tell there was once brioche. This was almost like waterlogged mushiness. Should have gone the banana cream tart.

I had to come here after I read all the positive reviews for this place. I am a huge pastry fan, so naturally I needed to check out the hype. There was a line already formed but it moved quickly and the cashiers were very attendant. I ordered the ever popular morning bun, a lemon tart, eclair, and banana cream tart. Everything was absolutely delicious and well worth whatever wait there may be. It was so hard choosing what to get, as absolutely everything looked amazing. I was happy with my choices though. My favorites were the morning bun and lemon tart. The flavors were gorgeous and everything tasted fresh. I would definitely come back here to try other things!

I went this past weekend with my friends to hit up San Francisco with the goal of doing the Big Eat SF list. And of everything that is on that list (that I've tried), Tartine is the one that I can confidently state most deserves to be on it. When that Levain was handed to me across the counter, and I felt the warm weight of it through the paper bag, little did I know it would be the happiest moment of my entire week. Remember that scene in Ratatouille where the woman chef teaches Linguini how to listen for the perfect baguette? I felt like I put that lesson into service at Tartine. And the verdict was - excellence. I squeezed the loaf lightly and heard a faint crackling sound like the pitter pattering of bread elves on a hardwood floor. Lol. The crust was rustic, but not too hard, and once you rip it open, a most lovely puff of steam hits your face. And then you look down and are greeted by soft, doughy, holey, glutenous carb goodness. I ate half the loaf for my dinner (with Bi-Rite ice cream as the appetizer. Dessert first- you never know what might happen). Best Bread ever. Hands down.

This place is pretty amazing. I first head about it from the cookbook that the owner has. When I was there, I got a ham gruyere panini sandwich which was cut in half, but could have easily fed two. My friend also got a banana cream tartlet. It was yummerz, and had an unexpected shell of chocolate on the bottom which was a pleasant surprise, but made it a smidge difficult to eat. You would most definitely need a metal fork as we compromised the structural integrity of the cornstarch fork. I also got a berry creme cake which was rather typical. The bread pudding was yummerz and included apricots which I normally do not have in bread pudding. The raspberry tartlet was also delish and was very pretty!!! Overall, it is a pricier place that takes only cash, has a longer line, but totally worth it. This is SF so street parking only, if you're lucky!!

Okay... okay... I admit it. I went to Tartine like a lame tourist because I saw it on The Food Network's show, The Best Thing I Ever Ate. Well, after trying the double pain au chocolat (chocolate croissant) and the raspberry and peach bread pudding, I absolutely agree. Tartine has some of the best desserts I've ever ate. The double pain au chocolat was baked to perfection. It had perfect flaky crust that wasn't drenched in butter and was perfectly warmed without having the chocolate ooze out the side... but still melted in your mouth. This is one of those places you just need to visit. Why? Cuz I said so and The Food Network did, too.

I have been an admirer of Tartine for a while - their Croque-monsieur, their bread pudding, their chocolate croissant, their other pastries, but I finally fulfilled my dream - to taste their fresh-baked bread, still warm from the oven. You have to order before 3 p.m. in order to pick up bread at 5 p.m. So on a rainy Sunday afternoon, I naively called their phone number and left a message on their voice mail to order bread (I didn't even specify the type or the size). But since they didn't call me back I grew worried, sprinted through the rain to the J Church and then again through the rain into Tartine. Turns out they knew nothing about my order so I ordered it right there on the spot - a half-loaf walnut bread. The rain had subsided but I ran again, before 5 p.m. this time to the 14L Mission (I live around 30th and Church, so I get a choice between the J and the Mission lines) and 4 more blocks to Tartine, just in time to pick up my warm bread. The combined Muni Clipper fare equaled the price of the bread. I have always loved warm bread. I sometimes go to the Russian bakeries in the Richmond to get my fix. I also love restaurants that serve fresh warm bread. I even got my very own bread machine. But nothing beats the feeling of this warm bread in the hands, and especially in the mouth. The light tartness of the levain (not to be confused with American sourdough), the tandem crunchiness of the crust and the walnut, the softness of the core, the comforting warmth and the mesmerizing aroma make this the best bread I've tasted, in recent memory -- and eliminates the recent memory of running for it in the rain.

ÊI still regularly get the light fluffy quiche and the moist delicious bread putting with seasonal fruits, but I have also discovered the Croque Monsieur and the pressed sandwiches. When I finally made it to Tartine for lunch I realized how much I had been missing --the lunch menu was ripe with opportunity! ÊTwo new favorites -- the Croque Monsieur and the Pecorino and Almond Pressed Sandwich. ÊThe Croque Monsieur is an open faced sandwich of crusty country bread, gruyere, and other toppings. ÊI generally get the Niman Ranch ham version. ÊThe Pecorino and Almond Pressed Sandwich is unlike anything I have ever experienced -- closed faced pressed sandwich of pure deliciousness. ÊThe pecorino gives great flavor and the almond offer an amazing texture. Gah, want to go to Tartine NOW.

The line was reallying friggin' long, but my god was it worth the wait. ÊSorry this isn't longer, but really I think it's pretty hard to make a wrong choice. ÊDon't be afraid to take it to go, mixing and matching is a good style.

Their croissants and pan de chocolat can rival some in Paris. ÊYou see, in Richmond, VA we are not blessed with good bakeries. ÊIt is very very difficult to find a good croissant let alone a pan de chocolat. ÊNot only is the ganache large, the people working there are extremely friendly and offered up suggestions for my trip back east.

My roommate enticed me here on a drizzly day, hoping it would cheer us up. It did. I went there expecting to pay a lot of money, so I wasn't surprised at the prices of the place. My advice: eat a small but nutritious breakfast before you go to Tartine, or else you'll spend way too much money. I really like that the tables are less-than-private, European style. "Ist hier noch frei?", I wanted to ask.

After reading a review in SFGate regarding being voted as the best Bakery in America, I figured to give this place a try. ÊWow.

ÊI was FORTUNATE enough to find parking right on the corner!...(Time to buy lotto baby!) Everything inside was BUSTING like crazy! ÊLooked and smelled good! ÊWe finally settled on things we haven't really tried before: Coconut Bulvarian Cake - Nice and creamery....very good and very fattening! Êguess more time at the gym! Fruit Brioche Bread pudding - TO DIE FOR! Chocolate Croissant - ??? wasn't "SHARED" with me...she ate the whole damm thing! :( Museli? Ê(Don't know the spelling) - yogurt with wheat - result?

I love the ambiance. I love love love the freshly baked bread (it reminds me of the fresh bread in Paris!) However, I don't love how weird their bread-baking schedule is.

It goes without saying that the food at tartine is awesome. I also think that the service was great, but then again, I tip. I was appalled that so many other people didn't/don't. I read the other reviews that said bad service, attitude, etc. Well, did you fucking tip them? If not, then shut the fuck up. They help thousands of people everyday, most of them rich snobby fuckers like you who don't feel the need to tip. I had a conversation with a friend the other night who said that if people KNEW how much of a HUGE DIFFERENCE it makes when you TIP, then they totally would. I personally don't have that much faith in humanity, but here it is jerks, TIPPING MAKES A HUUUUUGGGGE DIFFERENCE. Try it sometime, and watch the attitude improve. Hell, what's an extra dollar?

Nice boulangerie in Mission. ÊIt's a tad overpriced: $28 for 6" chocolate cake! ÊI had a turkey croque and chocolate pudding and it cost me near $15. ÊBut it's certainly worth indulging in every once in a while. ÊThe croques are great, chocolate pudding is delectable, and the bread pudding changes daily based on available fruits. ÊIt'd easily be 5 stars if it weren't so crazy expensive. My only complaint is they should have some healthy salads on their menu in addition to all those delicious cheese and bechamel slathered croques and sandwiches!

Woohoo doesn't even begin how I feel about Tartine. This is a place I would come to visit even if I didn't live in the bubble that is SF. It is wonderful, divine, heavenly - and I'm not a religious fellow. Let me give you a specific. #1 - Bread pudding! #2 Banana Creme Tartlet #3 Those fantastic ooozy cheesy sandwiches. And if that isn't enough - the last time I went there a truly inspirational thing happened. Listen close - First we ordered. 2 sandwiches and some coffees blah blah. Went outside to sit at a table and wait for the food. A super charming brunette (who we see there very often - and I should be more outgoing and ask her name) comes up to us and tells us that one of the sandwiches was made wrong, so we will have to wait a short bit. She gives us the wrong sandwich for free and gives us a refund. And then delivers the correct sandwich about 10 minutes later. A refund and the sandwich. What? With a beautiful smile and a sincere apology for the wait. This entire experience I have just re-canted......has NEVER happened to me in SF. No one has ever had that amount of genuine care during an ordering/dining experience for me. I was so blown away I was speechless. I just keep mumbling thank you thank you thank you. I will always be a loyal customer of Tartine just for that one experience. My faith in the service community was restored - just from spending the 20 minutes or so in the company of this fantastic employee at Tartine. I work in the service industry as well (I guess don't we all) and I was truly impressed. Oh and guess what - the food was of course AMAZING. Like always. Thank you over and over Tartine.

Tartine's pastries are certainly decadent and nice to look at, but meh, I'm still not sure it's worth all the hype. I've been here a couple times and sampled the pain au chocolate, cinnamon roll, brownie and some sort of frosted chocolate cookie thing. All were pretty tasty but way more rich and heavy than they needed to be. Is it possible to leave this place without a stomachache? Anyway, they lose at least one star for the unpleasant woman working the counter.

I probably need to go to this place again to give Tartine a fairer review since there's a plethora of choices. The morning bun was OK - (If you like your pasteries dry). However, it was fresh (I know, sounds paradoxical) and the flavor had a nice tinge of orange. To my dismay, I was expecting a stellar, remotely euphoric taste of a $4.00 tea. Also, this place is always packed, so expect long lines and to be standing around for awhile to get a table.

Does this place really need another review? Heck no but I just felt compelled to (sorta) quickly say that ever since eating my first REAL croissant in Paris minutes after it came out of the oven waaaay back in '95, I have been searching and searching and disappointed EVERY time for a Êcroissant even remotely as buttery, tender inside but lightly crisp on the outside and oh so friggin delish here in the US. ÊTrust me - I have eaten my fair share of croissants all across this awesome country and NOTHING compares to the real thing. Ê BUT I had Tartine's version today and I did a double take. ÊExactly like the genuine article? Sadly, no. ÊPretty damn close that I'll be back for more when I'm jonesing for a quality croissant? ÊHells yeah! ÊIt only took 14 years to find the damn thing - mon Dieu!

I made love to a morning bun and a few bites of the Croque Monsieur yesterday. I was able to get to find seating at one of their rustic, farmhouse-like tables, drink their delicious coffee, which is as many free refills as you want, and chat with friends and people-watch. It doesn't even bother me that the place is tiny and crammed and that you have to wait in line at least half an hour.

Tartine makes good pastries, burnt. ÊYou can tell they made the pastries well (croissants, quiche, etc.) but they overbake almost everything, so that it's overly dark and subsequently over-crunchy and dried out, or just completely burnt (and still serves it!). ÊI went twice to give them a second chance, but on the second trip I got several things and they were all overbaked (tart, quiche, bread pudding, eclair). ÊYou can even see in some of the pictures already posted that the pastries are too dark, with some black regions (most obvious on the croissants). ÊI just think that is a poor pratice for a bakery/establishment. ÊWon't be coming back.

I'll make this short so I don't start salivating and short out my computer ... I LOVE the toasted sandwiches. ÊI start drooling just thinking about the turkey/broccoli pesto. ÊThe only reason I don't get it more often is it takes forever to make it (if I order it and my party gets something else, they're usually done before my sandwich arrives). ÊThe passionfruit Bavarian lime cake is amazing (especially when served just a little cold). ÊThe bread pudding isn't too shabby either. ÊThe only other downsides I'd mention are the wait (first you wait in line, then you wait for an open table, then you wait for your sandwich) and the prices are quite high. ÊI go as a special little lunch treat ...

"I'd like a pain ow jam bone." "One pan aw jamb on." "Jaum baun, please." Me? I just point. But it's okay, because (1) the folks behind the counter have heard it all before and know what you want and (2) regardless of how you pronounce it, it's still friggin' delicious. They're even better fresh out of the oven; the 15 minute wait is totally worth it. ÊThe plain croissants are a bit more hit or miss; I feel sometimes they come out a little too burnt. Actually, that's probably the case for all of their croissant-based items. I don't have much of a sweet tooth - except for ice cream - so it may be just me, but except for some of the tarts and the apple turnover (which isn't always available) all of the sweets are a bit too sweet for me. I would probably love the frangipane a lot more if they could turn it down a bit. I'd like to try items from the cafe if I ever get the time (too hard to eat a quiche on the run); for now, the rating is based solely on the baked goods that you can eat with one hand.

I see the potential in this place..and thats why i gave it 4 stars..it deserves a 3.5 i'd say but yelp hasnt caught on to the need for 1/2 stars yet...till then... I cant speak for the pastries, but my boyfriend and I ordered two sandwiches.. the sheep cheese and lemon, as well as the turkey pesto sandwich (which actually was not the sandwich we ordered ..) The bread was amazing, AMAZING...Soft to bite but just the right amount of crispy on the edges. The sandwiches huge.. two people can definitely split one of these ridiculously priced, $13 sandwiches! The insides.. not so great. The sandwich with the sheep cheese was toooo sweet, we didnt finish it and ended up drinking gallons of water after. And both sandwiches had so much butter on them that the butter was literally dripping down arms on every bite. our hands were covered in butter and we literally used dozens of napkins. it was veryyy odd how buttery the sandwiches were.. but i suppose nothing with butter can taste completely bad ... ?

I am definitely a fan of Tartine. We stopped by here while waiting to get seated at Defina Pizzeria up the street. My sister raved about the crosiant so I had that in mind, but while standing in lined, I looked over at the bakery window and I knew that I couldn't just get a crosiant. I actually ended up ordering two crosiants, a Almond tart, and a Banana Cream tart. Although I didn't get to eat them until the next day, the Almond tart was delcious. I love almonds, so it was just perfect. Not too strond and not too dull. The Banana Cream tart was awesome too, but unfortunately, I wasn't able to finish it all since I had to catch my flight. The crosiant was okay, but the next time I go there it won't the crosiant I'll be waiting in line for, it will definitely be the tarts and the bread pudding (base on other reviews). PROS: -Decent price for the quality of food -Service was good -Delicious bake goods CONS: -Very limited seating.

Ordered: Morning bun Latte Cappuccino Shortbread Chocolate chip cookies My husband and I shared one of their famous morning buns. It was delicious, flakey, buttery, sugary and good, but personally, I'm not a fan of the orange flavor. I know that's what a lot of people like, but for me, I prefer the actual fruit rather than something else being infused with its flavor. I had a latte, he, a cappuccino--we both very much enjoyed them. Perfect w/the morning bun. We also got some shortbread and chocolate chip cookies to-go for my son, but I ended up eating them (gave him cupcakes from Kara's instead). Ê I want to go back to try more of the pastries, especially the croissant with frangipane and one of their savory items. First review from Feb 2010 Unfortunately, they were out of the cinnamon buns by the time we got there, so we opted for the banana bread pudding and almond tart. We were quite disappointed w/the bread pudding, but the tart was delicious. Would definitely go back to try their many other pastries--both sweet and savory.

We had to wait 20 min for them to finish another batch of pan au chocolat and had a croque monsieur while waiting which was really tasty, along with some tasty bread pudding.

Just wanted to write a newer review to correct the old reviews saying not to come here if you're vegan. I got bored while my friends waited in line and, figuring I'd have no choices, got breakfast from Bi-Rite. Then I discovered that actually they have vegan carrot cake! The kamut flour taste was a little too healthy-tasting by my standards, but I appreciated that for waiting around for half an hour, I had something to go with my soy cappuccino, which was also delicious. My food didn't look quite as mind-blowing as my companions', and it wasn't worth the wait on its own, but if you're a vegan and your whole posse is going to Tartine, don't ditch them and eat at Bi-Rite! Then you'll have had 2 brunches and be way too full. Learn from my fail.

Tartine Bakery is the sort of place that makes me deeply grateful to live in San Francisco. ÊCompared to other cities (and countries) San Franciscans are blessed with a phonebook full of good bakeries -- so much so that even our lesser bakeries would be considered great if they were relocated to a lesser city. ÊAnd with so many bakeries of similar quality, it's arguably a waste of time to compare them. ÊTartine Bakery, however, is different from the average bakery. ÊIn fact, Tartine is so far above the so-called competition as to warrant particular notice. Tartine's baked goods are truly in a league of their own. ÊWhether this is a function of superior technique, or better ingredients -- I'm not qualified to say. ÊWhat I can comment on is taste, and in this respect Tartine has no equal -- not in Paris, or New York, or any other city where you'd expect to find great bakeries. ÊThe simple croissant is a good example. ÊAt the better bakeries in Paris, you'll find a buttery, flaky croissant -- tasty, no doubt. ÊAt Tartine that croissant is both buttery and flaky, but the butteriness is so much richer, and its flakiness balanced with crispness. ÊIt's an elevated experience. ÊThe same can be said of Tartine's frangipane croissant (and similar creations), with its perfect balance of butter and almondy-sweetness. ÊThese are standard offerings at most bakeries, but Tartine's version of these croissants stands so far above the others that it's not fair to compare them as if they were like products. The same praise can be heaped on everything Tartine produces. ÊFor example, I recently brought home a coconut cream tart for my wife who is fond of coconut. ÊI'm less fond of coconut -- or I was before tucking into that tart. ÊIt was rich and creamy, yet simultaneously airy and light. ÊAnd where an ordinary crust would be dense, mealy and flavorless, Tartine's crust had a lovely flavor and was just the right texture. ÊHere was the Goldilocks of crusts, and indeed, of tarts. ÊI could carry on in this vein ad infinitum, but these examples are representative of everything Tartine produces. Some reviewers have complained that Tartine is expensive, while others have spoken of long lines. ÊWhile both complaints are valid to a point, they should be kept in proper perspective. ÊYes, you will pay more for Tartine's goods than other bakeries' products. ÊBut the adage that you get what you pay for is entirely true, and applies as much here as anywhere. ÊIf you're on a tight budget, you can easily buy a lesser product elsewhere. You will likewise often find a long line snaking out of Tartine. ÊIn my experience, the line moves pretty quickly, so I've never viewed this as a particular problem (though I take my goodies to-go, so if you plan to sit down and eat at Tartine, the crowds may prove to be annoying). ÊAnd on a related subject, parking is a bitch around Tartine (as it is in much of the Mission). ÊIf you have to drive there, my best advice is to try to visit during the day, when this neighborhood isn't quite as packed.

I guess sometimes people expect way too much from a place, and let me tell you I expected too much from this place. Don't get me wrong Tartine is a really good place for dessert lovers, I mean just from the name "Tartine" people can expect it to be fancy and a good bakery place. However, I must say that I like the banana cream tart, I don't LOVE it but I must say the taste is pretty good that i would categorize my liking into a 4 star. I recommend to just try almost every variety of the pastry selection they have, one thing i tell you, you are not going to disappoint yourself in trying new flavors. I wish that they would make larger spaces for the seatings though, it would be so much nicer if the customers are not clamped together in a confined space. But I guess, you could always sit outdoors and enjoy the view. Also point to remember is that Dolores Park is nearby and its just amazing to have Tartine foods while enjoying a beautiful scenery out in the park! But don't expect that Tartine is the best of the best bakeries in town cause i think there are still better ones out there:) Overall however, i still enjoyed this place:)

We decided to skip dessert at Delfina and stopped by Tartine Bakery on our way out. ÊThe case was filled with desserts that your eyes would feast on before your mouth! I picked up a coconut cream pie, a slice of the lemon meringue cake, a lemon cheesecake tart (I adore all things lemon!) and a small bag of the chocolate chip walnut cookies. Yes, yes..i know, seems like a lot but i wanted to taste them all, even if I don't finish them! Unfortunately, I started tasting before I started taking pictures...oh well, besides that there are PLENTY of photos for your eyes to feast on here! My favorites in order: the coconut cream pie ...filling was so good, creamy and very toasty coconutty :-) the crust was lined with a bitter sweet chocolate but almost tasted burnt so i tried them separately and they were both good! The lemon meringue cake...flavor was good, cake was good...confusing to the pallet, my preference would be to stick to lemon meringue pie. Moving on! The lemon cheesecake tart...very nice flavor and texture! And finally the chocolate walnut chip cookies. I love walnuts in my chocolate chip cookies, reminds me of childhood, but what made these extra ordinary was how thin and crispy they were! I would highly recommend a stop by if you are in the neighborhood...I would even recommend skipping dessert at Delfina and save room for Tartine!

The best pastries in town. You cannot beat the: Morning Bun, Ham and Cheese Croissant, Frangipane Croissant. However, lesser known is that Tartine's has the best BREAD in town. Trust me on this one. The french bread is mindblowing, and helps you remember what bread really is.

De-friggin-lectable! Terrific savory pastries - the sweet ones are even better. The sandwiches are good, but who needs "real food" when you can gorge on pain au chocolat, banana cream / coconut cream pie, that evil chocolate crack - I mean cake - with chocolate ganache and caramel, lemon meringue cake, dense chocolate brownies, Scharffen Berger chocolate pudding.... One of the reasons why I've cancelled my Atkins plans 20 times (every time I wanted to start, I find myself staring at that chocolate cake!) In the spirit of full disclosure, the seating situation is dire (please open another spot), plus now that the hordes of yupsters (yuppie-hipsters) have descended on that place.... Oh, the service can also be uneven - some of the girls are sweeter than the desserts, some others make it painfully obvious that they are way too good to be serving you ;).

Definitely one of my Top 3 favorite bakeries in the city. ÊI always get a ham and cheese croissant (croissant au jambon et fromage), and a latte. ÊIt's just around $5 and it's the best start to my day I could ask for. ÊThe ovens are pretty hot here, so every now and then you'll get a croissant or other baked good that has a great brown crust but is a little doughy in the middle, but overall the product is pretty superior here. ÊYour best bet is to come during the weekdays or late afternoons. ÊHowever, if you come too late they might not have as big of a selection.

Wifey's Review: While on my way to try Pizzeria Delfina with my husband, I noticed a corner store with a line out the door that passed the second bench. ÊI had no clue what people were waiting in line for. ÊWhen we were done eating at Pizzeria Delfina, the lines were even longer! ÊI did not see any sign until my husband said, "It's Tartine." ÊStill I did not recognize the name until I went on Yelp and found out. Since that day, I have been to Tartine 4 times, and each time I go I always order 2 different pastries. ÊMy husband DOES NOT like sweets, so there is MORE for me. ÊAnyway, of all the times I have been there, the lines were not bad at all, the employees were always pleasant, and the pastries are very, very good. ÊI recommend the morning buns which have very yummy, gooey, and distinctive flavors of orange cinnamon glaze. ÊIt is very unique and very good. ÊThe lemon tart is perfect in its tartness. The crust is just the right flakiness. The coconut tart is perfect as well. It has the flaky, buttery crust which is then layered with dark chocolate. ÊThen to add more happiness to my taste buds, there is another layer of rose flavored caramel! ÊCan we say "decadent'? ÊAfter all this heavenly goodness, you get to the main event, and that is the creamy coconut atop with fresh cream. ÊIt is so good. ÊThe lemon meringue, passion fruit Bavarian, strawberry Bavarian, and chocolate cakes are all very good as well. ÊFresh and unique flavors are highlighted in every bite. I tried their butter croissants, but I felt it was a bit too bready and not enough flakiness. Ê Ê Have not tried their lunch menu yet. ÊOverall, this is great place to have desserts with friends and family after having pizza at Pizzeria Delfina (review will be coming soon).

I don't dig the lines or the attitude that sometimes jumps out from across the counter, but these pastry-slinging broads are the sweet bun sirens of SF for my money. ÊWent there recently and everything was superb. ÊQuality of quiches, almond croissant, croque monsieur, etc., was what I would expect from a reputable boulangerie or bistro in Paris.

The best croissant ever? in San Francisco??!!?? That's what I heard from the reviews in mags & etc. But let's see my personal review... When I came there like around 11am, the line was there, & I was so hungry havent got any breakfast yet, so once it was my turn to order... I ordered the croissant of course & banana nut bread w/ the blueberry muffin (whoa i was really hungry!)+ i don't want to be in line anymore, so i grabbed all those 3 to-go! when i tasted the croissant, it was definitely buttery, well to be honest it wasn't like I expected. ÊI guess I expected the best?? Well, it's not the best, it is rather ok,, i tried the banana nut bread it was sweet and crummy. It was not bad, i tried the banana nut bread in starbucks too they're really good & taste a lil' better than tartine. the muffin, it was just taste like another regular muffin; but i ate all that and i was really full!! So, the overall experience is I don't think it is the best bakery in the city, & to me i won't be going on a line just for an ok bakery like this. i could find other croissant way better somewhere else. I really still dont get it why people like tartine that much. well, everybody have opinion, but that's what i think. They do have a lot of varieties, however I just say this place is just an ok place. So best croissant in SF?? Not to me...:D

The food is really good, but the line is always so long and moves so slowly that the other brunch places in the neighborhood must be thankful for the customers Tartine drives to their business. I have given up on the wait several times and I believe this could be improved without much effort. For example, if the customers could see the menu while they wait, it wouldn't take 5 minutes per person to place an order once they get to the cachier. They are lucky that there aren't many French bakeries in this city.

Tartine. Too easy? Not a challenge? Ok, the crowd waiting outside is definitely enough to put you off your appetite. My girlfriend refuses to wait here with all the hipsters on principle. She doesn't want to be part of the mindless mobs waiting when any competent establishment would get its act together and find a way to deal with the lines. I used to share her opinion, til I ate here a few times. Tartine has a long line because most of the stuff is great. Really great. The morning buns are unbelievable, sugary, carmely wet dreams of flavor, at least when they have them. The last two times I've waited in that stupid line with the effeminate dudes wearing ski caps from Nordstrom's they have been OUT OF MORNING BUNS!!! IN THE MORNING!!! Hello, I just waited in line 20 minutes with Scarlett Johansson's cousin from Aspen's yoga instructor and you're out of morning buns? At 10 am? Talk about suckage! So when they're out of buns the ham and cheese croissants are an excellent fallback item. Take your damn ham and cheese croissant, sit in Dolores Park and eat it. Better yet, take your morning bun AND your ham and cheese croissant. Make sense? Does to me. I had a croque monsieur once... didn't know how to pronounce it. There was something in the sauce, like a lemony bechamel, that was a little too tart for my taste. The bread looked right, the cheese looked crusty enough. Didn't knock me out. I've had couple other things that were good. Four stars because of the crowd and failure to deliver on said morning buns.

I can't say anything here that probably hasn't already been said. So let me quickly state the following: - Avoid the muesli. I was going for a long-ish bike ride afterward, so was looking for complex carbohydrates (yeah, I know that sounds gay. But I'm no longer in HS where my lunch would be ... a 2 litre of coke). The muesli tasted like a bunch of shredded dried coconut with little in the way of whole grains. The yogurt was kinda tasteless too. - They've got the best croissants outside of France. period. - Since their success, the quality of their food hasn't degraded one bit. THAT is something to shout about. You definitely can't say the same for Ritual Roasters.

It's not easy to maintain such attention to quality, day after day after day. If Tartine wasn't so good, there would be no long line, and maybe even no sullen servers(though I doubt it). Maybe some day they'll get a bigger place and staff it with smiley people. Until then I'll put up with the rough edges so I can get my sugar.

So I wanted to not like Tartine because they made me wait nearly 40 minutes for a single panini on a relatively slow weekday, and because I generally enjoy being a curmudgeon towards places with a lot hype but, alas, they spoiled my curmudgeon-liness. ÊThe panini was fabulous; the bread perfectly caramelized and crisp on the outside, chewy interior--yummy. Ê I like also like (to my chagrin) that they don't feel the need to add a hundred ingredients to each sandwich and instead focus on a few simple, fresh ones-- a la Alice W. ÊTried a couple cookies, which were okay, but was sad that I didn't have any appetite left for a fabulous looking peach tart. ÊI'd like to go back and see if I can find anything to nit-pick about (come to think of it, $11 is a lot of dough for a sandwich-- pardon the bad pun) but I have a feeling I'll be out of luck.

Yes, they make amazing pastries. ÊI live in the neighborhood, though, and don't go unless there isn't a line. ÊWhy? ÊBecause they came out with a cookbook a few years ago, and well, I can make just about everything I would stop in for. ÊAnd I don't want to wait on line for a half hour with people who (1) don't have a clue how to choose what they want while waiting and (2) have no regard for personal space and (3) are maybe, quite possibly from out of town, spewing inanities, grabbing tables when they first get on line, etc. ÊThe experience of waiting in line at a place two blocks from my house--no. Which brings me to today. ÊThere was no line. ÊI stepped in, was second in line, but still somehow managed to wait for ten minutes to both order and pay. ÊWhat is with the people they have working there now?! ÊThere are only a few "old-timers" who still have a few brain cells and understand both civility and efficiency, but the rest... holy crap!! ÊThe blank stares, the ridiculous outfits, the serving of a "double" cappucino that's the same size as a one-shot cappucino (what?!), the overly dressed little salad, the semi-warm quiche. ÊAnd then the girl who delivered my quiche took the table number so that the girl with the salad (who had taken my order BTW!) walked all around wondering whose it was. ÊI was frustrated beyond belief. ÊAnd I hadn't even done the half hour plus wait. ÊSigh. And I just want to say... with a few exceptions, they always have the same stuff. ÊI understand that they're famous for a few things and that they make basics like croissants better than anyone in the U.S., but it's become stale and boring, honestly. ÊI think there's a little resting on laurels happening.

I get together with a friend about once a month to catch up and we always meet at Tartin. Usually on a weekday morning before the line gets too long. They make excellent quiches, bread puddings w/ seasonal fruit, morning buns, etc. Everything is absolutely yummy. You can sit outside (or inside, of course) while enjoying a tasty treat and coffee/tea while watching the ppl of the Mission get ready for work. It is really delightful.

You can't beat the morning buns from Tartine. ÊThe bread pudding and banana Cream Tart are simply delicious, too. ÊBut I think that Tartine's various grilled cheese sandwiches are its unsung heroes. ÊPeople watching is fantastic. ÊThey have a DIY service attitude that I don't mind. ÊFinding parking and then a table to enjoy your treats is the only challenge.

Tartine morning buns are the best: sweet but not sugary, cinnamon kissed but not a cinnabon and a kick of orange zest. Other pastries are also great if you have time for them. Not as thrilled about the bread pudding but others (the gf) seem quite enthused about it so perhaps I'm just not a great judge. Line and parking are annoying but get there around opening and both are generally avoided.

I'd heard that the croissants were "simply the best I'd ever tasted", so after having a lovely brunch at Lovejoys, we went over to pick up a few baked goods for later in the afternoon. A few commenters mentioned that everything looked "overdone" - it appears that they do indeed bake their pastries at a higher temp. and probably coat them with egg whites to give it that browned color, which I found to be excellent in a croissant. Nice crispy outside, tender buttery inside - perfect! Other items, including the ham and cheese quiche and cookies were also fantastic. For the food, I give it 4 - maybe 4.5 - stars. I thought it was excellent, but others in my party were a bit turned off by the crispiness. The service and outlay of the bakery? A problem. Other reviewers noted the almost lazy or careless attitude of the staff. I noticed the sort of "yeah, whatever" look on a few, but the particular problems are: 1) The cashier that day had the bubbly "and screw you too!" attitude, which we did not appreciate. Not helpful, and snide. Which, in part, was caused by... 2) The noise. We struggled to make ourselves heard by the staff, and they mumbled questions to us. Frustrating, but all of this was compounded by... 3) Their ordering system. Having a small bakery with a few staff people serving up a few people (say 5), that's fine. How it works on a crowded day is: there's this big line. Once you get to the beginning of the glass displays, a staff member asks you what you want. You haven't seen all they offer yet, so you struggle to peek around other people as you give them a few items you like. They take a break at each item you recite to fetch a bag to put that item on, then ask you if there's anything else. Arrgh. By the time you get up to the cashier, your helper is off getting someone else's order, and if you have something warming or don't remember exactly everything you ordered, the cashier has no good way of finding out. That was the problem with the attitude we had. She asked what we'd like to eat, we said we'd already ordered, she asked what we got, we didn't know for sure the name of everything, she complained that no one else had ever had a problem remembering... etc. A recommendation, owners, is that you give the help staff NCR or carbon paper order sheets - sort of like deli's do it. They scribble down your order, and when you're done listing what you like, they give you a copy. They take their original copy and fill the order, putting everything neatly in a bag. They can then attach their copy to the bag (with a name, optionally), and then when the customer gets to the register, they either hand their copy to the cashier or the cashier grabs the bag and *bam!* NO CONFUSION! This also would help the customer double-check their order to make sure an item wasn't drowned out by the noise, and would keep the cashier from thinking that you wanted something *for here* as opposed to *to go*. Please please please improve the ordering process, and perhaps help the staff members understand their attitude isn't making the process any better. For now, I won't go back.

Bread pudding for breakfast? Sure. Why not? At Tartine, feel free to pair this typically dessert food filled with yummy fruits with a piece of their corn and tomato quiche and some coffee for the first meal of the day. You will start your day with a full belly and a smile on your face. Consider sharing because the servings are generous.

If you could pick your heaven... this would be mine. I have never gotten anything I haven't liked here, regardless savory or sweet. I tend to order a lot between myself and my friends when we go here, so I've had most of the menu. Their sandwiches have 3 halves. Seriously. If you cut a normal sandwich in half (=2 halves), and then add another half. My ultimate indulgence is the frangiapane tart. The line may seem intimidating and a deterrent to eating here, but fear not, it moves quickly. Finding a place to sit is more the issue, but with Dolores Park down the street, I think your issue is resolved. You must try their coffee. I am not a coffee person, and I will go out of my way for a cup of joe from them. If I lived closer, it would be dangerous. I think I would need therapy for my addiction.

Tartine Bakery is a great weekend spot. ÊThe line goes out the door every day with people waiting to get their fix. ÊEverything on the menu is incredible. ÊThe quiche is light and tasty. ÊThe morning buns are perfection. ÊThe banana cream and coconut cream tarts are heavenly -- they take a pie crust and cover it in chocolate before filling it with caramel, custard and either toasted coconut or bananas. ÊAlthough I have not tried the croquette sandwiches, they are supposed to be legendary. This is a very dog friendly corner near Mission Dolores. ÊA few tables outside to soak up the sun and people watch make this a great spot to kill some time.

The morning bun was AMAZING - even the next morning after a night of refrigeration and subsequent re-toasting, it still had the delightful flaky crustiness. The bread pudding was a bit too eggy for my tastes, but was definitely not too sweet, which is good. Was not a fan of the Three Cheese sandwich, but the freshly baked walnut bread was delicious with cheese from the Bi-Rite store down the street

just like the 1,700+ other people, i'm a fan! we had the chocolate croissant (pain au chocolat?) - the pastry was crispy on the outside and soft on the side, with just enough chocolate. also had the bread pudding which was also really good, it was warm and not too sweet. Êand lastly, we got the croque monsieur (open faced sandwich)... they ran out of the shiitake mushroom, so we got the spicy turkey. Êwasn't too spicy, and the bread was really soft. we got there at 10:30am, on a tuesday, and the line was out the door. Êthe line was still out the door when we left 1.5 hrs later.

Jeebus. I've been here twice around 6:30pm and they've run out of morning buns, chocolate croissants, and everything else that I wanted to try :( the first time I just walked out since nothing looked tempting (and nearly $10 for a savory sandwich thinger? omg) but the second, I opted for a coffee, a mexican wedding cookie, and a chocolate walnut cookie. Everything was seriously delicious. I was going to take it to go but then saw the inviting community table and took a seat with my book with the other loners who were sitting at the table with their books. The mexican wedding cookie was a little too over-powdered for my tastes, but the inside was perfectly textured- not dry but not moist either, just the perfect amount of crispness! nom nom. the chocolate walnut cookie was delicious too.... it had an interesting flavor since there wasn't TOO much chocolate and walnut balance was great. Next time I come by Tartine.... please have chocolate croissants and morning buns!!!!!!!!!!!

The croissants at this place are like no other. The gods of buttery, flaky, and delicious have blessed this place a thousand times over. If you are in San Fran and don't get by here for breakfast, you have made a major mistake. It is pretty quick even if there is a line. No waiters- you just order at the counter, eat wherever a spot opens up, bus your own table and leave. The regular croissant and the chocolate filled one are what I recommend.

My favorite thing about Tartine is that I once was at a Make Out Room event to raise $ for Kerry/Edwards and some guy next to me was saying to his perfectly T-shirt and raggedy jeans-ed out friend next to him "Yeah, he says he's alternative, but Becky says she saw him at Tartine last Saturday".

Tartine is certainly worth the wait. You need to know what to order. Systematically trying it all is a great option. I like the muesli - it is light and healthy, with yogurt, cashews, fresh organic fruit and berries, almonds, walnuts... SO yummy. The perfect opening to something heavier like a chocolate croissant. The croissants are perfectly flaky, buttery on outside, soft and melt-in-your-mouth fluffy on the inside. If you ask, they'll give you Êhandmade apricot jam with the croissants. A friend who has travelled to Paris frequently says they are the best he's had in ten years. The bittersweet Scharffen Berger chocolate pudding is perfect. As is the double chocolate croissant, though it's intense - enough to be its own meal, as I found the coconut cream tart to be, as well. It's all the best. My only complaint is that they limit one's caffeine intake and will not serve a "large" cappucino, latte, or anything except for regular coffee. Only doubles in tiny "small" size cups. But the large servings of chocolate contained in the pudding or croissant make up for it in spades.

How do I even begin to put into words the sheer adoration I have for Tartine Bakery? I've been a faithful customer for several years now and can confidently say that my overall experience, from the quality of the food to the service, has been nothing short of exemplary. The croque monsieurs and hot pressed sandwiches are consistently delicious, probably because they share the base of Chad Robertson's absolutely perfect bread for all those other fine & tasty ingredients. The sopressata and pastrami Êare personal faves. The pain au chocolat and pain au jambon are cafe mainstays that get elevated to buttery, flaky, and scrumptious greatness, shaming the versions you'd get elsewhere. And Elisabeth Pruitt is hooking you up with an invitation to nirvana with the ridiculously awesome coconut cream and lemon cream tarts. Seriously, we're talking about some transcendent pastries here. It's really disheartening to read the (thankfully) scant negative reviews about either the food or service at Tartine. Regarding the latter, it has been my experience that the staff of Tartine has shown a commendable amount of poise and restraint when dealing with the throngs of "challenging" people that come through there at all times. It seems to be indicative of such successful and special places like Tartine that they are frequented by the types of people that feel *entitled* to all the great stuff offered by the establisment. Such is their self-absorbtion that it seems almost impossible to please them. I've observed adults who should know better act like bratty little children when they can't get what they want. Well boo-effin' hoo. It's not the staff's fault that you got there after they sold out of your precious morning bun. And you have the nerve to get bossy and expect them to stay open "just a few more minutes" because you couldn't get your privileged ass in there before they've closed the doors and registers. Get over yourselves. So as not to end this review on a sour note, I want to say that Tartine Bakery is the type of place that makes me feel lucky that I live in San Francisco or, for that matter, anywhere in the bay area. I've taken countless out-of-town visitors there and they all look back on the experience with fondness and usually can't wait until the next time they're in town so they can go back. Recognize the real. Tartine is the lick!

A wonderful bakery, where the bread and baked treats are delicious but the service is can't-be-bothered. Best to order and split than wait for a table to be cleared for the next eager-to-be-ignored diner. There seems to be a boycott on wiping off tables in order for a layer of evidence to build until the end of the day. Even more puzzling -- there is a notice on the cash register that says, "Thanks for busing your own table!" but there is not a clue as to where to put the dirty dishes when attempting to comply. Do we push our way back into the kitchen? I like baked goods, but the "what, me work?" attitude sours the entire experience.

OK I still love Tartine but as goes the way of most great things in the City, once they get too popular and full of themselves, the quality diminishes. Coconut Cream Tart Ê- still no doubt awesome but come on! $6.50 for a small tart? Bread - yes I do think your walnut bread is outstanding but must you absolutely CHAR the outside? ÊAnd don't tell me that is how they do it in Paris. ÊI've had Poulane's and it is not black on the outside. ÊDANG - turn the oven down some - it even tastes charred. ÊAlso don't give me a dirty look when I ask for a loaf you haven't burned. Still love the clientelle!

Spectacular pastries! ÊLike Cambridge's High Rise Bakery, almost everything here is wonderful. ÊStandouts are the orange-spiked morning buns, chocolate & caramel-lined banana cream tarts and bread pudding fresh from the oven. ÊPut some of the shortbreads in the freezer to give them a denser feel -- they're the perfect balance of sugar, salt and butter. ÊThe only letdown has been the eclair. ÊThe thick slab of Valhrona chocolate overpowers the suble vanilla in the pastry cream.

Please go and taste a "croque monsieur - fromage blanc + dried tomotoes" Êalong with a chocolate cake slice. The best is to share with someone else and enjoy how wonderful life can be. Also, a priori, don't go to rush hour, seems very crowded. I was on a friday 6pm and it was just perfect. Cheers.

Visited this past Sunday on a gorgeous SF afternoon. The line was long but I needed the time to browse the menu and drool over the the confections at the counter. Plus, I had time to scan other people's food too (very important) There's no way I could have made a decision in just a minute. So what did I choose after taking my time to study the menu? A chocolate croissant, of course. The best thing about it was that the chocolate wasn't super sweet like commercial brands. It still maintained a soft chocolate bitterness in addition to its sweet undertone. Next time I'm there I'll stray from my chocolate addiction...or at least I'll try. I really liked Tartine but need to visit again for a larger sample size to merit a final star

I love that Tartine is so popular and the line looks long, but you can get in and out in 20 mins on weekend day and much less on a weekday. I even got a table with my friends on Sunday at 1pm.

I'm not sure what else to add. ÊEveryone seems to have made all the essential points about Tartine. ÊAmazing bakery. ÊIn my mind, it's one of the best in the country. ÊIt makes the pastries at the Cheeseboard seem like yesterday's stale bread. ÊAnd the portions leave one satisfied in a way that one is never satisfied upon leaving Patisserie Poupon in DC. Ê On the downside, it is insanely busy. ÊThe service is perfunctory (probably because they're constantly swamped). ÊThe seating is terrible. ÊThe layout is thoughtless. Ê But, overall, I can say that I'm glad that I don't live in the Mission. If I did, I'd be at Tartine every day and I'd gain 50 pounds . . .

Went here over the weekend with my old partner in crime (see below). The line was long, but at least it kept moving. Don't expect indoor seating, as they appeared to have every table and counter occupied throughout the entire morning. parking could have been much worse, though I got a spot right in front of the bakery... The coffee was great, and the chocolate hazelnut tart that I brought home was superb. the only major discomfort to me was the way that the line wraps directly next to most of the seating (going in or out).

Without question the best bakery in town. Bread pudding, lemon meringue cake, gougeres, morning buns- all to die for. Come around the holiday months for some of the soft gingerbread, it is the best thing they make but they bake it rarely.

Not that this place need another stellar review, but i had to come on here to sing its praises! I got wind of this place from a friend who found it on yelp and we decided to go try it out. Its located in a beautiful part of the city. It was kind of hard to find as it doesn't have a the name anywhere but on the menu, but we found our way there via the huge crowds and the line coming out the door! We went there on a a tuesday morning and even then it was packed! we had to hover for a couple of seats! We ended up trying the ham and cheese croissant, the regular croissant and the fresh starberry tart. They were all AMAZING. Seriously the best that i've ever had. This place deserves all of its accolades and then some, great stuff here and everything looks amazing. This is one of those places where you have to go back 5-6 times just to try everything cause it all looks so great. Definitely worth checking out if you're in or around the area!

This is quite possibly the best bakery I have ever been to for single-sized and double-sized desserts. (I can't speak for the larger desserts like their cakes because I've never ordered them.) Bread pudding: always outstanding - great consistency, and served with the right fruit topping for the day. Frangipane croissant: also always outstanding. Good for you? Probably not. Tasty? Absolutely. Ê(There's so much salt, butter, and sugar that a friend of mine who left one in his car for a week still found it edible and surprisingly tasty one week later.)

Now this is what I call a bakery!! Something you would find in Italy or France. Tartine is not only a must try but another reason to love SF food culture. I stopped by Tartine before they were open on a Saturday morning (they open at 8am on Saturdays, late for a bakery) anyhow, their doors were left open and emanating the smell of good old fashioned pastry baking. Sign of a good bakery! Right then I knew, it was worth coming back to try what they had to offer. So, in going back and now having been open for 45 minutes and already a line out the door (another clue that it's probably worth the wait otherwise people wouldn't wait), I couldn't take my eyes off the Passion Fruit Lime Bavarian. While in line I could see the bakers in the back room prepping things for the oven and taking things out of the oven. Tried the freshly squeezed grapefruit juice which would have been better had it not had so much pulp and if it was colder. What I did have, that was magnificent, was the almond croissant and the gougere bread. The gougere bread was a soft round bread, similar to a popover but better, tasting like toasted cheese. Soft and buttery, melts in your mouth good! Next time I'm in SF, Tartine will definitely be on my list of stops.

I had 2 goals: 1. I wanted to see if all the Yelp hype was legit. 2. A local friend recommended it as one of the most famous bakeries in san francisco. Tartine lives up to the hype. I got the morning bun, the chocolate croissant, and the frangipane tart. The chocolate croissant was fresh out of the oven, and it showed in the flaky delicate layers. The sweetness of the chocolate filling balanced the nutty buttery-ness of the outer pastry. The morning bun and frangipane tart were less fresh i.e. a bit cold, which definitely detracted from the experience. The morning bun reminded me of a delicate cinnamon bun topped with hints of orange. It was a bit too crunchy, but that could have been attributed to its time in the display glass. It's hard to describe the ingredients in the tart. The cream filling was sweet but not overly so. Shaved almonds on top created a good crunchy contrast to the smooth mouthfeel of the filling. Basically, everything was delicious and subtly sweet, yet contained contrasting textures and tastes that demonstrated the craft that went into the baking . I detest overly-sweetened bakery goods, so Tartine really hit the spot for me. To its credit, if everything were fresh out of the oven, Tartine would have gotten a 5-star rating. But the time that the bakery items spent in the glass display case diminished their maximal possible impact. Bottom line: Go, and ask for the bakery items that just came out of the oven. You won't regret it.

The wild blueberry Frangipane tart is world-shattering. Literally. Order one of these babies, take it to the top of Dolores Park, and watch the world melt around you. I've also and enjoyed the classical roche, chocolate roche, cappuchino in a giant soup bowl, and open faced ham and gruyere sandwhich. Their country bread is definitely worth the $7 for the HUGE loaf. Buy one, cut it into sandwhich slices, and make your packed-at-home lunches exponentially better than they are today. (BTW: The bread always sells out on the weekends, so I call ahead to reserve a load for evening pick up. The situation is usually a bit more flexible during the weekdays.) I've never tried their croissants, because at $4.50 each, it's almost laughable to do-so. Maybe Tartine should consider adjusting their croissant pricing? Overall 5 stars, even with a wait out-the-door.

One of my favorite places in the entire city. This bakery, to me, epitomizes San Francisco - understated, casual ambiance without sacrificing quality of local ingredients prepared with an expert level of sophistication. Seriously, everything here is to die for. The croissants are amazing and worth the 20 minute wait. Also, I know people in the Mission love their coffee - and Tartine's baristas really do it justice!! Of course the bread pudding is incredible. But really, the experience - waiting in line to catch a glimpse of the abundance of colors and craftsmanship in the window; listening in on the customers next you dabble between their choices with the excitement of a kid on Christmas morning - is worth it. Sure the line out the door (especially on weekends) can be annoying, but there is something very special about this place. Somehow, Tartine helps you realize that the simple act of waiting in line can help you appreciate the simple things in life - the way flour and eggs and sugar can be whipped into a plethora of abundance of colors and tastes and smells to be shared and savored with loved ones. My suggestion - get it to go, and have a picnic in Delores Park just down the block. If you are really fancy, you can pick up a loaf of bread, some gourmet cheese and wine at Bi-Rite on the way and really do your picnic justice.

I probably don't need to add another review to the 2000+ already posted, but man this place is double effin' good! My gf and I went almost every day we were in town and got the double pain au chocolat, morning bun, and jambon croissant. The pain au chocolat was fresh out of the oven and just oozed with chocolate and butter and flaky perfection, and the morning bun was crispy and gooey and had a nice orange/cinnamon caramelly center. The Jambon (Niman Ranch ham and gruyere cheese) almost made me fall over, it was so BEYOND what it looked like. A flavor explosion sending happy ecstasy waves throughout my brain and body! ÊWe would stand on the street corner and eat the whole thing and immediately debate whether we should get another one.

ÊNot sure I would recommend the banana tart, didn't care for the chocolate coating on the crust, although I understand it's needed to keep the crust from going soggy.

This is the best bread in the bay area as of the date of my writing these words. Anyone who says otherwise is a liar or is simply ignorant of Tartine's bread. Alas, the bread comes out of the oven at 5 pm and they usually close two and a half to three hours following, and last time I checked, no bread is available on Mondays or Tuesdays, and often sell out before 6 on any given day. But for the dedicated and true bread lover, these uncouth obstacles will stand as nothing to obtain these loaves of moist love. Of course you could just call in the morning and secure your bread without necessitating the braving of the Mission rush and the complete absence of viable and legal parking. Either way, eat some all ye farinaphiles, you owe it to yourself for existing in such proximity.

In the seven days I spent Êin San Francisco last week, I visited Tartine three times. ÊThe pressed sandwiches are massive and the great, thick bakery bread is liberally spread with olive oil; it is as a good panino should be. ÊThe lemon tart is beautifully and simply presented, and tastes as delectable as it looks. ÊAnd the double pain au chocolat is crunchy, flaky on the outside and buttery delicious on the inside with just the right amount of rich Valrhona chocolate in the center. ÊIt is usually hard to find a table, or even a spare chair in this popular bakery, so take it to go and enjoy the great view of the city from the bench at the top (southwest corner) of Dolores Park.

I have been to Tartine a couple of times now and truly think it is one the the best bakeries in SF. ÊThey carry one of the best bread puddings I've ever tasted and I also recommend the Bavarian and tres leches cake. ÊI like the simplicity of the atmosphere. ÊIn fact, the only reason I found the bakery the first time was the long line outside. ÊIt's also right next to Dolores Park, Êwhich is a great area to walk around and explore. ÊThe only reason why I don't give this place 5 stars is: first the line is always tremendous, especially in the mornings, and second I am a student and paying 5.50 for a slice of cake can be slightly ridiculous. But you pay for quality so I guess I can't complain.

Okay, I must admit that the pastries here are out of this world. ÊLately however, the coffee is absolutely terrible, sort of like colored hot water. ÊMaybe they changed their brand, maybe the cost of coffee went up. ÊSuggest bringing your own coffee, buy one of their cups and fill it with your own. ÊCan't pass up these pastries just because of the coffee. ÊHowever because a good cup of coffee must accompany these rich pastries, I am only giving it two stars.

Somewhat disappointing. went here for lunch after being promised good sandwiches, only to find that all they offer, basically, is grilled cheese. sure, there's a variety of gourmet-sounding cheese varieties and breads, but it's still a grilled cheese sandwich, and a greasy one at that, for almost $10. The line and service are also very slow - don't come at lunch if you're in a hurry. the bittersweet chocolate cookies were delicious though, so that made up for the sandwich somewhat.

I really feel like they are pulling one over on every one that goes here. The pastries aren't that great, the servers are rude and I've had several bad experiences here, such as: 1.) No croissants available in the morning. Gee, I thought they were a bakery. 2.) Getting sick off of their vegetarian Croque Monsieur. 3.) The way the counter/cashier bar is set-up, you are asked for your order before you get a chance to see all of the items. 4.) By far the worst and final straw for me was being asked to leave because they weren't open, yet. The front door was open, a customer in front of me was being served, and the cashier asked me to leave because they didn't open for another 10 minutes. I just don't go there anymore, even though I do like their Morning Buns. The La Boulange bakeries are better. Their restaurant, Bar Tartine on Valencia, is much better and I do recommend that.

I think that this is hands down one of the best places in the city. ÊThe ham and gruyere croissant and the coconut cream pie are my favorites. ÊAnytime I have friends or family in from out of town, I bring them here to have the experience. ÊWe suffer in line (well worth it), get our food to go, and then bring it up to the top of the hill at Dolores Park. ÊBy doing this not only do I avoid being cramped into a small space, but I also have a great view of the city while I enjoy my food. ÊMy eyes seriously roll in the back of my head while I am eating the food. ÊIt's amazing!

Sometimes I think about quitting my job to work the counter at Tartine's so I can be near the morning buns and almond croissants all of the time Tartine's is busy every day--all day.

Tartine bakery is worth waiting in line for on a Sunday if you have your heart set on good coffee and decadent pastries that rival those in the best patisseries in France. Ê(Go ahead French Yelpers, bring on the Êdeluge of protests.) ÊThe aroma of the place will keep you hypnotized as you stand in line. Ê(Actually, the line moves pretty quickly. ) Tartine offers a few savory items, such as the best, most delicate, tastiest quiche in the universe. ÊThe croque was a little over the top: Êtoo big, too thick, too hard. ÊIn fact, everything is grotesquely super-sized, to satisfy that American sense of plenty. ÊThe indulgence is compounded by the temptation to order two items, one savory and one sweet, because it's ever so hard to decide what to order. ÊIt's all just so dreamy.

Five stars for the food. Tried the ham/cheese croissant which was supremely buttery and flaky like a proper French croissant , the olive bread which was rich with blended cheese and olives, and one of their mini pies. The pie's crust was praiseworthy. The coconut cream filling was a little less divine but maybe that was because I was comparing it to the Dahlia Lounge in Seattle which makes the world's best coconut cream pie. ÊPrices at this bakery are quite high.

i came here with two friends on a Friday afternoon, so luckily there wasn't too much of a line. after trying the food, i can now say i'm glad there wasn't a long wait, b/c i'd be seriously pissed to have waited an hour for the food here. i sampled several items (i don't come to the city very often, and wanted to take advantage of the short line) to to test the range of the stuff offered here. - banana cream tart: pretty good a little overpriced (you can get similar for less at other cafes), but fairly large and tasty enough. the pastry encasing the bananas and cream was weirdly hard though, had to break out a knife and fork to cut through it---and i had to work at it too, it wasn't a simple slice job. - bread pudding: ok kind of disappointed to see them scoop it out of a giant basin, just didn't seem as appetizing as getting something fresh made to order. but i can understand that the high turnover demand of this place makes doing that impossible, especially given the popularity of this dish. honestly though i didn't care for it (why do people rave about it?); it was pretty soggy, looked like a hot mess, and the texture was like muffin soaked in water---so dense with moisture it starts to disintegrate into mush. flavorwise, it was decent, but nothing special. - morning bun: not good overly crispy, i want to describe it as being too well-done? i thought it'd be softer getting further in, but no, it was barely chewy. mostly just hard and crunchy. flavor was ok, again, nothing special. didn't taste much of the orange and cinnamon, mostly just sugary sweet. - chocolate croissant: not good like the morning bun, too well-done. really crispy, almost crunchy. not very chewy. i like croissants that are rich and buttery (which this was) but also soft and chewy, where it pulls apart easily in your hands and the flaky outer layers are delicate enough to melt in your mouth. i also didn't like the chocolate they used, the sign just said was some type of imported chocolate; i should've checked that it wasn't dark chocolate. - croque monsieur: decent just a solidly filling dish. a single, large piece of bread, with ham, gruyere and sundried tomatoes (the overall taste was very similar to pizza). disappointing that this also wasn't made fresh to order, but re-warmed in the oven, though palatable enough. the pickled carrot it came with was a little weird though---very sour, almost citrusy. - spicy turkey sandwich: not bad my friend ordered this, and it took a pretty long time (they did warn her that it would take around 15 min to make); we'd almost finished our croque monsieurs by the time her dish finally came out. it was HUGE though, looked like one sandwich plus an extra half. taste was solid, no remote spiciness at all though, and really oily. overall, not impressed. this place is nice enough, but i could never stand the wait that's typical of this place----it just isn't worth it. you could get pastries at many other places (after all SF is abundant with great cafes) that are just as good, for similar or less prices, and much less of a wait. ultimately, it's good if you happen to be in the neighborhood, there isn't a line, and you fancy a quick sweet (id go with the banana cream tart if anything. their other tarts looked promising though). otherwise, can't say it's worth the time you'd spend looking for parking (if you don't muni) and waiting in line (if you can't come in on an off-hour weekday).

Come early on weekends before they run out of delicious pastries + desserts. There's minimal seating and typically a 10-15 min wait, but it's well worth it. Must try: - Chocolate Eclair: combination of rich chocolate and vanilla cream make it the best eclair i've had - Banana or Lemon Cream Tart: huge pastry dessert has a flaky crust and a chocolate lining - Vanilla lattes also hit the spot OK: - Morning bun: on the 7x7 top-100 list, but I wasn't impressed.. has an orange-flavoring but bland for the most part

Long lines don't stop me from making it my favorite place to hang out. The key is to come during the week, or grab a table BEFORE you wait in line. The best croissants, pastries, espresso (not coffee) cakes, bread to die for!! I've gotten to know the kids (ages me, right?) who work here. They work hard and too often don't get tips. LEAVE TIPS FOR THEM. Right, there's no table service, but who do you think has to deal with lines around the corner, cleaning the tables, sweeping the floors. TOURISTS, you should know that in San Francisco, there are many places you serve yourself, but tipping is normal for any kind of service.

Love, love, love their bread and croissants. The bread is amazing, just have to order it before 3 and hopefully remember to pick it up before they close (though once we forgot and picked it up 15 minutes late, super friendly about that). We've tried all their breads and they are huge and delicious, worth the $7 price tag. Croissants are the flakiest and tastiest we've had yet, a little pricey compared to other places, but worth it still (considering they use organic ingredients and ultra delicious). One downfall, lack of vegetarian lunch options, I mean there are a few and they are awesome, but being a vegetarian more options would really rock. Also since so popular hard to go on the weekends.

A friend of mine recommended me this bakery saying that they have the best quiche and their line i always long and a lot of their pastries is gone by afternoon. So i went there with another friend of mine on a Monday at around noon. The place is pretty decent and there are people on most of the table there. But the line is not that long, there were just 2-3 people in front of us. We tried their quiche, scone and some other pastries which i don't remember the name. They are not as good as my friend has described.it's just okayyy, comparable to many other bakeries that i've tried.

This is my first review on yelp. Never felt the need to up until now. I'll get the good out of the way first. The morning bun is one of the most amazing pastries I've ever had......perfect! ÊThe scone is the most delicious scone I've tried. Besides those two delectable items, there is no other reason to go. Everything else I've tried has been below par. If this is supposed to be a French bakery, I suggest the owner visit France again. In France the croissants are not served burnt. The same for the cookies. I do not understand the hype. It's as if the customers have been brainwashed. The absolute worst part of the experience is the service. Some of the staff have this attitude as if it is an honor to be there.

Wow! They aren't joking when they say it's crowded.We stopped in today around 11-ish thinking we'd be there right after the breakfast, but before the lunch crowd. I mean reallly...Isn't everyone at work by then. Boy were we wrong. The line was still out the door, but the line moved pretty fast. Just fast enough to keep you interested but slow enough for you to figure out what you want to get. And trust me, you will need the extra thinking time. It was my first trip there but I had several friends who frequent the place so I was pretty sure what I was going to get before I stepped in the door. Of course that all went out the window when I saw all the other buttery, sweet and flaky options. We finally decided on the coconut cream pie and the ham croque monsieur. The opened faced sandwich was one of the best things I've tasted in a long time. I'm not even sure how to describe all of it's savory glory. The bread was thick and held up great considering it was smothered in a creamy bchamel sauce, and then was topped with sliced ham and tomatoes. there might have been other things on it but it was hard to make out as it was flying into my mouth. After the sandwich we jumped right into the Coconut Cream pie. It was Êeven more mouth pleasing than the sandwich (if that's even possible). The crust was flaky and the bottom was lined with a generous layer of chocolate and caramel. The coconut cream filling was smooth, rich and velvety (none of those shredded coconut flakes mixed in) and tasted exactly like fresh coconut cream. Considering we were eating in the car and forgot to bring utensils it was quite a feat getting that gooey, fluffy, flaky little morsel down without making a mess, but I didn't want to lose one once of that yummy goodness. Don't worry ...it all made it in safely and no crumbs were wasted.

It's hard not to love a bakery that has such delicious things. ÊTheir bread is amazing, as is their bread pudding, croissants, and everything else in the case. ÊTheir cookbook hasn't failed me yet.

with over 400 reviews, i'm sure tartine doesn't need another, but i'd figure i'd post one for my socal peeps. i visited tartine on a friday afternoon, and didn't have to deal with the madness i assume most people encounter on the weekends. got the croque monsieur with smoked niman ranch ham. i feared that this open faced sandwich may be too cheesy-greasy, but it was delicious. the bechamel added a great dimension of flavor and creaminess to the gruyere cheese. the ham was smokey and tender. Êthe country bread is spiked with all those great flavors. the lemon cream tart i got for dessert was spot on with the sweet-tart balance. creamy, runny citrus ooze in a buttery shell, topped with kumquat marmalade. yum. great, great place, if you don't have to deal with the hordes of others that find tartine a jewel of a place as well.

i admit, this is a place i found through yelp because it would always pop up on the sides, or the city's top picks ... i give this a 3 (WAIT! let me FINISH!) because i haven't really FULLY experienced tartine like the rest of the yelpers, or maybe it is just a 3 and i'm just schizo with my taste buds ... but yea, i'm willing to come back to pick up a sammie, and their cake, but for a quick grab -- 3 it is ... as a planner, i have a habit of buying a few munchies either the day prior or the day OF depending on how much time i have, so i have something to nibble on the plane or car ride... i heart pastries ... and tartine was definitely one of those places i promised myself that i should try before anything.... if you peek at the photos the others have uploaded, it pretty much explains itself... the LINE IS long, even at 8am... i couldn't believe it, but don't let that fool you. the line is long because it's one of those lines you pick and choose and leave. there are minimal tables ... line doesn't move quite fast though, even though, they have 3 friendly people who are assisting you and another 2 who is ringing you up. i'm going to blame it on the patrons. damn you! the best tip i can give you is to grab a menu when you get there or possibly ask someone you came with or not, to hold the line while you scope out the goodies, that way you can have a mental note of what is what.. or one of you grab a table or something. come on, be efficient! =D of course, this place has reserved a soft spot as a tourist trap so 9/10 folks are NOT locals... if i hadn't taken an early flight for the morning, i would've gotten their infamous hot pressed sammies, but they only have those at 12pm. Êif they were smart like Paul Maison in FL (http://www.yelp.com/biz/É) i think i'd have grabbed a sammie for me to go, but then again, i guess i can't really compare it because it was late afternoon when i was inside the bakery at miami, while here, i came pretty early ... but just simply stating the concept, having a sammie ready to go ....booo... i only got something small, just enough to fill my tummi for an hour or two, so it wasn't no feast. c'mon, im going to LA, i have to save my fat ass appetite! presentation? very fresh, and precise and extremely simple. i hear they use organic flour, so that's a plus. prices vary from $2.50 and up ... i guess that's average ... but anywys, i bought 2 morning buns that had cinnimon and raisin which were simply hollow on the inside, with no taste, but good. their vanilla eclair was good, but my eclair at t. keller's bakery was to die for ... i'd have gotten myself a tart or a slice of cake, but i'm only on the plane for an hour! i like how most of their items can be bought individually or as a whole, but then again, it IS a bakery... tartine is a place that seems a BIT overly hyped with the line and all, but it is a place, i wouldn't mind coming back for a 2nd chance. oh, and i hear they even have a sister restaurant called bar tartine for the night owls, so perhaps...

The other day, a Saturday, the line outside(!) Tartine was 28 deep... and growing. Nothing is that good. For all of us who live nearby Tartine is strictly weekday, early afternoon kind of fare because at "peak times" the line might actually be further back than your doorway. And then what? Then it dawns on you that you're waiting in line for the alchemy of butter, flour, and sugar behind the most obnoxious morning crowd south of Bugaloos, and below Noe. ÊTartine is good, but people, People! While you're waiting for your morning buns or whatever, when ordinary people (who may be hungover) try to walk past, and you're crowding the sidewalk three and four abreast like suburban moms in the mall, can Êwe dispense with the dirty looks? I'm just trying to get by. And one last thing. The women who work there are angels. Fucking angels I tell you. If only for putting up with a clientele that puts on its smug sense of entitlement right after the fleece and crocs.

Mmm, Tartine... It's so small for such a well-known and popular place, hence the line going out the door. According to my friend, that wasn't even that long of a line. We were there at about 10:30, so probably between the regular breakfast and lunch crowds. The wait was OK with me, as it gave me time to drool over the pastry case and peruse the menu. We ordered the wild mushroom Croque Monsieur (accompanied by two intriquingly spicy pickled carrots), ham and tomato quiche, and the brioche bread pudding with berries, along with a couple of coffees. You pay at the counter and take your number to a table and they bring out the food to you. We ended up sitting at a communal table, but that was cool; it felt like I was at a friend's place or something. Everything was extremely delicious--can't find fault with any of the items we got. I don't know how they make their quiche, but the egg part was so silky and smooth! It was an awesome breakfast. I just wish it wasn't so cramped in there, but that's the price you pay. They also ask that you bus your own tables, but that's not a big deal. I also dug the artwork on display--no safe little pretty pictures just because it's a cafe. There were these cool giant paper cutouts of rather ghoulish-looking humanoids hanging from the ceiling (see my photo) as well as various works on paper all over the place. I forgot the name of the artist, but I really liked his work. One of the many great places I got to visit during my time in SF.

Upon walking in, my gaze quickly shifted from the varied assortment of pastries and desserts to the croque monsieur- huge slabs of rustic bread topped with ham, and eggs- amazing looking! I should have followed my first instinct and ordered one, but instead felt like I should order a dessert. This was, after all, a bakery. I settled upon a cup of coffee and a big slice of the tres leches cake. I was hoping for something more similar to the tres leches cake I used to love during my youth in Chile, but what I ended up with in Tartine Bakery was a fancy version of what I was expecting. ÊDon't get me wrong, it was really good but I think some things are better left alone, in their original form. However, my boyfriend ordered the frangipan, a beautiful pastry with almonds. We both agreed the price was a bit high, but he said the frangipan was delicious and unlike anything he had ever had in his life. The coffee was good too. I think I need to go back and order something else at Tartine. Maybe next time I will try the croque monsieur that originally caught my eye or one of their chocolate cakes, which I imagine must be amazing.

spontaneous drive from milpitas to san francisco right after work just to try this place. i got to say its worth the drive. Êtook us awhile to find parking, we parked like 3 blocks away. when we got there they didnt have much of the pastry or tarts left. i wanted to try the lemon cream tart but they ran out of slices. i got a ham hot pressed sandwich which was very very yummy. the little bit of dijon mustard gave it a flavor contrast. i also tried the quiche which was really good when i heated it back up and the prosciutto hot pressed sandwich and a piece of short bread and a scone. everything was really yummy. the sandwiches were hot and fresh. we left very satisfied and for all that we spent only 23 dollars. good enough for me!

I have to say the only dealing I've had is ordering a cake from this establishment that was to be delivered to their restaurant down the street and around the corner for a birthday. Ê Apparently the restaurant 'suggests' you get a specialty dessert from the bakery for a special celebration, yet they don't deliver. Ê(Go figure!) ÊMy real complaint is with the so-called "manager" who has no social or managerial skills or idea of what following-up with a customer means. ÊIt took 20 phone calls, several voice mails, and 1 week to get a live person on the phone to order 1 birthday cake. ÊEven then, the "manager" couldn't get her facts straight before berating a paying customer to confirm an order. Ê I just hope the food at the restaurant is worth the hassle at the bakery. Ê I would definitely DO NOT DEAL WITH THE IGNORANT MANAGER AGAIN, Deal with Thalia. ÊShe gets what customer service really means.

Wow, I can't believe so many people have reviewed this place. I'll sum it up simply then. I can see why so many people like the food, but it's generally overpriced with a rude staff, long line, and no place to eat. While good, I certainly don't think a cheese and bread sandwich is worth $11. If you're allergic to yuppies, avoid it like the plague. Just because the staff have noserings doesn't mean its not pretentious.

Despite the complaints about the crowd, they really do have the best croissants in the city, especially the chocolate ones (flaky and oozy). The bread is delicious as well. I also love the open face sandwiches that are served with hot pickled carrots. The desserts are good but baked a bit dark for my taste. I prefer a rich golden color to my pastries rather than a dark chestnut color, but I like the rustic style and the classic flavor components and the use of fresh seasonal fruit. I have been treated nicely every time I go but sometimes the wait is outrageous. If you go, make sure to meet a friend and be ready for a leisure time. This is not the place for the morning rush hour crowd. Go on a nice day when you have nothing else to do but sit and eat rather than an average day of burning your mouth on coffee as you run out the door for work, otherwise you'll just get Êfrustrated and you won't apprieciate the beauty of a well made pastry.

So basically my mother won't let me come home unless I bring her something from Tartine. Last time I went home I got yelled at because I didn't think to bring an extra loaf of bread for my grandma. The lemon merengue cake smoothed things over pretty nicely though. Some people have complained that the staff is rude and that there is always a long line. I have never found the staff to be rude - it just seems to me that they want to move the line along as quickly as possible, which I have absolutely no problem with. And duh, the place is popular. There is going to be a long line. And guess what. It's going to be even more popular now that the idiots from the New York Times had to write an article in this week's travel section. Stay out of my bakery, tourists. I was pretty scared that the place was going straight to hell once my mother found their cookbook, but despite the publicity, Êthey have not gotten lazy and maintained (as far as I can tell) their position as the best bakery in SF.

The last time i was in san fran, i dint find out about Tartine until the last day i was there. ÊSo this time i had planned to visit Tartine at least twice on my four day trip. ÊI had previously only tried their baked goods so i was curious how their sandwiches would be. ÊThey have a selection of about 6 to 8 types. ÊTheir bread doesnt come out until about 4 because it is full with morning pastries during the day. ÊThe loaves sell out quick, we bought one for $7. ÊThe sandwiches utilizes their amazing fresh baked bread. ÊFor 11.25 we had the mozzarella and tapendade sandwich. ÊThe cheese was so gooey and stretchy and paired with the saltiness of the nicoise olives and the anchovies, it was scrumptious. ÊWe also had the chocolate croissant, which was huge and flaky, definitely serves 2. ÊThey bake really pretty cakes and you can buy them whole or by the slice. ÊFor 5 dollars we had a slice of the lemon cake with meringue, so good. ÊI think anyone can tell that a place that has over 2000 Yelps must be Legit, and Tartine is no exception.

This place is a little bit of heaven. Its close proximity to the Bi-Rite Creamery also spells danger; stop here for dessert after Aslam's Rasoi, roll yourself down to the Bi-Rite Creamery for second dessert, and then nap in Dolores Park for the most decadent tour of the Mission anyone should ever experience. Everything here is delicious. My favorite is the lemon meringue cake, it is consistently wonderful, with creamy lemony goodness sandwiched between fluffy white cake, all encased in meringue. I think a slice of this on a sunny day in the Mission is the definition of sublime! The chocolate cakes are great, and the banana tarts are excellent as well, with just a hint of chocolate to make them particularly stand-out. The chocolate tea cake is another good choice if I'm feeling particularly Spartan. Not to be outdone by their sugared counterparts, the sandwiches here are not fooling around. They're gigantic and gooey and wonderful; my favorite is the horseradish pastrami. I split it with a friend who was unused to horseradish, and it gave her a tummy ache, so proceed with caution! I love that burn in the back of my brain and the top of my nose, though, so I couldn't have been happier with our choice. ÊSure, I wish the place had more seating, but I can't bear to knock off a star since the pastries are so damn good. I'm sure my waistline is happy I moved out of the city, but my taste buds sure aren't; I make a point to come by Tartine anytime I'm visiting the area or trying to impress out-of-towners.

I am so over Tartine. I used to go all the time, and stuff my face full of bread pudding and hot pressed sandwiches and croques and gougeres and pain au jambon and lemon merangue cake. All at the same time. No more. While, yes, everything is delicious, any trip to Tartine is now more hassle than it is enjoyable. This place has gotten too big for its britches. The trouble starts before you even walk through the door, becuase the line is so long that it goes out the door and wraps around the side of the store. The line moves slowly because the staff is too cute to work. My favorite Tartine employee is the wafily incompetent "Quaaludes Girl," who at rush hour on a Saturday had no clue what the quiche was. Customers are subject to the harsh and bizarre whims of the employees. Perhaps you'd like a pressed sandwich? Not until the pressed sandwich guy is "ready," a state with no bearing whatsoever to the time listed on the menu or the signage on the counter. And he gets mad if you ask him when he'll be "ready." Oy. Since I'm not one of those magic San Franciscans who doesn't have a job, I can only go to Tartine on the weekends. Which I now refuse to. Do yourself a favor and go next door to Bi Rite instead and get a sandwich and eat it in the park. That way you won't have to freeze at one of Tartine's outside tables on the shady side of the street, which are so busy you'll never get to sit down anyway.

i went to tartine around 730 pm on a Friday night and ordered one of my favorites, the coconut passionfruit bavarian cake. it was almost closing and there was about one and a half slices of the cake left. instead of giving me a bigger slice, the girl behind the counter cut me a tiny slice and threw the rest away! i was so APPALLED!!! she could have given me the bigger slice or saved the other slice but she threw it in the garbage RIGHT in front of me!! she couldn't even wait til she got in the back. i was pretty furious! WHAT A WASTE!

went here for a quick breakfast meeting at 8 and just after we sat down there was a line starting that was swiftly making its way out the door. this place is legit with a nice exhibition style bakery kitchen. everything is freshly made and it's a real treat to get away from the cookie cutter starbucks decor. i had an americano coffee and a morning bun. the bun was both buttery and delicately sweet even with the extra dusting of sugar on top. there was also a subtle hint of orange zest and cinnamon. they opened at 7:30 this morning (friday). according to my cousin, the bun goes from night to day when freshly warm out the oven. i'm sure they wouldn't have hesitated to warm them up if requested as they seem to have a very friendly and personable staff. as we were in a bit of a hurry, we didn't bother and the buttery sweet glaze which i imagine would have been pleasantly warm and gooey was a bit hardened. still, it was a pastry of high caliber. i'm told on the weekends the line can stretch out the door and around the corner. i can understand why. if i get hungrier, i just might go back for one of their savory hot pressed sandwiches which i'm told are just as fantastic. if you've had the morning bun and are like me thinking it was as great a balance a morning treat could be, i did happen to stumble upon what seems to be the authentic recipe. i would surely try the real thing before aimlessly mucking around. http://www.7x7.com/eat-dÉ

I heard good things about this bakery from 5 people. "Oh you gotta try Tartine it's sooooo goooooood!" ÊOne day I went there to buy a birthday cake for my sweetie. I got the choclatyiestesssesese looking cake in the glass. My ankles started hurting from waiting in the long line. The shit looked good in there. I'm sure it's good but the cake I got was so damn choclateeeeeeeeeee that it was like biting into a 6 inch thick dark chocolate block with no bread. A tiny sliver of this cake was enough to go WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! EHHHHHHHHHHHHH! Give me some water or milk or both! Fuck! Put some cake in there. I'm sure 99% of the pastries are good, but avoid the chocolate bomb cake. The one that requires heating up the knife to cut it. It's litterally like a gigantic soft chocolate bar with almost zero cake in it. I give it four stars because the cash register there is gonna explode or blow circuits.

goddddd i was really going to up this to five stars because every pastry, desert and even the guyere bread puff (gugere?) are phenomenal, but then i had had to get pushy and try the pressed sandwich for over 10$ and it was tasty IFFFFF you first squeezed out the oil and wanted to light a thousand oil lamps for 10 years with it.

This non-descript little bakery/cafe offers decent coffee and beautiful French pastries, among other things that keep patrons hanging around for hours. Seating is pretty limited. I secretly hope that people would just finish eating and move along... Today was my lucky day! I parked right out front, didn't have to wait in a long line, and I snagged the last almond croissant, the best croissant ever by the way. It had tons of almond filling. I have never seen so many almond slivers packed into one croissant before. Awesome! Someday I'll get around to trying a Panini.

they get the two stars for their morning orange bun.. but......................... their devil's food chocolate cake. I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!! hello........ bought a piece of this cake to go.. and unfortunately, it wasn't until we left that we discovered how stale it was... apparently, to save time, they like to cut slices of the cake before it's even ordered, which means.............. it can sit all day long and then by the time someone does order it, the sides of the cake are stale....... which ours was.. if we had gotten the cake for inside, I assure you, they'd have had that cake planted right back at them but sadly, we got it to go and we didn't want to come all the way back to the place...... Also, had their croissant.. ah yeah.. a bit burned on the bottom... and if the employees handing the cash register didn't talk so much to one another, I do believe the line would move a lot faster... this place has some decent items.. but beware.. you must truly pick and choose....... some things are good... others things just aren't.......

There was a day when I had a hankering for a yummy panini from Tartine for breakfast but was in Hayes Valley. Whoa! there's a Tartine (the blue awning simply says Tartine) that I spied as I biked away from Blue Bottle Coffee. However, after checking it out, alas, not the same as my beloved Tartine Bakery on 18th and Guerrero. (the blue awning-ed place is some other establishment completely unrelated to Tartine Bakery or Bar Tartine). Yes, nothing compares to my usual selection of either a sopressata/broccoli rabe pesto/asiago panini garnished with spicy pickled baby carrots (those I save for last, they are DEEElirshus) OR a ham and cheese croque monsieur. For sweets, a myriad of options await but I tend to gravitate towards either the bread pudding (a bowl if I am feeling ravenous), the lemon tart, lemon bar, sticky buns or chocolate puddin. Wash that all down with a lovely double latte or glass of red. And if you're lucky enough to be there Sunday to Wednesday shortly after 5, then go get yourself a loaf or two of heavenly Tartine bread (the walnut or country loaves are fabulous, but then again, so is the olive loaf). ÊC'est magnifique!

ÊMy favorite item at Tartine is their Banana Cream Tart, which is out of this universe! ÊThe tart is layered with chocolate, caramel, rich vanilla custard, sliced bananas and whipped cream...and the tart crust is flaky. ÊOh my gosh... I miss San Francisco for this sole reason. ÊI also highly recommend the eclaires, morning rolls (orange zest, sugar, cinnamon), the warm bread pudding. ÊTartine's pressed sandwiches are to die for. ÊThe bread is crispy, buttery and rustic and whatever sandwich you choose I guarantee that you'll come out smiling. ÊI've literally tried every single one, and never came away disappointed.

So I'm spending the weekend with the hubster in SF to celebrate our 4 year wedding anniversary. ÊWe were in Tommaso's (based on yelp reviews) waiting for a table and this very nice gentleman overhead us discussing what we were planning to do the next day. ÊHe told us of a few places around North Beach to check out and about Tartine. ÊBased on his suggestion, we planned our outing to the Castro/Mission district to include Tartine. ÊWe got a little lost after getting off the F train, but we made it. ÊBased on the yelp reviews, we knew we had to try the bread pudding. ÊWe had the best bread pudding we ever had on our honeymoon in Hawaii. ÊWe've been trying ever since to find bread pudding as good or better and Tartine's definitely came close. ÊI guess blackberries are currently in season, so that was the fruit topping of the bread pudding. ÊFirst bite was just heavenly. ÊIt was sweet, but not overly sweet. ÊIt was moist and it had a custard like consistency. ÊSo good!!! ÊThe hubster and I just kept eating and eating until it was all gone and realized that we should have gotten a bowl of the bread pudding instead of a cup. ÊI will definitely go back to Tartine on my next trip to SF. ÊLovely, sweet and beautiful bread pudding, I am missing you so much right now but know that I will one day have you again hopefully sooner than later. ÊLove your bread pudding Tartine!

The pastries here are great. ÊThe frangipane croissants are my favorite, even though they're ALWAYS a little overdone (dark brown on the bottom and too crispy).

ÊBut even with the line out the door, you wouldn't think it would move so slowly when almost everything is already made and just needs to be put in a bag or on a plate. ÊThis line doesn't include coffee (separate line) or waiting for anything that needs to be heated. ÊThe one time a friend ordered a toasted sandwich (croque monsieur), I left, got coffee down the street, went home, checked my watch several times, decided he had been hit by a car, and walked back, all before he got his sandwich.

the question with tartine is whether their excellent baked goods outweigh the near-obnoxious attitude the proprietors and management hold regarding their customers. a review of the baked goods themselves is relatively straightforward - they know their stuff. maybe not the most inventive assortment, but very well executed. 7$ bread is absurd, but it sure is tasty. the problem is the attitude borne to the clientle. i was willing to tolerate the lack of friendliness until a recent episode where tartine overcharged me (and every other customer over the space of a couple days), and then dragged their heals in correcting the charges. apparently they accidentally double-charged every customer who paid by card in mid august, but quadruple charged me. i was annoyed they didn't contact me when they clearly knew of the problem, and even more annoyed that after my repeated requests to reverse all false charges they insisted i must have made a second purchase of the same amount. after 3 weeks they finally reversed all extra cost, but with no admission of fault, no gesture of apology and the expectant impatience their servers show when asked for a croissant aux amandes. tartine would do well to study the coded formality and respect accorded in a true french bakery as intently as they've studied the process of baking the goods.

The set up is so intentionally rude and user-unfriendly I've got to give up the best pastry in SF. ÊTwo registers, one perpetually unused despite a line out the door and many take aways piling up behind the counter. Lots of busybusy, lots of attractive women taking orders, which just pile up.

Always go for my Birthday breakfast and it is always wonderful. Morning buns and bread pudding fabulous. Croque Monsieur is so yummy with their great coffee. I could just stare at the glass cases like I have done in Austria...not many great pastry places in SF. This one rocks! Thank you. Go off hours and you will really enjoy.

of course this place is great. i had a guest from out of town dragging me out of bed at on the weekend two days in a row, just to get some o the tartine lovin. and i'm here all "yeah it's good and it's in my hood". i think i need to move to the burbs in the midwest, just to come back less jaded....being the perpetual architecture and interior deisgn ho that i am, one thing i would like to commend as well is the bathroom on the premises. fabulous. great colors, fixtures, finishes, clean. so if you've had one too many a scrumptiously fresh squeezed grapefruit juice...doncha worry. they've gotcha covered

Yes, their food is delicious and decadent. But 1 star because the managers clearly don't care about their customers. The line is insanely long and they are ridiculously inefficient at coming up with a fast way to service their clients. There are many many other shops and bakeries where they have figured out a way to serve the clients FAST - and it seems that Tartine owners haven't even tried. I've stopped going there just because I don't want to wait 20 minutes for pastries.

Yelp let me down again. ÊActually I have a few friends that raved about this. ÊA lot. ÊAnd 2000+ reviews were just tempting. ÊBut I was so disappointed. ÊI really wanted a croissant and they were already sold out when I went there at lunch time. ÊSo we order a banana cream tart and a bread pudding. ÊSo many people were eating it, so I thought it must be good. Wrong wrong wrong. ÊIt was really REALLY SOGGY and such a disgusting mess =/ ÊI only took a few bites and left the remaining there. ÊBanana cream tart was OK... just cream inside a dark chocolate coated crust. ÊNothing special. ÊOnly the first few bites were good, and I didn't want to continue eating after that. ÊWe had latte and it was... well...just latte. ÊTypical. ÊI don't know if we'll come back here. ÊI don't understand the raves and the line that wraps around the block. ÊAnother overrated place on yelp, just like Burma Super Star.

If Yelp criticism lands on a business with 2000 reviews and 4.5 stars, will anyone actually read it and care? Ê Probably not but I'll post anyway because a couple of things need to be said. ÊFirst: Êmore butter does not equal better. Ê ÊYes, butter is amazing. ÊYes, butter makes the (baked) world go round. Ê ÊBut Tartine proves that there is such a thing as too much. Ê If I squeezed my morning bun hard enough, I could have fried eggs for a week. Ê ÊSecond: Êbeing a beloved business does not give you the right to treat customers with contempt. Ê Came in on a rare slow late afternoon to pick up a slice of tres leches cake. ÊThe man behind the counter was engrossed in conversation with a friend and did not feel the need to help. Ê Several minutes pass. Ê Cake is requested. Ê Counter man checks the case to find 2 beautiful tres leches cakes. Ê Then brusquely replies that it is too late in the day to cut the cake so no slice. Ê I ask for clarification - what is the cut off to cut the cake? Ê No response as counter man moves on to the next customer. Ê ÊThird: Êthe chocolate chip cookies suck. Ê I mean, really not good.

the currant scone is great. it's not very sweet and has a nice slightly dry texture that would go well with tea/coffee. i tried a piece of a croissant that they reheated in the oven and it was light and crusty-good. the grilled sandwiches that were coming out of the kitchen also looked really good. perhaps i need to give the bread pudding another shot, but i thought it was ok. sit down space is hard to come by as the place is kinda small. also, waiting in line--though not for too long--is standard.

You may walk by this unmarked cafe and wonder to yourself "Why are there so many people in line?" The answer to this question can be a multitude of things but to me, it would have to be THE MORNING BUN. This delectable treat has the consistency of a soft pillow, the fragrance of orange and the flavor of spiced citrus with sugar and a hint of cinnamon. It is delightful, to say the least! The banana creme Êtart is also a great hit! I'll be the first to say that they don't skip out on the bananas. The chocolate croissant is flaky, bittersweet and something you would LOVE to sink your teeth into. I've had one in France and this one definitely compares! Tartine's Croque Monsieur is the biggest beast I've ever seen and it was a very delicious and flavorful dish. I cannot wait to come back here. It was so worth waking up at 8am and making the drive from the South Bay. I'll be back for you, Tartine. Soon enough!

Best croissants ever! I've tried their ham and cheese croissant and lemon cream tart one afternoon. It was 3 or 4 PM and it was still somewhat crowded. I liked the croissant more than the tart, but I'm also biased because I prefer savory foods over sweets. Nonetheless, the lemon tart was really good. I don't remember it being too heavy which is good. They also give you unlimited refills for their coffee which is a plus. The second time I tried Tartine was when my friend bought morning buns and almond croissants to share while we were waiting in line for rush tickets to In the Heights, but I arrived late and the morning buns were gone :( Luckily I got to try the flaky and crispy croissant with a delicious center. I need to go back and try the morning buns that are supposedly to die for. My friend was there when the store was about to open, and he said there was already a line, so it's probably a good idea to go early to avoid crowds.

Êhere is my suggestion.....go spread some goodness in the world....take a "quick" detour on muni, pick up half a dozen of these tantalizing warm, sugary, flakey, sticky morning buns with that alluring suggestive hint of orange - no nibbling now! - carry them back with care to your hungry colleagues, and you shall see smiles, drools, groans, ooooohs and aaaaahs..... and thats just on the J church!

went to tartine for the first time this morning, and it was great! the big downsides are the lines, and rich old guys trying to cut in line so they can "just buy a loaf of bread." Êhowever, the line moved pretty quickly, and the food was well worth the wait. my wife and I got the croque monsieur and the pastrami sandwich. Êboth were nice and hot when we got them, which was excellent. Êthe sandwich had the perfect amount of horseradish on it, so it wasnt too strong, and the meat was nice and tender. ÊThe prices are a little high, but you get a good size portion which is nice. ÊThe pastries and tarts, though, are pretty much the same price as at starbucks, but I'm sure they are tastier They only had grapefruit juice, which I'm not a big fan of, but they were cool about me going across the street to get a naked juice and drink it inside the cafe. it's hard to grab a place to sit inside, so you have to keep and eye out and stalk people who look like they are about to get up. I usually try not to lend the trendiness of places affect my reviews, but this place was very good, and worth the crowd. Êwe'll be going back soon for pastries and tarts!

pastry like paris without the plane fare... Êthis place certainly sets the bar for all else, though the experience can be a little trying - always crowded, people opt to not bus their tables, as you're meant to, so there's frequently 'stuff' on tables that could otherwise be used or are just dirty - it's best to just do take-away and dash up a few blocks to the park and overlook the city.

Over a 1000 reviews for a bakery near the Mission is quite the amazing feat, but it shouldn't come to any yelpers since this joint is highly regarded by the yelp community and San Francisco in general. My girlfriend discovered the place on Yelp and she figured I would enjoy the food there and as usual, she is correct. We went during that heat wave that paralyzed San Francisco and between you and me, there were a lot of hipster chicks not wearing bras, including a worker...Plus 1! We both ended up wit the Procsciotototot sammichs (Sorry cant spell Italian) and it was damned awesome. Toasty and buttery bread and the meat was delectable. We were also able to eat outside and enjoy the sun and the harmonious sounds of the cars whizzing by. I beleive our sandwiches were 9 bucks each, quite pricey but luckily there was a corner store across the street, so I bought an Origina on the cheap to complete our European Bistro Style experience. Good times

I wanted to check this place out because the reviews on Yelp were really good and the pictures of all the desserts and pastries looked sooo yummy...I just had to try it for myself. I went on a Sunday around 2pm and expected there to be a really long line. There was, in fact, a line but the wait wasn't too bad. The place is pretty small but there are also a few tables outside. All the sweets looked even better in person than in the pictures. It was hard for me to choose what I wanted to try. I ended up choosing the Banana Cream Tart to share with the hubbs for dessert. We each got one of their pressed sandwiches as well. I ordered the Prosciutto & Provolone and the hubbs chose the Spicy Turkey. There was a bit of a wait on the sandwiches so we ended up eating the tart first. Oh my...was the Banana Cream Tart delicious! Perfect size for sharing too. Our sandwiches came soon after we scarfed down our dessert. They were definitely bigger than I thought! If I knew the portion was going to be that large I would've shared one sandwich with the hubbs. Both were very tasty though I think I liked my Prosciutto & Provolone a little bit more than the Spicy Turkey....but I definitely would recommend both. We boxed up the the rest and ate them later on that day (and it tasted just as good!). I can't wait to go back again and try more of there scrumptious goodies!

Perfection. Do you know how hard it is to actually produce a flaky croissant as they do in France? Well the bakers here have figured that out ages ago but please dont limit yourself to a meager croissant or brioche because there are many, many more heavenly delights and pastries, cakes, desserts that could be displayed at this moment on the boulevard St-Germain in Paris or in any self-respecting neighborhood patisserie in France. But Tartine is more than a bakery. Their croque monsieurs/madames (does one say "messieurs and mesdames?") are positively craquants --yeah, oozing with marvelously flavorful gruyere; you won't regret it. I am also a big fan of their bread pudding, a mixture piled with fresh berries served warm. Haven't had the pleasure yet of their chocolate cakes but they look very inviting in the display case. And I have to believe that there is a daily exercise in masochism (or sadism?) in that hordes of very hungry people have to wait (im)patiently to order and in the process have to deal with what's behind the well-lit glass cases...just before they try to figure out what to order. Only a couple of quick misses: service can be a bit surly (please smile in order to disarm them); getting to the coffee in the corner is awkward since you have to cut through the line a couple of times as you are balancing your coffee cup. Finally, this place is much too small!

Their pastries are to die for! ÊWhile exploring in SF, we discovered this little bakery. ÊI recognized it from the last time my family came to visit trying to find the "best bakery in SF." ÊThis place is not easy to find since it has no sign but if you look for the long line, you'll know where it is (also it's 18th & Guerrero). ÊThe place is small so I recommend taking ti to go or eating ti in the car. ÊWhen you get in, you will be so overwhelmed by all the wonderful goodies you can get! ÊI got the lemon cream tart, a currant scone and a couple of shortbread cookies (yes, you will gorge here...but how many times are you around this area to get these?). ÊWe loved it! Êeverything is just so fresh and a true sense of what a pastry is. ÊI did have to take one star off for the cramped quarters to get the food (and the Asian lady who kept pushing her way to make wierd complaints and get questions answered). ÊA little pricey but I definitely will be coming back !

wake up early, head on over and arrive at 9:06 am, 6 minutes after opening on a cloudy sunday morning. the line was out the door, but going quickly. the smells were drool worthy, everything just baked and still warm. unsure of what to get for my *first time*, i got two of the plain croissants, scones, and morning buns. and my friend also threw in the chocolate hazelnut torte. (aka good idea!) the croissants were flakey and buttery, the morning buns were sweet, with a candy likeness to them, sugar crystals decked out on it. the scones were crisp on the outside, crumbly in the center (i am going to have to admit i LOVE more the scones at Arizmendi bakery over on 9th ave.) the hazelnut chocolate torte... not overpowering on the chocolate, crisp yet flakey crust- delish!! the bread pudding looked incredible, but after stuffing my face, i could unfortunately bare no more baked goods.

I came back this time to stand in line....parking was not fun to find as they were having the summer in the city and closed down streets near the bakery. ÊA line had formed and when we finally found parking we hopped into the line and waited for 10 minutes. ÊSuch a nice and beautiful day...I ordered the pain au jambon, croissant, et tarte aux chocolates y hazelnuts (if my french serves me correctly). ÊYes this place is on the indulgent and slightly pricey side, but it was worth the trip. ÊThe pain au jambon was so good and inside it contained Gruyere cheese. ÊThe croissant was still good the next day after popping it into the microwave, but I still liked the pain au jambon better. ÊMy friend and I took our goods over to Delores Park and people watched in the sun. ÊVery relaxing for a Sunday morning. ÊWould definitely head back there....btw...my chocolate/hazelnut tarte still exists in the fridge, and per my friend the best way to describe it is that it's like a huge Ferro Rocher, it even tastes better when it's been sitting in the heat warming up....yummy yummy in my tummy!

My best friend, who happens to be a pastry chef, was visiting from Vancouver and she really wanted to check out Tartine while she was in SF. ÊWell, naturally it was my duty as her friend to sacrifice myself and indulge in a pastryfest. ÊOh, and did we ever indulge. ÊSince we were there purely for her research purposes, it was necessary that we try pretty much one of everything. ÊReally, it was. ÊMy absolute favorite item was the brioche bread pudding, closely followed by the lemon tart. ÊThe chocolate croissants were also delicious. ÊIt was definitely worth the wait in a line that went out the door and around the corner- luckily the line moved very quickly. ÊI guess the only thing that I can't rave about is the slightly tough/edgy feel of the place, from the artwork, Êto the attitudes of some of the staff.

I have gone here several times and feel its time for the review. I really enjoy everything I have tried here: croissants, fruit tarts, coffee, tea... last evening after work I was walking around the neighborhood pretending to be a hipster and walked back in here. I was in line trying to decide what to try when I stumbled upon the fresh fruit brioche. Can I just say... YUMMY! I really enjoyed it because it was really fresh... not overwhelmingly sweet and the bowl for $6 was enough from my friend and I to share I also ordered the house ice tea which was tasty.... it had a hint of mint in it which I absolutely love love love! It was crowded as usual, but we managed to get a spot on the large table by the door. This place really does charge a lot for what they sale... it is my only complaint. Yet, I chose to go there.... so I guess I should shut my trap... but still... why oh why is it so expensive? I have had better pastries... yet, people seem to be like moths heading into the light at this place. I sure hope they pay their employees well... if so, it is cool.

after eating lunch at Delfina next door, we were totally stuffed but i was determined to go to Tartine before we headed back to LA. the line was out the door and hooked around outside a bit. seating inside is very minimal and crowded. i think there were about 6 or 7 tables and a small bar seating area along the window, but the line snakes through the seating area and out the door. we waited in line for probably 20 min and finally reached the bakery display case. what to get?!?! i had just read on twitter that morning that Bobby Flay was in SF and was in line getting morning buns haha! so i got a morning bun! and a little bag of cookies. my friend got the mini banana creme pie. getting a seat in there is near impossible so we just headed back to the car, and ran the rest of our errands before heading to the airport. we both forgot about our tartine goodies until we got home to LA. the morning bun was crispy, lightly sugary and had a slight hint of orange. it was even better warmed a bit in the microwave. my friend said that her banana creme pie was smashed but it was still so good. the cookies i got were thin and crispy and so good with coffee. tartine... another must go-to/must-try kind of place in SF :)

the crowded standing-room-only shop and the beautiful cookbook made me want to try Tartine for the first time. so a coworker and i made a special lunch trip to the no-parking area this afternoon. and quite frankly i was a little disappointed. ok, this may be a skewed review, but i'm not a sweets type of person. actually i hate sweets, pastries, almost everything Tartine is known for. HOWEVER, their menu also serves up some yummy sounding sandwiches and non-sweets stuff. first off, the service can improve tremendously. i was in line with only a couple of people in front. the girl behind the counter asks "what can i get for you?". i tell her i want to have a sandwich. she then tells me "oh, you have to order at the counter." ok, so why'd you ask?? so then i get to the counter and order. no problem the other girl puts my sandwich thingy into the oven and i go to another girl to pay. the assembly line system they have is so bad that she rings me up for other people's food after i told her 3 times those dishes aren't mine. i tell her it's the thing in the oven. she still asks. i'm frustrated by then. so i pay and sit down. she never told me how long it'll take. i'm sitting for nearly 10 minutes thinking they forgot to take it out of the oven. so i walk back up with my order number, and a new girl snobbishly says to me, "we'll bring it to you; it takes 10 minutes", as if i should know their procedure like a regular. oh by the way, did i mention it's not really a sandwich but a big slice of bread with cheese on top? and did i mention how much it cost? $7.75 plus tax = $8.31. OMG, WHAT A RIP OFF!!! for that much i coulda bought a whole loaf and a pound of cheese. and what's this whole thing about bussing your own tables? i could understand if it's so they don't have to hire so many people but they in fact had a LOT of ppl working there, yet the lines aren't moving any faster and they still stupid mistakes with the orders. they are quite lucky they're in a slow paced neighborhood. imagine if they were in the bustling downtown. great experience but i won't be back anytime soon.

After reading about all the reviews about Tartine through Yelp and various other blogs/articles/TV shows, etc I had to check this place out. ÊIt did not disappoint, though the line was insanely long. I went on a Saturday morning (prime time, I guess), and had to wait outside for around 1 hour. Lesson learned: to avoid waiting in lines get here EARLY. ÊI tried their banana cream pie, morning bun, and the pain au chocolat, I loved them all. Ê MORNING BUN = YUM.

ÊI have sampled the desserts, pastries, and sandwiches and all are fabulous (yes, you have to be a fan of butter!).

This place has gotten too big and probably careless if they have a few complaints from the locals. 1. -** The set up of he place is akward because you have to form a line by the door that leads to a narrow isle on the left side of the room and then you can't really see what is there available to order until you are up by the counter. 2. --***** for the horrendous service. Êsome drug induced un-clean and lazy guy was throwing all kinds of attitude when we request to purchase a slice of cake. ÊHe would reply by saying we don't sell the cake by the slice like duh....r u stupid???? ÊThere was no sign on any of the cake stating they don't sell them by the slice. ÊSo basically, every cake they have on display they don't sell by the slice and how dare us to even ask. ÊWhen I wasn't looking, he turned and made fun of me requesting cake by the slice with another woman. ÊHow rude!!! Êwhat the hell do you sell if nothing is available by the slice????? who the hell goes to a coffee shop and order an entire cake with their coffee?? ÊJust rude!!!! To add insult to injure, they put a tip jar at the register where the cashier also had a blacken sour face....... Maybe you can bang on getting the tourist bucks to carry on in this manner but I would rather eat chalk than to return for your great service served up by your fine young staff.

i like this place. and how it doesn't try to be french. sure, there are french pastries and beverages, but it isn't a francophile joint with grammatical errors in the name (hello "beau maison" on polk, your name should be belle maison--ever heard of gender agreement between adjectives and nouns?!). anyhow, the foods that i've had the delight to try have been yummy. even worth the occasional trip across town to wait in the semi-long line. 10-15 minutes is so worth it. the brioche pudding is great. love the fresh fruit. the frangipane croissant, morning bun, and double pain au chocolat are also tasty. i did have a quiche that was iffy, but it was okay. i was already bursting at the seams from all of the food that we ordered and well, you can't eat everything, right?

Ok I had to check this place out for myself.

The quiche was also good but I will definitely be coming back for the pastries. I didn't notice any attitude on the part of the folks working there. The place is small and cramped but most everyone there was friendly. Another plus is Bi-Rite creamery is right across the street, so i picked up a pint to bring home afterwards.

this place would get 5 stars for the baked goodies themselves. they lose two stars for the ridiculous catastrophe that one must endure to actually purchase said goodies. Ê i am tempted to knock off another star for the frustrating effect this place has had on the neighborhood, but since i've moved to the other end of the mission, i am less consistently annoyed by patrons so will stick with three stars. Êkeep in mind, i actually wrote this place 'welcome to the neighborhood' poems before they opened (slipped 'em in the mail slot), i was so excited to have a quality bakery in the 'hood. Êthose were the days... no joke, while the goodies are delicious- the best i've had in SF- it is rarely worth the wait, unless you come on a weekday, or can get someone to pick up a box to go. Êi wouldn't normally down grade a place for being popular- that's the price of goodness. Êbut this place seems to foster a willful incompetence amongst staff and whoever worked out the floor plan. Êdespite being crazy busy most of the time, the counter folk have a ridiculously slow and error prone system of moving forward the line. Êi cannot believe that after all this time, they still seem to muddle along with the same routine. Êhow about a number system like mitchell's or lucca's? Êor lose some of the indoor seating-? the other huge issue is the floor plan. Êthe coffee counter is at the opposite corner of the place from the coffee fixings. Êwhat the bleep!?! Êand, it's behind the ever-present line, and separate from the silverware and other eat in items. Êso one might wait in line for 30 min, then have to struggle across the cafe 2-3 more times before being able to eat/ drink your treats. Ê seriously, NOT WORTH IT. Êthat said, if you ever wander past and there isn't a line out front, it might be worth a try to stop in- the baked goodies really are delicious (i lived around the corner for years, so i've been more than a few times). Êi highly recommend the morning buns and the lemon tarts, and they have great croissants. also: the art tends to be terrible, even for an SF coffee shop (which is a fairly low bar in general).

The bread here is to die for! I love the crunchy crust and soft center. All their open faced sandwiches are so rustic and hearty. Their portions are a little large though, so I always end up splitting a meal. The cappuccino I ordered was good, but my friends chai was awful and watery. It is hard to find a great chai, and this place didn't quiet get it. It is such a cute atmosphere, but will the people who sit here on laptops please limit themselves! There are only a few tables inside, and it is so frustrating when you have ordered a meal and some person is sitting with his empty coffee cup surfing the web for hours! There are plenty of other places where you can sit and stare at your computer, but when I go to Tartine, I would actually like to look at my surroundings, the bake case, and the line of eager people buying their scrumptious treats!

So, I gotta say that I think this place is good but seriously overrated. ÊOn a few occasions, I've noticed the croissants and morning buns are overdone. ÊThey are a little too brown to call perfect, i.e., clearly accidentally overcooked but served in any event. Coming from Manhattan, where they have some french bakeries with some incredible croissants, I have to say I was disappointed by the croissants at Tartine. ÊThey are massive and overbrowned. They also seem to have some sort of egg wash to make them crispy on the outside. Ê This is not how I envision a perfect croissant. The coffee is just okay and I'm not a fan of coffee that comes in a self-serve thermos. Ê I feel like the hype of this place has kept it going, but it isn't anything special. ÊIt's just a place that gets a lot of good press but I can't say I've had anything amazing there. To be fair, I've heard the freshly baked bread is incredible, and perhaps that is also true with the morning bun, but if you don't happen to get there when everything is piping hot from the oven, then I'd say it's just a mediocre bakery in a good location.

Food is great. Service sucks. They don't clean their tables after customers leave. The wait in line just to order is made unbeiveably long by the lousy system of taking and filling orders. The cashier does nothing but sit there taking money while she yawns her day away. There can be a line out the door and still only one person taking orders with a mob of people in the kitchen milling around. Don't even try to order a sandwich here, they are way too expensive - over $20 for 2 sandwiches that took over an hour to arrive... where they waiting to bake the bread or cure the ham or make the cheese? God knows why it takes over an hour to make 2 sandwiches. Food is great, but is it really worth close to $3.25 for a morning bun? And did I mention, the service sucks.

It's too crowded, it's true. ÊI don't go here for the scene. I'm not a dessert person. I have been here 100 times and never sat down at a table. Why? Because I go there for just one thing--the bread. Their country bread is as good as I've ever had in the US. ÊI went to Rome--was there on National Bread Day, where I sampled enough amazing varieties to make me burst--and this is as good. It's a hassle getting a hold of it--available only 5-7 on Wed - Sun, and forget about the weekend--but I'll pick up a loaf (or a half loaf, they're huge) on Wed or Thur and it's just heavenly. (Do they serve other food?) You can order it ahead, but it's still a hassle. Please Tartine, make it available at other times. But I give it five stars for the country bread alone.

I moved to San Francisco from Philadelphia about 5 years ago and have been searching for that 'perfect' cafe/bakery/bistro combination- you know- great food, relaxed atmosphere, friendly service. I've been to a number of cafes/bakeries in the city, everything from La Boulange to Arizmendi's to Citizen Cake and back again. A friend whose culinary tastes I value recommended Tartine, so I decided to check it out. Experience #1: I decided to come in on a cold rainy San Francisco night, an hour or so before closing time. I had bread pudding and a cafe au lait. The bread pudding was a little on the sweet side, the coffee was good though not great. However, the thing that was really awful was the downright uncaring, borderline rude staff girl who, mind you, looked like she hasn't taken a bath or washed her hair since 1994 AND, as if things couldn't get more awful, they were blaring some totally inappropriate noise on the radio so loudly, I could literally hear my own thoughts. I know this is the Mission...but c'mon people, I've had friendlier, less hipper-than-thou service in Williamsburg for crying out loud! Experience #2 So, a few months later, I actually decided to give it another try...willing to try anything at least twice. Decided to come at brunch with a friend after relaxing at Dolores Park. I had a cappuccino and a ham/gruyere sandwich. The sandwich was delicious, the cappuccino, not so much. The espresso tasted bitter (shot pulled too long?) and the foam was full of bubbles, no creamy, velvety microfoam to speak of. Once again, the staff seemed more interested in talking to eachother then making a sale and the place was a mess, tables dirty, crumbs everywhere. We sat on one of the tables outside and watched dirty dishes literally pile up on a table next to us, as no one, not once, in 30+ minutes we were there, came to clear any dirty dishes. Overall, this bakery has incredible potential but atmosphere, and most of all, service, are seriously lacking. In my humble opinion, if you're looking for a stellar bakery, you're better off with checking out any of ÊBoulangerie's located throughout the city.

rich flavors, heavy food, and delicious. Ê(i'm sure there is a lot of butter in whatever it is they've got going on). Ê I've had a few of their sandwiches and have been adequately satisfied with each. ÊAgain, expect a full barrage of overwhelming flavor coming your way. Êsometimes borders on a bit too much of a good thing .. but, in the end i still deem it within the 'good thing' range. love their croque, pastrami (even though i'm not usually crazy about horse radish), spicy turkey, and sopressata. Ê for dessert i've had their lemon bar, lemon tart, eclair, and some bread pudding dealy - i'm pretty sure i loved each one. Êagain, very rich, and very satisfying. Êand since i love lemon tarts and lemon bars, as far as lemon tarts and bars go: pretty f*cking good. Ê Ê Ê also, love the pickled spicy carrot! and, word to the common stream of employee bashing... but to play devils advocate, they've not all been d*cks and as a fellow service industry worker, i get it. Ê(even though the attitude on some of them can be flagrantly excessive). if you're serving and endless line it is highly likely that you might run out of nice. also, to address those of you that have taken issue with the impatience displayed by the workers regarding ordering process, i say it is more than likey partially your fault. let me explain: you should pay attention to how the person in front of you is ordering if youre not sure. thats about it. Êthe first time i ordered i realized that there was a system at play and tried to pay attention to how the process works and didnt expect for them to cater to me. not like youre tipping them as you would a normal waiter. and if you aren't paying attention have the balls to ask them how to order. Êthe end. butterflies and ponies, l.n.

Tartine is amazing!! I am addicted to their Ham and Cheese croissant. Their pressed sandwiches are a dream. Their pastry is often the cure for what ails. Their cookies are crisp and delicious.

My first visit Êand a solo one too. Got there before the noon rush on a Sunday and had no problem finding a table to eat at. The chai latte was unsweetened so I had to dump these hardened rocks of sugar into it which didn't seem to melt or sweeten it up .. oh well. The olive loaf was good but I had to ask for it to be heated up. Went great with my chai latte but was a bit too greasy for my taste. A bit too pricey for a latte+slice of bread = $9 but def a great spot if you have some time to kill and are able to score a seat inside or out. My neighbours were also allowed to read for a bit but most folks are courteous and just eat, sit for a bit, and then leave.

Just because its reviewed over 2,000 times doesn't mean I shouldn't review it some more right? Needless to say this place in INCREDIBLE good coffee great pastries...its making me crave coconut and dark chocolate tarts just thinking about it. I can see myself going crazy one day and driving up from L.A. just to go grab another tart. I think the only downers here were the long lines, limited seating, and the long wait for our food to come out, but with the kind of pastries they make its worth the wait. The Êpastries were all pre-made so we got those at the counter, we had the coconut tart and the bread pudding. the bread pudding was luke warm, mushy, and wet. I could tell it was probably good an hour ago, but it became very bland once it got cold. The coffee was yum although it kind of sucked sitting outside because all these little flecks of pollution kept falling into my coffee which leaves me to believe it wasn't just in my coffee and actually in pretty much everything i ingested...bleh. Anyway im digressing, it took 30 minutes for my panini's to come out but boy was it worth it! (because it took so long they ended comp'ing another one of anything on the menu, but i chose another coconut tart thing even though it was cheap because it was just SOOO GOOD). I had the best and probably only backwards meal I have ever had and it was all at this amazing bakery. S.F.'ers are so lucky to have places like this in their city...COME DOWN TO L.A. WHERE ITS WARM AND OPEN ME A TARTINE BAKERY please =)

I had a passionately love affair with the croque monsier (french for cheese toast) and especially its pickled carrot garnish. Alas, after months of free extra carrots, we had an irreconcilable split when the gorgeous woman behind the counter informed me that, No, she couldn't give me extra carrots with my $9 cheese toast because it turns out carrots are really expensive. Maybe in a year or two I'll get over my heart break/wallet ache and be able to return to my naively romantic youth... until then, my toaster oven is getting a serious workout. anyone know how to pickle carrots?

The food here is good and the prices are great. However, the wait staff is extremely unhelpful, negligent and rude. The last time I was there, I noticed the "please bus your own tables" sign. I was happy to oblige, but wasn't sure where I was supposed to place the dishes. I tried asking a member of their wait staff. All of them knew I was trying to find help, but chose to ignore me. The food is good, but I wouldn't recommend coming here. The customer experience is simply too bad. In addition to the wait staff, finding a table isn't easy. One often waits almost a half hour standing with your food in order to sit down and eat it. I'd be happy to pay more and go elsewhere for a better experience.

sorry the fact that i spent last year eating one perfect pain au chocolat after another means that this place dissapointed me. i finally past it by when there was not a line out the door. so i decided to try it out, it being a "french" cafe and all. the good news was the pain au chocolat i had was the best i've had since i got back to the states. but it was also the bad news why is it that you just cannot get a good soft unburnt pain au chocolat and from what i saw croissant in the states. is the process of making them just impossible to reproduce. cant we steal some french bakers to produce high quality pastries for us here in america? why are all the pain au chocolats here thick, dense (i know same word) and hard. we are able to make good angelfood cake... and thats all squishy and soft. why cant we make good croissants? whats the deal? sorry tartine. but your pain au chocolats are dense and hard and too crunchy. and your croissants looked burnt. lets get our act togather america its not quantity its quality. yep

Tartine is the best bakery I know in San Francisco, possibly the best west of the Mississippi. I'll admit that there's a shortage of good bakeries in SF.

"Hi, could I get a croissant, cafe au lait, and a side of attitude please?" Yes, that's my usual order at this place. Sigh...the things I do for the love of their croissants...it leads me to grin and bear the sassiness (there's cute sassy, and there's dumb sassy - this is the latter case) of the Mission hipsters who work there. Too cool for school, I guess. But honestly, I plan on being buried with their croissants or bread pudding, so...there you have it.

2.5 stars if i could. Experienced the usual parking and line out the door thing. Caveat, got there at 3pm, a little later than ideal,so perhaps we didnt get the really good stuff, which i'm told runs out by noon (the double pain au chocolat and the morning bun). We got the tres leches and bread pudding, neither of which either of us liked much. Wasnt bad, but not nearly as great as the rave reviews lead us on to expect. I will admit that the pastry was pretty light, that was a plus. Will go back to get the pain au chocolat sometime. Girl who served us looked and sounded like she was doing us this great massive favour, negs for service.

finally got the chance to savor one of their almond croissants after attempting to do so at least 3 times. got up at 5am to lift this morning before i showered and headed out for tartine. got there at 7:25 and waited 5 minutes with a few other people for the store to open. all i wanted was the almond croissant and so i made a mad bum rush for those luscious treats. at 3.75 for one croissant, i'd say the price was pretty steep, even if the croissant was quite a bit larger than normal almond croissants. the croissant itself I thought was perfectly baked until i got to the ends, which were very burnt, so that definitely took away from the delectability of such a fine concoction, my favorite pastry of all time. the almonds, however, were perfectly toasted, the powdered sugar was not too heavily sprinkled, and the almond filling was very mild and pleasant, even if it was scarce. all-in-all, the price definitely was not worth the wait and effort. most of the croissant was just a croissant, and even if it was very flaky and well done in the middle, the burnt ends and meager filling really took away from a very steeply priced morning pastry. la boulange on pine and the brioche bakery in north beach still top out on the almond croissant list.

it's all right, but it's overpriced and certainly not worth the hype.

I've been to this bakery twice. ÊThe first time for a morning bun which was delicious but overpriced. ÊThe second time I went in wanting a morning bun again but the line was long and I waited then got tired of waiting and got discouraged and left. It is a shame that in reading the other reviews that other patrons think they are too slow in attending the customers and I was mortified to hear that some patrons got bad attitude by the workers taking the orders. Its a shame because even though they make good pastries THAT IS NOT A GOOD EXCUSE TO TREAT YOUR PATRONS LIKE CRAP!!!! So if the owners of this bakery read or even care about what your customers who keep you in business are thinking or writing THEN DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT!!!! ÊDevise a better system to make the lines go faster and hire professional courteous employees. ÊYour patrons deserve it for heavens sake! ÊIf you don't care what your patrons think then your days in business are numbered and you won't last. ÊYou should be kissing our feet for us to patronize you not the other way around! ÊYes...the customer is ALWAYS RIGHT!

very good pastries, but the absurdly long lines are not justified. i had a coconut cream tart, and part of a morning bun. both were delish, but this caliber of pastry can be had at the liberty cafe bakery without waiting in line for 45 minutes.

i live just a short walk away from this delightful place, and it is my favorite bakery of all time. Êit is comparable to many of the great parisian bakeries in its richness and grandeur. Êthis place makes really rich, sweet, delicious baked goods in classic french bakery style. Êunfortunately now the wait is ridiculously long at any time of day, but it is worth it. Êmy favorites are the morning buns, hazelnut tart, and any of the open face sandwiches.

I'm going to join the minority here. ÊI chose to stop by here while touring the area today based on the high number of positive reviews. ÊI didn't even realize that it was on the food network for the chocolate croissant. ÊAnyways, they were already out of that when we stopped by in the early afternoon. ÊInstead, I got the bread pudding, chocolate chip cookie, and the gruyere bread. ÊI particularly excited about the bread pudding, since so many reviewers mentioned it. ÊSince they were finishing up on the last bit of the bread pudding tray before setting out another one, I got a huge portion. ÊAnd apparently, if you dine in, you don't get the same amount. ÊSo I was feeling pretty lucky when I opened the bread pudding box. ÊAll the ingredients were good, but it didn't really stand out to me. ÊIt was just a lot of vague sweet stuff. ÊI had some stone fruit on top, and there was a portion of the pudding that was more flan like. ÊI thought the flan part was original...but in the end it didn't add anything to the dish. ÊSo overall, I thought it was good, but nothing to write home about. ÊThe chocolate chip cookie was even less memorable. ÊThe gruyere bread though, was delish. ÊI thought the texture and taste were great. ÊIf I do come visit the area again, I might stop by for the pain au chocolat. ÊBut I read in other reviews that it might be a little too rich, so I might not make a special trip out here just for that.

tried almost everything at Tartine & spent over $100....people behind me must think i'm crazy....i figure since i waited this long, might as well try everything....quality is good....long line helped you feel good about spending all that $$$....overall, i didn't get the wow factor....

obviously the pastries are beyond good but the service is so beyond bad. i'm not sure why serving up sweet, buttery treats makes the folks there so very sour, but it does.

My friend lisa has been telling me since the beginning of time that I must hussle myself over to Tartine's to have the almond croissant..frangipane. Honestly, I don't even like almonds...I'm not indifferent...I actually prefer NOT to eat them. But there I was eyeing everything through t he glass and I opted for one and a shortbread cookie. The croissant was nothing short of heavenly..Maybe earthly is a better word as the filling was dense and well distributed..not all lumped in the middle. A slightly sweetened paste with slices of almonds..and a buttery flakey fresh outer shell. I had forgotten about the short bread and ate it a week later...dug out from my purse. Wasn't stale at all...and crumbled apart like a good shortbread should. Sat. I went for the rasberry bread pudding which is eggy and light...with a nice amount of rasberry juice for the pudding to wade in at the bottom of the coffee cup...and I had one of my favorite brunch treats: the croque monsier, fromage blanc. Its a mild, mild fluffy cheese on a soft bread with asparagus spears on top burnt brown. Last time I had it, it was made to perfection, this time the aparagus bases were a bit...too fibrous and I couldn't bite through them.

this place is AMAZING! everything is so well crafted and delectably made. :-) very worth the wait--which goes by fast and is useful time to decide what you're gonna get. just had the Banana Cream Tart---perfect! the bananas are actually in there and the cream and custard are so light and lovely w/the crisp/flaky tart w/chocolate and a hint of caramel on the bottom. also have had the "Frangipane" crossaint with almond paste inside and seasonal berries in the middle (currants this time) with almonds and powdered sugar all over the crispy flaky crust. beautiful desserts and SOOOO GOOD! definitely a must when visiting the Dolores Park area...just have to decide between which sweet treat to have when you go: Tartine's or Bi-Rite Creamery. :-)

lines are too long most of the time and uncomfortable to sit and eat lunch, but a to go bag of baked goods are always yum. Êif you must sit, try their open faced sandwiches!

We were in France for a month in May and June, and I literally did not eat a single croissant (and I ate croissants almost every day) that was a delicious as the ones at Tartine. This bakery is a truly rare beast. My favorite things: the insane bread pudding with the seasonal fruit topping; the chocolate pudding (I know, I know, who cares about chocolate pudding? But try this one-- it's made with Sharffenberger Chocolate and is absurdly good); the mini lemon tart; the morning buns with the orange zest. I also love the ham and cheese croissants (which must be made with a pound of butter) and the cheesy gougeres-- I do wish Tartine had more savory treats. My one issue with the place is that the service can be uneven-- the cashiers are a little attitudinous and they have timing problems with the lunchtime rush. And I avoid the place on weekend mornings, when the queue goes way down the block. Nonetheless the food is incredible. It took me ages to lose my baby weight because when I went on long walks my feet always seemed to transport me to Tartine...

We went on a Saturday and stood in a line that didn't move for 15 min. and left, coming back on a rainy Monday when it was quieter. The pastries and cakes are gorgeous. I was prepared to be wowed and would say the verdict was 50% Ho! and 50 % Ho Hum. The lemon tarte was as beautiful as it was delicious. The chocolate on the eclairs is high quality however, like a hard shell vs. icing. The pate a choux is thick and chewy vs. light and airy. The pastry creme inside was flecked with vanilla bean, yummy, however, very runny, not a creme patisserie, more an anglaise. This is not a French style eclair. We split a Niman Ranch ham and gruyere panini. Enormous! and greasy, and because the bread is so thick, the ham and cheese didn't melt. I'd love to come back at 5p.m. one day and buy their bread. It's divine. ÊWe didn't try the other pastries however, the morning buns and almond croissants looked wonderful as did many other items. The baker must have turned the oven on too high today because they brought out a large platter of truly burned pastries, next to many other "too burned to sell" pastries. Who would want to eat burned pastries? The staff were all friendly however and we had a nice lunch here.

DO NOT buy the food from this Bakery. ÊThey do one thing very well, bake, the chef has it all wrong when it comes to real food. ÊI've had many of their treats and they're good. ÊI'm not going to say they're great but compared to other bakeries they're just a little above. ÊThe difference is the food. ÊI ordered a sandwich which was terrible to say the least. ÊThe grisly bread was too hard to even be considered for a sandwich I couldn't finish it. ÊAfter working my way through about 1/3 of it I threw it away. ÊThe bread tasted like stale croutons soaked in oil and burnt. ÊI've never been so offended by food which comes from such an upstanding bakery. ÊTake the bread aside, the whole recipe was off. ÊIf you have a sweet tooth then get a desert; it's what they know best. ÊIf you're hungry, go somewhere else. ÊOn top of that, the staff was rude and gave the impression they didn't want to be there and the whipped cream had no sugar in it to the point I threw it away as well.

I was actually a little worried about their business when I showed up for lunch today because there wasn't a line for me to wait in and I had my choice of tables. ÊBe forewarned, this usually doesn't happen. ÊBut if you are willing to wait in line and eat your food wherever the hell you can find some space, the bread pudding will not disappoint you. ÊYour hot pressed sandwich (I heartily recommend the sopressata) will be liberally bathed in butter before it is grilled. ÊWhether or not that's a good thing is up to you to decide. ÊThe pickled carrot took me by surprise - perfectly tender-crisp and zesty and flavorful with some spice that kicked in later. ÊThat and the broccoli rabe pesto are fantastic and might make you feel just a little less guilty about what you're eating. ÊThe desserts are gorgeous. ÊPersonally I've never tried them because I'm afraid if I do I'll just keep eating them and never look back. ÊMaybe you have more will power. ÊIf you do, I'd suggest that Scharfen Berger pudding. ÊIt's been calling my name for months now.
