Oh dear, sweet baby jesus. I had yet to try chairman bao since they are seemingly never EVER in the east bay, or I miss them when they make a rare appearance at OTG out here. Well, after the color run in SF this past weekend, they were parked in the lot and there was a huge line of hungry or drunk or possibly both patrons (I may or ?may not have fallen into the both category). I grabbed my wallet and hopped into line, super excited to finally try these (yes, I get ridiculously excited for food. don't judge me.) I ordered one pork belly and one chicken, and I've been kicking myself ever since for not ordering 2039850239850283 to keep in my freezer so I can eat these for the rest of my life. They completely lived up to the hype! The pork belly was tender and flavorful, and the buns are soft and pillowy. The chicken was actually VERY good, dare I say it may have been better than the pork belly! It was spicy and super tender and delicious and awesome and oh god why didn't I buy more..... *sobs* ... *keeps sobbing*

Indeed, the pork belly did melt in my mouth! I've heard a lot of good things about the chairman truck, but I didn't get a chance to try it until yesterday! They happened to be around washington square and so I finally get to try it. They don't have too many choices on the buns, but i'm sure pork belly is what they are famous for. You can either order the steamed or baked bun. Baked bun are like burger bun. My friend ordered the baked one and I ordered the steamed one. The steamed one came with 2 pieces of pork belly with some pickled daikon and sauce. I'm not a fan of pickles so I ordered with no daikon - basically it's just the steamed bun and 2 pieces of pork belly. Portion is not huge, but it was delicious~ Baked one was a lot bigger....and i think there were 3 pieces of pork belly. Other than this I did not try any other items. It was a good experience and I hope to try out other stuff ?soon!

Second time to The Chairman, but first review. I was racing against traffic to get to Moveable Feast in Willow Glen early so that I could beat the line for The Chairman. However, there was no line. I guess the craze for this truck has died down within the last year? I ordered: -Steamed Spicy Chicken w/Toasted Sesame Pur¨¦e, Pickled Carrots-Cucumber & Cilantro, $3.75, http://www.yelp.com/biz_¡­): Pretty good, but nothing special. The chicken wasn't very spicy, but I liked the pickled carrots and cucumbers. I probably wouldn't order this again. -Steamed Tender Pork Belly w/Turmeric Pickled Daikon & Green Shiso ($3.75, http://www.yelp.com/biz_¡­): Yum, still as good as I remember. The steamed buns are still nice and tender, but their shape makes it really hard to eat without spilling. However, the pork belly is still melt in your mouth delicious- a must order! -Baked Tender Pork Belly with Turmeric Pickled Daikon & Green Shiso ($6.75): I had this the first time I tried the Chairman and it was delicious- it's the same as the steamed version, but twice the size. However, the baked bun is a little more buttery tasting, and also easier to eat since it's more like a burger. Overall, the pork belly is still a must eat/try and doesn't disappoint. If you love pork belly and haven't been, you need to check out the Chairman asap! Fast service since there was no line. My only complaint is that it would be nice if they had sriracha available.

Two long and delicious years ago, I was lying on a sofa one night, watching food channel with my bacon-soaked mouth wide open, welcoming a big burger in my hand. Suddenly, a piece of golden meat stuck showed up on the screen. It was Chairman Bao. The meat was put in between a beautiful pearl white bun. A nostagic flashback of buns came up: My mother lifts up the steamer as the lightly sweet scent of the bun permeates the whole room. I then, have no hesitation in my mind that I will go find this truck someday. In the past two years, the search was almost completely marred by close successes, but ultimately, failures. I remember seeing the truck outside my window on the train, but was unable to get off the train, for my destination was far far away. I also remember seeing it stopping by a gas station with a closed sign on its door. Finally this Monday, I screamed as I finally stood face to face to this truck, and ordered my crispy pork belly bun. It did not disappointing me, I immediately sank my teeth through the soft pillow-like bun and the surprisingly crispy exterior of the pork and the bun. The juice of the meat immediately surrounds my tongue as the flavor it rang in my head loudly, and I was even more mesmerized when the coolness of the pickled daikon lifted me up light in the air. and I couldn't remember what happened after that, I probably fainted as I took the last bite. It's so good, chase it.

Oh my, Chairman Truck. Foodgasm in my mouth. I tried the pork belly, and some other ones, but clearly my tastebuds only vividly remember the pork belly one. Good balance of flavors - fluffy bun, delicious and piping hot pork belly, and some veggie on top to add some citrus in there. Now I see what the hype is about.

Excerpt from: http://letsomnom.wordpre¡­ Along the side of the street, we bumped into The Chairman Truck, one of San Francisco's best! Having already tried two of their buns with Sharon on my last visit, I knew it was worth a second! They specialize in making tasty buns, a perfect balance of sweetness and soft dough, with great toppings. You can either have the smaller steamed version of the bun or the larger baked version. I have yet to try the baked version, something I'll be sure to do on my fourth trip to San Francisco! With Sharon: spicy chicken with toasted sesame pur¨¦e, crunchy pickled carrots, cucumber & cilantro. I remember the chicken being a bit tough, although the flavors were bang-on! The bun is the most memorable of the components, definitely unique to the food truck. On the left: a Coca-Cola braised pork with savoy cabbage & preserved yellow mustard seeds. Super tender pork with a tangy twist. On the right: tender pork belly with turmeric pickled daikon & green shiso. Juicy bits of pork belly, and the daikon sliced so thin, it made a perfect slaw. Although their descriptions sound like very strong flavors (yellow mustards.. tumeric..), they're done very nicely with not one flavor overpowering another. Good balance! At this point, we saved our stomachs for the other food trucks on the other end, only to return to The Chairman to buy another bun. Yes, they're that good! Even the guy on the truck smiled as if this happens all too often. We ended up getting my favorite of all four that I've tried now: the crispy miso cured tofu with garlic-tofu mayo & baby choy sum. Whatever they use to batter that medium-firm tofu is amazing. And although I'm not usually a fan of baby choy, it worked really well with the mayo sauce. Best one of them all, despite it sounding way less appetizing! As a snack for down the road, I also ordered the chips. Might as well try as much as I can on the menu! Deep fried wonton chips sprinkled with Togarashi spices and slices of nori seaweed made this a salty snack I wouldn't mind buying packaged in the grocery aisle. Nom nom.

This food truck appeared during one of my visits to Off the Grid (Thursday near the Berkeley campus on Haste). ?The pork belly burger was delicious: the pork belly was tender, moist, and the fat oozed out of it. ?The wonton chips went well as a side to the burger, although I wish they had more flavor (a sauce, perhaps). ?However, everything can get pricey at around $11 considering their small portions. ?To get full off of their food, you would probably have to order two of their main dishes for around $14, which is quite pricey considering it is not a full-fledged restaurant with waiter service.

Had both the steamed and baked version of the pulled pork bao at Off the Grid. ?The baked bread is very similar to what you might get in Chinatown. ?The steamed bread version is very similar to what you get with Peking Duck in a Chinese restaurant, but not the steamed BBQ pork bun you get in Chinatown since those are raised with baking powder, not yeast. ? The pulled pork with cabbage bun interiors were OK. ?I'll have to try the pork belly next time and hope that the fat is grilled and not baked. ? I was told that the food truck was called "Chairman Bao" but it only said "The Chairman". ?Are they two different food trucks?

The fact that I don't eat meat means I have one option at The Chairman- Tofu. This is not a problem, or I wouldn't be a vegetarian. It just means I can't review this truck with reference to the other items on the menu. As a first-timer I felt I needed to try both the baked and steamed versions of the Crispy Miso Cured Tofu with Garlic-Tofu Mayo & Baby Choy Sum. This is definitely a filling option and next time I'll probably go for two of the smaller steamed buns. The baked bun looked just like a hamburger bun with a fluffier texture and sweeter taste. I picked off abut a quarter of the bun as I ate. The steamed bun was like a blown up taco shell, and also fluffy and sweet.The tofu was perfectly seared on the outside with a great texture. The baby choy sum was a good compliment. The sauce was tasty but I could have done with a little less. As usual, I wish I had added more sriracha than I did before walking back to my office to cut some of the sweetness of the buns. Overall, a very enjoyable trip to Off the Grid on Vallejo & Front.

I think their prices are just a little too high, but the line they attract animately disputes that opinion. You are gonna need to eat at least two baked buns to get full. They taste great and if you compare them to the 1.25 buns you can get at Chinese bakeries you will see that they are 5 times more expensive. ?However they definitely taste significantly better and contain a variety garnishes that add a nice combo of flavors. I got the baked chicken and pork belly buns. ?The chicken was good, but the pork belly blows it out of the water.... so if you get both eat the chicken first.

This food truck does it right! ?They took the Bao, and made it something modern, new, and delicious! ?Came here at the Moveable Feast, and this truck definitely stood out more than others. ?The contemporary approach to turning a simple bun with meat into something original was great. ? Had two of the steamed baos, the pork belly, and the cocacola braised pork? ?The pork belly was an interesting mix as baos are Chinese, however it had Japanese style daikon. ?Made for a delicious combination. ?The meat was crispy, light, and tender. ?Braised pork one was good as well. ?Less bursting with flavor, but still delicious nonetheless. ?

Perhaps my expectations were too high? ?I tried a couple of steamed buns -- pork belly & tofu -- when The Chairman was in San Jose for the Moveable Feast in Willow Glen. ?I found both disappointing. Firstly, the "tender" pork belly was anything but ... in fact, I almost reflexively spit out my first bite since the texture took me by surprise. ?When you are expecting melt-in-your-mouth sumptuous pork belly and what you get is like a super-fat slab of bacon it is just not good. ?Also, while normally I would agree that daikon paired with a greasy food is a good thing, it just didn't work for me in this case. ?The flavor of the daikon was overwhelming, and though the pork belly's flavor was underwhelming it just didn't balance out. I liked the tofu bun better than the pork belly, but it still had its problems. ?For being "miso cured," I sure struggled finding the hit of miso umami I was expecting. ?The tofu itself was nicely crisped on the outside and had a decent texture (though after eating the exquisite tofu from San Jose Tofu Co. at mom's house and at area Japanese restaurants it was a bit of a let down). ?The pairing with the Chinese greens worked better than the daikon/pork belly pairing, and there was some sort of dressing/sauce that was tasty but I could have used a more generous dollop. On the bright side, I did like the actual steamed bun in its pillowy goodness. ?I suppose if I ever ran across this truck again I might try some of their other offerings -- I mean how could you ever go wrong with duck confit? ?Though now that I think about it, I used to think the same thing about pork belly ...

It's one of my favorite food trucks that consistently provides excellent food. ?It's amazing how much food they produce in such a small space. The star is definitely the pork belly bao. It's perfectly cooked then seared on the grill and put into the bao with pickled daikon. ?The perfect marriage of crispy, acid and fatty goodness in a soft steamed bun.

Holy crap. This place is bomb-bay! Best food truck I've ever had. Best bun I've ever had. Only think keeping this from a 5 star rating is the price. At $3.75 - $6.75, its a pretty pricey snack. The pork belly is soft, succulent and melts in your mouth. The pickled diakon adds great sour and acidity to the bun and cuts through the pork flavor. The bun is soft and light, the perfect vessel for the pork and diakon. The braised pork was is sweet and bursting with flavor. The pork itself is pull apart tender. The cabbage adds some texture and almost a bit of creaminess to the bun. Be careful not to let it sit for too long. The pork is juicy and soaks into the bread. Wait too long and the bread will start to disintegrate. If you see the red truck with panda head logo, follow and enjoy those beautiful morsels from heaven.

I can't put my finger on why these baos are so good. Their secret ingredient must be crack or something with a small splash of LSD. On the serious note, these baos are insanely addicting, ?they need to start a BA meeting (Bao Anonymous) YES THEY ARE THAT GOOD! I always order the pork belly baked bao. The steamed ones are good too but the baked ones are bigger and the crispy texture works better with the ?soft pork belly. The acidity of the daikon cuts the richness of the fatty pork belly.

I've always clung to this intense aversion to food trucks. No matter which way you slice it, they're just not as good as restaurants. The Chairman throws all that out the window. It's always somehow exactly where I need it to be, exactly when I need it to be there. When my wallet's slim (always) and I'm craving coca-cola braised pork belly (always)--The Chairman is there. I'll say this but I'll only say it once: I'm glad The Chairman is a truck and not a brick & mortar. All hail Chairman Bao.

Word on the streets is, "if your a foodie and have not tried the Chairman Truck, your a wannabe". Is that true? Or should I say If you don't know what traditional Gua Bao is, then your just someone who wants to be a foodie. With that being said, there's a few factors to throw in before giving an honest rating of this truck. Background: -I'm motha-fa'king Taiwanese! -I go back to Taiwan once to twice a yr. I know what is traditional and what isn't. Street food is in my blood, my culture. -Let's not even think about American food prices and American hormoned filled pork! Okay, now here's the story. Put all that junk aside and eat like an American, this place is a hit. Even if your Taiwanese and you put yourself in another shoe. You think you can get better Gua Bao (or should I say Chairman Bao) from a Taiwanese restaurant in the Bay Area? I doubt it (unless you like prebraised frozen of a week fatty pork). Chairman was a hit place for me. Yes, I spent 6.5 for a damn bun (made not by Chairman but from a Chinatown bun factory). Normally something like this in Taiwan nightmarket should be around $1.5 if not less and maxed at $2USD. Put aside the price, and the plane ticket, and all that jibberish that a foodie can talk about, this place is darn good. The pork fatness wasn't overwhelming. In fact, it was just right. They added their own twist to the filling which doesn't exist in our traditional Gua Bao. I normally like to see peanut powder, cilantro, mustard greens and the nice steam bun. But here at Chairman, you have a choice between the traditional steam bun and the more American style baked bun. They didn't fill the thing with unnecessary junk that would ruin the taste. In fact, every bite was mouth watering (not from juices, but the natural aroma of the fatty pork). It tasted like the braised pork belly was done early in the morning and ready by noon time. It tasted like grandma's cooking, except mixed with their grandchildren's american twist. Even though it sounds all good, it's still not a 5 star thing. I still prefer grabbing my $1.5 bun in Taiwan when I'm back. It's not the same yah-know?

Well worth the wait. I tried the pork belly and spicy chicken steamed buns and they were A+. The pork belly was juicy and fatty, and the pickled daikon added a good sweet flavor. I just had one bite of the spicy chicken but I really liked it. It wasn't too spicy, but had a good enough flavor. Overall, I think I liked the spicy chicken more, but the pork belly was a close second, especially with some sriracha. I thought the size of the buns were pretty small for the price, honestly. I'll keep coming back to try more of their buns, though.

This is no char siu bao, but something much more amazing. My favorite is the spicy chicken. Why so? Because I abhor pork belly and am allergic to tofu. But that's not all... The spicy chicken bao is amazing because of their sauces and fillings are so exotic. It's meaty, yet crunchy due to the pickled carrots. And it's flavorful, yet spicy. My only gripe is its price because I'm so used to ordering char siu baos and peking duck buns for much less... And peking duck buns are tastier.

I got the baked coco cola braised pork. I was a little bit intimidated with the size at first when I got it, but I gobbled the whole thing. It looks like a burger but taste like bao with a twist. The pork was so tasty!!! Didn't feel fatty or heavy with the veggies they put in it. The bread was just amazing. It was sooooo soft!!!

The Chairman stopped by work today so I gave them another shot and picked up a pair of pork belly and chicken steamed buns. I don't know if I'm just unlucky, but I thought it was even worse this time. Although the pickled veggie toppings were still good, the pork belly was dry and sinewy, and about half of the chicken pieces were severely burnt. I pretty much waited half an hour to eat dry strings and charcoal. Ugh. Check out my pics and see for yourself.

Chairman, thank you for making my day just so, so much better! I was at the Treasure Island flea market today, and just around closing time my stomach started to complain. I had a $5 food voucher in my hands for participating in a survey at the flea market, and a row of food trucks that would take it off my hands. Wild game sausage? Tempting. Curry truck? Long line. Empanadas? Oh no, they're closing up with the market! I've gotta hurry up and spend my voucher... The Chairman? Sure. They have a short line, and are the cheapest of the bunch, I'll get almost 2 buns for my litte voucher. Give me a pork belly and spicy chicken, please? Oh. My. God. These little buns are too good for just a simple OMG. They require the full OH. MY. GOD!!! Or maybe it should be OH. MY. BUDDHA!? Either way, this was one of the best food truck experiences I've ever had. I almost went back for seconds, but felt a little silly. Of how I regret it now. Chairman, someday our paths will cross again, and I will sample the rest of your tasty treats. Until then, I'll let the lingering taste of your perfectly pickled daikon tide me over.

Whenever The Chairman Truck is in my neighborhood I go running. ?Later, I'll lie in bed at night still savoring the succulent pork belly. ?It's just that delicious. The menu is very simple--basically you choose your "bao" (bread) and then choose a filling. ?But, since it can be a little intimidating your first time here, especially when it comes to gauging appropriate portion size, I've written this brief guide. Bao Options: Steamed Bao - like a thick and fluffy Peking Duck pancake piled high with meat, veggies, etc. ?They run around $3.75 and 2 of them make a small but satisfying lunch. Baked Bao - like the bread from a roast pork bun, slit open with a knife and stuffed with filling. ?They're larger, and cost around $6.25. ?If you're hungry, get one of each. Filling Scorecard: A+ ?The juicy Pork Belly just melts in your mouth. ?It's by far my favorite in the line-up. A+ ?Miso cured fried Tofu - Not just for vegetarians! ?Lightly fried (not crispy deep fried), moist and tender in the middle. Topped with lettuce, pickled radishes and a tasty sauce. ?Add shiracha to kick it up a notch. A ? ?Coca Cola Pork - Delicious and mildly sweet. A- ? Spicy Chicken - Spicy and delicious. Lunch portion/price guide: Light to Medium Appetite: Order1 baked or 2 steamed bao ($6.25 - $7.50) Medium to Large Appetite: Order 1 of each (~$10) Huge Appetite: Order 3 steamed or 2 baked (~$11 - $12.50)

Although all their buns are pretty good, the Pork Belly (Steamed) is definitely the way to go! I have gotten the baked version before, but because it was so big, it didn't taste as good as the small, clam-shaped bun. I didn't appreciate it as much because there was so much of it (think hamburger-sized). Now I just order multiple steamed buns if I want more. The fatty pork belly melts in your mouth like better. I'm drooling just thinking about its deliciousness. This red truck with the friendly panda on it has me running to it every time I see it, like a little kid when they hear the ice cream man.

I had seen so many reviews & a few shows mentioning the Chairman as one of the best food trucks in America, so when I saw it at the Treasure Island Flea Market I had to try it....& OMG! The steamed Pork-Belly Bun is heavenly! It's an explosion of flavors & the pork's so tender it melts in your mouth! & the pickled radishes.....oodles & oodles of flavor! It was like a When-Harry-Met-Sally moment! A Must-try!!

YUMMMM. So good! The pork belly bun is really good! I really liked the steamed bun as it reminds me of peking duck! But it's more on the small end, like a snack size, which makes it a great way to try multiple food trucks! Definitely a must try! The meat is really tender and the flavours are amazing! I really love the addition of pickled radishes (daikon?) to the buns!

I bee-lined it to the truck when I saw it at the North Beach Farmer's Market to put in my order for the coca cola braised pork on a baked bun. ?I don't even like pork! ?I had tried it on the reference of a co-worker and thought it was amazing. ?The only drawback is the price ($6.75)--too expensive to order two, although I could easily eat that much.

Alright last year I got super into Food Trucks as did everyone else I feel like. I was stoked when I moved to SF to find that there is an actual Food Truck Stop on Mission St. ?They change up their trucks every day and post on a website. Boy was I lucky to have Chairman Bao on the day I went to the truck stop. This place is awesome. Probably one of my two favorite trucks next to the "Kogi" Truck in Los Angeles. You can either get a steamed or baked bun. The baked is essentially a hamburger and the steamed is essentially a taco. The prices are a bit steep than in Chinatown but man the flavors are solid here. They took something traditional and added a nice twist to it with the ingredients that they place into it. The pork belly is my favorite by far here. The pickled daikon adds a solid contrast both flavor and texture wise and the pork belly is super tender and flavorful. I also had the spicy chicken also which was solid but nothing beats the pork here. Definitely use siracha sauce if you like a little kick but trust me, even without it you would love it. If you have not tried the Chairman yet, find it and get some. You will not regret it.

Got the porkbelly and the braised pork. I wanted to like it, I really did. I wanted to say the best foods come from SF not NY but unfortunately this falls short. BOTH buns came out cold. The pork belly was dry, helped only by the daikon and fat. The braised pork was a bit tough and no hint of cola taste. Now the garnishes added nice colors and tasted good, so maybe I caught them on a bad day. But good food should alway be consistent. I'd try them again but I would not recommend them.

Brief statement: I've been eating at a decent amount of food trucks lately, and it seems that we are in the wave of trucks coming into the game to make the money, rather than the original wave of trucks that came into it because they couldn't afford to run a brick and mortar. I haven't been impressed with hardly any of the recent trucks and Chairman Bao is one of the only ones that I'm continuously impressed with. They're still pushing hard. Still consistently creating delicious food. Still creating massive lines no matter where they're parked. Good job, dudes.

With 500+ pics and almost 1000 reviews I thought, what the heck whats one more awesome review for these guys? I have experienced this truck more times than one should admit. ?Even worse is admitting that I dream of these little steamed goodies sometimes. Is there a 12-step program for them yet? I have only tried the steamed buns because the baked look really big and I like to have a variety of flavors instead of just one. Tender Pork Belly with Turmeric Pickled Daikon & Green Shiso: 5 Stars! Its always been cooked to perfection with the perfect amount of fatty goodness! ?The Daikon is tasty but watch your fingers they will be yellow if you pick them off your sandwich! (Lesson learned) Spicy Chicken with Toasted Sesame Pur¨¦e, Pickled Carrots-Cucumber & Cilantro: 5 stars. ?When it says 'spicy' it doesn't mean mouth on fire, but a subtle ting on your tongue. ?The sesame puree is what really makes this work! Crispy Miso Cured Tofu with Garlic-Tofu Mayo & Baby Choy Sum: Most times 5 stars. ?Once it was under cooked and a little too soggy ( that's one time out of 10) ?For anyone who says "I hate tofu" try this it will change your mind! ?The baby choy and that garlic mayo kill this bun! Coca-Cola Braised Pork with Savoy Cabbage & Preserved Yellow Mustard Seeds: 4 stars. ?This is not always on my order menu. ?The flavors together work great but sometimes the meat isn't as tasty as others so its a bit inconsistent for me. ?I have tried is several times and most likely will get again. ?In the last 5 times I have not ordered it however. Dont think about it, just order one of each and thank me with a compliment!!

A couple of months ago, I was able to try Off the Grid for the first time at Fort Mason. And on that day, I had the best bao of my life. It was a steamed Tender Pork Belly with Turmeric Pickled Daikon & Green Shiso. Simply amazing. One of my favorite meat pastries from anywhere in the world is a bao. And this particular bao was one of the most delightful things I have ever had in my mouth. Pure excellence.

Of all the food trucks here, the Chairman is the best bang for your buck. ?I started following the food truck trend when I worked in the city, but after trying out almost all, I realized that the food isn't that great and for the price, I'd rather go to a real sit down restaurant. ?When it comes to food trucks, I would recommend finger food like Bao, otherwise everything is kinda unsanitary and doesn't taste great consistently.

Stumbled upon this place at the Off the Grid food truck event in SF on Friday night! Apparently, this is a pretty popular truck in SF, so naturally...I had to try it! I was expecting the "bao" to be a completely enclosed bun, but instead, Chairman's baos are more like little sandwiches! One pork belly bao cost us $3.75 and it was as big as one of those small sandwiches you make at a Chinese restaurant when you order the Peking duck dish! They topped the pork belly with some crunchy daikon, which added a really nice texture to the bao. Overall, it was super good and fatty-tasting, but I don't know if it was worth the price or the wait. I would recommend checking it out if you like Chinese food, which I personally love!

Hands down the best food truck! The menu is very simple there are 4 options (1 chicken, 2 pork and 1 tofu) and each option comes in a steamed or a baked bun. Baked bun is the size of a burger and steamed bun is the size of a small taco. If you are really hungry you should get a baked and a steamed option. I got a coca-cola braised pork bun; the meat was very flavorful, the bun was delicious and there was a nice addition of mustard and mayo. The only downside is the long wait in line, because this place is popular!

Come, my fellow proletariat foodies, let us march on the steps of... whatever street it is, and fest on the meal of the glorious Chairman Truck. I mean, I don't know about you, but if there was a bread line for food trucks... I wouldn't mind the fall of capitalism one bit! Indeed, The Chairman truck takes political activism to another step and lets every want to be socialist enjoy a little bit of delicious food.... using a capitalistic model. Dear god, it's like buying a Che shirt - only so much more delicious. Okay, so it's a little hypocritical to buy something from this truck, but let's just put it out there - those steamed pork belly buns are something that I would topple a foolish imperialistic tyrant over. And yes, this truck, even though it is charging a little bit of a price for some amazing food, is General Mao approved. While some true blooded Americans would say it's better to be dead than red, I'd say it's better to be red so you can be fed. You have the option between baked and steamed. I will admit that the steamed bun is the only way to roll on this one. ?The pickled daikon that comes with is something else entirely. It's really good and I would have just chowed down on a hand full of that if I could. Lines when I arrived to the truck were non existent, though I hear this truck has a popular following to it. With how delicious those buns were, I could see why. And while I know we're not going to topple over the chains of capitalism any time soon, setting free the utopia of a socialist revolution, I can at least munch on these little delicious suckers. Truly a food fit for the working class!

Don't you know that two bellies are better than one? In this instance, the pork belly at Chairman Bao truck is better when it meets mine! The food here is amazing, given I have only eaten here twice. Both time at the Eat Real festival in Oakland, 2011 and 12. And I think that is probably why I think it is so good. It sort of become a tradition and treat for me. To think if I had access to Chairman Baa everyday. I don't think my stomach have the ability to stretch enough to fit like 10 baos a day. I really have no clue what the prices are because at Eat Real festivals, the prices are capped to around 5 bucks. But either way, it was very affordable and I left the truck with no complaints from my wallet or stomach. What I think makes the baos here so good, is balance! The meat is savory and juicy, the bao is a perfect vessel and what I think is the most important component, the pickles! Daikon, carrots, radishes, cucumbers, all of them cuts right through the fattiness of the meat and provide your mouth with the necessary crunch. Topping your baos off with siracha is a must! The spiciness adds a whole new dimension. I'll stop talking out of my butt and let you guys go try it for yourself!

I wish I was able to give The Chairman ten stars. I fell in love with the food last year when I experienced it at Off The Grid in San Francisco. ?Since then I have enjoyed and followed them all over the bay area. ?The decision was easy to make to have them cater a private event for us. I must share that not only was the food unbelievable, the truck was on time and ready. The staff was so friendly and accomodating that it made the rest of the stress of the night bearable. ?Thank you guys so much. Look for us to definitely use The Chairman again.

The Chairman needs another review like I need another ripple on my muffin top. Just kidding. (No, I'm not.) I'm hawt. (Really.) I've been a longtime fan of the Chairman and have eaten more-than-I-can-count pork belly buns at Off the Grid. I have friends who hate them. But me, I'm definitely a fan. Long line and all. I have the patience to stand in line for a pork belly bun or two. Other peeps, maybe not so much. Why? Because I've actually made them at home and know that waiting in line for those little pillows of porktastic-ness is worth every cent and every second of your life that you will never get back from waiting in line. Yes, I've attempted to make Momofuku's pork buns at home and holy smokes Batman, let me tell you, they are a labor of love (aka, in Anastasia lingo: they are a mutherphuckin' pain in the a$$!!) It took me FOUR PHUCKING HOURS from start to finish. Make the dough. Let in rise. Wait. And wait some more. Knead the dough. Let is rest. Let is rise again. Wait again. Blah. Blah. Blah. In the meantime, the pork belly needs to roast in the oven for a gazillion hours. Then you have to make the pickles and last but not least steam the little buggers. Oh, and did I mention assembling the damn things before they are chowed down at lightning speed. I might as well take up smoking or something if I want to knock off five years of my life in one day! As much as I love the Chairman's buns (moist and fluffy, yes they are.), sometimes I need a change from the same ol' same ol'. I have to admit the last couple times I've been to OTG, I've walked on passed the Chairman. Without a second glance. I've been tempted by something new. Thou shalt not speak its name, but it rhymes with MoJa (say that three times) -- the new long line in town. So kids, the next time you begrudgingly moan and groan about the Chairman line, just think of me slaving away in the kitchen for FOUR PHUCKING HOURS. And just be grateful it's not you having to make these buns. A 15-20 minute wait in line is not all that bad considering what goes into making those little pillows of porktastic-ness.

I officially feel like an idiot for missing out on these baos after seeing this truck countless times at the million street food festivals/food truck events I've attended! The line was just too daunting. Well, my friends, if you see this truck...I have four words for you: STAND IN THE LINE. No joke. I stood in (no) line thanks to the truck appearing at my workplace, and ordered a spicy chicken steamed bao and a miso-cured tofu steamed bao. Holly hell! WOWZA. Both were so, so flavorful, tender, juicy, and DELICIOUS. I just cannot give enough praise! I must say that I have no clue whether these steamed buns (there are also baked varieties that resemble a hamburger) represent the authentic Taiwanese version, but I personally don't care...they were THAT good. Helpful tips: - The steamed variety is like a mini taco, except wrapped in a steamed "bun." The filling is plentiful. - The baked "bun" resembles a hamburger and is roughly the size of one. Equally stuffed. - Two steamed buns or one baked bun makes for the perfect size lunch. - Siracha hot sauce is available and adds a nice kick if you like heat, but honestly, these goobers were good -- sauced up or not.

Looking at the list of the Eat Real 2012 vendors, there wasn't a "must try" for me... ?except for The Chairman! ?I've heard so much about it and couldn't wait to see if it would live up to the hype. ?We got to Eat Real at 10:30, did a walk around to scout out the food, and then promptly went to The Chairman at 10:45... ?when there was already a line! ?Thankfully the line wasn't very long since not so many folks were out eating yet and we only waited 15 minutes for our 5 spice pork belly bun and the Coca-cola braised pork bun with cabbage. ?We walked by the truck again around noon and the line was much longer, as I would have expected. The baos were awesome! ?We were pleased with the size of the buns and they looked delicious. ?The braised pork was nice and tender with a good amount of meat. ?But we liked the 5 spice pork belly even better. ?Very flavorful meat, nice and juicy and fatty, just as you'd expect pork belly to be! ?I hate pickled vegetables, but the daikon's taste wasn't too sour or overpowering and I liked how the flavors worked together. ?I'm not sure it's worth a 45 minute wait like some yelpers have had to experience, but I loved my Chairman experience and can't wait to have some more!

Delicious pork belly sandwich. The chairman came to Off the Grid in Berkeley this week and the tasty sounding dishes caught my attention. I wasn't too hungry, so I just got the pork belly sandwich which I thought was pretty good value for $6, especially compared to what is offered in other food trucks. The sweet Chinese bun and daikon worked perfectly with the crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, and deliciously fatty pork belly. It was simply scrumptious. I will keep an eye for The Chairman every Wednesday.

Excellent! I both love and loathe the days that the Chairman shows up to off the grid. ?Their pork belly bao's are so ridiculously good that I just want to eat a million of them. The nice, crispy crust on the meat pairs super well with the soft and tender middle. ?The tartness of the daikon radishes cuts the fattyness of the meat and creates a playful melody of flavor. Wow read that last line again, I am a d-bag. The lines get long as with any popular truck and prices are a bit high but man they're worth it. TL/DR - Good food.

Finally got to a Sacramento food festival early enough and were the third people in line. Ergo, finally got to try the Chairman. Course, the first guy in line had to go and order for like 30 people. People, don't be a jerk and abuse your position like that. It's obnoxious. Still, the wait wasn't as long as it was later in the day. We got 2 steamed bao - one pork and one pork belly, about $3 each. (You can also get baked buns, which are larger and around $6 but look like they could fill you up pretty good.) Both were delicious, but that pork belly was a little package of heaven. The pickled veg on top were the perfect compliment to the savory meat filling. This is a new favorite food truck for us!

Chairman is bomb! Pork Belly Sandwich is bomb! I don't usually like tofu, but their tofu is crispy, has great taste and once again, bomb! Never had pickled diakon, but guess what, bomb! especially with the flavors of the meats and the bread they use (steamed buns). Staff on the trucks are as friendly as can be. ?Shout out to Don!

The food truck experience. So many hits and misses right? Well the baked spicy chicken bun hit it on the big red dot for me at the San Jose Night Market: http://nightmrkt.com/ . I'm usually a healthy eater so it was a bit of a challenge staying away from red meat and pork, so I was about to let down my guard for the pork belly bun which everyone was raving about. At the last minute I realized there was a chicken option 3rd rows down on the menu. First I started off with a fork trying to peck and the 'fusionite' dish that looked so familiar yet foreign to me. Chicken was tender, the rich sesame dressing was not overly salty with just the right creaminess, the bun was soft and somewhat tasty. Eh... not bad. Then I realized, what a dumbass. It's in a bun, so put down the fork and go grab it with your hands! That's what I did. Put it all together and you get a really delicious Asian infused spicy chicken sandwich with sliced pickled carrots that really enhance the experience. $6 and it was worth every penny. Next time I'll grab this as well as the pork belly bun. The line was too long for me to go back that night, but I'll be back ANOTHER night! BTW I didn't see the bok choy version so they must have changed the ingredients, which is A-OK by me.

This is definitely one of my favorite food truck. I follow them around and try to go when they are nearby. I followed them to the Alamada antique fair this past weekend and a few weeks back, they were giving out free baos for one of the new start-ups at 3rd and market. ?What a fun idea to use the Chairman to promote new biz or birthday party. First time I went, I couldn't decide what i wanted so I ordered one of everything on the menu. The steamed buns a about $3.25 or so and the baked buns are about $6+. I can't remember. When the food is so good, I don't think about price. My two favorites are the steamed pork belly and the spicy chicken. I prefer the steamed to the bake, but they are all great. The steamed are smaller so order 2. The baked are like the size of a regular hamburger. You'll just need one, but for you hungry guys, you might want 4 steamed and 2 baked.

While on my way to AutoReturn after my car got stolen, there was a small episode of giddiness during that somber time, brought to me by Chairman Bao. I had only heard of this food truck as one of the better ones at Off the Grid, but when I went, I did not wait in that long line - how lucky that a few days after, I would run into the Chairman while on the way to the police station/AutoReturn! I ordered miso tofu and braised pork belly, and both were delicious. Personally, even though I'm a meat-lover, I thoroughly enjoyed the miso tofu baked bao. Such moist tofu and incredibly flavorful sauce...I don't think I've ever been happier eating a non-meat bun. Taking a bite of the baked pork belly, it was tasty as well - very good texture...although even though I'm Japanese, the takuan (pickled radish) they used sort of took away from the savory tenderness, which I would have been happy with. Of course, since it's a food truck, expect to pay as much for a regular meal for not as much food, but you're getting a unique taste and style from the Chairman! :)

I was talking so much shit about this truck the last time I was at OtG. "Why's there such a chubby ass line for a pork belly bun? That sounds disgusting." Yeah, not only did I eat that bun, but I also ate my words. My best basically forced me to take a bite of his baked pork belly bun and he said I would die over it. He wasn't kidding. I only had two bites of that scrumptious, crispy, almost sweet piece of heaven and I was fiendin for more. Too bad the lines are ridiculous. Otherwise, I would've bought 4 buns. Don't judge me. I will definitely come back for that bun. So sorry I doubted you, Chairman.

I still don't understand this food truck craze, but if one of these babies is close by and I am hungry, I'm willing to give it a try. ? They were out of the baked buns, so I got a steamed spicy chicken. ?It was small for $3.25, but tasty. ?The vegetables (pickles and carrots) were pickled asian style, and the meat was juicy. ?The bun ended up being soaked a bit with grease, which I assume is what made it spicy, which would be considered tasty for some people, but not for me.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this food truck. My favorite is their pork belly, both baked and steamed. But I might like their steamed one a bit more, The pork belly is nice and juicy and the daikon adds just enough flavor (and I love daikons too, hehe) I always wish I have room in my belly to eat more since they're so good. I'm always excited to stop by this food truck and I can't wait till the next time I spot them :)

I definitely know now why there is so much hype around this truck. ?They came to West Sacramento this weekend for trucktoberfest. ? It was really hot that day and it was probably about 95 ish??? ? Well I waited in line for about 10 min or so which felt like forever as I was sweating my ass off. ? The wait was well worth it as I got the spicy chicken with pickled carrots and cucumber I believe. ?The pickled veggies were done amazingly well and the chicken had a nice kick to it. ? The sandwich was $6.00 and well worth the amount. ? My only hesitation to giving them a 5 star is I'd like to try each food truck at least twice before giving them a 5 star review. ?So until then Chairman I will wait for you in SAC!

Chairman Bao rocks my socks! In July my bestie and I went to SF and on the way home she made me detour to Treasure Island to pick up a bun from this truck. I was stuffed so I didn't get anything and when she gave me a bite later I was kicking myself for not getting something. We decided to go to the SactoMoFo Trucktoberfest in West Sacramento saturday night and I was thrilled when I saw the Communist Panda set up next to the mainstage! I ran right over and ordered a baked Coca-Cola braised pork bun and a steamed spicy chicken bun. I knew the pork was good because that was what my friend got last time. I reaffirmed that it was delicious! The pork was super flavorful even just eaten by itself without the condiments or bread. The baked bun is super delicious on its own too. I really enjoyed the spicy chicken as well, especially with the abundance of pickled carrots and cucumbers, which are my favorite things about Vietnamese food. I would have prefered it on the baked bun, however, there is no way I could eat two baked buns. A baked and a steamed was just about the perfect amount as the steamed buns are about half the size of the baked (and about half the price). I love The Chairman, I need them to have a permanent truck in Sacramento!

Sorry to have to rhyme... but I think A Tribe Called Quest said it best: "Chairman of the board, the chief of affections... You got mine's to swing in your direction" Seriously, I'm a big Sriracha fan -- and filled up two little containers and hit the road back to the office with my three buns and hot sauce in hand. ?Barely used the Sriracha as the flavors were on their own pretty near perfect. ?Nicely done. ? Hopefully they'll have the duck next time as they were out or not doing it today. ?I'll be back either way!!

So what the bao is a bun? FREAKIN' DELICIOUS, that's what! This food truck frequents my workplace,and I couldn't be happier about that. Definitely try the Spicy Chicken Sandwich with a baked bun. My personal favorite is the Crispy Miso Cured Tofu Sandwich with steamed buns. Speaking of steamed buns, if you're going that route, be sure to order two sandwiches, or even three. Those things are TINY! Look for this truck in and around SF, and at Off the Grid. Enjoy!

SOOOOO GOOOOD! First visit, I tried 3 out of 4 steamed buns (all but the tofu) and they each tasted amazing. Each with their unique flavor to them. The only complaint I'd have is the price. The steamed buns aren't very big for $3.75 a piece, and adds up easily. Second time around I go a baked bun ($6.75) and a steamed bun ($3.75) if I remember right. Got more bang for your buck with the baked bun, and it was easier to eat. Definitely one of my favorite food trucks!

If only the lines weren't so long, but I can't fault them for having lot's of fans. The braised pork is my favorite, it's got some sweetness and spiciness and the vegetables are perfectly balanced with the meat. The steamed bun is good for what it is, but I don't like those things at all. I thought it was a bit overpriced for what it is, but not ridiculous. I think it's a must try and if the lines weren't always so long I might be tempted to get it more often, but to me the food while very good and an interesting change isn't worth the line. I can see how this would be an epic meal for some and for that I say it's at least worth one try, no matter what the lines. Hell it might change the way you look at food, it didn't for me but it was still pretty damn good.

Went to Off the Grid Friday night in SF. WOW!! Yes the line was super long, but it was so worth the wait. It takes a while to order your food (long lines), but they are quick to get your food out to you. We ordered the pork belly steamed bun thing. It was delicious!! The pork belly melted in my mouth and the bun was sticky and sweet... my mouth is watering right now. We also had the coco cola braised pork, it was good but nothing compared to the pork belly... I can't wait to visit again! The service is good, they are friendly and super fast.

My parents. The most finicky, hard-to-please human beings on the face of this earth. Never have I dared to introduce any man friend of mine to them, for my ego and his would surely be beaten to a infinitesimal pulp with their criticism. After meeting Chairman Bao post-work @ OTG Fort Mason, I started seeing him regularly but tried keeping our relationship on the DL. ?A few months passed before he made the venture into my hometown @ MVBLFST San Mateo. I knew it had to happen eventually. I got my baked pork belly and pep talked the box all the way home. How could anyone not love your meat, so crispy on the outside, yet tender and juicy on the inside? Who could resist dat crunchy daikon, or those big, fluffy buns? NOT EVEN my parents.

Everytime I hear or think about the Chariman truck, I always picture my friend Mary K. going OMG. Today I felt like the n00biest of the n00b at my first OTG in Alameda! I was so glad to get there at 11 am right when it opened and The Chairman already had a bit of a line, so I hopped right into it! It was a decent wait if you have the bingo app on your phone. Why did I feel like a n00b? I ordered two. Just two. Some guy 2 spaces in front of me ordered one and people made him sound crazy. There were people ordering 10-20 of them, and I've got to hand it to them, they work pretty fast for orders that crazy! The food is amazing, like many others, there is no way to describe the mixture of flavors. I knew the moment I Yelped Chairman Bao that I was a steamed bun kind of girl and my instincts did not let me down because the size and texture of the bun is perfect for the fillings they offer. I really appreciate all the flavors they have! Daikon with pork bely, mustard seeds and coke-a-cola braised pork. I'm SO ready to try more of them next time. Definitely not a n00b anymore, thanks Chairman Bao!

The preliminaries - the baked or the steamed? The baked is, as described on their menu: "A large Asian dinner roll-shaped bun, baked with a light sugar glaze for a golden brown crust and a fluffy center." That is accurate. The steamed bun is a steamed bun; a staple of China's venerable history, now ubiquitous due to several years of success at Momofuku. ? First, I wanted the duck - no duck this day; next, the tender pork belly with turmeric pickled daikon and green shiso (steamed bun); then, Coca-Cola braised pork with savoy cabbage and preserved yellow mustard seeds (baked bun); and finally, spicy chicken with toasted sesame pur¨¦e, pickled carrots-cucumber, and cilantro (baked bun). The long and short of it? Delicious is as delicious does; while I might quibble about occasional bites hewing toward too much sweetness, I will not do so today. However, once you've had an Asian-fusion bun of excellent quality (Mission Chinese used to), as far as the palate-memory knows (10 years ago at Momofuku), you've pretty much had them all - it is up to the imagination of the chef to distinguish his/her goodness from all the other goodness doing the same thing. Oft times simplicity is best, but man cannot live on one note (sweetened pickled veg), or one song (said veg with fill-in-the-blank Asian flavored protein), alone (on a Chinese bun). Eat here and you will be happy to hum; but I promise no tears of pleasure. I'll be back. Happily.

I ordered $60 dollars worth of food for me and 2 friends. ?We had the duck confit in steamed bun, pork belly in steamed bun, and Red Sesame Chicken with Scallion and Bok Choy on Baked Bun. ?Skip the pork belly please. ?Maybe my standards for pork belly is just too high but it really was a joke when I tasted it. ?Just dry, flat and the texture rubbery. ?WRONG! WRONG! WRONG! ?However, the duck confit is well worth the money and wait. ?I will go back for it. ?The Red Sesame Chicken and Boy Choy on baked bun is really innovative and fun to eat. ?It is spicy in a good way. ?I loved it! ?Two reasons why I will not go back again: ?Lady who gave me the food had major attitude and when I took the boxes of food back to the car, I found out they did not give me my complete order. ?No biggie but in this foodie mecca, thankfully I have plenty of restaurants and food trucks to spend my money.

Don't get me wrong, I like this truck well enough, and I'm definitely glad to try it, but I can't believe how expensive these are for what, by their own admission, is a snack food. Almost $7 for a mini pork belly sandwich is a pretty high price to pay from a food truck. The flavors are good, but not 5-star good. If the prices were more reasonable and the service more expedient, I would probably give this a 4-star rating. My favorite was the spicy chicken, and the tofu was also good. I was a little disappointed with the pork belly and would not get that again. My friend tried the braised pork and said it was his favorite, so that would also be a good choice. Duck was not available the day we went, so I can say nothing about that. On the whole, this place is worth trying when the line is short. With a long line, I say give it a pass, and try again another day.

First truck and last truck we hit up today at the Eat Real Fest! Seriously, the pork belly bun was blissful and the sesame chicken a slight notch below. The crunch and spiciness of the outside, tender goodness on the inside along with the tangy crunch of the daikon were an amazing combination on the pork belly bun. I was such a fan that came back and the the pork belly and sesame again but also tried the cola braised pork. Again all were excellent1 Definitely worth the wait and screw all you haters that talked smack about how long the line was. It wasn't that bad and if you don't want to stand in line, you don't have to so let everyone else that's waiting do so in peace.

OMFG. Think of any superlative to describe how good the Chairman Truck's baos are and they're still better. If you're reading this review, stop now, go to their twitter feed http://twitter.com/chair¡­ and go get some! The flavors in the pork belly, the Coca-cola braised pork and spicy chicken baos are simply beyond words. The meat is a fantastic combination of sweet and savory. The baos are moist from the fat but also from the other secret toppings that complement the meats and pickled veges to perfection. Who knew pickled daikon could taste so out-of-this-world good? Speaking of which, a bite into the sandwich, your mouth explodes with flavors it's never known, followed by your body leaving this world for that brief moment. The buns, whether steamed or baked, also work superbly with the meat and toppings. Eat the steamed bao that day (like you can wait) and the baked bao to save for later (if you even have that willpower - practically impossible). Thank you Chairman Truck. My mind has been blown.

Wowowow!! I've heard people talk about Chairman Bao at Off the Grid, and I never found any of the food at Off the Grid (N Berkeley) particularly great the last two times I went... but that's because the Chairman wasn't there!! The last time I ventured to Off the Grid, they were here... the line was long! (probably longer than any of the other lines) but so worth the wait! I got the baked pork belly (steamed one looked tiny and sad) and I would describe it as more of a burger than a ?bun... either way I've never had such delicious, flavorful, and tender pork belly. The picked daikon complements the pork belly really well and adds a bit of a crunch. Definitely recommended, and I'd come again. And $7 for this pork belly bao? Not bad at all!

I've been seeing so much hype about this truck and I finally got around to trying it today. I thought it was pretty good, but there were a couple mitigating factors.... First, the line is always super long. If you wait that long in line, you'd sort of expect that the food would be worth it. Second, the prices are high for what you get. The baked bun is $6.75 and is only a little bigger than like a slider you'd get at a bar. It doesn't really get you full, and I think it's too overpriced. I got the coca-cola braised pork in the baked bun. I really enjoyed it, but like I said earlier, I don't think it's worth the weight or the money and it doesn't fill you up. I'm glad I tried it, but I don't think I'll be coming back!

This was one of the rare times when I saw the Chairman Truck having no line. I took advantage because I might never get this opportunity again. Amongst my asian friends we would always scoff at the prices. "I could go to Chinatown and get an entire box for the same price!" I hoped my experience would be worth the cost. I ordered the baked bun with pork belly for $6.25. The food came pretty quick. It seems like they create in batches because everyone got their food at the same time. Impressive. I guess they do have a lot of practice. Opening my biodegradable compartment my sandwich-of-sorts looked a little small yet you could tell from the pork belly and perfectly golden bun that it was rich. I have to hand it to them. Their baked bun is awesome. It's incredibly soft and the golden crisp of the edges have a nice tooth to them. The pork belly is good although just a hair dry. They also put pickled daikon for crunch. I would have liked either more daikon or a more intense pickling. There's not enough acid to cut through the fat and richness. I think they put a sauce on it??? I couldn't really tell but they could have used some (more). So why the low star score? This is too rich for me! I took three bites and I was full. I microwaved it for lunch the next day (holds up really well in the microwave). It looked so small but after eating the rest of it my stomach was squealing. It's probably the bun and the pork fat doing high-fives with each other. ____ Going down it tastes great. But my stomach can't handle the grease and fat. It's almost like eating donuts with pork belly. If I get a chance I'll try the steamed buns yet I hope it doesn't kick me in the stomach. More daikon please.

BAO BAO BAO! Oh man, this was the first mobile food truck that struck me eye at Off The Grid - Alameda. ?My boyfriend and I had the tender pork belly and spicy chicken. ?We managed to get the last order since there were only 8 buns left. The only choice was steamed buns for $3.75 ea. It was a little pricey for a little taco looking Bao. Despite the price, the pork belly and spicy chicken was really tasty! The Tender Pork Belly was topped with pickled daikon (delish!). I couldn't help myself from picking off my boyfriend's food. Spicy Chicken was topped with pickled carrots & cucumber. I love the heat in it. I was a little bummed that it was so tiny though. The second time I had The Chairman Truck was at SactoMofo 5. Everything was the same and delicious. This time I had the option of baked bao (yum!!). For $2 more, the baked bao had more meat and a little bigger compared to the steamed bun. The only thing that made me "irked" was that the meat was whole pork belly, but when I had it at Off The Grid - Alameda, it was chopped and there was less. I'm assuming it's because they were running out of supplies during that time. Nevertheless, I'm overly satisfied. This will always be my "go to" food truck. Tasty & yummy!!

I'm giving them 4 stars on the strength of 1 menu item alone! I mean "out of this world, change my life good." I tried 3 of the 5 items because I wasn't too hungry at the time and I'm not typically a tofu fan. Also, they were out of duck by the time I ordered. Big regret. I should have fasted that day so I could have gone back for seconds. Anyway, I had the pork belly, the braised pork and the chicken all on steamed buns because they were sold out of the baked buns. All the reviewers raved about the baked buns but I wasn't disappointed with the steamed version which were soft, pillowy, melt in your mouth and yummy for my tummy. I will have to hunt the truck down another time and try to get there early enough to try the baked buns. I will even try the tofu since it has garnered so many positive reviews. As for the filling in the buns ... The braised pork and chicken were both delicious but nothing extraordinary. But the pork belly with the pickled daikon was a revelation. The freshly pickled diakon was refreshingly crisp and tangy. If only they could bottle and sell this without compromising quality. I would buy a case and snack on this straight from the jar. The pork belly had a perfectly fried crust and a succulent interior. It didn't taste greasy or fatty at all. Bar none the best pork belly I have ever tasted. And it was done in a food truck, not a sit-down restaurant! It was so good, I am still thinking about it 1 month after I ate it and I am forced to write a review to "express my feelings." It is very hard to find the holy grail of the culinary world, the perfect dish to satisfy all the senses. But The Chairman succeeds in a tiny kitchen on wheels. I have eaten in more traditional, fully-equipped restaurants with chefs that would give anything to accomplish this. I normally don't like jumping on the truck wagon but in this case, I agree with everyone. The Chairman Truck rocks.

I had a vivid hallucination that I should fast all day at work before attending, as I was slapped by the gnawing panic of possibly getting too full too quickly and not visiting enough trucks for variety. This plan worked wonders for me, as upon my arrival I was teetering on the verge of chewing my own tongue off for nourishment. ? Hapa SF: very quick line, 7 pieces of thumb-sized Lumpia Shanghai rolls, tender grounded pork, water chestnut, shredded carrot, served with sweet chili plum sauce. Magnolia: I had both a sippable IPA and later a dark Porter that was well hopped and was colored as between a medium-Oak and dark-Walnut in appearance. ?Very refreshing, the line looks intimidating but it moves rather quickly. Koja Kitchen: is centered in the ring of trucks, so they had a bit of a line. ?It was about a 20-30 minute wait-time, but with my IPA in hand from Magnolia it was easy-peasy-lemon-squeezy.. and their Tiramisu alone would've been well worth the wait. ?But of course the short ribs with chives over a bed criss-cross fries tasted amazing. ?I saw a couple eating the rice cake version which looked a bit difficult and messy, so we opted for the fries. The Chairman: the creamy clam chowder was the perfect choice to warm myself up with the dropping temperature.. all the Gua Bao steamed buns looked amazing as well, but I wouldn't have been able to take more than a bite of one. ?I already made a note to find this truck again, for the duck confit terrine with green papaya, and orange picked mint + onions. ?It sounds and looked amazing as it was being dished out to others ahead of me. ?This truck has coconut water! Fat Face: strawberry coconut popsicle was the perfect last note, and amount of natural sweetness to end this eating-spree on.. Especially on the walk back to the car, the subtle coconut flavor melds very well with the fragrance of the strawberry. All the food was great, inexpensive (most ~$5-7 range), sizeable portions (perfect for sharing), heavenly smells.. but be warned you will leave smelling char-broiled / post-camp fire.

Really good food truck. Advanced flavors for a simple sandwich. Line was super long on a hot day, almost making me give up, but I'm glad I held out. The Baked roast pork sandwich was great. Definitely coming back to try other options soon!

The steamed buns were good - I just think it's funny to say "steamed buns" :). ?Anyway, the pork belly and braised pork were very good. ?This time the truck was at Sacto MoFo in West Sac.

Oh food trucks, you all are the reason why I am always broke. I love the design and concept behind this truck.... kinda bummed that I didn't come up with the idea first. Nonetheless, on to the review! FOOD: 4 stars. ?I have tried the tender Pork Belly, Crispy Tofu, Coca Cola Pork, and the Spicy Chicken (basically all except for the Duck Confit). For some reason the Duck Confit Bao is always sold out when I go to the truck, I blame being responsible and attending class. All of the options (for the most part) are delicious and the combinations are just genius! ? -Crispy Miso Cured Tofu: MY FAVORITE! I am always on-and-off vegetarian, and this option is my go-to regardless of what kind of food-restrictions I have. ? -Tender Pork Belly: MY other FAVORITE! The tender pork belly is what I wished bacon tasted like and the daikon's slight acidity cuts the some of the fatty qualities that pork belly has. ? -Coca-Cola Braised Pork: It is like Asian carnitas. ? -Spicy Chicken: Even though this is my least favorite, it does not mean they taste bad...I just prefer others. The spice level is mild, so it is suitable for most taste palettes. ? For all the options, you can choose between baked or steamed buns; both have a soft & fluffy texture with a hint of sweetness. I recommend steamed, they are like....chubby tacos? PRICE: 4 stars. I feel so wrong thinking that The Chairman Truck is a tad overpriced since nothing on the menu is over $7. Steamed buns are $3.25- $3.75 and if I go food truck-ing on an empty stomach, I can't just order one... at least two... maybe three? These baos are no where near as inexpensive as a Chinese Bakery, but to some extent The Chairman's baos are worth it. Final Words: If you spot The Chairman Truck, do stop by and pick up a bao or two. I recommend the Crispy Tofu and/ or the Tender Pork Belly.

My fave buns here are the spicy chicken and cola braised pork; the pork belly buns are good but really incomparable to Momofuku in NYC. Yes, i know they're in NYC, but honestly, once you've had those, you'd be spoilt for life. Friendly service and if you catch them in Hayes Valley on Wednesdays, hardly any lines.

Pretty darn good if you ask me! This place sets a high standard for food trucks. They have a creative concept, tasty food, friendly service, and a cool lookin' truck (: I ordered the braised pork, pork belly, and spicy chicken, all steamed. Not paying attention to the pictures on the menu, or checking Yelp before hand (which is unheard of in my daily life), I was expecting a regular looking steamed bun like you get when you eat at a dim sum spot. My food came out and it looked more like an Asian taco .. Haha. Very interesting! All three had really good flavor, the buns were sweet, and the toppings just made everything extra yummy! They were pretty busy but the food still came out fast. They also take card, which is a huge plus since I never carry cash. It is a bit pricey, but I feel like that's a given since it's a food truck. Either way, I didn't mind since it tasted good. I will for sure come back again!

Chairman Bao's reputation precedes it. I've been wanting to try this truck for the longest time. Mr. G and I lined up at the OTG Alameda at 11am. There was already a line, but the wait was not too long. We got the steamed bun with the braised pork, pork belly, and spicy chicken. They came out hot and ready to be devoured. Sweet steamed bun on the outside, with hot spicy meat and yummy toppings on top. It was amazing. Gotta have more. They also take card, which makes paying so much easier.

Omg. If I could eat their pork belly buns everyday without turning into a little pork bun myself, I totally would! The pickled daikon on them is the perfect touch for the sweet and savory taste of the pork belly. I've tried chairman a few times and I'm never ever disappointed! The pulled pork with cabbage and mustard seeds is also another favorite of mine. The flavored are really strong, which is fantastic! Service is quick, people are friendly. I really want to just follow them around everyday.

Today marked my first time trying out the Chairman. I ordered a braised pork steamed bun w/ mustard seeds and cabbage. The meat was sweet, savory, and flawlessly cooked. The cabbage tasted very fresh and gave a pleasant crunch to the otherwise soft/savory bite. There was just enough of a mustard presence, which works well as the primary spice. The bun was smooth, soft, and a little sweet -- very good. My steamed pork bun ran me $3.75, which I find to be an appropriate price. I wish there was a little more meat tacked on, but maybe next time I'll get lucky. I also like how The Chairman sells 16oz cans of Tasco coconut juice for just $2. It's very refreshing and is a legit form of sustenance. Next time I'll come back for the pork belly :)

BAKED PORK BELLY BAO is soooooooo freaking GOOD. I've been wanting to try The Chairman for the longest time and I finally got to this past weekend while my boyfriend waited in line for KoJa Kitchen. Since we were both starving, I ordered the baked pork belly bao, steamed braised pork and steamed spicy chicken bao. Pork belly was hands down my favorite and totally worth it for $6.75. Like I've mentioned before, food truck food can get pretty pricey sometimes so I wasn't too surprised about the price. The pork belly was so tender and flavorful. The pork was chopped up in many pieces and there was so much that the meat kept falling off with every bite. A in my book for not being stingy on the meat! Spicy chicken was pretty good but didn't blow my mind. I couldn't really taste the spiciness of it which was a bummer. The steamed baos were warm and yummy though! There was a decent amount of meat on it but I'd rather pay another $3 for twice as much. The coca-cola braised pork steamed bao was delicious! The pork was braised, pulled and put into a tiny little steamed bun with lots of meat. I guess you can say I have low standards so I'm not disappointed in overhyped foods but I really liked the flavor in the pulled pork. It wasn't try at all. For my first bao experience, I left a happy, happy girl. I'm also glad that The Chairman is coming down to the South Bay more often so I could indulge in this pork goodness.

I've eaten here on several occasions in South San Francisco. Today, there were at the Soma StrEat Food Park. Yay! I already knew what I wanted and it's really hard to stray away from PERFECTION. So, I ordered 2 steamed pork belly buns - my fav! I added a nice squirt of sriraccha, and it just made the day. I crave those steamed buns all the time. My gf had the miso tofu stemed bun. I eat miso, tengjan and tofu all the time, so I didn't feel like getting one. She made it look sooo good. It also was quite a substantial meal for being tofu! I'm totally getting one next time. We can totally agree that this is SF's #1 food truck!

From what I am reading by other reviewers, it seems like your food is pretty good. It actually prompted me to try out your truck this afternoon. As a vegetarian, I'm always looking out for interesting eats and your Miso Tofu Bun really seemed intriguing. After a ?five block trek and a fifteen minute wait in line, my hopes were quickly dashed as you were "out of tofu". You're out of tofu at 1:00? No signage to warn the other hungry vegetarians? Time is money when you're on lunch break. You didn't get any of mine. I'll give you one extra star for offering to make me a bun with spare parts, but to be honest, I'm a spiteful prick and I'd rather give my money to someone else. Bring more tofu next time or change your name to Chairman No.

I went to the moveable feast event on a friday night in san jose. The spicy chicken baked bun ($6 at the time of this review) was nothing out of this world but it was delicious. Reminded me of korean spicy chicken. The daikon in it was just like any other daikon you would get from a japanese restaurant. The sauce in it looked like a mixture of the oil from the spicy part of the chicken mixed with some kind of white sauce, maybe mayo, maybe ranch, or something else. I feel you get a lot more meat and your money's worth with the baked bun, but since I did not get the tofu or pork belly baked bun, not really sure how it would compare. We also got the tofu steamed bun ($3.25). Tofu was not just tofu, it was a little crusted. ?Definitely different from what I expected. The pork belly steamed bun ($3.75) had a really good crust around the pork. It was also very tender and not the juiciest but still pretty good. Nothing to special about their buns. The baked buns are just like the bbq pork baked buns you can buy at any chinese deli. For the steamed buns, they are just like the buns used when eating peking duck. Service was fast and average friendliness. Lots of parking at the VTA parking lot surprisingly. Stars summary: Spicy Chicken baked bun: 4 stars (4.3 stars for the price) Tofu steamed bun: 3 stars Pork belly steamed bun: 3.5 stars Service: 3.5 stars Parking: 5 stars Overall food score: 3.6 stars =]] Definitely would come back here. Also my yelp rating is based on the food alone because if the food is good, i dont care about the service ;p and since this was an event, parking will vary depending on where the truck is. Recommend to bring your own water and hand sanitizer as these buns are pretty messy.

Pork belly steamed bun is a must try. A three-to-five bites bun. It melts in your mouth and even tastier with a touch of pickle. I would totally put it to the something to eat before you die list. Friendly service. I usually get it from SF Lunch box, 246 Ritch St. Only few minutes wait before you can start biting it. One, two, three... gone! Track this truck down, worth following.

Chairman goes to a lot of Moveable Feast events. The only time they don't have the longest line is if KoJa is there too. See if you can catch them somewhere else, though, like at The Willows, and you might have an opportunity to snag some of their duck.

I finally got to try Chairman Bao at Off the Grid in Berkeley. I wasn't really sure what to expect because none of the buns sounded appetizing to me when I was reading the menu. I ended up ordering the coca-cola braised pork steamed bun and was pleasantly surprised at how good it tasted. The meat and cabbage had so much flavor and complemented perfectly with the bun. The steamed buns aren't too big so if you're really hungry you should order two, OR you can under the baked bun which is bigger. I'm kind of sad that I didn't order their other buns, but I'll definitely have to come back and try the other options on their menu!

After hearing so much about the famous Chairman Bao Truck, I recently gave them a try at Edgewood Eats. ?Luckily when I got there, there was not a long line so I literally had to wait 2 minutes to order, Yeah Me! I decided on the Steamed version which is priced at either $3.25 or $3.75 depending on which one you order, they are the smallest ones so I thought this would be the best way to just get a tasting. First the Coca-Cola Braised Pork with Savoy Cabbage, Yellow Mustard Seeds & Kewpie Mayo ($3.75): I have to admit this one was just ok, now I personally make a killer Coca-Cola Ham, so their Coca-Cola Braised Pork was just blah to me. ?I was really hoping this wasn't what everyone was raving about! Than the Spicy Chicken with Toasted Sesame Puree, Pickled Carrots-Cucumber & Clantro ($3.25): ok, WOW, this redeemed The Chairman, I can eat these all day long. ?The spicy chicken was cooked perfectly and had a great flavor and all those pickled carrots and cucumbers, OMG, YES PLEASE! The bun was light and fluffy and with all the ingredients together was just excellent. ? Thank god for that 2nd Bun, because otherwise they would have only gotten 3 stars. Next time I'll have to try the other 2 options...Until next time Chairman.

Really really good. The only reason why i didnt give it a 5 stars are for the following reason. The lines are super long! but then again im so impatient sometimes and i cant blame the truck for that, but when i go to off the grid it makes me not want it as much because the line is super long. During peak hours the line would be close to 45- 60 mins long. Not to mention that your standing and waiting in the cold and have no where to sit after. It is more understanding when your in restaurant cause your in a restaurant. The pork belly is their best dish. Its about $4 each. Its the same portion size you would get at any Chinese restaurant, so i would need to eat about 4 of them to get full. So now im at a total of $16 with no drinks. Tip and drinks about $20. Kinda high for a food truck, but i wouldn't buy a steak for $50 from a food truck even if it was the same steak from "Mortons" With that said... I would recommend this place to ANYONE who loves good food. Would i go here all the time? If they had a restaurant front and i didnt have to wait an hour every time.

I'm so dumbfounded at all the rave reviews here that I'm almost afraid to be contrarian. I've tried this truck twice, and while the ingredients - especially the coca-cola braised pork - are tasty enough and fairly rich, you could do almost as well exploring your way through Asian bakeries, sandwich shops, and restaurants in suburban Asian strip malls or in urban Chinatowns. Lots of variety, reasonable freshness and quality, and far lower prices. With baked buns going for $6 or more (and more... and more... it seems, every time I see this truck), this is one expensive experience. They're really gussied-up sliders with decent-quality ingredients, a little Asian flair, and clever packaging in that they come from a funkily decorated truck with cute pandas. On their own, they merit 3-4 stars at most. For me, they weren't a satisfying experience either, unless you get 2 or 3 of the baked or steamed buns. All in all, super long waits, uncertain variety (they tend to sell out of certain items quickly), and a poor price/value proposition. If you're at a food truck festival like Moveable Feast or Off the Grid and plan on spending $10-12 anyway, you'll likely find better taste and value at other trucks if you compare their menus closely and look at what other people are eating.

Visited the Chairman Truck at the Fort Mason Off the Grid a couple weeks ago during my vacation. Off the Grid is quite the spectacle and the Chairman Truck is really the centerpiece of the whole event. I ordered a selection of their buns (2 baked and 2 steamed) not knowing exactly what I would be getting with that but excited to smaple their wares. Ended up with 2 of the pork belly (1 baked and 1 steamed) and 1 each of the chicken and the braised pork and quite satisfied. The steamed buns were everything I've grown to love in a steamed bun (tender, slightly sweet) and the baked buns really packed extra stuff inside (making the extra cost well worth it) and held up to the ingredients both texture wise and flavor wise. The pork belly in the buns was fantastic and all of the toppings were really tasty and matched each of the meats appropriately. The neon picked radish really cut through the richness of the pork belly and despite my general hatred of mayo, the Kewpie mayo on the braised pork really worked in the context of the mustard seeds and the cabbage. The chicken was really tender and probably my 2nd favorite after the pork belly buns. Highly recommended if you end up at one of the Off the Grid events or are lucky enough to grab the truck at another location!

I've waited in long lines for the Chairman Truck at Off the Grid several times. More and more recently they've been venturing to other food truck meets. Sometimes i'll catch them around Divisadero, most likely making their way to another spot. Each time i eat their food i have a different experience. The waiting time directly correlates to how much i enjoy the food hah. Steamed or Baked? Choose baked for the pork belly. Steamed for the tofu. Baked or steamed for the sesame chicken. Note the baked buns are much larger (and cost more too). Yum, pickled veggies. The tofu is surprisingly tasty! It doesn't sound as exciting when you put it on a menu with pork belly but it's crispy garlic tofu topped with miso greens is goood.

Just a bit of advice to those going to a food truck rally... DO NOT make Chairman Bao your first stop as you will be dissapointed by everything after. ? We decided to share a baked pork belly sandwich and it was heaven in my mouth. ?Perfectly seasoned, just enough pickled daikon, soft roll, what more can a girl ask for. ? Only con... had to share my other half as we planned on stopping by a few more trucks. My mouth melts as I type about the bun.

I have tried the Chairman Truck twice now and both times were scrumpdillyumptous! The lines can be long but they are worth the wait and if I happen to run into this truck again, I will wait again. I have tried the braised pork and the pork belly but the pork belly is by far the stand-out item for them. Both the baked and steamed buns are good but I feel like the steamed bun is a better base for really tasting all the goodness and flavor from the pork belly.

After years of waiting, I finally tried The Chairman. PORK BELLY on a baked bun is all you need to get. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. The baked bun costs more than the steamed bun, but it is OH so worth it. ?So is the wait. The line usually goes by pretty quickly.

After spotting the Chairman Truck driving by in Emeryville, I made a mental note almost immediately to check out this well decorated, avant garde food truck. Fate has it, we met again at Off the Grid Fort Mason San Francisco. We quickly learnt through our fellow yelpers t hat this is the bun place. True to that, this Taiwanese snack mutated food truck contains miso cured tofu with steamed buns that melt in your mouth, the baked buns are soft tasty and the pork belly! My friend didn't like pickles in general, so we picked up the pork belly and ate it solo. Delicious! Munch munch. Too bad we didn't have the path of fate to meet the duck, but hell to the yes, we will be back soon. Double shot : sweet potato thai tea fat face popsicle on the left hand and then chairman on the right. I feel I can take over the world.

I've only ever been to Treasure Island once and I just found out they have a monthly flea market. Seizing the opportunity to see the city from a new angle and possibly score some great gifts or desk toys, my girlfriend headed across the bridge for adventure. We didn't find any trinkets to buy, but The Chairman truck was present. I distinctly remember it being called Chairman Bao, but the must have offended somebody and changed their name as a result. Luckily, their buns haven't changed and I opted to try their famous pork belly bao. I really enjoyed the contrast between the pickled radish and savory pork belly, which while could have been a tad thicker, had great flavors. For $3.75, it was a small bite but surprisingly filling, and I think two would have actually filled me up. They relocate all the time but I'm glad I finally got to try their fare. I actually prefer baos to tacos so this really hit the spot. The event, and the usual truck spots, are pet friendly so be sure to bring your dog out to enjoy the day. I'm not a big food truck fan in general, but I'm sold on The Chairman. Food: 8/10 Service: 7/10 Price: $ Atmosphere: 7/10

The weather was beautiful today and perfect for taking a walk across the street to OTG at Civic Center to get my Friday lunch. ? Besides the cupcakes from Cupkates, I wanted to try something different, something that I have never eaten. ?I wasn't feeling the Hapa truck; they're okay, but it wasn't tickling my fancy at the time. ?Even though I like Southern Sandwiches, the line was long. ?The choices left were Seoul on Wheels and The Chairman Truck. ?Pacing back and forth between the two truck vendors, I decided on the latter. Steamed baos were $3.75 each, except the Crispy Tofu baos with baby bok choy and garlic mayo, $3.25 each. ?I ordered the pork belly bao and the crispy tofu bao for $7.00. ?I opened the container and looked at my savory goodies...hmmm...they seemed a bit small for the price and I asked myself - did I get my money's worth? ?Oh my, looks can be deceiving!!! ?I love them and I did get my money's worth!!! The steamed pork belly bao topped with pickled daikon and green shiso was delicious, quite filling and the pork belly itself was tender and tasty. ?However, for some strange reason it had hardly any fat on it. ?I guess the vendor must have taken one look at me and thought she got plenty of fat on her, and doesn't need the added fat on the pork belly...awww I feel so deprived not having to chew on some of that fat or some fat back...lol. ? ? Next up was the crispy tofu bao with the baby bok choy. ?Ooh wee (or oui), I inhaled it and wished I had bought another one. ?I have eaten miso soup, ma po tofu, stir fried green beans with tofu, deep fried tofu stuffed with ground pork, but I never had a crispy tofu bao and I never knew how great they taste. ?Better yet, never mind about getting a pork belly bao the next time, I'll settle for three steamed crispy tofu baos.

How can you go wrong with Pork Belly? The Chairman, formerly known as "Chairman Bao" truck, serves delicious pork bellies in steamed ($3.75) or baked ($6.75) buns. Tender pork bellies that's topped off with turmeric, pickled daikon and green shiso. The delightful combination is like Heaven & Earth wrapped in a cloud of soft, fluffy and pillowy buns. How about some Coca Cola braised pork with savory cabbage, yellow mustard seeds and Kewpie mayo? Hey, don't knock it till you try it. If that ain't your cup of tea, they also have spicy chicken with toasted sesame puree, pickled carrots, pickled cucumbers and cilantro. And for the vegans, they offer a crispy miso cured tofu with garlic-tofu mayo and baby choy sum. Prices for the chicken and tofu are $3.25 for steamed buns and $6.00 for the baked buns. But the Chairman's star is the Pork Belly that just oozes with delightful flavors that will make you crave like a meth addict willing to prostitute yourself just to get another hit. Yeah, they're that addictively good. The Chairman is a regular fixture at Off The Grid events all over the Bay Area, and it's often the star attraction at the Fort Mason location as they are usually positioned in the middle with the other trucks surrounding them like a cavalry protecting the herd. Whether you spot the big red truck with a logo of a Giant Panda wearing the Communist hat in the middle of an OTG event or parked on the streets of San Francisco, be sure to line up and get some buns. And a message to Eddie Huang: Giant Panda from the West will fart in your general direction, you douchebag!

Probably one of my favorite food trucks that I frequent at OTG Larkspur. Awesome looking food truck that serves up delicious food. I think the steamed clamshell "bao" (normally reserved for peiking duck) is an ingenious vessel for packing the flavor in. It's fluffy and chewy, without being mushy. It's slightly sweet and is soft enough to soak up all those residual oils and juices and sauces from the meat. Their pork belly is just ridiculous. Pork belly by itself is an insanely delicious cut. It is fatty, juicy, tender, crispy, basically every type of flavor/texture you could ever want. The Chairman heaps on generous chunks of pork belly and tops it off with some sweet/sour pickled daikon. It adds a nice visual touch, as well as a nice crunch and cooling bite to level out the richness of the pork belly. I also tried their coca-cola pork shoulder. It's flavorful and tender and almost reminded me of a fresher version of the dried pork sung that you find in chinese grocery stores. The mustard seeds on top are a nice touch. Still haven't tried their baked versions, but I'm sure they will be just as good.

This truck's portions are small for the price, that's for sure. But it's okay, Chairman Panda-Bear Guy. Size isn't everything. I was ravenously hungry when I stumbled across this truck in UN Plaza today, so threw myself on its tender, juicy mercies. I ordered a pork belly bun and a spicy chicken bun, and when I opened up the container I had the distinct impression that I was not going to be satisfied. But when I found a comfortable place to sit and got down to business, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the business was juicy, subtly spicy and with just the right amount of bite from the pickled vegetables. I love my big American portions, but sometimes you don't need to be full to be satisfied. So give the Chairman a shot, and I hope it's good for you too.

Oh man! Came across this truck of awesomeness at the SJ Taco Festival of Innovation. A few friends in the group I went with made a bee line towards this truck, saying it was the best. BAO, were they right! Sorry for the cheese, haha! Their offerings are kind of like peking duck, where it's a sandwich / taco of meat with the bao. ?A bao(zi), for those of you not familiar, is a type of chinese steamed bun or bread, usually white in color. We only got 3 baos (2 different ones), and they were all de.li.cious! The baos were fresh and fluffy, moist enough, and without a thick skin on the outside. The pork belly was super tender and tasty. There was a nice lining of fat along the pieces to add just enough of that heart clogging taste. The other bao we tried was the coca-cola (seriously) braised pork. I couldn't really taste the coke much, if at all, but it was good nonetheless. I didn't care much for the cabbage and mustard seed topping, but then again, I don't care for cabbage at all. The service was decent, the wait wasn't too long considering the amount of people in line, and the price was fairly reasonable. Not sure how much their baos normally are, but they were $2 a piece at the festival. Damnit...writing this review is making me drool with regret that we didn't get more of these baos of bliss. =).... TL/DR (ratings out of 5): 5.0 - Pork Belly 4.2 - Braised Pork 5.0 - Service 4.5 - Price

Mt favorite gourmet food truck so far. Great concept and great execution, at a very very reasonable price. The steamed buns comes at $3-$3.50 and the baked ones around $6. $10 will fill you up and a chance to taste all they ?have to offer. I personally like to go for the steam buns, just because I can get 3 for $10 and be totally satisfied. They really put effort into each ingredient, which totally shows in a seemingly small bun filled with just a few pieces of meat and veggies. The meat is marinated in wonderful juice, done to perfection. But I mean, how can do you go wrong with pork belly?! Still, it's good. The veggies that accompany the meat in the buns are no afterthought, they're also carefully seasoned to enhance the meat in the bun, making the whole thing a symphony in your mouth. So far I've had the pork belly (duh!), the pork braised in coke or something, and the tofu. Everything just melts in my mouth and tastes so good. Even the tofu was wonderful, given that it has to compete with pork belly in my mouth. Now I don't think they make their own "bao", steamed or baked, from scratch. They probably buy it from some chinese bakery. But no matter, it's the fact that when they put everything together, it tastes wonderful.

The Chairman is the reason why I like Food Trucks. Interesting and exciting. Served in a bun - baked, not in a bao like you find at Dim sum, with a nice big slab of pork belly along with the crunchy pickles. Delicious and memorable. Wait time? Less than a min. Yes.

I am now a fan and am following them on twitter, so when they are close to me, maybe within 100 miles or so, I can rush out to get my fatty fix. I never thought poky belly sounded good. Oh, how wrong I was. These tasty, fatty morsels are worth waiting in line to purchase. ?There were two pieces on my steamed bun. ?I offered one to L, she only wanted a taste; I am so happy that I got to eat them both.

My office manager inadvertently teased me again today about the fact that her and her husband were going to get Chairman Bao or perhaps her husband was going to go pick it up for her. "Would Ryan pick it up for me too and bring it to work?" was what went through my head, but that would've been kind of a bit much to ask. The catered crunch mode dinner tonight ended up being something pretty lackluster from Waiters on Wheels, so I grabbed John and Jon to go over to Curry Up Now. Lo and behold, I totally forgot that Off the Grid had started up again tonight and was right next to Curry Up Now AND the Chairman Bao truck was sitting front and center!!! What's better is that we got there early enough that there were no lines for anything!!! SO, I finally got to try Chairman Bao. Oh man. I am still salivating and wishing I'd gotten two more buns!!! OK. Ok. Let me back up. The girls working in the Chairman truck are super nice and friendly. They took my order and then had my meal in my hands no more than 5 minutes later. I got the pork belly bun and the braised pork bun (both steamed). The pork belly was very tender and flavorful and had some yummy pickled veggies on top in a light, fluffy bun. The braised pork was a little bit like Asian carnitas with some big chunks of dark crispy pork and ?a cabbage mixture on top. Both were insanely good!!! Chairman Bao is probably the best food truck I've eaten at in terms of food, friendliness, and service. These girls deserve to be superstars with this kind of business and I can't wait to try all the other buns next time they're in town!!

I went to edgewood eats on an rainy Tuesday night just for this truck that I had been hearing about for months now. ?How good can a bao really be??? it's just a bao...I've been eating it my entire life....then I saw the price...$6.50 for a freaking bao?? ?not off to a good start at all....it took a little while to get our order and drove home...I wanted to wait until I got home to try but but since it was raining (seriously California and rain?? I didn't move here for that!) ?I was stuck in traffic and couldn't help but to take a bite of it and then save the rest for when I got home....3 minutes later the whole thing was gone and I was mad I didn't get a second one.... Like others on here...definitely get the pork belly bao...it's worth the extra hour on a treadmill (or better yet the tennis courts)

I'm just going to file this under, "Things that go in my mouth". I have sultry, spicy dreams about the Chairman Truck. The Chairman brings his buns to my work place about once or twice a month and it's like Christmas morning when I see that sexy red beast pull into the front. The clouds part and the sun shines and the birds sing... It's wonderful. I love everything on their menu - even both the baked and the steamed buns but if I won a contest and could eat only one menu item every day for the rest of my life - I would pick the spicy chicken on a steamed bun. The only item I have yet to try, and it's just because I don't want to look like a total pig by ordering one of EVERYTHING each time, is the Tofu bun but I hear it's amazing. Last year, when I tried those spicy, saucy buns for the first time, they also had an amazing drink available - the Lyche slush and I still have dreams about it. They don't offer it anymore but I still ask every time I order and I've made some very suggestive suggestions on their Facebook page about it. I might have to write another 5 star review of the Chairman Truck, just so I can give it 10 stars!

The Chairman Truck was about two blocks from my work on a Friday, and we decided to check it out. ?We went at a good time and the line wasn't too long yet. I had tried them once at the JP Morgan Corporate Challenge, and I already knew what to get. ?I went with one pork belly and one braised pork bun. ?They have a good system going, and our food came out fast. Both buns were super good. ?The pork belly was so tender and tasty. ?Its melt in your mouth kind of good! ?The braised pork is definitely one to try as well. ?If I had to pick one and only one, the pork belly would be the winner. ?If you're really hungry, order the small steamed buns, so you can try the different meats. ? The Chairman Truck is definitely one to seek out and try!

This was my last stop at Eat Real Fest. I was quite full at that point, but I had wanted to try The Chairman for awhile so I thought 'might as well since I'm here.' The line was pretty long but I didn't really mind waiting as it gave me time to digest and make more room in my gluttonous stomach. I ordered the Pork Belly Bao. Meat was tender and plentiful, and the pickled daikon gave it some good contrast. $4/bao that day, a bit pricey considering the size of these, but that was expected at a food truck festival.

Oh. My. Goodness. This was the greatest choice I've made in a while! I've been a huge fan of food trucks, so I was very excited to see the corral at the Creator's Project this past weekend. Searching around for vegetarian options I found the crispy garlic tofu with miso greens and was intrigued. Standing in line I started speaking with the people around me who declared that the Chairman was probably the best truck there. I decided to go with the steamed option since it was smaller (and less expensive). It arrived within a few minutes and was the perfect temperature. I am almost positive it was love at first bite. Tofu hasn't always been my favorite, but they found the perfect way to prepare it. Seriously, it was phenomenal. I would rather not admit how quickly I devoured it. I will definitely be stalking The Chairman this summer...

This is one of my favorite food trucks. ?Whether it's the tender pork belly or the braised pork, I'll get two orders of it steamed or a larger baked glaze bun. ?If you're cold, try the clam chowder with bacon and mushrooms to warm you up. ?They are a bit expensive for the portions, but that is the price of the novelty of these Taiwanese good eats. ?

Finally had ?a chance to sample Chairman Bao when the truck was stationed in Off the Grid Haight last night where the lines were short. Known for their mini steamed buns, I just got one (so I could save room for other trucks). ?Went with the Coca-Cola Braised Pork with Savoy Cabbage, Yellow Mustard Seeds and Kewpie Mayo ($3.75). ?

So, I keep hearing all the rave about this place and decided to give it a try. They are in San Ramon on Wednesdays. the coca-cola pork is great; however, their service is horrible. The workers there are a tad snotty for me. And I agree with some of the people on here, they are a bit overpriced for what you get. Seems cheap at first, but after you discover it is gone in three bites, kinda not worth it.

Sweet baby Jesus! I think I could easily be persuaded to be vegetarian, until I come across something like the pork belly with pickled daikon in a steamed bun served out the window of a mobile kitchen! Vegetarianism can wait! I ordered the delicious pork belly in a steamed bun and a spicy chicken in a steamed bun. They are pretty small, like palm of your hand small. I think four at any one setting is reasonable. Fine, three would be more appropriate. I only ordered two this time around and it took everything I had not to walk back over there and order another...or ten. Both were tasty, but the pork belly was exceptional. The pork is so succulent, juicy, crispy, yet tender. It melts in your mouth and when paired with the pickled daikon it is a match made in gastro heaven! I understand the baked buns are more normal size, but I'm not sure I will ever be able to tear myself away from the light, airy steamed buns! They let the other ingredients shine. And by shine I mean explode in your mouth. I've been back and basically I have eaten their menu - well, the steamed bun options at least. The pork belly remains hands down the favorite, with the braised pork bun and the crispy tofu bun tying for second and the spicy chicken holding a solid 3rd. I did order 3 this time and it's a very filling lunch, but 2 just isn't enough. The steamed bun with pork belly and pickled daikon is one of the best things I have ever eaten on this earth. Not even joking. I strongly urge you to stalk this truck via its website, twitter or facebook and track it down. STAT.

I've heard mixed reviews on The Chairman Baos/Truck, so I finally had to try one for myself. A lot of people complain that it's not a traditional bao or that it's way pricey. While both may be true, I like to think of Chairman baos as fusion and a fun spin on an old classic. You have your choices between baked and steamed buns. The steamed buns are cheaper, but they're tiny. You've been warned! I ordered a Baked bun withPork belly and pickled daikon; it was super delicious. It's pricey, but you get a huge chunk of pork belly. I may look small, but I can eat and one baked bun was enough to fill me up. It was messy and I used up a handful of napkins! I really enjoyed the crisp contrast between the daikon and the pork belly. Mmmm, so good! Watch out for the dripping fat...lol.

LUV IT! the boa is wonderfully delicious all things considered. if they have tofu I get the tofu and it's beautiful on the tongue! Eating from trucks is great as long as there's not line and this truck has typically got a long one. No fun when you only have an hour for lunch. My coworker will buy about four buns but I can only do two. They always smile at me and that's a nice bonus.

Definitely better than all the other food trucks I've tried who come during lunch to the Brisbane/South San Francisco area. I had the baked pork belly and the steamed coca-cola marinated pork. Both were just yummy and packed to the gills with yummy goodness. Sure, at $6.75 for the baked bao and $3.75 for the steamed bao, it was a bit pricey...it's above average compared to the price/portion of most food trucks I've tried. At least The Chairman's food was delicious, good and filling...others, not so much. Will definitely have it for lunch again the next time they come around!

Out of all the reviews waiting for me to type, I feel wholeheartedly that The Chairman formerly known as "Chairman Bao" a) deserves 5 million stars and b) deserves to be my 900th review! Out of all the food truck meets I have been to, I have never tried Chairman because either the line for this truck is ridiculously long or because I have already spent way too much on other food items. I normally go to at least 2 if not 3 trucks because it is true, I am a fat penguin :( And here I was yesterday indulging when I know I shouldn't but it is ok since strict dieting starts tomorrow. Anyway, I saw a few I wanted to try but I was drawn to the red truck that The Chairman embodied. Moveable Feast Saratoga shuts down at 2pm every Saturday, we got there a little after 1:30 so the hype has surpassed. I got in line, excited that I was behind just 2 folks, excited to see a "We accept credit cards and debit cards" sign, and the menu which was easy to read and somehow made me want to order "the everything" but I held back and ordered 2 steamed buns: pork belly w/ turmeric daikon and the crispy tofu w/ something-something. I did not request for anything to be omitted though I am not a "vegetable" person but felt like trying the buns as is. You get in line, you order, you pay, you wait for your # to be called, and once you take your first bite you would not want to stop at 1. I am glad I got 2 but scolded silently to myself because I should have ordered more and I wanted to try the baked version bun. The steamed one is less in carbohydrates because it is a lot smaller and a lot cheaper than the baked ones. The baked buns is double the size of the steamed ones and double the price - I think it will be worth it. I will try the baked ones next time. An Asian hamburger.. cute. Anyway. I tried the pork belly first. I am shocked to see how everything was packed on 2 tiny albeit airy, soft, and delicious ass steamed buns. The turmeric daikon looked weird to me at first because I am strictly a "meats and potatoes" girl however, I ate the entire thing almost in 2 gigantic bites because it was that finger-lickin' yummy! I tackled the tofu one next and oh.. my.. cupcakes.. I would have said "yes" if the buns asked me to marry it. In short: a must. Mental Note: this will be requested when a) at my future wedding w/ a guy unlucky to end up w/ me because although I don't need fancy shmancy things, I eat as if I am a king and b) as part of my last meal.

Jeez-Louise, I had no idea there was a big brouhaha over the existence of this truck due to a vociferous charge of copyright infringement from an East Coast food truck owner who claimed the name of Chairman Bao for his own pork belly bun. I was wondering why this truck suddenly became The Chairman like the serene-looking but totally totalitarian panda in the logo was Sinatra or something. Truth be told, I really don't care about the political battles that caused the name change since I was excited to try the buns. Why, you may ask? Well, it's the first time I have had anything in these parts remind me of a menu item from David Chang's Momofuku operation, probably the best Southern-fried Asian fusion food I've ever had. It's obvious that's the inspiration for chef Eric Rudd's creations here since the steamed buns look like carbon copies of Chang's appetizers (see my photo from Momofuku Ssam Bar if you don't believe me - http://www.yelp.com/biz_¡­). The truck was parked at the Chevron station next to the 17th Street Plaza where I usually see the Cr¨¨me Brulee Truck. I got so excited I think I made a little penguin fin-clapping gesture and decided to try two of them. Hey, they're small, and I couldn't help myself. The steamed ones sounded healthier and at $3.75 a piece, were three bucks cheaper than their baked cousins. Both were in the poufy white-clamshell buns I recall so well from Momofuku. The first was stuffed with Coca-Cola-Braised Pork with Savoy Cabbage, Yellow Mustard Seeds and Kewpie Mayo. Delicious and about three bites in my famished condition. But I have to tell you my preference was the Tender Pork Belly with Tumeric-Pickled Daikon and Green Shiso (see photo). Pork belly is a can't-miss food item for me, especially when it's braised into a crispy texture making the crunch of the daikon a nice complement. I doubt if I'll ever try the spicy chicken or tofu variations because, well... what for? Pork is for the ages. FOOD - 4 stars...hey, if you're going to copy anyone, copy David Chang, I say AMBIANCE - 3 stars...gee, it's a truck, granted a cool one with a Communist panda logo SERVICE - 3 stars...you order, you wait, you pick it up, no big whoop TOTAL - 4 stars...pork belly for the proletariat...Mao would shed a tear

Was not super impressed with the pork belly bun. Also the beer battered ribs bun had way too much slaw on it. Really messy to eat while walking/standing. Coincidentally, is this the food truck that Eddie Huang complained about for taking the name from his dish? I should give this truck an extra star just for that.

Pork belly steamed and baked coca cola Baos, baos, baos, baos, baos! Since I couldn't decide between baked or steamed I got both. One pork belly steamed bun and a baked coca cola braised bun. Pork buns are always the best. The steamed bun tasted mellow and light. The flavors weren't too overwhelming. The daikon was a nice way to balance out the tender pork. The baked buns was similar to a burger like bun. The braised pork didn't have any coca cola flavor?? It was oozing with juices though. The baked buns are definitely a lot bigger than the steamed buns. The steamed buns are like a nice appetizer while the baked buns are more like an entree.

Checked out the Chairman Bao truck at SactoMofo 4, where they easily had one of longest (if not THE longest) lines at the event. Luckily the hour wait wasn't in vain. I got a steamed Coca-Cola braised pork bun and my friend got the baked pork belly bun... both of the buns were pretty killer, I understand why the Chairman truck is so popular. The reason I'm not giving 5 stars is the ridonkulous wait time, which was made worse by them forgetting my order. I asked them, after 10+ people behind me got their order, where mine was... they said my ticket was dropped on the floor so they weren't aware of it. Hustle them buns, yo, I'm hungry!!

I've eaten from this truck twice and it was awesome both times! What puts it over the top for me are the marinated veggies which are included in each bun, they're really flavorful, crunchy and go wonderfully with the flavor of the meat. I'm a creature of habit so both times I had the pork belly and the spicy chicken. The spicy chicken is good but I would not say amazing (although the marinated carrot is yummy), the pork belly is perfection! I've had both the steamed bun and the baked bun and liked each one. The baked is quite a bit larger than the steamed which I did not fully realize, I think next time two steamed buns or one baked bun will be a good portion size.

Beware of the pork buns...they are so good they may just break your mouth! ? The baked buns are just under $7 and worth every bite! A friend of mine always calls me when the truck is around the south bay and I find it almost impossible to say no. They have two pork buns and I can't figure out which one is better...it's like awesome and awesomer. ?They are both so different, but at the same time so similar...as in AWESOME similar. Try them, you won't regret them =) If you don't want the meat, just go somewhere else!!! :-P Happy Eating!

I had the pleasure of trying out The Chairman last Tuesday for the very first time @ a fundraiser at James Logan High School parking lot on a rainy night where 9 food trucks gathered from the Food Truck Mafia, who put this all together. I had just eaten a cheese steak sandwich from Grillaz, but had to make room for a steamed bun from the Chairman. I had seen The Chairman at various food truck events around the Bay Area, always with very long lines so I always passed them up, until now. It was raining that night so lines were very short and I jumped all over the opportunity to try The Chairman's tasty buns....no, no not those buns!, the Gua Bao, or a bun sandwich, a tasty traditional Taiwanese snack. My mouth immediately started to water when I spotted the Tender Pork Belly bun on the menu ?($3.75 steamed bun, $6.75 baked bun) I ordered one Tender Pork Belly steamed bun (with tumeric pickled daikon and green shiso) Other options include: -Coca-Cola braised pork with savory cabbage and preserved yellow mustard seeds -Spicy chicken with toasted sesame puree, pickled carrots, cucumber and cilantro -Crispy Miso cured tofu with garlic-tofu mayo and baby choy sum Can't wait to go back for more!

Found out that the truck was going to be in the alley behind my work today, and despite having brought my own perfectly serviceable lunch, I went for it - and I'm glad I did! That other lunch will be fine for tomorrow, today is Bao Day! Sure, the line looks a little intimidating, and you worry that it's going to take forever. Well, it may take a few minutes more than some truck with no one in line, but I still felt like the line moved swiftly and the buns came quickly. And oh boy were they great! I was told I had to try the pork belly, which by the name makes me a little skeptical, but it was honestly delicious. I trimmed a bit of the fat, which made me realize there was less than it seemed when I first peeked at it. And the sauce is the perfect blend of fat and amazing. They had four different bao available total, each one coming in both steamed and baked. None of the four failed to impress, even the tofu. I didn't think it could have much flavor, but it really did! A pleasing, savory miso-ness with a bit of sauce to highlight. There wasn't a one I didn't love. Well, now I'm even more excited to work in the Financial District - it means more access to the Chairman (Bao)!

AS SEEN ON CHECK, PLEASE!BAY AREA: ?http://blogs.kqed.org/ch¡­ ANOTHER TOFU & PORK WINNER! PORK BELLY BUN ?is ?#32 on 7x7 Big List 2012. ? However, I opted out to honor my self-commitment to observe a healthy diet and avoid eating meat as much as possible. And let me tell, eventhough I cannot write about the Pork Belly Bun, Chairman's TOFU BUNS are gggrrreeat! For a year now, I have been walking past the Chairman's eye-catching red truck and not giving him the time of the day thinking he was just another glorified ?bun on 4 wheels. In all reality this cute panda in Chairman's outfit is one of a kind and could only be found at Off the Grid. http://www.yelp.com/biz_¡­ And you will definitely most likely not find these buns with identity crisis but delicious nonetheless in your ?local Chinatown. ?You have a choice of STEAMED BUN: $3.25 http://www.yelp.com/biz_¡­ BAKED BUN $6 http://www.yelp.com/biz_¡­ WHAT I HAD: 1st Time: TOFU (BOTH STEAMED AND BAKED): ?Crispy semi-soft tofu steak with slightly spicy aioli sauce with a hint of garlic and bokchoy. ?The warm buns and pillow softness of the "crispy on the outside silky on the inside" tofu with a hint of garlic were comforting. ?So simple, so full of flavors, so yummy. Great texture and flavor! 2nd Time: STEAMED COCA-COLA BRAISED PORK: A moment of weakness made me eat this "forbidden" food. Forget about my BS about avoiding meat and trying to eat more healthy. However, I am happy to report that it was worth ?every bite and every morsel. This pork bun was close to divine! I got bits of some crispiness in this tender pork that was marinated in coke (the soda, not crack)--resulting in nicely-balanced sweet/savory flavors. I will break my diet again for this bun! http://www.yelp.com/biz_¡­ STEAMED VS BAKED: I ordered both the steamed and baked buns. ?They were both good in their own ways. ?The steamed warm tender bun follows the traditional Chinese bun while the baked bun looks more like a hamburger. I devoured both. I will most probably always get the tofu since I really try to eat healthy. I vowed to stop eating what Yelp tells me to eat but ?if you are a carnivore, the Chairman has plenty yummy for you to try: *MUSCOVY DUCK *PORK BELLY *RED SESAME CHICKEN CHECK: $9.25 for 1 steamed bun and 1 baked bun & ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?$7 for 2 steamed buns which were filling! VERDICT: I might be tempted to try the other ?meat options someday but the Tofu Buns are sure winners on The Chairman's menu. These hand-held meals are portable and convenient. I find $6 for the baked bun to be on the pricey side since the bread and tofu, although yummy, were airy and fluffy--not very filling despite the size. The steamed bun had more substance although smaller. Either way, they are both good and I will be back for more!

Just thinking about the Tender Pork Belly with pickled daikee makes me salivate. The pork belly is always cooked to perfection with crispy edges and tender inside. I see that some Yelpers have mentioned dry pork, this has never been the case for me. The baked bun is absolutely the way to go. It is messy, so get a few extra napkins!

Yep, I'm now happy that you make a weekly visit to San Carlos! ? Came here to grab some of your infamous Pork Belly buns! ?Of course, you made me wait 20 minutes until you were ready to take my order, but I've shrugged it off for the lunch meal! ? Mmm, the pork belly bun were great as usual, with the added sauce and the picked daikons. ? I tried your spicy chicken bun, but, for me at least, the chicken was a little dry, so it wasn't as inviting for me. ? However, I will be back soon to visit! And, I'll be wearing my Chairman t-shirt to represent the fact that 'I eat Chairman Bao'! ? Recommend!

I feel dirty for liking this. Dirty like a occupy protesting, Chrome messenger bag carrying, skinny jean wearing hipster. I drank the proverbial Kool Aid and hunted this truck down for months. Each time found it, the line was ridiculously long so I end up eating elsewhere... Fast forward a year later and I accidentally drive by the Off the Grid event in Marin. I've always wanted to go to an Off the Grid food truck event, but can't stand the thought of being in SF. Anywhooooo, I hit the brakes when I spotted the trucks from the corner of my eye and back my car up illegally. Run up the hill and find that I'm second in line (the stars and moon have finally aligned!) Thinking the little bao would be small, I ordered one of each AND a baked one. These suckers were HUGE! Very generous portions of protein and soft/fluffy/slightly sweet bao. The baked one is actually the size of a burger. Everything was prepared perfectly, great marinade, and very tender. The clear standout was the pork belly, but everything else was pretty good. Hands down the best value out of any food truck I've been to in the Bay Area. Score: Hipsters +1, Average Normal Jeans wearing person 0.

For the last few years, I feel like I've seen the Chairman Truck everywhere. Hell, I've even seen it driving along the freeway. I've put off trying out the food because every time I'd seen it at Off the Grid of any other major food truck meetup, the line was always ridiculously long. As a result, I've spent the last few years wondering if the bun there could really be worth a wait like that. Lucky for me, the truck's made an appearance at the last few Earthquakes games. While there has always been a line, it has never been nearly as crowded as I've seen it anywhere else. I've only really tried the steamed buns and for the pretty small buns, $4 is pretty expensive. They really aren't the most authentic buns I've tried either. I'm admittedly no expert, but it's nothing like the buns I've gotten anywhere else. That being said, the steamed buns are absolutely delicious. I've tried the braised pork, the chicken, and the pork belly buns by now and have been impressed by every single one of them. For their size, they are jam packed with flavor. My favorite was probably the braised pork. It made me wonder why it's taken me so long to try these buns out. Maybe one day I'll try the steamed buns, but at $8 a pop at Quakes games, they're kind of expensive. The only reason I give the truck a 3 rather than 4 star is that while it was delicious, it's not a truck that I would go out of my way or brave the long line for.

Chairman Bao's never fails to deliver. ? I spoke to the last chef awhile back when he was leaving & of course was a bit skeptical as how the quality of food would be after his departure. ? The truck was at The Creator's Project at Fort Mason, SF. ? If you have a large appetite, you'll have to order a few of the "bao's"; think dim sum but on a larger scale. ?Bun/Bao options: steamed or baked. I savored every moment of the: 1/2 of a steamed crispy garlic tofu with miso greens & 1/2 of a baked tender pork belly with pickled daikon The ingredients taste fresh and are true to their descriptions. ?When they say crispy they mean crispy, when they say pickled, they mean pickled. ? I could live off of Chairman Bao....

Went to the Treasure Island Flea and found the Chairman truck, the line was long and for good reason. My boyfriend and I ordered the pork belly bun and it was freaken DELICIOUS!

Went to moveable feast this weekend and the BF really wanted to try this truck out. I read the menu and wasn't feeling it so I decided to go elsewhere. He got this spicy chicken on a steamed bun that was delicious I was instantly jealous that I didn't get one myself and by the time I realized I wanted one the truck was closed :( Luckily my BF shared with me and I was able to enjoy this delicious creation.

Buns price right. $6.75 for Baked, it looks like a hamburger. $3.75 for Steamed, it looks like a soft taco. I was very suspicious and worry when I saw the truck today thinking should I go or should I stay driving, only because I remember one of my favorite Yelper gave 2 star for the truck. It was noon but almost no line, so I decided to stop by. I didn't know what to order but I saw the sign says that Bun and Steamed. I ordered both, waited about .... less than 10 minutes, I was preparing longer. I have to say, it was really good! I like them both, baked and steamed. I really like the idea mixed with Tender pork belly with Taku-an, pickled daikon Japo style. ?The Taku-an was a good choice, a bit sweet kind, not a bitter one. Its like, Finally China meets Japo kind of $hit and the $hit is good. I know that China and Japan had so much issue and still going on, but I believe we can get along. And the braised pork with savoy cabbage and mustard green seeds was good mix. I really like the texture of the heavy braised pork and crunchy fresh cabbage. But, whan I saw the Tender pork belly with baked bao, the Tender pork belly, dark and flappy, looked like an Asian penis, inside of ?the baked bao like an Asian v....... I can not say that. Also, Oh Fxxx Yes, don't forget the steamed bao is like a nice white v ..... ! I am not a panda fan, I always thought it a beat up polar bear, but this Chairman panda is good panda. Good job Chairman Panda, I'll go back.

The Chairman is my favorite food truck in the Bay Area, and I've tried a bunch of 'em. Their product is unique (to my knowledge of local food trucks), they basically do one thing - buns (or 2 if you count steamed vs baked) - in a few variations, and they do it really well. I'm not a vegetarian but some of my best friends are (seriously) so I appreciate that there is a tasty tofu option (although I'm not gonna lie - the pork & chicken are better, in my opinion). Also, their use of compostable packaging is highly appreciated by this environmentally concerned citizen. Thanks for regularly appearing in the South Bay, Chairman!

If you're into pork belly then you'll love The Chairman Truck If you're not into pork belly, well, you're lame I came across this truck while visiting the Off The Grid event at the Fort Mason Center. Their menu is quite small. They offer baked and steamed buns with your choice of meat filling. The night I visited the truck they had pork belly, tofu and red sesame chicken. They also had bags of fried wonton chips. My wife and I bought one steamed pork belly, one steamed red sesame chicken bun and a baked pork belly bun, which was more like a sandwich. We also got a bag of wanton chips. The steamed pork bun was fabulous. It was filled with tender, juicy, fatty pork belly, turmeric pickled Daikon and Green Shiso. The baked pork belly bun was filled with the same filling but it was not good because the baked bun was to doughy. The red sesame chicken bun was also good. The red sesame chicken was juicy and slightly spicy and was topped with pickled cucumbers and carrots. The chips were just OK, nothing special. The prices at this truck were a tad high seeing how small the portions are. The trucks employees were really friendly and got our order out extremely fast. If I ever come across this truck again while I'm visiting that bay I would definitely stop by and pick up another pork belly steamed bun.....or two......or five.

Had lunch today with the Chairman and it was DELICIOUS! I ordered the spicy chicken steamed bun, ate the whole thing and between bites said "this is what it's about!" My best friend said "what good food is about?" and I said "What it's ALL ABOUT!" The chicken was tender, spicy, flavorful! The bun was steamed to perfect! The perfect amount of doughiness! I wish I had gotten two buns but unfortunately I had wasted, WASTED!! part of my stomach on a stupid taco from another food truck (Twister Food Truck...you know you wanted you know) I will NEVER do that again! EVER! I'm gonna save my whole 'tumic for the chairman and I probably will fast so I can eat even more. It was so good.

When I think buns, I don't think of the Chairman....they're more like sandwiches to me. I'm a fan of the steamed little pockets of porky goodness, others prefer the baked. They're a little pricy for what you get, two steamed will be my lunch and will set me back $7ish, but the hungry could easily spend $10 or more. You can't go wrong with any, I've tried all the meat options and I always find myself going back to the porky options...mmm...pork belly and coca cola braised pork...mmm.. till next time!

Chairman Bao was soooo good! Both my boyfriend and I got the Pork Belly and Pickled Daikon Steamed bun at Off the Grid in North Berkeley and it was definitely the best food truck food I have ever tasted. The bun is perfectly soft and light, the pork belly is super tender and flavorful with just a little bit of crispiness to it and it is topped was delicious pickled daikon. The daikon really helps balance the bun out from the heaviness of the pork belly and leaves a refreshing taste in your mouth. My only regret was not ordering more! Next time an going to get the larger sized baked bun with the pork belly and try one of the other flavors of steamed buns, probably the tofu. If you are going to Off the Grid, I recommend that you go a little early, closer to when it opens, to beat the lines. The Chairman is definitely the most popular truck there! But even if there is a line, I can guarantee it will be worth the wait!

I like nice buns. Two visits to The Chairman Truck = 3 buns consummed, more to go! -Pork belly, Baked: Delicious! More bread/bun comes with this one, so it fills you up more than the steamed one. Had to eat the top part of my bun separately as it was a little big. Must eat it all together as the pork belly, pickled veg, sauce, and bun are a fantastic combo! -Pork belly, Steamed: Delicious! See above. Smaller sized bun. Will allow you to leave room for other tasty treats. -Coca-cola braised pork, Steamed: Good, but the accompanying veg/topping (forget what it is exactly) didn't quite hit the spot for me. Do not fear a long line - it moves fast!

One of my favorite food trucks and my go to place when they are at the Truck Stop. The lines are usually the longest for this truck but the wait is worth it. I definitely prefer the steamed buns over the baked bun (although larger, these are also more expensive). I recommend getting both the duck and pork belly steamed buns. The pickled vegetables included with both of these are a great compliment to the saltiness of the meats. I didn't think that either of the braised pork or crispy miso cured tofu buns were that great. I probably wouldn't order of these again. The flavors just aren't there and the tofu is not crispy enough. You'll probably need about 3 buns for a full lunch.

I'm going to be honest, I did not think standing in line for more than 20 minutes in line for some steamed buns with fancy meat/garnishes was going to be worth it especially for $3.75. OW BAO, BABY! I got the Pork Belly w/ Pickled Yellow Daikon and this simple combination was filled with contrast and flavor. I'm not a real fan of pork or fatty meats, but the pork belly was so tender and flavorful ... and was perfect with the tartness of the Daikon. Plus, how can you go wrong with their steamed buns?!

If the steamed pork belly buns at Momofuku Ssam Bar are the New York Yankees of the pork belly bun world - outsized reputation matched by outsized price tags - the pork belly at The Chairman is the Toronto Blue Jays - a perfectly respectable mid-market team suffering in a division with just too much competition. The pulled pork buns are, to torture this poor sports metaphor well beyond all reasonable limits, rather like the Toronto Argonauts* - not necessarily better, but fewer preconceptions to measure up to.

This was the first truck I hit up at the South Point Gourmet Food Truck Festival (11/5/11) in Las Vegas. I was smart enough to check out the menus of most of the trucks online before going there so i didn't have to waste time deciding what to try. The line was already about 30 people deep but from the looks of it, wait times were about the same for most other trucks. I spent about half an hour waiting in line to order and another 15 minutes or so to get my food -- not great, but not bad either. The best of the two steamed buns ordered was the pork belly bao ($3.75). Pork belly rarely disappoints and their rich and savory version was a winner. Coupled with the sour and acidic taste of the tumeric pickled daikon and green shiso, the flavors left me begging for more. Unfortunately, I ate the pork belly first. The braised pork bao ($3.75) with savoy cabbage and preserved yellow mustard seeds wasn't nearly as pleasing. The pork itself was excellent but I wasn't a fan of the other ingredients. I do have to commend them for the amount of food. While $3.75 for each bao is steep, they pack them with as much food as possible. Plenty of it will spill out as you bit into it, so grab a fork to make sure you can eat every last morsel.

Utmost food truck awesome-ness. Not only did it take Chinese fusion to a different level, it also introduces "gua bao", the white buns that we eat in Taiwan, to the masses in SF. (I'm sure there are other places that have it but definitely haven't seen it in a popular place like this). First off, all of their items are awesome, but you can only eat so much in a setting. If you want to try more, get the steamed buns -- they're like a slightly big taco and you can easily down 2, if not 3 in one go. The baked buns are a full-sized sandwich, so when you know which filling you like best, go for those. Do NOT pass on the pork belly. It's pure heavenly with the pickled daikons -- and I love that their daikons are not overly salty like the stuff they sell in Chinese markets. The daikons are crunchy, savory, and they're just the perfect match for the super savory pork belly. The coca-cola braised pork with mustard and cabbage is pretty good too, but they pale next to the pork belly. Don't get me wrong, it's still *really* good in food truck terms, but the pork belly just takes you straight to heaven. I still have yet to try the spicy chicken, but word is, it's good too. Heck, is there anything that's not good from this truck? If this truck passes through your neighbourhood, be sure to give it a try!!

The Chairman truck is hands down the best food truck in the Country. Buns are about $3-5 each and they have just 4-5 varieties of choices on their truck. If you have dietary restrictions like my partner in crime, ask at the window and they can change sauces for you to try and help out. They are always at Off the Grid and have one of the longest lines there and for good reason. The taste is awesome. Stuff I tried The pork belly - ?This is so good. They give you a couple of slices of pork in a steamed white bun and top it with this really good slaw. The pork melts in you mouth and you just want more. I think the next time I will try the Big bun to get more meat and a different flavor. I saw some others with the baked bun and it is hamburger sized. The Tofu - I'm not really a fan of vegetarian dishes but the tofu is really tasty. They crisp up the outside so it's hard to know that you weren't eating a vegetable based product. The pickled veggies on top really match with the flavor as well. Braised Pork - ?Close to pulled pork but it has an Asian twist. Really great as well, but not as good as the pork belly. In summary - If you only get one thing get the pork belly, it is phenomenal. Follow them on twitter and find out where they are going to be. They travel all over so they should hit your part of the bay sometime during the week.

Chairman Truck is slowly becoming my favorite food truck... even over Senor Sisig! (Sorry guys). I don't really know what a 'traditional' Chinese bun is, but I'm not really concerned about that. Very flavorful and not over ingredient-ed. Baked rolls are soft, just the way I like my rolls. One of the more unbelievable things is that its hella cheap. HELLA. One baked roll is good enough for a meal, but if you're feeling sassy, get a baked and a steamed. I've tried both the braised pork and the pork belly, I'll move on to the other items soon, which I'm sure are just as excellent. Kinda greasy... but what do you expect, you're eating shit like pork belly.

We each had two of the Steamed Buns at the Treasure Island Flea, where the Chairman Truck was parked. Both the Tender Pork Belly with Turmeric Pickled Daikon & Green Shiso and the Coca-Cola Braised Pork Butt with Savoy Cabbage & Preserved Yellow Mustard Seeds were excellent. The meat was super tender and flavorful, and the veggies were a great crisp and tangy contrast. My girlfriend had the Spicy Chicken with Toasted Sesame Pur¨¦e, Pickled Carrots-Cucumber & Cilantro which she thought was equally good. Two Buns and a drink make a very filling lunch, and a light eater could probably get by with just a bun and a side of some sort. I wish these guys came down to Fremont, because the food is awesome!

WHY HAVE I NOT TRIED YOU BEFORE?! I had my first Chairman bao roughly two weeks ago at the Garden City Moveable Feast.... We got there right before they opened.. and they already had a pretty long line! I knew I had to try it.. It MUST be worth the wait if people are willing to line up for it... I didn't know what to get.. but there was a gentleman behind me who told me that the pork belly was a must have... I mean.. I would have ordered it anyway.. but his suggestion just made me get more (to share--but I probably could have eaten them all)... I was not disappointed! It was very tasty! I also tried their other ones (all but tofu -- I think they only have 4 types?).. the pork belly is definitely my favorite! The steamed ones are $3.50 each... (a little pricey.. but TOTALLY worth it to try).. I haven't tried their baked yet... Oh, and although the line was long... it moved pretty quickly!

came across this food truck when walking around the soma street food park, what originally caught my eye was the cute girl that was taking the orders. Then i decided to walk by and take a look at what they have on there menu, let me tell you the spicy chicken is AMAZING!!!!!!! The bun was also perfect that they throw on some pickled carrots and pickles on the sandwich. I love food trucks and i have to say this place def jumped up into one of my favorites. I will defiantly be eating at this place again and hopefully soon!

I finally tracked the truck down! The pork belly was great! So was the cola braised pork and the chicken. I could eat 5 in one sitting, which brings me to why it is not 5 stars....kind of expensive. That's an expensive lunch out of a food truck which I need to now eat in my car. Don't get me wrong, I liked it but it won't be an every day treat given the price.

I feel that THE CHAIRMAN deserves a re-review so I can add that prestigious 5th star. I shared a pork belly bun a few months ago with a friend, but this time went with the Red Sesame Chicken on Baked Bao this go around. I loved loved loved the chicken! The roll is awesome as usual, but the veggies on this roll were more up my alley (carrots, cucumber and onion). The baked bun if far superior to the steamed one, in my opinion. Can't wait for the next time I see The Chairman... I'm all about the Red Sesame Chicken... 4.75 stars!

If you haven't noticed, you tend to pay a premium for gourmet food trucks. While Chairman Bao is not an exception here, it does favorably compare (price-wise) to what others provide for similar costs. A baked bun ($6) can easily be your lunch. It's hamburger-sized, and they're generous with the fillings. I gorged here. For $20-something, I bought - 2 steamed pork belly buns - 1 baked crispy tofu bun - 1 baked sesame red chicken bun - 1 baked pork shoulder bun I can see why the pork belly filling is the most popular, but it's not my favorite. The daikon pickles are fantastic on top, though. Crispy tofu was actually really good (I'm not that big on tofu, usually). But It had nice flavors and was substantial without being dense. The red chicken had carrot pickles (yum!) and had a healthy kick to it. If you like spicy food (it's not super spicy), I think you'd be happy with this. The pork shoulder was my favorite - I really like the slaw on top. Yum! I'd eat it again. I wouldn't gorge myself to the brink of reverse osmosis again, though. I like Chairman Bao's flirty modern attitude.

I've had the Pork Belly Steamed Bao, and I must say that was a couple of bites of perfection. ?The pork was tender and flavorful, and the pickled radish was a perfect complement. ?The bun was not soggy and was firm enough to hold it all together. ?I've always loved "quapaos" back home, and this to me is a awesome version of it. ?I would've given it 5 stars, but at $3.75 each, it held me back. ?Opportunity cost....is $3.75 worth two bites of yummyness????

Anyway... it's... amazing...... and doesn't need another 5-star review, but here it is anyway. Had the Pork Belly and Coca-Cola Pork. Both were great.

I saw this truck on either a food network show or on the cooking network and wanted to try something from here! ?My friend recommended the pork belly. ?When it came time to order, there were two different types of buns to order, either a baked bun, or a steamed bun. ?The baked bun was larger and more expensive and the steamed bun was smaller and cheaper. Since I wanted only a tasting, I opted for the steamed bun pork belly. ?The steamed bun was very soft and light and fluffy. ?The pork belly melted in my mouth. In terms of presentation, it did not look very pretty. ?They added a picked veggie of some sort which made the dish unappetizing. Thankfully it tasted a lot better than it looked.

(See pics) Review #1154. Food truck 3.6 stars. Okay buns but good flaky house made egg tart. The baked bun looked more like a burger bun and the pork belly tasted more like pork meat while I was expecting some crispy side of happy lard, though it's quite juicy. The steamed coca-cola braised pork bun, while not totally authentic, was on a fairly good dough but the meat was with too much cabbage and yellow mustard seeds and I was having trouble searching for the meat. But once found, it was pretty flavorful. They made their egg tarts too so I had to have some. The flaky custard was good lard-y delicious. The center was drowned in vanilla extract, unfortunately, even the texture was really good.

This truck frequents the SF area but it happened to be in the Motorola offices parking lot in Santa Clara one day. ?The line wasn't long at 11:45am but quickly picked up between noon to 12:30pm. ?If I were you, I would definitely beat the rush by feigning sickness to your boss to secure some edible treats. ?Otherwise, you'll wait 10-20 minutes as the 4 cooks inside fulfill all previous orders. The truck has two variations of each item. ?You can opt for a steamed bun which looks like a white pancake folded in two but stuffed with veggies and meat or you can order the baked bun which acts as a hamburger bun with the meat and veggies in between. ?An average person can be satisfied off one baked bun order or two steamed bun order. My personal favorite was the steamed bun Coca-Cola pork butt with lettuce and mustard seeds. ?The soda marinate gave the pork a sweet and tasty flavor and the mustard seeds gave it a weird taste in a good way. ?The pork belly bun was mediocre which may be due to either the quality of the pork or the skills of the cook. ?The chicken is .... chicken. ?It's good and healthier than the pork but definitely not as tasty. ?Don't get me wrong, it's still good but not orgasmic good as the Coca-Cola pork. ?The hidden gem is the tofu. ?The tofu had just the right consistency - not to firm and not too flimsy. ?With the sauce they added, the tofu is a formidable opponent to the Coca-Cola pork. I will definitely flag them down next time they are in the South bay.

Finally got some chairman bao! So happy. I ordered the baked braised pork with cabbage - pretty good. I loved the mustard seeds scattered about. The baked bun was also super good. We also got the pork belly on steamed bun - oh my freaking goodness! This was soo amazing. I loved the slab of pork belly - not too lean not too fat. The sauce was perfect and the pickled daikon went so well with it. Next time I'm getting this in baked form. Finally, got the spicy chicken; really spicy but may be indigestion inducing. I didn't enjoy this one as much as the porks...but it's definitely not bad. TL;DR get the pork belly, get it now! :)

Probably one of the hardest things to give up when I became a vegetarian was barbecue Peking duck with steamed buns, but Chairman Bao gives me an opportunity to revisit that. They didn't get lazy with the veggie bun, either; it was pretty creative considering what went into it. The overall sweet yet savory taste mimics that nostalgic (at least for me) barbecue duck flavor profile. Greatly appreciated.

One of our go-to spots at Off the Grid. There's always a line but we've never had to wait more than 5-10 minutes, and your food comes fast after ordering. My personal faves are the pork belly and tofu. Both are very flavorful and the steamed buns are just the right size.

Straight legit. Just when I began to loose faith in the food truck madness, Chairman Bao leads me on a path of unctiousness. ?Following a path laden with steamy buns and porky goodness. Yeah, ViTech is right. At three and three quarters its a bit steep for one porky bun. ?So do yourself a favor and get TWO because it just works out in the end. ?No, there is no discount if you get more. ?Just saying. So that's what I did. The first was the pork belly and the second the Coca-Cola marinated. ?Both with the steamed bun. ?You can choose baked, but wtf? ?A baked bun would really take away from the experience. ?This is what I mean. ?The steam buns fold nicely around the generous amount of meat and topping. ?You get the right amount of each. ?The topping is a slightly astringent pickle and parsley. ?Respectively each complimenting the pork belly and Coca-Cola meats. ?Both give a stunning presentation and contrast in flavors and textures. ?Put the same combo in a baked bun? ?Nah. Condiments? ?Siracha and thingy cups. ?But do yourself a favor. ?The flavor combinations stand on their own. If the meats are that good, I'm sure the tofu variant is probably just as good as well.

Baked buns, steamed buns, I love them both! This is currently my favorite gourmet mobile food truck in the Bay Area! Why you ask? Let me dive into several reasons why it is MY FAVORITE. A little background, The lines have always been long at Off The Grid SF and at other food truck gatherings throughout the Bay Area. I have tried to wait in those long lines but would give up after 30 minutes. Finally, at Moveable Feast San Jose a few weeks ago, I was finally able to try Chairman Bao and I was hooked. Everytime the truck makes a stop at Moveable Feast, I try to be one of the first in line to get their pillowy soft steamed buns with pork belly. The pork belly is tender and flavorful with slices of pickled yellow daikon. A simple concoction is combined into a highly addictive and hand held bun for on-the-go goodness. These buns are portable which make them a huge winner in my book. I can eat them easily while driving or walking through Downtown San Jose or SF. I can eat at least four but I typically purchase about two so I can be able to try other things at Moveable Feast. In addition, the staff is very friendly. I have had several conversations with the owners and staff and they work very hard to pump out lots of buns without sacrificing the quality of their food. The other bun fillings are very good as well but the pork belly takes the cake. Some other things to note, line up early because the lines for Chairman Bao can get long so either line up early or be patient. Also, Chairman Bao has just been voted as one of the Bay Area's top 5 food trucks by Zagat! Woohoo!

Funny thing is, we looked up Yelp reviews for this place while waiting in the long line to order. ?Two definite must tries... the steamed pork belly bun with pickled daikon, and the baked braised pork shoulder bun. OMG - I could eat 10 of the steamed pork belly buns, and then still try to shove in a couple more of the baked pork shoulder ones. The steamed buns are small - not traditional bun with the a stuffing. ?It's an open faced bun with toppings. ?The steamed buns are a little bigger, but same idea - open and stuffed.

My boyfriend brought home The Chairman's Pork Belly Steamed Bun for me to try when they were at Moveable Feast Willow Glen. I am not a fan of pork, but they did a really great job at cooking the pork belly to maintain it's tender fatty nature. The daikon pickles were really good. The steamed bun had a good taste, but sort of dense in texture. One problem with the pork belly steamed bun was that it needed some sort of sauce, if there was any... it was too mild. I could barely finish one bun because it tasted so fatty. A sweet soy sauce like they use for peking duck at chinese restaurants would have made my steam bun so much better. I really think they should consider adding this option. It would've knocked my socks off. Another problem was the lack of fresh veggies, perhaps cabbage or butter lettuce. There's a lot more potential for the pork bun, but overall it was a little bit of a disappointment.

Can't believe I haven't reviewed Chairman Bao. Or is it because they're now The Chairman? Doesn't quite have the same ring to it, sadly. Whether they did this to be PC or finally just caved to Baohaus NYC, they still serve a mean bao. After all, what's in a name? The same thing that's in the baos. Awesomeness. I always get one pork belly on steamed bun and one cola braised pork in steamed bun. Sets me back under $8. If Cupkates is around, I add that offense to my arteries as well. They're the only baos I know of (where you can just buy a bao... I don't want to have to eat a whole Peking duck) in SF.

Hey, look what I found at the Chevron Gas Station on Market Street and Castro: http://www.yelp.com/biz_¡­ The food truck is usually parked near the Civic Center for lunch. But I don't go to that area that often. Nevertheless, I finally found one of the hottest food trucks and businesses in the Bay Area. On my debut of the food truck and looking at the small menu posted on the side of truck where we place our order, there are only three choices of meat with a choice of baked or steamed buns. I chose the Braised Pork on a baked bun. For $6.75, I get shredded grilled pork with a scoop of marinated shredded savoy cabbage and a hint of mustard seed in a baked bun that is most commonly used in Chinese bakeries. The meat combine with vegetable and spice and the sweetness of the baked bun make this hefty sandwich very unique. I like the sandwich very much and I'm glad I found the truck. ? The food truck only accepts cash. The truck is primarily parked in front of City Hall during lunchtime. You can also follow the journey of the truck on Twitter and Facebook.

This place comes to my work about once a month, which I'm very thankful for. ?I actually waited in line for them for a full hour this week (they were a bit late setting up and a huge line had formed), that's how much I love their buns! ?They are super quick putting together your meal once you've ordered. ?Normally I'd take that as a bad sign, but their food is very fresh and perfectly prepared. ?They're just on top of it! Like pretty much everyone else says, you have to get the pork belly. ?Just do it. ?I didn't think I'd like it, as I'm normally not a fan of fatty meat but... yes. ?Wow. ?I've also had the spicy chicken a couple times, which is great too. ?The pickled veg they put on top (daikon for the pork belly and carrots/cucumber for the chicken) adds some great crunch and flavor balance.

Alright *sigh* full disclosure: I'm on this detox thing of no alcohol, no sweets & limiting my eating out thing (if I had a gf, she'd be very sad to hear that last part...I joke...my yelp homies know what I mean!) So, as a placeholder, I'm reviewing food trucks I've tried. I don't want to drop off the face of the Yelp just because I'm dining out less, so I'll just catch up on old-ish reviews. You guys don't mind, do ya?! So, everyone has seen the insane lines snaking around the red & yellow food truck known as Chairman Bao. Asians & Non Asians alike, waiting 30 minutes for those moist, tasty buns. It's a little odd for me (& probably for other Asians) to see the commotion because this is stuff we grew up eating. I'm glad it's getting its propers! Over the course of several OTGs, I've tried: -- steamed garlic tofu ($3.25): ?no surprise, my favorite bun is the veggie one. Crunchy, garlicky & very satisfying. went well with the fluffy, thick bun. -- steamed red sesame chicken my least favorite. Shredding chicken texture was not pleasing. Flavor was bland. -- steamed pork belly ($3.75) the bf held it out to me & commanded me to 'bite!' He knows how picky I am with meat, but he was right...not bad! Defeating the purpose of pork BELLY, I picked off the fat & the meaty part was good! - baked braised pork ($5.75): didn't love the baked bun, fell apart easily ?There are definitely better ones out there but the filling was great; didn't taste 'porky' at all & was very juicy & flavorful. Get in line with the rest of us & try what the Chairman is dishin' out.

Wait, what? ?I haven't reviewed Chairman Bao yet??? ?Must be because the mixture of drool and pork belly grease locked up my keyboard. Yeah, it's all true. You'll likely have to wait in a massive line for their incredible pork belly buns (I think steamed is a bit better than baked) and it's worth it. ?Anyone that's had Dong Po pork in Hong Zhou, China, will find the massive fatty layer deliciously familiar. ?Do it.

Pork belly, mmmmm don't mind if I do... DON'T MIND IF I DO! Friday night. Off the Grid. Sweet tangy daikon. A piece of pork belly. Soft sweet fluffy steamed bun. Definitely, don't mind if I do.

Being pregnant right now, I have a more specific taste for food and the pork belly buns really hit the spot for me! ?I prefer the baked one ($6.75) over the steamed one ($3.75) just because it is bigger, meaning more meat inside. ?The pickled daikon added the perfect crunch and sour taste to compliment the slight sweetness of the pork marinade. ?They did not add fatty pieces of pork. ?My coworker also enjoyed the spicy chicken buns. ?Just lost one star because I felt the steamed bun needed more substance inside (lacked meat and daikon). ?Overall rating - MUST TRY CHAIRMAN BAO! ?It's worth the wait in the long hot line at the San Carlos airport!

Uh oh, I think I might have found my favorite SF food truck... Chairman Bao is creative, flavorful, fast service, and worth every penny & second that you're waiting in line. Sure, it's a bit pricey for a tiny bao, but once you bite into that pork belly topped with fresh daikon nestled inside that soft bun, you'll wish you ordered another one. Both pork options are excellent and offer two very different flavors. Order the braised pork if you don't like the tanginess from the pork belly's daikon partner. Eating these bao's were the least guilty I've ever felt about eating pork. The other bao choices are also so good and have the best combination of flavors, even the tofu which is probably the only option for vegetarians/vegans (another reason why I'm glad I haven't converted to veggies. no offense.) The chicken is uber spicy so I probably wouldn't order it again but if you like that hot kick I'd recommend it. This is the type of food I'll crave for breakfast lunch dinner and after hours.

Awesome. If you see the chariman truck... just stop and get yourself a little pick me up. No, it's not authentic and no, it's not cheap... but it's delicious. I love the combo of the salty pork belly and the picked veggies. I might be a tad biased, since I love pork belly in any way/shape/form. When cooking pork belly, it can get mushy and fall apart but the one at chairman truck has a nice crisp to it. Just go try it. EDIT:: I hear there's a new owner? Gotta go retry to see if it's still as good as I remember.

This is one of my favorite food trucks in the bay area. Wherever they go, the line is always long. The good thing is, they've got their process down so it goes pretty quick. After you've placed your order, it normally takes less than 10 mins before they call your name. They normally have two styles of buns and 3-4 choices of filling. The steamed, open face buns are smaller. The baked, sweet buns are bigger and are about the size of a hamburger bun. The first time I tried their food, I made the mistake of thinking the baked buns were the same size as the steamed, so I ordered two... one was enough to fill me up. ?So far I've tried their spicy pork belly with picked daikon, the pulled pork shoulder with chopped veggies, and the sesame chicken with pickled carrots. My favorite is definitely the pork belly, but they were all good. I normally like trying different food trucks whenever they show up in masse, but it's sooo hard to pass on Chairman bao.

Pork belly steamed bun FTW. TOFU steamed bun FTW. Wow, after many times of visiting Chairman Bao, I finally decided to try a vegetarian option and the tofu is surprisingly good! The skin outside is lightly crisped to give it that texture you like. Each bun is about $4 so make sure you get at least 2. Totally a fan. I love how the truck is always on 2nd/Folsom or theLunchBox parking lot. WIN.

Review #100 w0000t! I've been wanting to try this truck for a while after hearing my buddy rave about the buns. What could be so great about these little buns?! I was able to catch the Chairman at MVBL Feast Garden City and there were only 4 people in line :) They had 4 different steamed buns on the menu so my fatass bought all 4 to see what the hype was about. ZOMGGG!!! SO GOOOOOOD!!! All of the buns come with different veggies(pickled?), all really fresh, crispy, and full of flavor. Goes perfect with the meats. Pork Belly- Melt in mouth pork belly, MUST TRY Coca Cola Braised Pork- ALSO melt in mouth pork with a nice touch of flavoring from the Cola Tofu- Not that big on tofu but I decided to try it anyways. Tofu was just, tofu but the veggies on top made it worth while Spicy Chicken- Chicken was tender, just a little bit on the dry side, really oily and messy, but still gave me a BAO-GASM For anybody that hasn't tried this yet, TRY IT. It WILL NOT dissapoint. PS: ILY Chairman XOXO

4.5 Stars Still my favorite food truck. ?Prices have been slowly creeping up (steamed buns are now at $3.75 from $2.95 a year ago) but it hits the spot. ? Definitely recommend the white steamed buns over the brown baked buns. ?Daikon pork belly is still the favorite but the other varieties are often good and creative. ? Chairman Bao is cash only, but will take credit card in a pinch.

I LOVE this food truck. The tender pork belly is simply amazing. Tender, tender, tender. They did go a little overboard on the radish, but that's a moot point. Simple fix: remove some. I ordered the baked bun this time, but next time, will definitely order the steamed one. I don't think the baked one was worth [almost] twice the price of the steamed ($3.75 vs $6.00). I'd definitely come back to this place again for lunch. Be warned: you might be standing in line for a long time during lunch hours (20 min+).

I've seen this truck at a few mobile food events but the line was always too long and I was always too hungry and impatient to wait in those lines. Lucky for me, I was with a group of people this time around for the food truck event in San Carlos and we all split up into different lines. I got my Nom Nom tacos and my gf waited in the longest line for the Chairman Truck. It took her 30 minutes to get our food but when it finally arrived, it was worth the wait. I got a Pork Belly Steamed Bun, which was filled with fatty pork meat, sauce and pickled yellow daikons. It was a perfect blend of texture and tastes. The baked buns looked good too but I always prefer the steamed ones. The bf will definitely love these buns and I can't wait until Saturday to get one with him at the Moveable Feast by our place. The Chairman Truck usually has the longest lines and now I know why.

this is about what i expect of food trucks now-a-days, fusion-y "weird" food filled with a lot of hype. at least with the chairman, the prices, at $3.75 for a steamed bun with pork/chicken/tofu and $6.75 for a bigger baked bun, aren't too bad. but in terms of taste, it was just mediocre and rather bland--the descriptions were more flavorful and robust than the actual food. and yes, they are small.

This place is pretty legit, if only for the braised pork belly bun. Wrapped in a large fluffy white bun, the pork belly's tenderness and flavor really stands out, without the addition of other items. I actually picked off all of the pickled daikon and ate it separately. I am amazed that the could charge $4 for a single bun, and that people were ordering them in multiples of five and more. I decided not to get caught up in the hype, and one was more than enough for me.

Chairmon Bao, you make me look forward to checking the Edgewood Eats Facebook Page religiously to see when you're going to bless me with another trip down the Peninsula so I can get in line and pay my moola to experience gastronomical heaven.

REALLY torn about how to review Chairman Bao. ?While I LOVE their innovative spin on classic Chinese baos, I just can't justify $3.75 for their teeny tiny baos. First off, when I read the descriptions, I was already drooling. Pork always catches my attention so I ordered a steamed bun with pork belly and pickled daikon and another with pulled pork. I was expecting something resembling a classic bao stuffed with pork yumminess. ?When I received it, I was baffled by what it was. ?The baos they used are like the ones you get with peking duck, little steamed buns big enough to put in a pinch of meat and maybe a bit of veggies. ?I was so disappointed, until I bit into it. ?Thus began the conflict. While I was disappointed with the size and shocked by the price, the taste transported me to porcine heaven. So, I tried Chairman Bao again, just to see if maybe I'd get over this indecisiveness. ?We had the pork belly again (since I'd been dreaming of it since I had it) and the sesame chicken with scallions. ?After two tries, I'm still on the fence. ? I still have dreams about the pork belly which turn into nightmares of not having enough cash when I finally get to the front of the line that I've been waiting in for an hour. AAGGHHH!!!!

When i normally think of bao or chinese buns, i think a tender bread ball filled with pork or custard, but this place takes it in a different inventive step of baking flat baos and filling them like a taco. ?Well it works! ?Very tasty! I ordered the chicken bao, and the warm soft fluffy bread was a great texture alternative to your standard taco tortilla, and the filling was tender and super flavorful with sort of an asian marinade on the chicken.

$3.75 for a steamed not even authentic Chinese style "bun" with meat and some pickled veggies inside? What is this, a cupcake? I must say, Chairman Bao gave me mixed feelings as I stand here staring at the remains of what was my $20 lunch (hey, I try to get everything in case I never get to go back again ...) which included the pork belly, the braised pork, their "new" spicy chicken and some vegetarian option. Although they are tasty and creative, they are by no means authentic. The ingredients are not used in any Chinese cooking involving the other ingredients in the same bun and these aren't even real "buns" since they are actually breading for peking duck or chicken - a traditional Beijing dish where you put the roast duck or chicken inside the sweet wedged bread sliced down the middle with some hoisin sauce and green onions. That aside, $3.75? really? That's quite pricey for something that doesn't blow me out of the waters or make me full on the first one. At least with a cupcake you're full of sugar and happily buzzing on high after. The steamed buns are not as tender, chewy and sweet as they could be and you can find this at almost any Chinese restaurant that serves Peking duck. The baked bun is almost $7!! Looks like a hamburger, is way too heavy on the bread to meat ratio (as in ... too much bread) and it isn't even soft and buttery like what you would find at a Dim Sum place. I'm not complaining that I got to try it out, of course, because now I know what it is and what the rave is ... but is it really worth it? Not if it's not around the corner and you can buy a lot tastier things with $20.

I finally had a chance to try Chairman Bao after food trucks started coming for SJ eats weekly on Saturday evenings in Downtown San Jose! Basically you have an option of having your bun steamed ($3.75) or baked ($6.25). The steamed bun most resembles the taste and size of a Peking duck bun while the baked bun resembles the taste of a baked BBQ pork bun that you get at Dim Sum and the size of a small burger bun. While the baked bun is heavier in terms of being greasy, it is much tastier and definitely more worth it for your money. I was told that the pork belly was the specialty and the most popular item so I opted for that. The pickled daikon paired with the meat inside the bun was a perfect pairing to offset the sweetness of the bun and saltiness of the meat. Tip: Sometimes they run out of the baked buns before the end of the night so even if you're thinking of trying other food trucks around, hop into Chairman Bao's line first to ensure that you'll get a baked bun because it's so much more worth it and tastier than a steamed one

The people who operate Chairman Bao are GENIUSES. ?Plain and simple. ?When I think of traditional pork buns, my mind travels to dim sum restaurants. ?This truck throws familiar out the door, and what results is a bao that's fresh, and new. ?Did I mention it's fresh? Baos are the specialty here, and they come in either steamed (around 4$) or baked (around 6$). ?Their pork belly is the priciest item on the menu coming out of your wallets at 6.75$ each, and is also the most talked/yelped about. ?They also offer other items, such as chicken. The pork belly bao is especially amazing. ?It melts and oozes deliciousness. ?The bao is comes with slices of pickled vegetable (pretty sure it's radish, sorry if I'm mistaken), which balances the sandwich with crunch and acidity. ?Be forewarned however, as your eating experience will be helped with a few napkins. NOTE: ?The line for Chairman Bao was virtually non-existent at OtG: 5M, as me and my friend went right when they opened. ?Even after leaving a little past noon, the lines still seemed decent.

I have eaten at The Chairman since it was Chairman Bao. I like the new less communist name. Every time I come through I get the steamed pork belly. The first time my lips touched this scrumptious meat I actually did a little dance. Unfortunately, much like crack cocaine ever time I come back the pork belly is a little less tasty. ?Was the first bite really the best? Will I ever get another perfect pork belly again? ?I hope so. ?I will keep trying like a pork belly junkie. They also sell cool black T-shirts now too.

WOW! My wife kidnapped me and took me to SF last Sunday to sample their food. This was definitely the best food I've ever had off of a truck. I had the larger baked bun with the Coca Cola marinate pulled pork with the mustard slaw. So moist and tasty and with all the other food I could only eat half of it. Four hours later it was still just as fantastic. I also tried the steamed one with the spicy chicken with pickled carrots on top and like it a lot but I enjoyed the pork more. I also had the steamed version of pork belly and that came with pickled daikon which was perfect with the richness of the belly. My wife who has had the pleasure of trying everything previously just had one steamed one with the moso glazed tofu and marinated bok choy. I wish the truck was in areas that I frequent but it was totally worth the trip across the Bay Bridge. Some of the best pork I've ever had. And one of the cutest trucks I've ever seen too.

Want to try something new and different? Then give Chairman Bao Bun a go... YUM! Definitely worth every penny, portions are decent and the flavor combinations are outstanding! My sister and I had the pork belly baked bun with daikon. OMG! lol... it made me just forget all my troubles that day... I was relaxed and just in the zone eating the sandwich. The pork belly was tasty! and the daikon added a nice crunch and tang. Combined all of that with the bun they use and well it was pretty amazing! My buddy had the red sesame chicken and pickled carrots, his looked amazing also but I was too distracted with my pork belly. Love this truck! Come to San Jose lol...or closer to San Jose. : D

Your truck is awesome and thank you for always greeting me with a smile and great service. ? I am a vegetarian and I absolutely love the veggie, tofu bun AH-MAY-ZING. ?The tofu is the perfect creamy texture inside and nice and crispy on the outside. Omg and the sauce, wow! ?I've tried both the steamed and baked and both are yummy. ?Although the baked is more filling. ? I've also heard the pork belly bun is the the BOMB! ?But, since I am vegetarian I can only go by what my carnivorous friends tell me. ?I highly recommend this truck!

Chairman Bao is a staple at Moveable Feast in Willow Glen and always has a 20 minute line to show how popular it is.... and deservedly so! ?The buns are amazing (get the buns your first time, not the sandwiches). ?My wife, who would never eat something with the word "belly" in it, devoured the pork belly bun like she was surrounded by a pack of hungry wolves. ?The food is simply amazing, blending a potpourri of different tastes and cultures into one bite.

My friend highly recommended Chairman Bao's buns during today's Moveable Feast in San Jose. We were there right before it opened and it was the only cart with a line forming already! I ordered the steamed red sesame chicken and steamed braised pork. Both were tasty!! I thought a steamed bun would be like an actual chao see bao-type bun, but it was more of a pocket bun. Nonetheless, I still enjoyed them. Braised pork was okay but I added some sriracha sauce which made it so much better. I liked the red sesame chicken more for its own kick of spiciness and delicious carrots on top. Each steamed bun was $3.75...overpriced, yes? I would like to try the baked bun one day but I wouldn't care if I didn't since it's $6.75 each. Chairman Bao is expensive but it's definitely worth a try!

Was lucky that this truck was in an alleyway on Mission/Fremont by my work. The line was manageable, so I decided to wait the 30 minutes. I also was lucky to snag the last baked bun. ?Got the braised pork baked bun (which is bigger than the steamed buns, hence the price difference) and the garlic tofu steamed bun. ?I really enjoyed the braised pork baked bun. ?Hearty, good portions, cabbage nicely pickled, and the pork not so "hitsukoi" or "too much flavor"; perfect. ?I added sri racha sauce to both and it was fantastic. Yum! Try it, at least to try it once.

Finally got a chance to try Chairman Bao during Off the Grid at Civic Center. They had a short line when I was there and I opted for the special - duck confit with papaya salad on a steamed bun for $4.50. The steamed buns are like the buns you get for Beijing/Peking duck, but larger. They're shaped sort of like a taco shell and are made of white flour and have a fluffy but sweet taste to it. Chairman Bao offers their menu on either steamed or baked buns with the steamed buns being around $4 and baked being around $6+. The special I ordered was only available on a steamed bun though. Now I have no idea what confit is but the duck confit was amazing! Imagine skinless duck meat that has been hand pulled and compressed into a dense rectangular patty topped with just the right amount of sweet sauce and papaya salad. It seemed like a tiny portion but the dense duck confit actually made it fairly filling. I definitely want to come back and try one of their baked buns.

I was debating on whether or not to eat out for dinner....and then I saw the Chairman truck and the decision was made. It was that easy. I wanted to get something small because I knew I was pretty full from coffee and I didn't want to have that insanely heavy feeling in my tummy. I wanted to try a new flavor as well. For those reasons, I chose to get a steamed chicken/toasted sesame puree/pickled carrots-cucumber and cilantro bun. The steamed buns aren't as great of a deal as the baked buns (not at all) but it's good for if you don't want to eat too much at once. Anyway, the chicken was good. I was worried that the toasted sesame puree would overpower the flavors and make me dislike it, but it complimented everything well. If anything, there was an overwhelming amount of heat, but that's probably because I went overboard with the sriracha. Great truck! Never disappoints.

CASH ONLY Chairman Bao made a trip out to San Mateo, so I decided to give them a try. I had the steamed pork belly w/daikon buns. The buns were so soft and the pork belly so succulent, that when I took a bite, it went well together,was not too salty either, the pickled daikon gave it that salt it needed. A little on the pricey side, but they are ok in my book.

My favorite truck in the whole wide world! A 7x7 sf big eats 2011 contender, and well deserved so. There's a reason why Chairman Bao's always has a crazy long line, yet I'm still willing to wait in it to get my BAO on! I've had the baked and steamed buns, but I prefer the steamed ones. That's not to say you shouldn't try all of them though. The baked buns look like burgers, with the same ingredients in it as the steamed ones. Yes, it's those steamed buns like what you get at a Chinese restaurnat with your duck. But the ingredients they put in it, it's just downright clever and delicious. MY FAVORITE: braised pork steamed bun. 2ND FAVORITE: TOFU steamed bun 3RD FAVORITE: Pork belly daikon bun - Yes, this is the one on the 7x7, it's pickled daikon with pork belly. A winning combo, but I still prefer the first 2 yummy ones. 4TH FAVORITE: Sesame Chicken bao - new on their menu, a bit spicy, but good flavor. The baked buns are about ~6-7 bucks, and steamed ones around ~3-4 bucks. For one person, sure a baked bun would satisfy you for lunch, but if it was up to me, I'd get a braised pork, and a tofu veggie bun. Those are soooo good. Trust me, i know what you're thinking. You're a meat lover, so am I. But man, that tofu is fried and is meaty already and the dressing they use on the veggies is just finger lickin' good. I sound like a Chairman Bao commercial, but really I just wish they will get some trucks runnin' ?on a usual basis in south bay. Or HECK, open a flagship store please! I've had them at Edgewood Eats, SJ Eats and Off the Grid Fort Mason. So keep a look out for the line ups at meets, because I highly recommend their amazing baos!

SO GOOD. People have told me they like the tofu bao even more than the pork, but I wouldn't know about that. I only know that the tofu is smoky, savory, and so flavorful, with just the right grilled crunch on the outside. The buns are used like little tortillas to form a "taco" and they're light and fluffy and just a tiny bit sweet. The bok choy and sauce topping is juuuuuust right. I ate two of these but I could have easily eaten twice as many. The service was friendly and the truck is decorated with fun swirls and a panda in the fashion of Chairman Mao. Great stuff!

I was so excited to hit up this food truck since it's from the city I used to live. I tried this food truck out at the Gourmet Food Truck Fest near South Point in Las Vegas. The line was long but was going by really quick. My sister and I checked out the menu and we are glad that we picked this truck. We tried all the buns out since they all sounded so good. The pork belly was our favorite out of the four we tried.

A little too overhyped for me unfortunately. But here's a helpful tip: Always get the Steamed version, never baked. Much more worth your money and much tastier. The best bun is the tender pork belly, hands down. The pork belly was melt in your mouth goodness. Only 3 stars for being ridiculously overpriced.

Since then, they have extended their reach into the East Bay. ?I've been able to get my Pork Belly Bao fix when they take a post at the Newark and City Beach events.

Went to OTG at Fort Mason, and this truck definitely had the longest line! I have been wanting to try out Chairman Bao for a long time now, so I was happy that the truck was there. I really wanted to try what a lot of yelpers recommended, like the duck confit with mango, ginger lychee lemonade.. etc.. But they had a limited selection by around 8pm at OTG. Still, we tried the braised pork and pork belly buns, and they were so good! The pork was buttery, and the veggies that they came with complimented each well. The only downside is that at $3.75 for a steamed bun (the smaller of your options, the baked bun is ~$7, and looks like a burger bun), the portion you get is tiny! But I guess it's worth it since they're so good.. I only wish that this truck would go to the OTG events in Berkeley so I could try their other buns and drinks..

Chairman bao has the perfect combination to make a revolutionary BAO. It's not prices my traditional Chinese mom would pay for a bao but I would because of how unique the flavors clash. It's not like our steamed buns from dim sum. They use sweet clam buns (the kind served with Peking duckskin appetizers at chinese restaurants). The lines are worth the wait. I'm just going to outright state the obvious that if it's your first time, get the pork belly. Bao Appetit!

PORK BELLY with PICKLED DAIKON = AMAZING!! pork belly is incredibly tender, moist, delicious. and the daikon is great! i'm not a huge fan of pickled things, but this one is def worth it. The bun is like a huge hamburger bun but buttered and toasted lightly. omgasm. I also got the DUCK bun thing, which was good too with shreds of daikon in a white tender moist bun. Pretty good too.

I have wanted to try Chairman Bao's buns for soooooo long. I love Chinese food, and I LOVE these buns. It brings me a nostalgic feeling of when I would go back to Asia and order these at half past midnight off those crowded busy night markets. Although there aren't pickled vegetables with fatty pork sprinkled with peanuts, Chairman Bao does a tasty Americanized version of these buns. Instead there's slow cooked pork topped with different pickled vegetables. I also thought it was very strange that the people in this truck actually resembled pandas. It's understandable for the lady who took my order because she had lots of black eyeliner and an orange panda-faced hat, but the guy who passed out the food looked very kung-fu panda-like.

Looking at the lines, one has to wonder how those buns are. After tasting a few, I realized that I've had this before - in any Chinese restaurant that has a decent buns dish. If you have to wait 5-10 min in line, it may be worth it. If it's longer, perhaps go to one of the many other trucks around or somewhere else. Don't get me wrong, the buns are tasty. All the fixings and sauces work well in balance to give you a very tasty [few] bites. Pork belly is good and tender, the duck is worth a try as well. But for me, I've had my fill. On to the next one.

After all the hype and missed opportunities, I finally snagged a Chairman Bao steamed Tender Pork Belly with Pickled Daikon during Off the Grid. Yes, it is tiny and you have to wait at anywhere from 5-15 minutes but this bad boy is worth the wait if you like fatty meat. The bun is just like the steam bun you get if you order peking duck but the pork belly just melts in your mouth. And the picked daikon pairs perfectly with it. I am just dreaming of the day I can go back and get more. Actually since I waited 10 minutes, I decided to get one of eat for a total of $14. The other steamed buns were okay, nothing spectacular and a little dry. Also, they were in such a rush they forgot to put the savory cabbage and preserved mustard seeds on my pulled pork steamed bun. Next time I will pass on the red sesame chicken with scallion and bok choy as well as the crispy garlic tofu with miso greens. I will probably try their baked bun next time. I want to know if taste outweighs the cost. What I recommend: Tender Pork Belly with Pickled Daikon (if you are fatty meat fan)

I ventured out to Palo Alto, especially for Chairman Bao. I was really looking forward to the spiced duck bun, but they didn't have any duck that day. They had the crispy garlic tofu with miso greens, red sesame chicken with scallions and bok choy, tender pork belly with pickled daikons, and braised pork belly with some sort of slaw. I ordered one of each (http://www.yelp.com/biz_¡­), for about $3.75 for each steamed bun. The baked bun was about $6, which I thought sounded a little overpriced so I didn't get it. I also prefer my buns steamed, not baked. I was very impressed with how delicious the buns tasted! The tender pork belly with pickled daikons (http://www.yelp.com/biz_¡­) and the crispy garlic tofu with miso greens were my favorites. The pork belly slices were predominantly fat, but that's what pork belly is all about. It was gluttonous, but oh so good! It was very well prepared and full of flavor. The pickled daikon was crisp and served as a perfect contrast to the jelly pork belly. The crispy garlic tofu with miso greens was very refreshing. The tofu was soft inside, crispy on the outside, and complemented very well with the miso greens. The lady who took my order was very nice. She wasn't pushy and allowed me time to decide on what I wanted--even if it was everything on the menu. I assume that everything is already prepped, so it didn't take them very long to put my order together. If Chairman Bao ever makes it out to your area, I recommend giving them a try!

The first time I had Chairman Bao, I wasn't too blown away by their food. ?While I found the Steamed Buns tasty, I thought their portions were small and overpriced which was a bit of a turn off for me. ?Since I usually give places more than one try, I decided to give them another chance when they stopped by Brisbane again. ?And this time I tried their Baked Bun. ?It's so much more worth it than the steamed buns. The Pulled Pork Baked Bun is huge! ?Take a look at the pic (http://www.yelp.com/user¡­), it's just as good as it looks! ?Loaded with Pork, it was delicious! ?Word of note, like a Burrito, after having one of these, it should keep you satisfied for a few hours. And because you have to order them when you visit Chairman Bao, I also ordered two Steamed Buns, one Pork Belly and one Red Sesame Chicken (http://www.yelp.com/user¡­). ?The Red Sesame Chicken had a nice sweet and spicy kick to them which I liked and the Pork Belly was amazing as usual. ?I think I was gypped the first time I had their Steamed Buns because the ones I had this time were loaded with meat! ?And yes, I had these with my Baked Bun. ?I'm such a pig!! So why the upgrade to only 4 stars and not 5? ?It basically comes down to pricing. ?While I believe that $6.75 for a Baked Bun is worth it, I'm still on the fence with paying $3.75 each for their Steamed Buns. ?Though now it's a little more understandable with the portions I had this time. ?They were like mini sandwiches. ?But now I'm convinced why people flock over to this truck at Off The Grid. ?Their stuff is really good!

Chairman Bao has an interesting concept of serving steam pork buns. they use an open bun, taco shell style. unfortunately it's a concept i'm not enamored of. is it evolved from the beijing duck ways of peeling a steam bun to get thin layers of wrapping buns to put the crispy duck skins in?.... buns filling options ("steam 3.25-3.75, baked 6 ish) -tender pork belly with daikon -brised pork with spicy cabbage & preserved mustard seeds -red sesame chicken with pickled cucumbes and spicy ? foodnotes: -tender pork belly has the most meat. best value. -interesting filling ideas, not wowed. -might try a duck to satisfy my duck fetish. -takes 5 minutes waiting to get bun after ordering.

I would definitely try this again!

I think this is, hands down, the best food truck I've ever come across. Every single bite was so good! The buns were soft and pillowy and have the perfect toppings. I heard about Chairman Bao just recently through friends, and was fortunate to find out that it was coming in to town at the SJ Moveable Feast. This was by far, the most popular truck there, as they were the only one with a real line, about 10 people deep! Luckily, wait was only about 10 minutes and the food was ready shortly after we placed our order. We decided to order one of everything! Steamed, of course. I loved steamed baos. The steamed baos are $3.75 and the baked baos, which look more like a huge hamburger bun, was going for $6.75. Duck confit - the green papaya and mint toppings complimented the duck confit perfectly. Red sesame chicken - generous portions of moist flavorful chicken with a small kick, loved the pickled carrot/cucumber mix. Great crunch! Pork belly - best part was that there wasn't too much fat! And the daikon, omg, the pickled daikon. Sweet, sour, crunchy. So good! Braised pork - very flavorful, but not too salty. The cabbage and mustard seed mix topping was savory and gave a good crunch. Crispy garlic tofu - the tofu was crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. The miso greens were light and refreshing. We definitely enjoyed them all and inhaled them in minutes! I was tempted to go for seconds, but I had to calm the piggy inside me down. They're cute little bao tacos! Easy to eat. Must try. Worth every penny. Really.

So are these buns worth at least a 20 min wait AND a hefty price of $3-7?..the answer is YES! ?(at least buy 1) I tried their steamed buns with pork belly and also the ones with chicken..these are TASTY! ?I've never tried anything like it. ?The pork belly had a couple pieces of meat and some daikon in it...and the vinegar really balanced out the heavy pork taste. ?My brother even liked this one and he doesnt even like daikon! ?I also had the spicy chicken one..this one is tasty too and if you're not a fan of spicy food..dont order it because it's pretty hot! ?I still have yet to try the baked buns...more to come once i try them!

My coworker told me how one of his friends waited 2 hours in line for Chairman Bao's, and it was totally worth the wait. ?I was kind of skeptical, but having already heard great things about this place, I was eager to try it out. ?Luckily, I only had to wait only 10-15 minutes to sample their goods. ?My conclusion: ?Chairman Bao's is worth a 10-15 minute wait at best. ?If I had to wait longer, I wouldn't. ? I tried all 3 buns: the pork belly, braised beef and the sesame chicken steamed buns. ?My favorite was the sesame chicken one. ?But, that doesn't really say much since I wouldn't care to eat it again. ?Also, for paying close to $12 dollars for 3 small buns, it really isn't a bargain. ?In my opinion, not worth the hype.

I absolutely love chairman bao!!! Tip: get the baked option over the steamed one. It's more worth it and alot bigger! Everytime I've had chairman bao I haven't been disappointed. I recently tried their red sesame chicken baked bao and it was so delicious. The chicken was seasoned nicely with the slaw and bao together it was so good. My usual is the pork belly bao which has succulent, fatty pork that is cooked to perfection and slightly crispy. It's so good it almost Made me think that it was crispy duck. Yum. Will def be back for more. Generally I havent had to wait too long for the bao. Usually about 10 mins but then again I go to the otg at the civic center. Love it! :)

I'm glad that access to Chairman Bao isn't readily accessible...I'm pretty sure that I would be chowing down on buns way more than the surgeon general would recommend! By far, my favorite is the pork belly on the baked bun. The Chairman has me hooked people! I know there are a lot of complaints about the cost - $6 for the baked bun sammy...I have no problem paying this! There's something about the taste of the tender slabs of grilled pork belly, the pickled daikon and the tasty baked bun. So delicious! I've tried every combo they make, and I still go back to the pork belly. The steamed buns are tasty too, but I still prefer the baked babies. If you're at Off the Grid, they usually have a ridiculously long line AND they tend to run out fast. Make it your first stop ;)

Hmm.. Probably no better than 3 stars. Nothing here really wow'ed me. I tried the baked bun with the pork belly, and also had the steamed bun with the braised pork. The baked bun was sweet and fluffy, but that sweetness overpowered any flavor that the pork belly had. The belly itself wasn't super-tender like the ones in the buns at Momofuku in NYC, either. It just didn't have that melt-in-my-mouth texture. Flavor-wise, it was also lacking... The braised pork with mustard seeds on it had a bit more character, but it's not like it left a lasting impression. Wait, I just had it a few hours ago, but I already kind of forgot what it tasted like. So what's with all the hype? I mean.. it's just a BUNch of buns! .....See what I did there?

These bao buns were oh-so-good! I bought 3 baos from their menu at Off the Grid. I was lucky enough to only have to wait 45 minutes in line to get some of their bao! I was unlucky on the part where they had run out of half the items they started out with by the time I got to ordering! Daikon pork belly on steamed buns were delish! Tofu was also yummy! Braised pork was also very good! These buns melted in my mouth so, 45 minutes in line is the most I'd tolerate for a bite of these buns. Not a fan of lines but these buns were yummy.

Every time I tell my friends about food trucks, this is one I *always* mention and strongly suggest that they must try. I have eaten their Pork Belly, Braised Pork, and Red Sesame Chicken in their steamed and baked forms. My favorite is the Pork Belly, as it is the perfect combination of flavors that fit into a fluffy bun. I prefer the steamed bun, because I feel that the sweetness of the baked bun takes away from the delicious savory filling. The price is a tad high for the amount of food you get, but it's not expensive considering the quality of food and its comparison to food trucks in general. I think it's worth the money (but for the steamed instead of baked buns, heh heh). p.s. one might think these buns are like the ones you find at dim sum restaurants which are filled prior to steaming/baking. Instead, these are more like a sandwich and stuffed to order.

TOTAL PORK BELLY REDEMPTION... Just one bite of the "New" Pork Belly Bun moved Chairman Bao from the bottom to the TOP of my list of food truck favorites! After my most disappointing food truck experience last August with Chairman Bao, I swore I would NEVER return. However, when I was in Vegas two months ago for a Bachelorette Party, my gf told me our mutual friend took over Chairman Bao. Although hesitant, I was longing to do a re-do and last Friday's (4.8.11) OTG - Civic Center gave me the perfect opportunity to do so as the lines are much shorter. My colleagues and I got in line at around 11:35 AM (opens at 11:30 AM) with 7-8 people in front and we had our buns in tote in about 8 minutes. I got the Steamed Pork Belly Bun w/ Pickled Daikon ($3.75) and was BLOWN AWAYYYYYYY! I couldn't get the picture I wanted because I was getting funny stares as I often do, so this pic does NOT do the Pork Belly Bun justice. http://www.yelp.com/biz_¡­ Nestled between a soft and fluffy steamed white bun was a thick slice of seared pork belly. The pork belly was crisp and as I bit into it, all the savory juices burst into my mouth. It was JUICY, SUCCULENT and lightly drizzled with hoisin sauce for that hint of salty sweetness. The pickled daikon's acidity complemented the pork belly by helping to balance the richness of it. After devouring the Pork Belly Bun I wanted more and didn't even feel like eating my Katsu Curry from JapaCurry anymore. Hands down, it was the BEST pork belly and BEST rendition of a Chinese steamed bun I've ever had!!! As soon as I got back to the office, I text my friend to let her know about my re-do of Chairman Bao and she told me our mutual friend had been braising the pork belly till 5 AM that morning--talk about dedication! The Pork Belly Bun I had was NOTHING like my experience with Chairman Bao last year so itching for more info, I sent the new owner a message. He told me that he revamped the recipes along with a new steamed bun and made sure that extra care is taken when preparing these buns which truly shows in the execution and taste of the mouth-watering bun. As someone who is a harsh critic of Asian Fusion Fare (because flavors are often watered down), Chairman Bao's Pork Belly Bun totally WON me over! For those of you that had a disappointing experience with Chairman Bao before, I urge you to try it ONE more time. I *pinky swear* that you will NOT be disappointed with the Pork Belly Bun although your doctor may be when he/she sees your cholesterol levels just like how mine will be...

Off the Grid- Fort Mason Center When I arrived at Off the Grid, I made my way to this truck first. I've wanted to try Chairman Bao when it came to Sacramento but I missed my opportunity due to long lines at Sacto MoFo. Tender Pork Belly with Pickled Daikon (Steamed Bun): The fatty pieces of tender pork belly melt in your mouth while the pickled daikon added a tangy crunch. The steamed buns were soft and fluffy. It definitely lived up to my expectations!

The whole concept of trucks is so unique to the bay area. It seems there are hundreds of these running around and I'm not sure why, but I always associate them with cheap, good food. The good part is correct, the cheap part isn't. On one of my days off, I was craving for a couple of these. Granted I'd never had them before, but god the pictures and descriptions were tantalizing enough. Plus given the innumerable delicious options in SF I've rarely found the need to repeat any visit to any restaurant, barring a couple (mainly due to proximity to my place). So, I got on twitter, stalked Chairman Truck's account, and found out they were near the Market/Castro area for the night. As I walked there I was contemplating my choices (and hoping there weren't any lines I had to deal with) I love that they only have a few. Makes life a lot easier. Given that I didn't exactly understand the portions, I tried two things, one steamed and one baked. And my choices were the Baked Spicy Chicken Puree with toasted sesame puree, pickled carrots-cucumber and cilantro and steamed crispy miso cured tofu with garlic-tofu mayo and baby boy chum. If you want bigger portions, baked is the way to go. If you want more bite-sized portions, then steamed is your go to choice. My favorite of the two was hands down the baked spicy chicken. It wasn't bite sized, perfectly done, the spices were balanced, and the hot sauce I had it with made it one of the best baos I've ever had. I wouldn't say this is incredibly authentic, but who cares when it's so damn good?! I hear the pork belly bao is amazing. Next time I get a craving that will be the one I'll be trying. The tofu was good, but not nearly as satisfying and it paled in comparison to the chicken. And lastly, the bao they use is great. Perfectly buttered. Get 1 (or 10) and be happy :)

Who doesn't like chairman bao, right? If it weren't for the fact that waiting forever in line is part of the general bao experience it would be my favorite truck. The buns are delicious, with amazing meat fillings and interesting sauces. I absolutely love their shaved ice drinks (when they have them) and would consider waiting in line just for them, they're so refreshing and tasty (coconut strawberry was amazing! Only once in a while will we get buns with just fat for the meat filling which sucks after such a long wait but that has only happened twice I think and the other times definitely make up for it. I would never wait in the long line for them, but if I find it before they start up I usually stop by. A little expensive for just buns, but worth it once in a while.

Finally got the chance to try this at MVBL Feast. I got the pork belly bao on a baked bun with pickled daikon. Delish! Perfect blend of richness with tangy crispyness as contrast. I like the spin on pulled pork BBQ, but asian style. Really good. I would recommend if you are a fan of Asian fusion. Very tasty!

By far my favorite food truck, even over Mogos BBQ. I have only tried the steam buns, and that is still all I need. The pork, the chicken, the veggies all have been great for me. It can be costly if you have a big appetite. Otherwise, a pretty good deal. I wish they were more in the East Bay so that I could get it more often.

If nothing else, I am a faithful Panda. While I can't review the full range of Baos, the tofu variety, both baked and steamed are delicious. I like the baked just a little more, but they both have deliciously crispy tofu and greens and sauce that do not fail to delight. I've been heading out to the various Movable Feasts (food truck mini-festivals!) and other gatherings, and this is a fun way to chase down food and enjoy it. Somehow, my vegetarian hunting instincts have been engaged. You won't escape me, little tofu Baos!

Finally decided to wait thru the 30 minute line at OTG Fort Mason to see what all the hype is about. (I think the line was abnormally shorter because NomNom was making their debut at the event) Tried the pork belly, the sesame chicken, and the garlic tofu. The stand out winner in my mind is the chicken. Spicy and sweet. Plenty of filling to bread ratio and was worth the wait. I didn't notice any limitation signs on how many you could order this time. Definitely going to be imitating these little buns at home!

I had the trifecta of pork belly with pickled daikon, the spicy chicken, and the braised pork. I opted to have all three bao buns steamed. The buns were perfectly pillowy and fluffy. The pork belly had a nice caramelized glaze and crispness, while the meat was succulent. Actually, this was the best pork belly I have ever had. This is how pork belly should be! The pickled daikon added a nice tangy counterpoint to the fattiness of the pork. The braised/pulled pork was also quite good. It reminded me a lot of the pulled pork Carolina style barbecue I grew up with, oddly enough. It is topped with a slaw and mustard seeds. The chicken was my least favorite of the three, but still enjoyable. Overall, I was really impressed and will be back again next time I'm in town.

THIS AINT YOUR AVERAGE CHINESE BUN! Chairman Bao Bun Truck knows how to create great Asian fusion foods. The steam buns are used like hot dog buns and about the size of a small hotdog bun. The baked buns are used like hamburger buns and about the size of an average burger bun. They also have misc drink such as water bottles, coke, and coconut water. I paid 3.25 for garlic tofu steamed bun and 6.75 for pork belly baked bun. Totally worth it considering the amount they give. The pork belly bun is really delicious. The pickled daikon slices they used with it perfectly compliments the taste of the pork belly with a nice sour taste. ?The pork belly was soft and surprisingly less fatty than your average pork belly. The sauce they used was really sparse and sort of hidden by the source taste from the pickled daikon. The tofu steamed buns are pretty great, but I couldn't taste the garlic. The dressing (maybe ranch?) they used really overpowered the tofu taste. The tofu texture was cripsy and soft. It's a nice Asian take on tofu dogs.

Woah! A taste of this bun suddenly I was like, "Am I in an outdoors market in China, bargaining with the street vendor?" ?No. ?Good. ?Because this bun did not remind me of a Chinese market at all. Judging solely on the food, it's pretty good. ?During SJ Eats, we bought one of everything on the menu - steamed bun with chicken, steamed bun with pork, and steamed bun with tofu and miso greens, in addition to a baked bun with pork. The steamed bun was soft and fluffy. ?The slight sweet taste offset the saltiness of the chicken/pork. ?The chicken bun was a bit spicy, but with goof flavor and the chicken was very tender. ?The pork belly bun was very, very good! ?The pork belly melted in my mouth, and the pickled daikon added crunchiness to the softness of everything else. What I did not like were the steamed bun with tofu and miso greens and the baked bun with pork belly. ?The tofu bun lacked flavor, even with the miso greens. ?Even though the tofu looked fried, everything was just a bland, soft mush. The baked pork belly bun was way too dry, and the portion was simply too big. ?Not saying "too big" as in it is worth the price tag - I meant too big in terms of having to chew the same dry meat and flavor for an extended period of time... Eeek. Overall, I don't think this is something that worth waiting for two hours for, even though the steamed buns were very tasty. ?I could probably get something with similar flavor at a sit-down Chinese restaurant. ?If the wait wasn't two hours long, it's worth a try.

Yeah, I think I'm done. I tried out this truck again for another go at the vegetarian bao, thinking that I may have been too hasty in calling this truck overrated. Not so: Like I said in my first review, nothing about the food itself was actually downright BAD, and for the novelty/fusion factor it was fun to try, but for the price-to-portion ratio and overall value this just isn't worth repeat visits. Sorry Chairman, but this member of the proletariat is skipping your truck in the future.

Get baked not steamed! ?Baked buns are pricier but BIGGER and better! The tender pork belly with daikon pickles is heavenly. ?The crispy garlic tofu with miso greens is divine. ?I'm usually not one to rave over anything involving healthy green things, but putting those miso-soaked greens alongside the crispy garlic tofu is genius!

Bow to the Chairman! Chairman Bao is the latest SF food truck to debut yesterday in the SOMA area selling Chinese bao (stuffed steamed or baked buns, like mini sandwiches). http://static1.px.yelpcd¡­ This iconic truck is currently parked at 1200-7th street, in front of Economy Restaurant Fixtures from 12-2pm. http://static1.px.yelpcd¡­ Check twitter for updates on upcoming evening locations and hours. The prices are not exactly cheap (since the average bao costs less than $1 in Chinatown, and gua bao at Tea Garden is under $2) but affordable. A combo goes for $9 - choose two steamed buns OR one baked bun, plus a shaved ice drink. If you order a la carte, the baked baos are $5.75 each, while steamed baos (clam-shaped) are $2.95 - because they hold less filling. There are 6 choices for fillings: pork belly with pickled daikon, sesame chicken with scallion & bok choy, lion's head (pork meatball) with kimchee, duck confit with mango salsa, Chinese sausage with egg and hoisin sauce, and the vegetarian bao: garlic tofu with miso greens. http://static1.px.yelpcd¡­ The fresh fruit shaved ice drinks ($3.50) have a few unusual flavor combinations: pineapple salted caramel, strawberry coconut, ginger lychee, and mango matcha green tea. http://static1.px.yelpcd¡­ It's similar to Vietnamese dessert cups filled with chopped fruits and gelatin, but with shaved ice added. Other drink options include: iced tea, coconut water, vitasoy and others for $1.50 or more. The location is remote but so far so good (the fatty pork is the best choice so far). I'll update and add pics later after I try more menu items. Overall, 3.5 stars but rounded up to 4 stars because of the nice friendly service! This is actually the 2nd street vendor to offer the steamed gua bao or siao bao in SF (not including regular Taiwanese restaurants). The other street vendor is "MaliNumNum Treats", she makes a slightly smaller version for $2, with 3 meat choices, no veggie version yet. ***** Rivalry with east coast vendor? - As soon as I heard the "Chairman Bao" name being used I knew there might be some controversy. Because I had read (previously bookmarked for places to try) about a small NY shop that opened last year named Baohaus, which has a menu item ($4 each) with that same name. And today it surfaced, the owner of Baohaus posted a reproaching foul mouth rant in his blog claiming that he owned that name. At first I was willing to consider his point of view as valid, but after he mentioned how he "hates yelpers" (even though he's a yelper too. Yelp flagged his 5-star review of his own place.) I lost all interest and his rant became meaningless noise to me. Yelpers are customers too, I believe that owners should respect all customers. Also no longer bookmarked to try that east coast spot. Update: Legally same/similar name use is not an issue since they operate in different regions.

Just by looking at the long line every time, there is no doubt that Chairman Bao is serving up some good stuff. I finally decided to suck it up and wait patiently in line. Spiced duck confit with mango salad: The duck was lean and tasty. This bun packs a powerful punch of spiciness, but is balanced by the sweetness of the mango. Delicious! Braised pork shoulder with cabbage slaw: The pork was juicy and tender. This bun was flavorful and the cabbage salad added tanginess and crunchiness to the whole thing. Delicious! While I thoroughly enjoyed my steamed buns, I'm doubtful of my return. My 2 buns cost $7 since the prices have gone up. Before each steamed bun cost $2.95. Now the buns are separated into 2 categories: People's buns ($3.25) and Chairman's buns ($3.75). Taste & quality: 4 stars Size & price: -1 star

Had my first experience at the Eat Real Fest 2011 in Oakland, and just simply pure genius. Every bite is full of mouth watering, flavorful meats and veggies and special sauce for garnish. The steamed Peking buns are a simple complement to the tangy flavor of the meats and veggies. At 4 dollars a pop, I thought it was ridiculous, but totally worth it. I had the pork shoulder and was actually kinda full from it already. Can't wait to hit up the truck again and try everything else yelpers recommend! ? Cash only!

Yeh the line was long but it was worth it when I took that first bite into the tender, moist pork belly and bao. The pickled veggies were perfect to cut through the meaty fattiness of the pork, and the bao was thick enough to make it a hearty and scrumptious bite. Ahh.... God I want another.... Right now....

After seeing Chairman Bao's concoctions i knew i had to try them. I also heard that the line is usually super long and the wait time can be over an hr?? pure craziness!! Luckily I was joining fellow yelpers for off the grid at civic center. Arriving early made a difference, I noticed Chairman Bao had the longest line of all the trucks. To be able to try a different variety of them, my good buddy and i decided to order 3 buns and share. We decided to go for the Chairman combo and add in one more bun. The Braised Pork with savory cabbage and mustard seeds, Tender Pork Belly with Pickled Daikon and lastly Spiced Duck Confit with Fresh Mango Salad. It also came with some Bao chips. http://media1.px.yelpcdn¡­ http://media1.px.yelpcdn¡­ My favorite was the Pork Belly with the Pickled Daikon, although the other two were also up to par in taste and mixture of flavors as well. The Bao chips were very interesting, it was basically wonton skins deep fried and had shavings of seaweed in them. They were good ?but a bit oily after eating them for a while. The greatest thing that deters me from having Chairman Bao again is the price. almost $4 for one steamed bun or $6 for a baked one. Seriously you can go to Chinatown and get one bun for a lot less. I understand and love that you are taking a new creative edge on a traditional concept. Other than that after having Chairman Bao once, I don't feel the need to have it again. The experience was nice but I don't think i will be back. 3.5 stars

Shoutout to my homie Tim, who has been supplying me with a steady flow of OFF THE GRID goodies & bringing it to my workplace. When he showed up today with some Chairman Bao pork belly buns, I took one look at it and began drooling already. At first I was a bit weird-ed out by the mustard seeds on top, but after one bite I found myself unable to stop eating..mustard seed and all. The buns are similar to the buns you get with Peking ducks in Chinese Restaurants, but their fillings are a little less orthodox. Inside this steam bun, was a huge heaping of pork belly topped with some sort of sauerkraut looking like topping with mustard seeds on top. Don't judge the buns by its size, a small little bun filled me up! I've personally never been to OFF THE GRID (mainly because I'm never in the city or is working during the times in which it's going on) but I've had the chance to sample quite a few of their famous goodies. One bite and I understood why there are long lines for Chairman bao. Plus they have a cute truck to boot! i can't wait to try some of their drinks next time!

The hype is well worth it to the San Francisco foodies. One tip that I must reinforce is to get the baked buns. Although not your traditional "bao" but more "sandwich or hamburger" (laughter), Chairman Bao has effectively used well placed ingredients evolving the traditional bbq pork and chicken buns into pork belly or duck confit for example. Pork Belly - Fatty and the way pig should be eaten when not in crispy bacon form. The pickled daikon gave a nice contrast with a nice crunch. Duck Confit - Succulent pieces paired with papaya and mint that paired perfectly. Red Sesame Chicken - Spicy flavored chicken topped with pickled carrot/cucumber, that didn't quite hit home with me right away. All in all, this is one of my favorite trucks in the city and I normally don't mind the wait during events like Off the Grid. However, if you have the opportunity to locate this truck at an off-peak lunch hour, it's heaven to have some quality time with this truck =)

I was surprised to see Chairman Bao at the International Dragon Boat Festival at Treasure Island. ?Even bigger surprise...no line! ? I'm torn between three and four stars. ?On one hand, the pork belly w/ pickled daikon was very good and a unique interpretation of an asian dish. ?The sandwich features pork with onions and pickled daikon housed between two large and toasted hamburger sized buns. ?Pretty good. ?Plus under $6 for a large sandwich seems like a fairly good deal to me. On the other hand, as my sister-in-law described it, it's just a glob of fat between buns...thick, obnoxious fat. ?The meat was about 85% pure fat and 15% pork meat. ?Plus the sando, quite expectedly, was on the greasy side, leaving me with that bloated feeling afterwards. Overall, the sandwich was quite delicious. ?I don't know if I like it enough to stand in line the next time I see them. ?I had my review at four stars from yesterday to today. ?But it kept bothering me, so I'm editing my review now and downgrading to a three.

One of the best food trucks always found at Off The Grid, Thursady nights at Stanyan and Waller. Their steamed buns make for a filling meal in orders of two, a rough equivalent to eating just one of their baked buns (a sandwich-like configuration). Their lychee-ginger slushy drinkie is also out-of-this-world! They lose a star for no longer offering the duck confit & fresh mango bun -- the only real five out of five star offerings on the scene at OTG. [chants] BRING IT BACK! BRING IT BACK! It's been almost a year --- what gives?

Big flavors in these buns but I can't help but feel they are too expensive for what you get. Sure, they use all kinds of fancy pants organic, free range meats and things but my waiifish self dropped over $10* on three steamed buns and was still starving after. I'll definitely pick one up in the future as a snack but probably won't be planning another whole meal around them again. *This brings up a pet peeve of mine - they add sales tax on these buns. That just seems downright wrong...when you look at a food truck and see something as $2.95 it should be $2.95, not $3.21 or whatever they were.

Question everyone is asking themselves? Is all the hype right and is this really worth it? Short Answer? Yes. Probably the fatal flaw behind this place is the fact that its expensive AZN street food (oxymoron, I know) but it is well worth it. Went to off the grid Friday and waited in the daunting line in front of the infamous Bao truck. As I waited in line, the smells intoxicated the air. The buns were getting ripped off the menu as they sold out, and my anticipation was killing me. When I finally got to the front (~15 minus later) I tried the pork belly and the fried tofu, and both were mouthgasmically amazing. Well worth the wait, and I'll do it again. I'll probably regret reviewing this, because I don't want this place to get any more crowded than it already is, but it was just that good that I can't NOT share.

Now that I've tried The Chairman's baked duck confit with mango steamed bun, as well as their pork shoulder steamed bun with mustard seeds...

Wow what a BAO! ?this is not your typical bao, as it's more of a taco or pancake type of dealio. ?But it was good!!! I tried this truck last night at Off the Grid at Upper Haight and got the pork belly one as well as the duck one. ?The duck one was their special of the night that was really good and unique, but the pork belly bao was the best. ?I love pork belly because it has a little bit of fat in it, but it makes the meat taste so delicious. ?The pickled yellow daikon on top was also really ?good, and slightly sweet and pickled at the same time. Oh, both were steamed, as you have the choice of getting a baked version or a steamed version.

Who could buy a .20 bun from chinatown throw some pork belly and daikon and charge 6 dollars and have people rave about it? ?I guess if I didn't grow up eating peking duck with bun, I too would rave about this place. ?Is it all about marketing?....................Absolutely!!! Look.............it's not a bad concept. ?I actually admire them for it because it takes balls to come up with an idea like this. ?An Asian inspired dish and infuse it with an american twist...............Why not?!? ?I am not one to hate on great concepts. ?But, to have a non asian company invent a dish and then make it better than what the asians can come up with is absolutely incredible. ?And.............we would stand and wait in line for it. I wouldn't be surprise if those pink boxes of buns were picked up from "Good Luck Dim Sum" in ?Chinatown. ? I guess growing up in Chinatown and paying .50 for a Char siu bau got me thinking.........

I have a love-hate relationship with Chairman Bao. I'm excited whenever I see it, eat it but then I'm also like "eck, it really isn't THAAAT good..." Like after awhile it's just totally over-hyped. Maybe I'm just in denial, but whatever it may be... FRESH chairman bao eaten then and there is the way to go. A little dash of sriracha... The clash of flavors, texture.. is just "BAM!" in your mouth. I love how they have pickled daikon, it really completes the whole bao. But then you start to feel a little remorse after you're done even though you're so satisfied with all that pork belly you just scarfed down, you look at the paper box it comes in and all that oil that's in the box... It's really just such a simple fattening bao is what it comes down to. Nothing more, nothing less. Would love to try their drinks but they never seem to have any of the fancy ones that people post pictures up on yelp...

Just to further echo Lady K's review Bao o Bao is in the HOUSE! I definitely bao down to Chairman Bao Bun, they are one of the many that is leading the way for the Street Food movement that is engulfing many major cities in the Northern and Southern California. Here in San Francisco Chairman Bao is certainly one of the major players in this Street Food revolution so when I found out they were going to be in Emeryville this Monday I was going to hunt them down. Just before lunch I took my daughter, my brother and his girlfriend down to Emeryville to find this truck. (It's not that hard to find since it looks like a fire truck with tattoos. You can see it three blocks away.) When we got there there were only a few people in line since they were still setting up, but as soon as they open, the masses of followers started to show up. As soon as they started taking order I ordered the Steamed Pork Belly with Pickled Daikon and Duck Confit with Mango Salad in a baked bun. My brother and his girlfriend ordered the Steamed Sesame Chicken with Scallions and Bok Choy and the Steamed Pork Belly. My immediate favorite is the Duck hands down. It is shredded duck and some kind of sweet mango relish thrown in a baked Chinese bun. The immediate reaction to the first bite is "Humm this is different, a little spicy, hummm." Then as I took the last bite I'm saying "G-- D--- this is good, I'm buying another one." The Sesame Chicken was also delicious and spicy, as my brother's girlfriend gave me some to try. I'm definitely getting more of that on my next visit. The Steamed Pork Belly was also good, although it didn't make a big splash as the other food. Overall I loved it. No problem giving Chairman Bao a cool 5 stars. I love the whole Street Eat Revolution and it's my honor to support this movement. One request for Chairman Bao Ban, please pay a visit in Hercules Market Hall, PLEASE!!! Update 1/3/2011: Follow up meeting with the Chairman and this time I got the Braised Pork w/ Savoy Cabbage and Preserved Mustard Seeds. It was delicious, but I still put the Duck Confit above them all. ?I also got to try their Ginger Lychee Lemonade, it was so good, you got to try it.

OMG. Quite possibly one of the BEST food trucks out there. During my first trip to Off The Grid, this was our last stop. I lucked out and a friend had the hook-up at this place. We got the braised pulled pork baked bun, the pork belly with pickled daikon baked bun, along with four different steamed buns. I tried a little bit of each and each one was AMAZING. The meat in the braised pulled pork bun was flavorful and had a tasty coleslaw topping. The bun itself was soft, fluffy, and slightly sweet. The meat on the pork belly bun was also pretty good. I'm not a big fan of fatty meats like pork belly, so I only had a small bite, but it also was quite tasty! I didn't get to try any of the steamed buns except for the tofu one, but the bun on that one is also nicely balanced. It's pliable, yet firm enough to hold in the good stuff. The tofu is also very flavorful, though, slightly salty. When we got our items, they were fresh and still mighty hot, but that is the way to eat it! Even when I decided to pick at some leftovers later that night, it was still heavenly! I'm so glad we got to try this food truck because it's definitely one I would go to again and recommend to friends! GO GO GO! But be prepared to either make that your whole meal, or bring friends to share, because it's just THAT much food!

Pork Belly. ?The combination of crispy outside, melty fat, and flavorful sauce, cut by the acidity of pickled daikon and a soft sweet roll is just absolutely retardedly perfect. Tip: One is not enough. Buy at least 3. Or 6. ?Or a dozen. They won't go to waste, ever.

You slutty food slinging truck.. how dare you do this to me. What delectable, sexy little buns with juicy meat bursting from within. I had dreams about eating here after I missed out on the Eat Real fest. The dreams were so good, that today, I dashed out of work an hour before my regular lunch hour just to beat the crowd. Ain't no one gonna stand between me and these buns I tell ya. I got one of each to experience the steamed and the baked. I can see how the steamed might be a favorite to some..it was good, but nothing fantastic. I'd never had pork belly before so, all that fat kinda grossed me out & I removed it all.. but it was still good stuff with the pickled daikon, which I thought I'd hate, but it had a unique flavor. Then I opened 'The One'... the king of all Bao: The baked, duck confit with mango salad. Again, this was another first.. I don't believe I've ever had duck confit.. and I certainly never had it with a mango salad on top. ?Talk about an exotic flavor party.. all in a bun. If I could regurgitate and re-eat that sandwich, I would. But I'm full so, I'll just sit here in a food coma, refraining from drinking anything that might mess with the after taste this delightful, ample, meat-filled bun has left on my tongue. Chairman Bao is seducing the tastebuds of the Bay Area, and let me assure you, he got all up in my head, down to my belly and back up to my heart with his tasty talents. I shall be back, but not too often. Food this good cannot be good for you. If loving Bao is wrong, I don't wanna be right.

This is definitely one of my favorite trucks at any OTG event! What I look for in a perfect food truck is 1. good price and value, 2. really tasty food, and 3. freshly prepared with great ingredients (preferably local and organic). In that order. Chairman Bao satisfied all of my criteria AND includes friendly service. Not so much quick service all the time, though, which would only improve my review. I love the tofu bun--either baked or steamed (although I slightly prefer it on a steamed bun), but my heart mostly belongs to the baked duck bun with the mango salsa, which I haven't seen in a while but I'm hoping will return soon. The best part is that I can get a baked bun for about $6 and it totally fills me up. Now that's what I'm talkn' about, Willis!

Tasty enough to elicit my first review! Got one of each of the steamed buns offered this day at Off the Grid Upper Haight: (now what do these Rating Stars stand for again?) RED CHICKEN STEAMED BUN** Meh I've experienced better ? ? WORTH A TRY? SURE: Maybe this one was just out done by the other two but, left me wanting more "red" in my red chicken. Sriracha maybe? ? ? BUY IT AGAIN? NO ? ? ? CRISPY TOFU STEAMED BUN **** "Yay! I'm a fan" ? ? WORTH A TRY? ABSOLUTELY! Even if you're not a fan of tofu. The patty was suprisingly creamy and full of flavor and crispy on the outside. Yum with the dressing and fresh greens too! Should've paid more attention, but it was gone too quickly. In my Bellay! ? ? BUY IT AGAIN? YES PLEASE! I'm craving it as I type. PORK BELLY STEAMED BUN ?***** "Woohoo! As good as it gets!" ? ?WORTH A TRY? AND THEN SOME! My expectations were so high with this one, because #1. great reviews, #2. Pork Belly..nuff said #3. All the inticing photos on here! But I psyched myself out, cuz nothing breaks my heart like being let down by my treats. But alas I was saved! (emoting) Ok, so, loved the meat, loved the fat, loved the Char Sui flavor on the crispy bark. I fully agree with my sister when she said "I'm in heaven~ " Oh, and though I LOVE fat, it may have been too fatty had it not been for the pickled daikon & onions. PERFECT! ? ? BUY IT AGAIN? WE DID JUST THAT! Once we inhaled those three, we went back and ordered us each a Pork Belly for our very own. "MINE!!"

I met Chairman Bao at Off the Grid one cold Friday evening and he made me wait for 45 minutes to taste his baos. ?During the long wait in line, the owner, whom we shall name Chairman Bao, came out of the truck handing out what I thought was a menu but turned out to be the flyer that said to vote for him in the Food Network truck race. ? Anyway, he told me that most people order the pork belly bao so I did. ?Boy was it delicious. ?The filling was excellent but I thought the bun was pretty decent too. ?I also go to try the sesame chicken but it wasn't as good as the pork belly. ?After that long wait, you are only allowed a maximum of 6 per order so a bunch of us just ordered together and got the max. While we were eating our baos, Chairman Bao came walking towards us again and we yelled at him. ?"Hey! ?You tell us to try your truck and you're eating ramen from another truck!" ?Trader Bao. ?He said when you have your own truck, you just get tired of it which I guess makes sense. ?It's just funny that he's standing in line promoting his truck with a bowl of ramen. ? He told us that people complained about the buns and they were frozen before so he said they just started with buns made from someone who worked at Yank Sing. ?Wow. ?A top notch truck I suppose if you like Yank Sing. ? Thank you, Chairman Bao, for the yummy buns. ?However, I do not think it's worth a 45 minute wait in the freezing cold. ?I could've gone to Chinatown and back in the same amount of time and paid 45 cents. ? ?I know, I know. ?It wouldn't be as good.

I took a survey months ago regarding different types of food trucks. This bun truck was one of my top 3 picks but not my first pick. So I've already had it in my head today that this can't be that good. It's almost like I was trying to find something bad about it. So we arrive around noon... nobody in line, but this probably won't last for long once word gets out. It's about $6 for a baked bun and $3 for a steamed bun. When you think of buns... at least to an asian person, ?you think of bbq pork buns. If you've had peking duck before, that's the steamed bun... you know the one you can place on your lip to mimic big lips. If you're don't know what I'm talking about, you're probably not as immature as me... so let's move on! The baked buns are exactly like the buns you get at a dim sum place except instead of having it stuffed, this truck creates their own version and sandwiches meat in between the bun like a hamburger. Okay enough with the intro. I ordered a baked pork belly bun. It was really juice, lots of burnt edges, and pickled daikon in between a baked bun. My friends ordered the lion head meatball... a bit messy but they said it was good. If you want to try the meatball, I say it's better to order the baked bun instead of steamed bun... why? I'm going to make you think about this one. =) Oh a friend also ordered the fried tofu over steamed bun... that was actually my last pick on the list.... no meat... bleh! My friend couldn't stop talking about it.... so I might have change my mind and try it! Iced drinks.....pineapple salted caramel....strawberry coconut. The pineapple salted caramel wasn't bad at all.. reminded me of Birite. I had the strawberry coconut... tons of coconut and strawberry in the drink. Well worth the $3.50 I think and a bonus that it was really good! Location is a bit far from a lot of people working the financial district. But I'm sure they'll probably try to swing by this area....so get your buns now or face the long lines I foresee in their future. =) Oh and you have to see the design on the truck. I wouldn't mind owning a shirt if they started making one... *hint hint* Overall review...skeptical at first but I guess don't knock it unless you try it! It's a lot better than other trucks where I only need to go once and forget about it. delicious buns and drinks.. can't wait to try the rest next time!

3.5 stars I have started dedicating my Fridays to walking over to City Hall and scoping the truck scene. It really makes my Fridays THAT much better! Last Friday I was so happy to see the Chairman Bao Bun Truck because the thought of pork belly stuffed inside a bun made my stomach happy. The line was somewhat long but moved quickly. By the time I got to the front I realized that half the menu had already been sold out- the menu wasnt that long to begin with. The fresh pork belly was really good and complimented well with the bun and pickles. The bun was a little overpowering and would have probably tasted better if it was a bit smaller. Perhaps I should have ordered it with the steam buns instead. I had a few bites and saved the rest until I got back to my office- bad move. By the time I got back, the bottom bun was all soaked and soggy from the sauce. Lesson learned. I would love to try their duck in the future!

I attended a food truck event with a few friends one weekend. We got there fairly late and most of the trucks were sold out of their top picks, so I decided to give the Chairman a try. I ordered the pork belly pickled daikon baked bun. The first bite was good, but it just went downhill from then on. The bun was just WAY TOO GREASY. Seriously, the entire bun was drenched in grease after a minute. I couldn't even enjoy my meal because my hands were dripping with grease! Yuck! 1 Star for the food. However, the female cashier was extremely friendly, so another star for service, otherwise I'd leave it at 1 star.

pork belly bao - that's all you need to know. their tofu is really good, too, but the pork belly rules. last year, they offered duck confit, but i wasn't able to try it. (they always ran out before i reached the window.) you get a choice between baked or steamed bao. both are good, but i prefer the baked. please bring back the bao chips. those are super addicting! great t-shirts - i always get complimented on mine.

I tried the pork belly bun with radish steamed and to be honest, I think it is overrated. I went to off the grid at fort mason and saw the huge snake line to the chairman truck and I heard that it was really good. I love the pork belly because it was fried nicely and the radish was pickled really well. I didn't think the price was worth it. $3.75 for one bun. I have ordered pretty good pork belly buns for about $3 for two buns. I would really love to try something new here next time and be awed for the price I am paying for one bun. I felt that I wasn't too happy with what I ordered. I might have set a high expectation for the chairman truck since I've heard how good it was and also the line that has formed and kept building at off the grid.

Don't get me wrong, I love Chairman Bao. ?When I first started eating from this truck a year ago, I was amazed that a food truck could deliver such amazing cuisine. ?Hey, sometimes you can't get restaurants to cook food this good. ? My favorite is the pork belly and the duck confit. ?The sesame chicken is also quite tasty. ?Love the steamed buns but the baked bun is just as yummy. So why the 3 stars? ?The price. ?It was already expensive when I first started eating there. ?Then they hiked up their prices a few months ago. ?It's just way too overpriced now. ?I understand that quality ingredients cost a lot. ?But in conjunction with the price increase, they also reduced the quantity of the meats on the buns. ?I'm sorry but I can't give it more than 3 stars based on the cost. ?It's worth a splurge here once in a blue moon but the pricing is a deterrent.

Always happy when Off the Grid is back in Alameda! ?Today I sampled a couple of sliders from The Chairman. I have to say that at $3.75 each these are comparatively teeny sliders. ?Usually I'm good for a four bite min on a slider, but the two I ordered were gone in about two and a half. First up, the Miso marinated 'crispy' tofu with bok choy. ?The flavors of the tofu and bok choy were nice but not quite bold enough to stand out from the steamed bun. ?Also the tofu wasn't very crispy, in fact it was only remotely crispy on one side. ?So I had mostly bun with some bok choy and a tiny slice of tofu that was basically the same texture as the bun. ?I think this could be really delicious if it were done properly. Second, a spicy shredded chicken with a delicious crispy carrot relish. ?The spiciness of this one held up well and was a great compliment to the sweet sticky bun. ?Unfortunately the chicken was a bit gristly and also very tiny and gone in under three bites. I think this truck has the potential to do some really good things but I probably won't be going back to them until I've sampled the other trucks.

If I had to wait 2 hours to get a $7 pork belly bun I'd be fatty pissed. ?But since I only had to wait 5 minutes at the North Beach farmers market I was a happy fat ass. ?The baked pork belly bun was delicious. ?I've eaten at most of the food trucks in the city and this was probably one of the best things I've eaten off a truck. ?The food trucks serve is usually disappointing and expensive for what you get. ?But I was definitely impressed with their interpretation of a baked pork belly bun, ?I also had the braised pork in a steamed bun and it was also delicious. ?$4 for the steam bun is borderline highway robbery and goes back into my opinion that food truck items are overpriced but it was good. ?If you want a goo hearty portion definitely go for the baked bun version.

They have some bomb ass pork belly buns. Caught them at "Off the Grid" on 6/17 and thankfully we were there right when they opened, cause within 10 minutes, the line was already backing up into other food truck spaces. Ordered some steamed pork belly buns, the braised pork, and the crispy tofu bun. ?All were good but they ain't got shizznit on the pork belly. ?I would marry that piece of glob if I could. ?The fat just bursts into your mouth and get's the party kickin' in there. ?Highly recommended. ?Just make sure you get there early and don't go too late bc they run out of this stuff fast!

The Chairman is a very popular food truck, isn't it? I'd followed it with interest online for awhile and when I finally made it to Off the Grid, Fort Mason (an event that I heartily recommend by the way) I was glad to see the truck there, in all its glory. It's a sight to behold, and whoever designed it did a killer job! I had read very positive reviews of the food and apparently, many other people had, too. The line for the truck doubled back on itself perhaps a hundred deep. I decided to abort thankfully there are other places to catch the truck. I discovered Wednesdays on 7th at Folsom (near Sightglass) is a fantastic time to go. I walked right up to the truck with no line. It was fantastic! And lucky me, that day they were serving a new bun. Called the Dragon, it was made of grilled eel (a big portion) with salad, avocado and grapefruit in a somewhat spicy and tangy marinade. The combination of textures and colors was beautiful (see photo, uploaded to the album here) The marriage of citrus/ sweet/ salt perfectly balanced. I look forward to trying more of their sandwich buns in the weeks to come!

my pick at The Movable Feast this past weekend in San Jose at Canoas Garden. ?I wish I lived closer because I could so easily eat a couple of these every week! ?I tried 1 of each of their steamed bao. ?They were all so tasty and full of flavors that literally ignited my taste buds!! ?The tofu, the braised pork, spicy chicken and pork belly. ALL of them had their own personality. ?My favorite would be the Spicy Chicken, then the Pork Belly and Tofu tied at 2nd and 3rd the braised pork. ?I truly can't wait to eat them again! ?Def give them a try if the opportunity presents itself. ?YOU WON'T REGRET IT!

Quick Tip: If you know Chairman Bao is going to be at a certain location get there early because the lines get ridiculously long. I have a food truck fetish and I had been itching to try Chairman Bao since I got to the bay area. I finally got my chance when I went to the local food truck gathering in Palo Alto on Mondays. I showed up at around 4:30ish and of all the trucks present Bao had by far the longest line. As it got later the line got longer and longer so I was glad to get there early. I only got one bun there, the pork belly on steamed bun and it was fantastic. The bun was soft and sweet, the pork belly was fatty and had a nice salty flavor. The pickle daikon and vegetable provided a nice refreshing sour crunch to go with the soft chewy texture of the bun and meat. Throw in some siracha and you have an item that combines 4 distinct flavors into one delicious snack. The main reason that I can't give Chairman Bao a 5/5 is because of the price. At 3.75 for a steamed bun and 6+ for a baked bun, you just don't get much food for how much you pay. The buns are quite small and to get a full meal you would have to buy 3+. However, the food is good enough to warrent buying a bun just because it tastes so good. I would recommend getting a bun and another item from another food truck to augment your meal.

Turns out I couldn't even wait 24 hours before coming here again. ? Although no pork belly was available, I got to try all that they offered the next day: 1. Red sesame chicken with scallion and bak choy: This is very Korean inspired because the scallion and bak choy is really one of many versions of kimchi. ?I was a little confused as to whether this or #3 was the pork because they're both shredded/pulled-ish. ?At first sight I could tell kochujang (red pepper paste) was the main ingredient so it might be re-creatable at home. ?As for the "red esame" in the name, I don't know where that was. 2. Crispy garlic tofu with miso greens: Almost everyone preceding us in line skipped out on this one because only freaky vegans would pick it. ?But I went with my hunch and didn't regret it at all. ?The flavors are really light and the tofu is a different texture but somehow, it works. ?It's on the firmer side and you can definitely taste the garlic. ?The greens were marinated in a way that made them really refreshing and held true to their original flavors. 3. Pulled pork with pickled daikon: ?A little disappointing maybe because I have daikon fairly often. ?I didn't feel that the pork had incredible flavor compared to the others so what a bummer. With all these the mantou is still consistent in every order and bite. ?Number one in my book is still the pork belly.

The only thing great about the Chairman Bao is the truck. Horrible bastardization of Chinese food has been committed here. Both the pork belly with daikon and the red sesame chicken were way over sauced and mediocre...the chicken was borderline awful. I generally can't turn down food but after a bite of the chicken...I wanted to throw it away. =( If you love this truck, you need to check your tastebuds...you clearly can't seperate what your eyes see from what your tastebuds taste. I really wanted to like this truck too because the let's admit it, the truck is eye-catching. But at the end of the day...it's about the food. 1 star for the truck, 1 star for the super friendly service, 0 stars for food.

Usually one has to hunt down the food carts. Ever so rarely, when the stars are aligned, the food carts come to you. Such was the case today when I was minding my own business walking home, only to discover Chairman Bao parked right up in my business (i.e. a block from home). The hype had been loud, I knew I had to seize the moment and give it a shot. Other yelpers have mentioned excess oil, which yours truly usually calls out, but perhaps it was the lingering hunger from a night dancing that my steamed chicken bun had no chance. Don't check for oil. Do not pass go. Just eat. $3 later and after a few bites of heaven on wheels, consider me a fan.

If you've ever been to Tiananmen Square in Beijing you'd know that there is always a massive queue to see Chairman Mao in his final resting place inside his mausoleum. ?A somewhat morbid intro to a food review, but similarly, in order for you to partake in the deliciousness of Chairman Bao's buns you'll have to be willing to queue up as well. ?There is a reason Chairman Bao has the longest line at Off the Grid, because the food is off the hook! I've pretty much had everything Chairman Bao has to offer with respect to its steamed buns-- pulled pork topped with savoy cabbage and mustard seeds, pork belly with pickled daikon, duck confit with mango, red sesame chicken with bok choy and scallion, and crispy garlic tofu with miso greens. ?All of the baos are exceptionally delicious and none have disappointed. ?My ultimate favorites though are the tender pork belly, savory pulled pork, and succulent duck confit inside the moist steamed buns. I've also read from Chairman Bao's Twitter that the buns used for the baos come from Wa Li Bakery & Cafe in Chinatown, SF. The shaved ice drinks they offer aren't too bad. ?I've had the pineapple salted caramel and the mango green tea matcha on separate occasions. ?The mango one is better in my opinion. Interestingly the logo, being a profile view of a panda wearing Chairman Mao's garb, bears a strong resemblance to the logo on the Chairman Mao watches that were shoved in my face by a myriad of hawkers during my time in Beijing.

Too bad they were an hour late just getting to SJ Eats (the day before they announced on FB they would be serving early at 11:00 so I showed up at 10:45) and even though I waited AN HOUR (their prep time once they arrived) first in line to get the infamous buns..well they let some douche bags cut in front of me from the Lousianna Territory line who were at the END of that line and maybe stood there 5 minutes. I hope those efiin douchebags got food poisoning. The Chinese lady who was behind me almost lynched the shameless bastards. That truck wreaked havoc! It was 2 seconds from full blown riot. Now enough of my rant on SJ Eats.. BTW that delay time enabled me to get the first food served at the event from Lousianna Territory who's food was AWESOME! So awesome I went back for SECONDS, yes Seconds in that mob scene... they won for best food of the event and were better than the Chairmans buns hands down! Although they were damn good buns. On to the BUNS, I tried all 3 varieties. Ginger seame chicken, Pork Belly w/pickled Diakon, and fried tofu steamed ($3.75 each) and one baked pork belly bun ($6). I wondered why the baked bun was so much more expensive, well once I got it I saw why, it was like a BIG beautiful hamburger, and SO DAMN GOOD!! I was so glad I got the baked pork belly one, I devoured it like a savage. I also ate a bite of each of the other ones. the tofu one was GROSS, and I like tofu. The sesame/gingerchicken one was pretty decent, I would order it again. I was sad they didn't have the duck confit one I heard so much about. If your gonna get the buns, fork out the extra dough and get a baked one seriously, that was by FAR the best one of the lot! They were the second best truck at SJ Eats, and I ate from: (in order best to worst) Lousianna Territory, Chairman, Sam's, Kara's, Babaloo, and Mobowl (which I have to say mobowl was disgusting). Oh and I had NO idea they were on some list of the foods to try before you die? Hmph, they haven't had MY cooking, I make meals all the time where people say "they could die right now and be happy after that meal". However I don't deliver in a really cool truck.

This is hands down the best meal on wheels I have ever consumed and I fully comprehend the boldness of the implication I am making. ?I have sampled the entire menu and all of the items are of a legitimate gourmet Chinese Fusion Cuisine caliber, only served rapid fire in an almost morning bakery style manner by an enthusiastic crew. ?The standout is the Coca-cola braised Pork served on the baked version of the signature Bao roll, which has a cabbage/chipotle mayo garnish that Rivals the flavor profile of the best Carolina pulled pork and slaw sandwiches. ?Come here with any kind of an appetite and you will have a hard time not completing this particular item in its entirety.

Delicious. The pork belly baked bun (WAY bigger than the steamed bun) is amaaazing. The only problem is that once you order your food from a food truck, you gotta stand and eat it which makes you naturally consume the food 3 times faster than you would sitting down, so the wonderful flavors disappear too quickly.

My FAVORITE food truck at Off the Grid in Fort Mason (except for Cupkates on the dessert side). I went earlier tonight and it was good enough to warrant a same-night review :) $3.75 for the steamed bun. It includes: delicious, buttery-soft chunks of pork belly and crispy, pickled daikon sandwiched between a pillow-soft white bun. It was DELICIOUS. An explosion of flavors in my mouth. The fattiness of the pork belly contrasted so well with the sharp flavor of the daikon. Yes, the pork buns are expensive. But yes, they are so, SO worth it. The sounds kind of weird, but the flavor of the daikon reminded me of the flavor of the slaw at Bakesale Betty's. And the bun reminded me of the buns on the famous pork buns at Ippudo Ramen in NYC (so, so good as well!). I definitely want to return to try their other buns/menu items.

Ever since I seen this truck featured on Eat St, I had to try it to see what the hype was all about. ?I got the chance to try them at the ERF this year at Jack London and really enjoyed the pork belly and 5-spice steamed buns. ? I saw that they were in SF close by work and since I didn't get to try their baked buns, I decided to check them out once again. ?I got 3 buns (2 baked @ 6.75 and 1 steamed @ 3.25) totalling almost $18. That's super pricey for your average chinese bun but it is packed with a lot of ?meat and/or filling. One baked one will get you full. ?I'm a fan of the tender pork belly with pickled daikon in a baked bun. ?The pork cubes really are soft and flavorful. ?I don't even know what daikon is but it's sweet and tangy that gives the bun good texture with it's slight crunch.

The Justin Bieber of food trucks, Chairman Bao was easy to spot at the Friday Off The Grid event at Fort Mason due to the crazed, bun seeking line that was at times 75 people deep. Business is so good here that they have to enforce a six bun max order limit!! If there ever was an illustration for excessive exuberance, this would be it. We were smart and a bit forward looking and got there way early when the line was only 10 people deep. We still had to wait a bit, and yes we did each order six buns. Sometimes I think the six bun limit is just a marketing gimmick to get you to order the limit.. sigh. I got two of each : Pork Belly with Radish, Duck Confit with Mango, Sesame Chicken with Scallion/Bok Choy. My favorites were the Pork Belly and Duck buns. The Pork Belly matched extremely well with the pickled radish.. the fattiness is fended off by the radish - amazing. The duck was very tender while the sweet mango paired with it quite nicely. Oh and if you're wondering why the baked bun is almost twice as much as the steamed bun, its b/c the baked one is like more than twice as big and its baked (duh). All I know is that there is a baked Pork Belly Bun with my name on it come next Friday.

I love mobile gourmet week! ?Thanks again Bishop Ranch for bringing street food to our hood! 2.5 Stars: So I ordered the BUN meal which consists of a Baked bun, and a Fresh fruit shaved ice (complete with boba) . $9 -BUN: ?Spiced duck with mango confit -Shaved Ice drink: Pineapple Salt Caramel note: I've posted pictures of both. Sounds good huh? ?great concept right? ?Yeah well.. the food in my opinion fell kind of short... The Bun: ?The bread itself tasted a day old, it was not bad and it looked great (nice golden shiny coat) but it was not soft, fresh and steamy the way a fresh baked chinese bun out of the oven tastes like. ?The bun was cut in half and stuffed with shredded duck .. while you can taste the 5 spice (star anise, ginger, pepper etc), it was very salty, and it took some convincing for me to realize that this was dark meat duck, and not some over marinated pork. ?The duck meat was then topped off with a type of sweet mango relish. ?There was some good "heat" to the seasoning, but I have to stress that the dish overall was very salty. ?Too much for me to really enjoy. The Shaved ice: Once again, fell a bit short...looking at the drink, it looked really good.. however, it literally tasted like a can of chopped pineapple over some shaved ice. ?Think of a can of Dole Crushed pineapple, now pour it over crushed ice and tapioca. ?That's the drink! ?No flavor of caramel, no salt...

Honestly, I love steamed buns. ?I was one of those kids who stole all the steamed buns off the platter when the family ordered Peking Duck. ?I was the kid who would ask to buy just steamed buns from Asian bakeries and markets, and gorge on about 5 just to ruin dinner. ?So when I stumbled upon Chairman Bao at Eat Real 2010, I was kind of excited (a la kid in a candy store, but in my case, kid in a steamed bun store). The first thing I noticed while waiting in the kind of long line, was the unique design and color scheme of the truck with the huge panda who I assume is Chairman Bao. ?Walking slowly, step by step, mouth watering and stomach grumbling, I could not wait to eat some steamed buns. ?Finally, upon reaching the front of the line, I had to order as much as I thought I could consume (and carry in one hand because the other hand had a beer in it), so I got a red sesame chicken, pulled pork and crispy tofu steamed buns. I got three knowing I would have to share with my fellow festival goers, so while walking around (and getting lost on purpose) looking for my group, I took bites out of all three. ?Each one was delicious in its own right. ?However, my favorite was the crispy tofu... but obviously, the star was the steamed bun which was perfectly soft, slightly sweet, and oh so good. ?Join the revolution and get some Chairman Bao!

They're tasty, but they're not bao. Let's be clear, a bao is a steamed bun filled with something or plain. When I say "filled" I mean that the contents are inside, and have been steamed with the bun. Chairman Bao gets packages of pre-made buns in chinatown and uses them like tacos to put things on. Their fillings are actually quite tasty, but that's not a bao. It's more like a fancy chinese style taco. So if you want asian-fusion-ish stuff on a bun, check it out. If you were actually looking for anything authentic like, for instance, a bao, this isn't the place.

Gosh, I can't believe I never wrote a review for Chairman Bao! Chairman Bao is one of a handful of food trucks that I return to whenever I am at one of the OTG events. I first tried their buns some time in 2009 when the food truck boom was just taking off and Chairman Bao was one of the trucks that I heard a whole lotta raves about. Frankly, I wasn't that "moved" after trying a few of their buns and quite baffled by what the hype was over.

There has been many changes since my last visit 6 months ago. ?The drinks menu has been eliminated completely. ?The menu has shrunken a bit. ?My favorite, egg and Chinese sausage with oyster sauce, is no longer on the menu. ?=( ?I've noticed that the bao/buns are significantly large in diameter now. ?There's also the option of adding Bao chips, which are fried wonton strips. ?Dismayed by the lacking in choices, I settled for the red sesame chicken baked bun. ?It smelled really good. ?The sesame oil fragrance is hard to resist. ?The sandwiches are now a substantial meal with the heaping filling of meat, pickled veggies, and green onions. ?It was super-spicy. ?Well, I am a weakling with a low tolerance level for spice. ?I had to down 3 glasses of water to finish the sandwich! ?My coworker's duck confit sandwich was also too spicy for him to handle.

Will anyone read this since this place has garnered over a gaZillion reviews? Probably not. But the Prince of Taiwan needs to lay his two cents down nevertheless, much like how fat chicks have to lay down after walking one flight of stairs. Pork Belly Steamed Buns. Just buy these and your belly will thank you for it, not to mention your tastebuds. Perfect bites of pork belly goodness. it is fatty, moist, tasty, oh heavenly indulgent goodness. the peeps that I saw in line eating these buns looking like they were performing fellatio on the damn buns. Needless to say this is a winner. At 3.75 not too pricey either..but these buns are small, about three bites tops.

They are in Emeryville Mondays (Hollis & 53rd) & Wednesdays (Hollis & 45th) from 11:30 - 1:30 . . . should there be another listing so their E-ville location is more prominent? Anyway, I got there a little after 1pm and they had 4 available buns. Pork Belly, Sesame Chicken, Pulled Pork, and Tofu with Duck & Lions Head Meatballs sold out. It looks like the Pulled Pork has taken the place of the sausage & egg variant on the menu. Anyway, I got one of each pork in a steamed bun. (See my dark blurry pic) Visually the Pork Belly with Daikon reminded me of the Momofuku Pork Bun with daikon instead of cucumber. The flavor was good, but the meat a little dry and tough in spots. The Pulled Pork was much better for me. The spicing seemed similar to the pork belly, but was much juicier. The cabbage & mustard seeds added a good contrast . . . I just wish there was more of it in the bun. Decent stuff, but at $2.95 per bun, they seemed a little overpriced for their small size (2-3 bites). $1.25 street tacos have ruined food truck pricing for me!!

I went to Arizona last November and had these pork belly buns. They were amazingly good! Hearing that Chairman Bao had these too I have been dying to try them out. I ordered the The Pork Belly with the pickled radish. It was 3.75 for steamed. Man was it tiny! It was 6 something for baked. God I hope it was bigger than the steam one. It wasn't bad but it wasn't amazing either. The reason for the two stars is that after 90 minutes of eating it I had a stomachache. I can't be sure it was the bao but I didn't eat anything after wards. I am happy I tried it but I don't know if I am willing to pay $3.75 for another one.

I don't know what I was thinking, not yelping this place before I walked uphill (in heels!) to go try some of these buns. ?I guess when I was thinking buns I was thinking those big buns you get when you go to Dim Sum (Cha Siu Bao? Please correct me if I spelled that wrong or if I'm just plain wrong). ?So when I departed I only brought enough cash for one thinking that the portion would surely suffice. ?Dead wrong. Oh no, my friends. ?These are not THOSE buns. ?These are little fold-y buns. ?Delicious, but not what I was expecting. ?I rolled up to the truck when it was parked at Sabin Alley one day and was delighted to find only a few people in line. ?That huge hill must be a deterrent to the lazy (usually me, but my addiction to trying new street carts was motivation enough). ?I ordered a pork belly bun from the brightly colored truck (sooo cool, but the ordering and pick up windows are kind of high, not good for the short statured). ?And it was GOOD. ?If you don't like pork belly it might not be your thing. ?Next time I'm getting two! My coworkers each got a different kind. ?One got tofu, one got the chicken version and everyone was super satisfied with their meals and couldn't stop thanking me for telling them about this super secret truck (patting myself on the back while typing is hard!) You can also get a large version of the bun that I definitely want to try, but that whole walk uphill...

SO I think I'm over this whole food truck thing after this last experience... I tried Chairman Bao last week when it came to Mission Bay for the day. Showed up at 12:45 hoping to get lunch and take it back for my 1:30 meeting (I was all of a block away from my office). It didn't happen. I was meeting some coworkers, and I got there first so I grabbed a spot in line and waited for them. There were probably about thirty people ahead of me in line. At 1:15 there were still a dozen people in front of me, and things clearly were not moving along, so I asked my coworkers to put in my order and bring it back to the office for me, which they were kind enough to do. My meeting was done (at 2:00) before they got back. WTF? The buns were tasty enough, but suffered from major issues with being too messy to eat easily; if I had been walking down the street trying to eat this food instead of sitting down, things probably would have been a disaster. Chairman Bao, this is not how you run a food truck. It shouldn't take forty-five minutes to get to the head of the line and place your order, and then a further half hour to actually get said food. ESPECIALLY not when your menu offers all of six freaking items. Le Truc, for comparison, offers twice as many menu items and managed to get me from standing at the back of the line to having food in my hand in 30 minutes, and this was on the day that the Food Network was there doing a special on them. I'm massively disappointed with the service here, especially when the food is tasty and the truck is so damn hyped up. I won't be back until I hear that they've gotten a handle on their service issues.

The first time I tried this truck I stood in line for about 40 mins and let me tell you, after that first bit of pork belly stream bun heaven, that 40 min wait was worth every minute! Chairman Bao has been deliciously consistent ever since I first visited over a year ago and only keeps getting better with them perfecting their flavors. And if mouth watering melting pork fat isn't your thing then there are still plenty of options for you! Garlic tofu, Braised Pork, Duck and Chicken to tantalize your taste buds. Though...... you could never go wrong with some succulent pig.

I wait almost an hour for these baos at San Jose Eats, luckily I was the 5th person in line. Yes, it still took an hour!! I waited before the truck even showed up and they still ran out of pork belly. ?So we ended up ordering the steamed Red Sesame Chicken bao and baked Braised Pork bun. Baked buns are $6.25 and steamed are $3.25. The steamed ones are a bit smaller and the baked ones almost looks like a hamburger bun. The baos were interesting, not your typical Chinese bao. They're creative and the flavors are unique. The red sesame chicken was soft, but a bit too spicy for me. It's topped off with fresh cucumbers and carrot slices. The braised pork bun was better in my opinion, especially if you don't like your food spicy. The braised pork meat was soft and fresh and it was topped off with pickled daikon an mustard seeds and lettuce.

This food truck always has the longest queue and for good reasons. Pork Belly bun! You can't really go wrong with pork belly but the sourness of pickled daikon brings out the fat flavor even more. Both pulled pork and red sesame chicken are good but not as good as I'd skip them and get the pork belly instead. The red sesame chicken has good medium kick of spiciness to it so beware. Crispy skin of the tofu is really thin but still good nonetheless. I'd prefer this over pulled pork and chicken. Steamed (taco size) or Baked (burger size)? If you don't care either way, baked bun definitely give you more filling for the buck. If it's your first time, you'd probably get 1 steamed bun of each fillings. Then come back with the same conclusion as mine just like my friends did.

I'm surprised it's taken me so long to review Chairman Bao. ?I've been to this truck at least 3 times and each time it's been consistently good. ?Because I don't eat meat, I get the steamed tofu buns and they're always delicious. ?Crispy tofu with fresh mustard greens and a garlic sauce... yummy! I think the steamed buns are kind of pricey for what you get, as I could easily eat like 3 or 4 of them, but I recently tried a baked tofu bun and I found it to be cost effective because it totally filled me up. ?The wonton chips are good, at first, but they're really salty. ?I can't vouch for the pork belly, but everyone I know who's tried it basically says it's a mind blowing experience.

Same profane joy at Off The Grid 9/30/10, only this time it was a spicy Duck Confit w/ Mango. This time, it was the $9 deal that included a Shave Ice Juice w/Tapioca. My flavor was Pineapple and Salted Caramel. It tasted familiar, but I couldn't put my finger on it. My wife identified the flavor profile immediately - PINEAPPLE UPSIDE-DOWN CAKE! In a refreshing drink form. That's it. I'm attaching my own rickshaw to the back of this truck.

I've been to a few functions where the chairman was slanging his warm buns as if he was working a seedy corner in the tenderloin. My bad, i think every corner is a seedy one in the loin. I never knew what "bao buns" were, until yesterday. But yesterday was a glorious day. Birds were singing, the sun was out and Bao was serving up the buns at Off the Grid: Civic Center. I ordered the baked braised pork bun. My fiancee ordered the red sesame chicken. oh em gee Suddenly everything made sense. The line that usually accompanies the Chairman Bao truck now, of course makes perfect sense. But after enjoying this hot, fresh, surprisingly light, perfectly cooked manna from heaven EVERYTHING made sense. Everything was right with the world and I found myself grateful for every blessing in my life. I love me some Bao buns. I've converted into the Bao doctrine.

Disclaimer: ?I hate hipsters and the inconvenience of food trucks. ?(Loved the trucks when I was spending time in SOMA and would happen across them, but trekking around and then finding out that they are out of what you want is very frustrating. ?Nob Hill is great for many things, not so much food trucks.)

Tried 2 of the steamed buns -- chicken and tofu. Both were delicious, though I wish I had tried the pork one, as well. Spicy chicken steamed bun: delicious, not too spicy; the bun complements the chicken quite well, and the sesame sauce was a nice touch. Miso tofu steamed bun: definitely try this one, even if you don't like tofu -- doesn't taste much like tofu at all! Would be better if it had a little more heat, but they had sriracha for those who wanted some added spice! Overall very good, and at a good price for trying a couple of the different kinds. Would definitely go back to try the others!

Thoroughly impressed with this food truck! I got to go during Off The Grid and they were the only trucked with a roped off line, and deservingly so. I felt so bad for JapaCurry next door, who had no line at all! Anyways, it's definitely pricey for street food, but the ingredients are solid. They didn't have the Duck Confit that day so I was a bit sad, soI opted for the Tender Pork Belly with Daikon in a steamed bun and my bf had the Rosemary Chicken in a baked bun (which was huge, kind of like a burger). Glad we tried out both types of buns; I think the baked bun is better for meats with lots of sauce (baked bun soaks it up) and the steamed bun is better for when the taste of the meat is the star. I wouldn't stray too far from the truck after you order; they may expedite your order if other people's orders contain items that are still cooking, your order was small, etc. The price does make me question if this place is worth it, so far now, I'll think of it as a treat. Definitely beats the Kogi Truck of LA-- When I was attending UCLA, there was a lot of hype around Kogi so you'd see all these people chase after it around the campus-- which was not worth it at all. I'd run around for Chairman Bao though.

Like others have said--great concept. But as many brownie points they get from me for that, they still haven't won me over with execution. I had the Chinese Sausage and the Duck Confit because they ran out of the Pork Belly. The Chinese Sausage needed more sausage and less hoisin sauce. It's WAY too much hoisin sauce for healthy consumption--probably enough for a whole month. And it really pulls away from the flavor that's supposed to stand out--the chinese sausage!! The duck confit was alright--I'm not crazy about the spicy sauce (a bit too thick and creamy for me), but I guess it goes fairly nice with the mango. I also had the green tea matcha mango iced drink... this was the best thing I had but it's no new concept--there's a place in Oakland chinatown that does this really well already. I think this place has potential, but for now I haven't bought into the hype. I'll be back sometime--until then, Chairman Bao, keep on truckin'...

A few things you should know about Chairman Bao: Yes, their buns are expensive. You are not shopping in some hole in the wall in Chinatown. If you want something in your bun that doesn't resemble the reject meat pile at Ranch 99 that they charge you $1 less per pound for, then you'd better show up knowing that you're going to shell out a little more. Deal with it. No, this isn't "real" bao. There is no one making these buns with love. They come from a package. Yes, they are delicious, no, they are not bao. Now that we've cleared up those misconceptions, let's get to the good stuff. This place is delicious. Their full menu wasn't up because I was at Sunday Streets, but I had the steamed buns and they were delicious. I split the meal (2 buns + drink) with a friend, and we got the pork belly with daikon and the duck with mango. Both were really tasty. The pork belly had an exceptionally fatty cut of pork, and with the daikon, the combination was unbeatable. I loved the duck with mango, and even though I thought the combination was odd to begin with, I took a bite and all my doubts disappeared. Nom. They get extra bonus points for having delicious shaved ice drinks. I got the Ginger Lychee and it had chunks of lychee in it with some boba. Easily worth the money we paid. If this happens to be in the vicinity again, I will most definitely pay it a visit. The wait was a little long, but it was well worth it.

The eBay people were out there with video cameras & showed or just talked to people about eBay app for their smartphone. We could pick a FREE drink (strawberry/coconut) or ginger/lychee) & FREE chips. ?I thought that was it, but then there was someone that passed out a container. ?Inside the container was 2 steamed buns: spicy chicken w/ bok choy & a cabbage/meat bun. ?Liked them all.

This used to be my favorite food truck. I'm not eager to try food trucks now, as I usually find them to be overpriced and overly hyped. I came back to the Chairman for my fourth visit last week. The line was still pretty long, but it moved a lot faster than I remembered, probably because they didn't have their shaved fruit drinks that I loved. I asked about them and was told that they only serve them on "special days." I also didn't see the duck confit bun on the menu. Since it was a Friday during Lent, I could only order the garlic tofu bun ($3.25 for steamed). It did not hold a candle to the pork and duck buns. I wouldn't order them again, even on a day when I am not allowed to eat meat. I don't know, the meat buns have such interesting flavor and texture profiles and the tofu one was sort of soft and mushy, with the garlic overpowering and the miso in the greens nowhere to be found.

Although my two cents on what Chairman Bao has to offer will probably be lost in an ocean of similar feelings, the tenderness of the pork belly is compelling me to join the chorus. Sure, Chairman Bao usually has the longest lines at any food truck gathering. And sure, the buns are a lot more expensive than the buns you can purchase at your neighborhood Chinese bakery. Once you bite into the sweetly glazed bun and melt-in-your mouth pork belly bun, you will think yourself crazy for ever having doubts. The daikon brings a different dynamic to the swirl of flavors in your mouth, but you can easily imagine eating the bun without it. ? Immediately upon finishing, you will either consider rejoining the line or daydream about the next opportunity for you to sink your teeth into the pork belly bun and be carried away by its potential.

I've had Chairman Bao's several times at Off The Grid events. Tonight we saw them at the Gourmet Food Truck event in Pleasanton at the fairgrounds. We were so excited to hear they were going to be there, we arrived at the event early. They always have a huge line when we see them at Off the Grid when they are Ft. Mason so we wanted to be early. Being early paid off because we were able to get our favorite - the duck confit buns. It was a little different than we've had before. It didn't have the green onions and the duck was pressed instead of shredded. I like it better the original way but this was still good - the other is just better. Previous times we also tried the pork belly buns and that is also very good. To the guy that took our order - "FIGHT ON!"

In conclusion, all hail the godlike Chairman Bao. ?Coming soon to a peninsula location near you.

I came here alone while I had some idle time in the city and did I feel like a super fatty mcfatty mcfatty for doing so? ?Definitely. ?But was it worth it??! TOTALLY. ?I think I was the only person there by myself who was not picking up food for the office/friends. ?BUT Yelp readers, this is why my solitude was justified: ? 1. This is finger food of the highest caliber. ?Sumptuous meats (pork belly and duck confit are amazing) and fresh vegetables (baby bok and pickled daikon) combined and sandwiched into a fresh Chinese style steamed roll serve as a totally awesome reminder of the more authentic dishes natives like myself love and also as a gentle introduction to Asian snacks for those less fortunate and less Chinese. 2. The shaved ice/jelly/boba drinks are different. ?Salted ginger with little tiny cubes of lychee jelly and boba on the bottom? ?More please. ?Unlike anything I've ever had at any Asian tea shop. ? 3. Have you all seen the Chairman truck? ?That truck is seriously just really awesome to look at. ?I dont think any other Bay Area food truck has been as successful in its viral marketing using the truck itself. ?Very commendable. Minus 1 star for the wait time, but they do their best and I could tell the service staff was really stressed out trying to bring out all the food as fast as possible. ?I don't understand why the girl in the front passing out all the food is there though. I didn't find her to facilitate the process all that much. I will admit that maybe this concept is a bit overrated, and more delicious Chinese food can be found easily in SF at a smaller cost with only a fraction of the wait time, but I have to commend the homies/comrades over at Mobi Munch for doing such an excellent job with its marketing for this truck. ?After all, the long lines that have since become a fixture to the truck aren't there for no reason. ?All hail the Chairman!

There are few food trucks out there that actually deserve to get caught up in the food truck craze. Chairman Bao is one of them. It does Chinese style "tacos" and "sandwiches" and it does it well. What you get is either a peking duck style steamed bun, or a baked (think Chinatown Bakery style) bun (or bow), and you got your fixings: Pork Belly, Braised Pork, and Red Seasame Chicken. Style-wise: I prefer the steamed bun, its a smaller portion and much easier to eat. When you bite into the baked bun, everything seems to gush out, and you're left holding an oily mes. Plus! It's cheaper. Fixings-wise: I prefer the Braised ?Pork or the Red Seasame Chicken. The latter is a bit spicy, from I remember, which I like...think Thai-influence when you're eating it. The Pork Belly, unfortunately, its quite a fatty and greasy mess. Maybe it's just me, but I don't enjoy fatty pork. (I don't like Roli Roti's Porchetta either). Forget about all the other food trucks jumping onto the food truck craze, Chairman Bao is the real deal.

Glad these guys made it down to San Jose for Movable Feast. ?I have been wanting to try them for a while, and was not disappointed. We had both the braised pork and the pork belly bun. ?One was baked, one was steamed. ?There is a huge difference between the two. ?The steamed is kind of mushy, and a lot smaller. ?The baked is way more flavorful, and bigger! ? I can see why these guys are popular - They definitely have something "different" going on in a saturated food truck market, and they have quick, friendly service with very good food. Only downside was not much selection (two pork, one chicken), and it was a little expensive. ?But, I would definitely get a baked bun again if I saw the truck. ?Pass on the steam, though.

A-MAZING! Whenever I go to Chinese restaurants with my family, one of my favorite dishes is the roast duck buns with hoisin sauce and shrimp chips on the side. Chairman Bao is serves buns just like that, but with a twist. My favorite is the Pork Belly w/ Daikon Radish bun, followed by Roast Duck w/ Mango. The pork belly melts in your mouth and the daikon radish gives a little zing to each bite! Nom nom noms. They're at Off The Grid every week, but the line is ridiculously long. If you're in the city a lot, I suggest hunting them down on other days where they camp out in front of various bars and shops because the line is shorter and that's always a good thing, cause girrrrrrl I'm ain't tryna wait foreva for my buns, I wants it NOW! If you must, go to OTG early or split up with friends and choose who has to be the unlucky one to wait in that super-long line while the rest of your crew roams around to check out other trucks haha.

I stopped at the Chairman's truck in San Ramon at lunchtime. ?Independent of my early arrival, the lines weren't as bad as I heard they were at Off the Grid. I got the garlic tofu/miso buns, and considering they put a soft, panko-coated tofu steak in each steamed bun, the steamed ones were better, food ratio-wise, than the baked ones. The Chairman's buns are filling and good. ?I really want to give them five stars for their punny establishment and appropriate cart art, but the token vegetarian option could have both more garlic and more crispiness. With coconut water, my tofu buns made for a solid meal and were worth the wait.

I don't just love the clever play on its name: Chairman Bao, the food justifies its ridiculous wrapping and looping line too. ?Baked buns each for $6 may look small, but pretty sure caloric-wise one is enough for your lunch. ?I was fortunate enough to be able to try 4 different kinds thanks to having 3 lunch companions. ? Pork belly with daikon is so fatty and so wrong but the pickled tangy daikon makes you forget you are swallowing fat one mouthful after another. Braised pork has the perfect balance of flavors---most of us thought that was our favorite. Chicken sounded super boring but was actually really good. ?Also full of strong but well-balanced flavors. Tofu is probably the most boring of them all, but it was kinda nice to have something a little more subtle and mild after the other strong-flavored buns. The buns themselves are quite spectacular: doughy but not soggy and can withstand the sauce from the fillings. ? My only recommendation is to arrive early and bring your own knife if you intend to share. ?Trying to tear those bad boys apart using bare hands is virtually impossible.

Do yourself a favor, if you want to order multiple flavors..buy the steamed buns because the baked buns are frikken HUGE/ like "super size me" status. the red sesame chicken was spicy goodness. The addition of carrots and cucumber added a cool sweet flavor..ingenious combination and i absolutely loved it! but unfortunately I ate it first, got incredibly full and couldn't really enjoy the pork belly bun so i had to pass it off to someone else. chairman bao FTW!

HMPH drove away and didn't see me walking toward the truck! jerks lol that was my first experience. Today they just happened to be where I was shopping with my dad. ?We decided to give it a try. Ordered (from what they had left) all baked buns: -Pork belly -pulled pork -duck with mango -Pinapple Salted Caramel I wanted to try the steamed buns and the lion's head. ?My dad was pretty much saying all the good about them. Like how they're really good at fusing the two cultures together. ?American (hamburger) and Asian (lion's head meat ball, and pork belly) foods together. It's like adapting and being able to create something that maybe the hipsters would like to eat. I still think food truck food should not be at such a high price. $9 for buns and a drink? I know this is "gourmet" or whatever but come on. There are way better Chinese buns out there. AND TO CHARGE ME TAX?! on your fancy POS system!!! geezz Anyway that's not all that made my rating for here go down. The food was edible, nothing to write home about. I like my pork belly either juicy or fried crispy. It was neither.. the daikon on it was nice. The Duck had a stem of some plant in it.. and a small bone.. -_- stem must have dropped into the truck while they were prepping or something. I think the one i liked most was probably the pulled pork for the dressing on the salad/coleslaw. I felt like the buns were nothing special (maybe because i grew up on fresh baked bbq pork buns)..so the steamed one would have been more interesting with these ingredients. Pineapple Salted Caramel. It was quite tart! I couldn't pick up the salted caramel part. But i did pick up on the ginger. Overall it's a nice try, colorful truck, interesting presentation of ingredients and drinks. But i won't go out of my way to try it or buy it.

I get so excited when I see the big panda truck outside my office. ?First of all, who doesn't love a panda anything? ?Secondly, yummy food. ?And lastly I discovered today - pretty fun drinks as well! The duck is my favorite. ?I've tried the steamed chicken, the steamed pork belly and they were both just "eh" for me. ?But the duck....oh..the mango and the duck and the sauce...*drool* so good! ?The baked bun duck is actually the best, but the steamed bun duck is good too - I switch back and forth depending on my mood. ?Today I also tried the strawberry coconut drink and though it's not like the best drink I've ever had, it is still a yummy little after lunch snack to get me through the rest of the afternoon. For $9 you can get: 2 steamed buns + icy bevy -or- 1 baked bun + icy bevy

After weeks of anticipation, the day has finally come! The food options near my office are really... eh, and get old after just a short while. So, my coworker and I are always scanning the foodtruck map. We've been hoping the chairman would stop by for weeks. So needless to say we were entirely too excited and ran up to the truck giggling like schoolgirls. We had steamed buns, I tried the pulled pork, duck, and sesame chicken. At 2.95 each it made a filling but totally reasonably priced lunch. I gotta say, the fatty inside of me would have had 4 or 5 of those things because they are delicious! The steamed buns are light and fluffy. All the meat was cooked to melt-in-your-mouth perfection, the seasonings are unique and brilliantly paired with their meats; the greens on the sesame chicken were fabulous, as was the cabbage and mustard seed on the pork. Out of the three I had, the pulled pork and the duck were my favorites. The mango and onion on the duck, with a hint of ginger, is something I'd eat over and over again. My coworker also says the pork belly was fabulous. One thing - if only they had a sweet bun or a sesame ball or something. That would just make the whole experience utterly complete.

Went to Off the Grid at the Chronicle Building. We were like the 10th in line and waited an hour. CBBT had the longest line. This gave me time to look at the menu and decide on what I wanted. Pork belly- steamed $3.75 pulled pork- steamed $3.75 red sesame chicken- baked $6 matcha pina colada- $2.50 bao chips- $2.50 First off....what is with the huge price difference with steamed and baked? When I buy bbq pork buns whether steamed or baked, I pay no more than $1. I'm just saying............ Pork belly: Reading another review someone said they got slabs of pork belly. I only got two slices. What's up with that? It was crunchy and fatty and good with the sauce in the bun. The bun was thin flat pancake like. So it looked like a tiny taco. Pulled pork- yuck! Please pass on this. Red sesame chicken- spicy!!! I don't ?think they mentioned that this was spicy. Ok red = spicy. I'm thinking Chinese here so I was thinking of the red bean curd in brine. It's the same baked bbq pork bun was was sliced in half. Kinda like a hamburger. Matcha pina colada- home made and this is a must. bao chips- fried wonton chips, tiny strips of nori, tons of salt and spice. It was ok. Oh yeah....the girl short changed me! All in all this was a little bit on the pricey side for such tiny portions. No I didn't eat all this by myself. I had the pork belly and half of the pulled pork. Not filling at all. Would I go back? Yes. For the pork belly, matcha pina colada, and they had another drink I didn't see on the menu but saw people with. It was a yellowish/clear drink. i think there was mixed fruit cocktail in there.

So I've tried all 3 types of steamed buns now, there's the pork belly, red sesame, and pulled pork. As everyone's been saying the pork belly one is the BEST!! Red sesame 2nd, and pulled pork 3rd. The very first time I had Chairman Bao was the pork belly bun and at first, you look at the little guy and think "$4 FOR THIISS?!" But once I put that puppy in my mouth...it had me speechless! I scarfed it down so fast I think I pulled a neck muscle, and choked a little bit too. Hands down, TOP 3 Best Foods I've Ever Eaten! I try to catch them at least once a month, but with my most recent visit I noticed they were becoming more and more unimpressive. I even brought one home for my brother to try (it was his first time having Chairman Bao) and even he said "it was just ok." Sadly, I had to agree. But I think everyone should try Chairman Bao for themselves at least once!! It's certainly worth the $3.75 to try it yourself, and you just might dazzle your taste buds. But be warned, chew your food carefully!!!

Chairman Bao offers delicious creations served on steamed or baked buns. They have always sold out when they were selling at China Basin. Everything I have tried was good (pulled pork, pork belly, red sesame chicken) but the proportion are on the small size so they're a little overpriced. My favorite was the red sesame chicken. The steamed buns are the size of street tacos and the baked buns are the size of a small sandwich.

I finally got a hold of the famous Chariman Bao Bun Truck! It really is too bad that it had to be during the infamous and notorious SJEats Movable Feast Failure... -------- Food: Out of four possible stars: four stars. Having grown up on Taiwanese buns and bread, I've searched long and hard for steamed buns of equal caliber. I finally found night market style buns at Chairman Bao. On top of that, the bun I ordered had pork belly and pickled daikon. What a perfect balance. A subtle sweetness from the bun, savory pork belly and cool crisp pickled daikon? I see where Chairman Bao's fame comes from. -------- Miscellaneous: Out of one possible star: one star. I had to try very hard to hold back my utter distaste and hatred for that bastard devil Mao... but Chairman Bao's decor is beyond cute! And I'm a guy, so you KNOW my usage of "cute" is appropriate. I mean, it is a panda! The line was stupid long (one hour long wait), but that wasn't Chairman Bao's fault, but rather SJEats fault. If I could review SJEats, that is where stars would be docked.

Tried this place for a work function a bit ago. ?I remember they offered up a handful of different fillings and you could choose either a steamed or baked bun. ?Sadly they only had steamed buns when I rolled around so bear that in mind. ?Now onto the food. The buns that stood out for me: 1. Pork Belly Come on of course. ?It's freakin pork belly. ?Sorry people...fat is good for you! ?Eat it! ?The pork belly is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. ?I also liked the homemade daikon pickles that go on top of the pork belly...cripsy, sweet, sour...yum. ?Gimme a jar of that to go. ?You can throw in a jar of pork belly too while you're at it. 2. Tofu Yes! ?I know it's not paleo, but I had to try it...and I actually liked it 2nd best. ?Hats off to you Chairman Bao. ?If I had to bet on my order of buns I would have lost due to this upset. ?The tofu was very flavorful. ?Way Awesome. 3. Braised Pork Oh Braised Pork...you were supposed to be #2. ?It was good, but just didn't have the same flavor impact as the Pork Belly and the Tofu. Rest: Didn't really stand out to me...besides at these prices do you want to waste your time with anything lower than 3rd place? So if it were so good why 3 stars? ?I want to be fair and personally if I had to pay for the meal I had I'd probably have a little sticker shock. ?I could easily eat 6 to 8 buns for a meal. ?That adds up fast. ?Great buns, but not an everyday kinda thing for me.

I'm sorry Chairman Bao, I really wanted to like you. ?After seeing you drive past me while I looked out the window on my elliptical at 24 Hour Fitness, I finally got my chance to try you outside of John Colins last Thursday night. ? PRICING: $5.75 for the baked buns, $2.95 for the steamed buns Accepts cash and credit cards BUNS: I got my chance to try 4 buns (I was hungry!!) and I was majorly disappointed as the buns lacked authenticity and were small (think 3 bites and you're done). ?In my opinion, most of the buns were a great idea, but poor execution on how they actually tasted. *Tender Pork Belly with Pickled Daikon - It was okay. ?Normally I'm not a fan of daikon, but it added the extra crunch to the bun. ?The pork belly lacked tenderness and was a bit on the dry side. *Red Sesame Chicken with Scallion & Bok Choy - Good. ?I got this bun by mistake but it was the one I liked the best. ?The chicken marinated in red sesame had tons of flavor and the scallions and bok choy added a slight crisp. *Lions Head Meatball with Fresh Kim Chee - Probably my least favorite. ?The bun consisted of two small meatballs (I wouldn't even classify them as lions head) which had little flavor and soggy kim chee that didn't have the spice kick like it should. *Pulled Pork with Savory Cabbage & Preserved Mustard Seed - My friend didn't like this much, but I thought it was okay and had more flavor than the lions head one I had first. ?The mustard seed added a nice flavor to the pork and cabbage.

THE CHAIRMANS BUNS WERE SO DELICATE WHEN I TOOK A BITE TO EAT IN BETWEEN Amazing buns that melts in your mouth. Friends and i were at Off The Grid and was recommended from a friend's past experience that we wait in the long line to get some. The line is always ridiculous rapping around each other and randoms trying to cut. Its all worth the wait but when you get up the front of the line... ORDER EVERYTHING. thats what we did. We ordered every single bun and shared it amongst our group. Why only order two or three... why not alot. You obviously waited in a long like for oh... 30 - 45 minutes, you might as well go all out. ALWAYS GET STEAMED ($2.95 per bun) - Tender pork Belly with pickled diakes, very delicious but the pork belly was kind of fatty and fattening - Red seasame chicken with Scalion and Bak Choy, flavorful and delicious - Chinese Spiced Duck with Fresh Mango Salad, uhm i dont eat duck. - Lions Head Meatball with fresh kim chee, not available - chinese sausage and egg sandwhich with Hoisin, was not available - Crispy Garlic Tufo with Miso greens, was not available I can eat the bun by itself.... its so damn good. Will i be back? Yes to get me some "Lions Head Meatball with Fresh Kimchee" bun, if available. Until the next review.........

Ever been to a Chinese or Vietnamese wedding banquet? Well then you know what I'm talking about when I say that out of the multi-course dinner extravaganza, the roasted Peking duck smeared with hoisin sauce and tucked into a white, steamed bun is one of my faves. Who knew the Peking duck version could be topped, let alone by a food truck? Thanks to the Chairman, I don't have to wait to be invited to an Asian wedding to get my hands on these hot buns. Chairman Bao's savory buns are stalk-worthy. I had my first taste at the Eat Real Festival and now I can satisfy my cravings whenever they park their sweet little buns over on 8th and Folsom Streets. The steamed buns with Chinese spiced duck confit with mango salad and the pulled pork with cabbage and mustard seed are good, but the pork belly with pickled daikon is THE ULTIMATE. Baoism is one ideology I can support and the Chairman has officially converted me into a Baoist.

First off, as others have written, the Chairman is definitely not cheap. I think their stuff, especially the baked buns, is priced pretty high. That said, I liked the two steamed buns I had (crispy tofu and pork belly), though I was surprised that they looked like tacos. I may be a white girl, but I know that steamed buns are usually self contained, not taco-shaped! I did love the pickled vegetables in the baos. They were a nice touch. The standout was the ginger lemonade with lychee jelly drink -- ?to die for!!

Once again back ?again at OtG: Fort Mason, but early this time. ?This time around the Lenten season was over and now to tackle the rest of the menu. The line for the truck was still pretty long even though OtG just barely started. I would say I waited in like for about 30 minutes. This time I made sure the full menu was going to be available. The last time I was here, choices of menu items became very scares. When I got to finally order, I ordered: 2 Steamed and 1 baked bun pork belly with pickled daikon. And 1 Baked bun with braised pork. Oh yeah, they ?had a six bun maximum order. ?Good thing I was in the limits of the order. The order was made fairly quickly, I'd say about 5 minutes. When I picked up the order and distributed ?them among our party, the buns looked and smelled very good. The braised pork bun I order did not lack any meat all. As took the first bite of the bun, the pork ?was tender but a bit to salty for my taste. As for the other orders, I sampled them as well. The pork belly tasted pretty good but didn't eat much of it. I'm not really into eating animal fat since I was raised on trimming fat off all the food I ate. Plus, if you ate this everyday you'll be cutting your life expectancy very short. I just had to try this place out. My overall verdict is Over hyped.

3.75 steamed= small tasting size 6.75 baked ? ? = sandwich size okay so let's talk pork belly baked bun sandwich size. omgoodness....okay so here it is play by play. first off, they use the baked chinese classic sweet bun...cut in half....grilled on each side for sweetness and a light crisp. then it is loaded with sweet pickled daikon with chives (the pickle is amazing..is it mustard seed? i dunno but the taste is so flavorful) and then stacked thick pieces of pork belly in a light char-su sauce (chinese bbq pork flavor) they really do not skimp with the meat!!! this is a really different treat. very cool. i dig it. also for vegetable-tarians there is a garlic tofu option that sounded amazing!!!

Hyped? Hecks yeah. Worth the hype? ?My mouth is still singing. ?Well, it's more like it's sort of... vibrating. I think this is a reaction to the amount of salt that I just ingested, but odd bodily reactions are worth the food at this truck. With two Chairman's Buns (the pork belly and the duck) and a bag of won-tonny, seaweed sprinkled, sodium soaked chips, I was completely satisfied. Those buns may look small, but they're packing. The Bao truck succeeds by serving up a fantastic combination of flavor and texture. ?The food is just unique enough to raise your eyebrows, but without losing a certain comfort-food quality that makes you close your eyes and smack your smiling lips. And salt. ?Mmmm, salt.

Strange how the name is the chairman truck instead of Chairman Bao but this food truck is amazing! I have heard a lot about this truck at off the grid and saw the ridiculous line with a velvet rope. But after trying the food, I can see why people wait. Food: Pork Belly- Amazing! The pork belly is tender but not too fat and it works very well with the daikon that comes with it. Braised pork- Very good The steamed bun is the size of a taco and the baked is the size of a BBQ pork bun. Highly recommended but I would suggest to try this truck at truck stop early because the line is more reasonable!

One Word: OVERRATED.. Sorry folks.. After waiting for 2 hours for these so called 100 things before you die food SF list, it was definitely not the case.....$3.75 for steamed buns... $6.00 for Baked buns... overpriced... Maybe next time I will try the duck one, which I am sure I will enjoy more than the pork ones... I should of gone to a chinese restaurant to get peking duck, which would hit the spot more!

Chairman Bao was one of two food trucks at an after party my company hosted. Devon helped coordinate beforehand. She was very laid back, and I was initially a little nervous about execution, but I needn't have worried -- the team was friendly and prompt the night of the event, and the food was delicious. the Garlic Tofu bun was all I indulged in myself, but from the word of mouth at the party, everything was perfection. Chairman was a highlight for many, and more than one local at the party mentioned the truck was one of their absolute favorites. Thanks, guys, for a great night!

I was really wary about the food here since a couple of my friends said their food was too salty. ?I was down the street from john collins for an event and since I haven't eaten dinner I decided to go try the baos. I walked on over to chairman bao and asked "eric" what was the most popular. ?their two most popular was the pork belly and duck confit which were both sold out. ?dangit! ?oh well, so I decided to try the lion head meat ball and the sesame chicken on the steamed buns. ?the lion head meat ball was my favorite out of the two. ?I really liked both items, both had full flavor and wasn't salty at all. ?there was a nice mix of textures to them. ?the meat was nice and moist while the veggies were crunchy on a soft bun, a nice compliment. ? plus, eric was really friendly. ?he came out of the truck and talked to me about "street food business". ?I'll definitely come back to try their other items, hopefully the pork belly and the duck confit. ? chairman bao, I "BAO" to you!

Hearing the ice cream truck drive around my neighborhood used to make me GIDDY! With the popularity of food stands, carts, and trucks, I get super giddy just to see what treats they have in store for me and following them on Twitter just to see where they're at? Adds to the excitement...just a little. I wasn't expecting much from the Chairman Bao Bun truck since I've never heard of it before. There was a massive line forming and I had sent my partner-in-food to stand in line as I was waiting for another order from another vendor. When I came back, I was disappointed that my partner-in-food had already ordered. Eeek, but...but I wanted to choose what I wanted to order *sigh*bygones*. In his defense, he did quite well actually and ordered what I would've ordered. It was a nice surprise to see these 3 mini open face buns. We had the duck confit with mango salsa--I love duck and mango so this one was amazing to me. What an awesome combination--the saltyness of the duck with the sweetness of the mango. YUUUM. We also had the red sesame chicken w/ scallion and bok choy--this was proabably the most flavorful. I really enjoyed this bun. The 3rd bun was the pork belly with daikon--this one was OK to me. I preferred the first two but overall they were all pretty tasty little things. Too bad the portions were so small. Next time, I will definitely order 3 of each--or maybe 4 of each. Yes, much better. The ice cream truck has been replaced when it comes to the giddy factor but in some ways it's still the same. As children we used to run after ice cream trucks, now, we have to wait for the Twitter sign and we're off! So sad...

3.5 I want to round up, but for 1 - it's sort of messy, 2 - it's kind of pricey 3 - it's from a food truck, so you never know where they will be. ?not dinging a star for number 3 just saying... Got the baked one with Duck and mango. ?Pretty tastey! ?Only bummer was that it falls apart, but that's a good problem since that means they gave a lot of meat. ?Might have been a tad bit too much on the spicey side for me, but I really like the concept. ?Could afford to come down a dollar or two. ?(yeah, I'm semi stingy sometimes, but c'mon! ?honestly in Chinatown it'd probably be cheaper)

The lines are always ridiculous, but I really believe that Chairman Bao lives up to its hype. If you see Chairman Bao at a food truck festival, always head there first because the line WILL multiply. At $3.25 per steamed bao, the price definitely adds up quick, but the preparation and quality is good. The pork belly is tender, fatty, crunchy. I'm not a big fan of biting into a piece of fat, but this pork belly has a nice balance of textures. The miso vegetables & tofu bao is no token vegetarian option; it's delicious in its own right. Nice greens dressed in miso, with a lightly fried tofu steak. I had the baked bao once, but I wasn't much of a fan. I thought it would be liked the baked char siu bao; however, it was basically the filling between what very much resembled a hamburger bun.

The line for Chairman Bao was long and it may have been hyped, man, I thought it was pretty tasty. The chicken was pretty good, but oh my, the pork belly. Yes, pork belly. You can never go wrong with pork belly. Maybe it is hyped, but I think having a "taco" made with a Chinese bun was pretty cool in my eyes and it tasted good enough for me.

What can I say that hasn't been said? Me and my buddies went over to the Haight meetup of food trucks, and wow! It was a winter wonderland of foodie goodness. Our first stop was Chairman Bao. I had the duck confit bun, and it was delicious! I wish I could have tried more buns, but there was much other food truck goodness to be had and I didn't want to fill myself up. Chairman Bao, if this is the kind of food that a devotion to Communism brings, then consider this my official good-bye to Capitalism! (lol jk)

I liked the pulled pork steam bun. The pork belly was good, but the pulled pork is better C.B. should list their prices WITH tax. You throw people off by adding tax and then they have to scrounge for change, slowing down the line. They have to earn their living, and the "bao" is expensive. $2.95+tx for steamed.

Chairman Bao is by far the best food truck out there. The Pork Belly bun (steamed or baked) is one of the best things I've ever had, and I'm a serious foodie. The mix between the salty and savory of the pork belly with the sweet and crunchy of the pickled daikon? Forget about it! I seriously ate this 2 nights in a row (Moveable Feast WG and Quakes game) and could have easily gone back for more. The employees are really friendly too, always good service. The spicy chicken is super legit as well! Can't say I'm a big fan of the duck though...

I went to Off the Grid yesterday night... more like ran there! Yes, I will run for food. Crazy packed there! I think Chairman Bao Bun Truck had the longest line there!!! I waited an hour for those buns... I got so cold. I kept thinking, while waiting in line, that they better be worth it. My friend had tried it before and said that it was too hyped. When I FINALLY reached the truck's window, I got two steamed buns: one with the pork belly and pickled daikon and other was the red sesame chicken with carrots. The chicken was pretty delicious. But, I wish I had tried that first before trying the pork belly one because the pork belly was WAY delicious. It was very, very flavorful, and the pickled daikon complemented it very well. My only gripe was the price. The buns aren't that big, so one pork belly and one chicken for $7 was pretty much pushing it. However, I think it was worth to try the pork belly one at least once, even if you have to wait an hour.

85% Yes. 15% No for the price. The Chinese Bun Truck; finally Asians are hitting up the Fast Food Truck market. Watch out Taco Trucks, there's a new up-comer in town. A great spin off of the peking duck dish found in your local Chinatown, they took the soft steam buns and wrapped it in with pork bellies, pulled pork, or sesame chicken sprinkled with pickled vegetables. Just like "White Castle" these little creations aren't going to get you full and there is a 6 bun limit per customer. This will be good as an appetizer. Walking the beat of the Asian Street Fest this past Saturday, Chairman Bao was a treat. Three bites and on to the next vendor. The price tag of one of these buns are $3-7. If you are into trying new food, Chairman Bao will fulfill that need. To find the nearest Chinese Truck, follow them on Twitter. I don't promote vendors, but this is a moving restaurant.

The first time I tired Chairman Bao was this year at the Asian Heritage Street Celebration. There was no line at the truck because I came around the time it was still setting up. I ended up getting the steamed pork belly.... MAN OH MAN... the pork belly!! DELICIOUS! I even had to get one more so my bf wouldn't eat all of mine! haha The pork belly fat soaked into the steamed bao and it just made the whole thing much more flavorful. The price for these are way overpriced and I wouldn't wait in line for hours for it (unless I happen to be at Off the Grid on a Friday and have nothing better to do but eat and stand in line). I also came to this truck one Friday night at Off the Grid, the wait was actually not that long and this time I ordered something different. My bf ended up getting the baked bun with braised pork and I got the spicy chicken on a steamed bun. I do not recommend the braised pork, it was way too salty and it just didn't taste good. The flavor just didn't work with the baked bun. So stay clear from it! As for the chicken, it was pretty good, but not as good as the pork belly.

Okay, so I have to admit I had no idea what this truck was when I first saw it. My first time at OtG last year we were a little early and I was walking around reading menus. I noticed that a line was already forming for this truck...so I hopped in. Figured it must be good. I was fourth in line and it didnt take too long for the line to multiply. I wasn't sure what to get so I just blurted anything out. Baked Sesame Chicken with Scallion and Bok Choy- Eh, it was okay. I think the baked bun takes away a lot from the sesame chicken. I ended up eating it open face. Steamed Tender Pork Belly (sans the Pickled Daikon)- WINNER! The bun is warm and soft filled with a juicy pork belly. I totally would have lined up for more if the line weren't so long.

I love the pork belly bao. nice flavor. texture and temp are also spot on. spicy chicken was nice with good heat. yes, they use the small steamed buns but when you have two of them, that should be good enough for a quick lunch. this food truck is in the soma once a week and i am so thankful!

Comrades, this is my favorite food truck (not because it's Chinese, cause I'm not biased like that). Unlike all the other normal looking white food trucks driving around with their logo, this one definitely stands out with the red paint, unique & catchy logo and Chinese-y symbols all around. You won't miss this truck! I had a sampler of three buns - tofu, chicken and pulled pork. I ate it in that order and my favorite also is in that order (yeah, pretty surprising that tofu came in first on my list). The tofu was different, it was fried with caesar salad, which tasted surprisingly good. The chicken reminded me more of the typical semi spicy Korean spice with scallions and bok choy. The pulled pork (at this time I was pretty full) tasted alright with the radish, I thought the meat could've been a bit more tender though. I also had the strawberry/coconut pulp drink and lemon/ginger lychee pulp drink. Both were just mediocre... the lemon drink was a bit too sour for my liking (but on a hot day, I guess it's good) and the strawberry drink was just meh.

OMG SO GOOD. We waited in line for 45 minutes at OtG Fort Mason to try these guys, then waited longer to pick up our order. Sure tasted like 45 minutes!! Very worth the wait, as justified by the giant masses of people lining up for these guys. They have a maximum order of 6 buns and their stuff ran out fast during OtG. Their Chairman chips are really good... fried wonton chips seasoned with something... Japanese like. The chip bags have little strips of nori tossed inside, which adds an extra kick to the salty deliciousness. They may be too salty for some people, but I LOVE SALT. They were SO GOOD. The buns are greasy and hard to eat without napkins, but they are oh so good... Love the creativity that is put into these things. So good. SO GOOD!!

You can get a little taste of communism at Chairman Bao's by waiting a long time in line for a little bit of food. ?The filling choices are fresher and tastier than anything you'll get in Chinatown, but there is a price premium for that! ?If you get a bunch of the smaller steamed buns it's like your own personal curbside dim sum. Buns: You have two choices. ?The steamed buns are like the ones you'd get served with Peking Duck, overflowing with the filling. ?The baked bun is NOT like the one you'd get at a Chinese bakery with BBQ pork hiding inside, it is more like a brioche sandwich roll cut in half with a double serving of filling. ?The baked option is more filling, but I prefer the steamed bun because the flavor is subtler and lets you focus on what's in the middle. Tender Pork Belly: Large slabs of pork belly and lots of them. ?Very tender unlike some tough pork bellies that are cooked too fast. ?Soft all throughout, sadly no crispy outside though. ?The pickled daikon does a good job of pairing tart with the rich fatty pork. ?Definitely my favorite. Braised Pork: Very soft pulled pork with a creamy mustardy sauce. ?Seemed more like Southern BBQ than Chinese influence. ?Kind of like a slider, so I wasn't too wowed. ?Maybe they should try Chinese Hot Mustard instead? Red Sesame Chicken: Thankfully it's not that deep fried chicken in a sticky sauce you get from greasy Chinese restaurants with numbered menus. ?The whole thing had an overwhelming taste of tahini. ?Not as rich as the pork options so it went down very quickly. Crispy Garlic Tofu: I was shocked that the tofu tasted so good! ?Many times tofu from street carts tends to be an afterthought to assuage the whiny vegetarian/vegan co-worker in the lunch group. ?It was lightly fried; think chicken milanese not the Colonel's. ?HEAVY garlic taste which is totally yummy, but best for a day when you don't have any client meetings in the PM. Bao Chips: Too much nori! ?I appreciate that they are trying to spice up the stereotypical wonton chip, but it was so heavy on the seaweed it tasted too fishy.

Got a chance to have another food truck experience while in Sacramento at the Asian Heritage Festival in Old Sac.

I'd heard this truck was very good, so I made it a point to try it out when I went to off the grid this past Friday. The line was long the whole night, but when I finally went over and waited in it, near the end of the night, it moved really quickly. A couple friends and I each got the baked buns, one got tofu, the other and I both got chicken. It was tasty, sort of the tastes of a banh mi, but in a different format. It's a little bun sandwich. Nice and filling too. ?The other selections were something cooked in cocacola (I don't drink soda) and a pork belly one, which my friend told me not to get cuz it's basically just softer bacon fat. Ew. I would probably go back, and try the steamed ones, which are smaller (I was hungry so I didn't get that) because it seems to be their more famous thing, in retrospect.

My experience with the Chairman Bao Bun Truck was a total cock-tease. After being spurned at the lunch session of SJ Eats, we came back at 4:30 to see what the scene was (it was supposed to start again at 5). The truck was gone, but we noticed a couple people enthusiastically waiting where it was. "Well, we'd be practically first in line." "Okay, but if it's not here by 5:15, we're out of here." 6 o'clock rolls around, and we're... still in line. In the interim, the line had moved to a different spot, and we were fifth. Some sketchy dude managed to sneak in behind us, but that's not our problem. When I'm starving, I don't fight for justice. The truck had already pulled in around 5:20 or so, but it just sat there for a while. Then the main Bao dude pulled open the flaps, and we thought we were good to go. But then he flipped the "Closed" sign up, so we waited. They also had a sign saying you could only order up to six maximum, thus shattering my dreams of buying 100 buns and re-selling them to everyone in line for $10 a pop. Think about it: that's $1000 dollars... sigh. Anyway, eventually we got to try these $3.75 buns of joy. Overall, the pickled vegetables that top these buns are good. I've included a picture for your enjoyment. Overall, the picked vegetables that top these buns are good. Skip the sesame chicken bun, as it pales in comparison to any of the pork buns. Of the two types of pork buns, get the pork belly one. Lastly, the tofu one is surprisingly good. We just got that one for completeness, but I rather liked it. Good, but not worth waiting 1.5 hours.

Definitely a fan of the steamed pork belly buns. ?$3.75 is somewhat pricey for such a small bun, but worth the splurge. $6.75 for the baked version. ?The pork belly one was pretty good as well. ?We also tried the baked braised pork bun which is also worth the try.

I commend them for the great marketing. Awesome name for a food truck and cool graphics... Made me think, "Gee, why didn't I think of that!" The food on the other hand, is nothing to cry about. Discovered this truck at Off the Grid, and of course lined up because there was a huge line. Wherever there's a line, it HAS to be good right? NOPE! Honestly, just listen to other Asians on this review. If you ever in your life had real baos, this is not good bao! And trust me, Chairman Mao would be sooo disappointed in Chairman Bao. I had the pork belly and it was like half fat dripping with fat. For about $4 a bun, I just felt a little ripped off. You can honestly go to Chinatown and get ONE delicious bao for 50cents. I guess that's not the point of a food truck. For something to hype up, it's gotta be exclusive or rare. Like Facebook once was... By all means, I do wish this truck much success. I hear it's hard as hell to make a life off a food truck. So if you're curious, please support them and give it a try--I could just be a varying opinion. My only advice is just don't expect too much.

Each protein has a distinct, well seasoned flavor (chicken can be pretty spicy!) And the choice of breads is fun and changes the character of each sandwich. If you're just sampling, go for the steamed bread. Baked bread is larger serving and heartier.

When next I go for a pork bun I'll be sure to wear my kangol mao cap and stalinist shirt. I felt all campy and red ordering here but after a bite of pork belly I knew that I had left the camp tent and walked onto Tienanmen square. The pork belly is greasy mushy soft tender crack, seriously, I'd like just a pound of the belly forget the bun, throw the pickle on there, maybe a little scallion and I'll go to town on it like 1917. The chicken was tasty and had a nice kick to it but paled in comparison to the pork. I wasn't terribly impressed with the bun, it was just, well a bun. There are some crazy good buns at dim sum shops on clement, it made for an interesting sandwich but didn't make me week in the knees like the belly. I hear there's duck but they were out, so I'm holding off final judgment until I have ze duck.

I bow to the bao. After many months of coveting I finally tried their creative take on steamed buns. Let's just say I'm an addict now and this poses a problem for my wallet. The Chairman has me under his spell with the red sesame chicken with cukes, carrots, and some delish sauce I can't remember. Between that bun and the spicy mexi chocolate cupcake from Cupkates it was an epic lunch. Oh god I need another already.

BAO o BAO that was good! this is the 2nd time ive tried this truck. ?made a u-turn after almost sideswiping the truck mobbing down folsom, excited coz i never see this truck near my location. ? i always get the steamed version coz the baked kind is like a humongous baowich-cant do it. ?ive tried the red sesame chicken, crispy garlic tofu, the pulled pork & the chinese spiced duck w/ mango...THIS is my favorite. ?i dont eat duck or order duck on the regular, so im surprised the oily fowl was pretty good in this bun, and the mango salad was spicy so that was a plus. any one else know of a bao stop? ?otherwise, i bao down to this truck. ?im goin back for the drinks. ?maybe then theyll get their 5th star.

Chairman Bao's buns are soooo yummy. ?I love that they offer baked versions that are twice as large so that I can just get one and be filled. ?If it's your first time, don't skimp. ?Get one of each and figure out which ones are your favorite. ?My boyfriend loved the Pork Belly bun and my all time favorite is the Fried Tofu bun. ? For those expecting a typical Chinese bun...let me warn you - don't. ?I mean, come on. ?#1: You're buying baos from a TRUCK. ?#2: The truck is called Chairman BAO. ?Good, authentic, Chinese restaurants never have such clever names.

The steamed buns are all I have ever had, and they are sooo delish. The pork belly with pickled daikon radish and the red sesame chicken are standby's and I can see why. So solidly tasty and not the least bit greasy... which most people may think of the pork belly. Not so. oh soo yummy in my tummy. I've been known to return a few times just to get another when the lines are short enough at OTG Upper Haight. yes I am that glutton :-\ Only minor gripe is that they are a cash only establishment - no cards of any kind are accepted. Which can be a bummer sometimes when I've not had the chance to stop by the ATM before going over to see them.

If you go to Clement St., buy some Chinese BBQ and a bao from from the dim sum ladies, and you can make a much tastier version of their offerings for 1/4 the price. ?In the meantime, it's interesting to see the yuppie/hipsterfication of Chinese food for a change. ?Not really a good thing, but interesting none the less.

Let me get this out the way right now: ?it's a "roach coach" no matter how you decorate it, where it's located, and/or whatever fancy name you wanna call it. That being said-the people of Bishop Ranch business park in San Ramon decided to have a "Gourmet Truck" (rolling my eyes at that) lunch for the tenants back in October. About 5 trucks participated-this truck being one of them. ?I've never heard of them until this event, and since I like manapua buns (that's what they call the steamed pork buns in Hawaii) I decided to try theirs. Not what I expected. I ordered the sesame chicken, since I wasn't too crazy about the other menu items. I expected the usual meat stuffed in the bun; instead, the bun was split in the middle and the meat placed in it like a small taco. I ordered 3; they were spicy as hell but pretty good. I don't work in the City to visit the truck on the regular, so I hope Bishop Ranch decides to do the event again and invite them back. It's rare to find something for lunch in San Ramon that won't leave you broke.

I tried the baked pork bun with mustard seed. I initially ordered it and had to run to work as I was late. I got to work a little so I had to refrigerate the bun and save it for later. Lunch time came around and I didn't really want to stick it in the microwave because that would make the bread soft and limp so I decided to do the toaster oven. 10 minutes later I pulled out this bun that looked like when I received it from the truck. I also had the chips which were fried wontons mixed with dried sea weed. They were so good. The pork bun had the perfect combination of sweet and savoury. The price was worth it. I will definitely look for the truck in the future.

Easily one of my favorite food trucks! Ok, lets admit it, the line here is always insanely long. ?The first time I had The Chairman's buns I waited about an hour and it was good, but I wasn't too sure it was worth the insane line. The next few times I've lucked out and had a very short and acceptable wait and let me tell you, the pork belly and daikon bun is amazing. ?The warm belly, the cool daikon make for a great marriage in this super tasty bun. ?I never pass up the chance to grab one if I'm hitting up an OTG or they are miraculously close to me one work day at lunch. ?I'm not sure why the baked buns are so much more expensive than the steamed (can anyone answer that?). ?Maybe there is some legitimate reason, but it seems insane for it to be twice the price. ?Luckily I like the steamed, but I still feel this is enough to knock off a star. ?But make no mistake, the buns are awesome!

I fell for the hype. The Chairman Bao is one of thee best food trucks out there I have ever eaten. A must try for everywhere has to be the Pork Belly. I loved the idea how they used both baked and steamed bun to sandwich the meat. As I grew up, I've always had a hatred towards the baked bun (cha siew bao). But for the chairman, my mouth just went bedazzled. My tongue tasted every goodness from the bun, pickled reddish, and the taste of the delicious pork belly. Steam buns, they're just as good. But the baked bun is much more filling and well worth the price for only 6.50. Chairman Bao Bun. Definitely unique, a must try for everyone. and i mean it.

I never tried the baked bao because its either sold out or I don't feel like spending 6 bucks on it. I will one day. This truck is pretty good. I think 3 bucks for a small taco bao is much for me, but I eaten here numerous of times. My favorite would be the garlic tofu with miso greens on a steam bun.

Delicious greasy lunch deliciousness. Do not come here looking for pious options on a Monday after gorging yourself all weekend. Come here on a Friday, early, if you are slightly hungover from Thursday happy hour that went longer than you anticipated. Red sesame chicken steamed bun with marinated carrots - tender and sweet and spicy and sour and awesome. Baked bun with braised pork and savoy cabbage - not really a terribly Asian item with brioche bun and mayo-y slaw, but I'll take it. Adding sriracha makes it more authentic, right? A little too greasy, but that didn't stop me from devouring it.

Very yummy! I got the steamed bun as opposed to the baked one because it's 2 dollars less, but it's half the size also. There are different options but finally decided on the spicy chicken, which has pickled carrots, and cilantro all inside of steamed (open) bun, what a delight!

A little unusual for my taste, but I was blown away. My first bun was eaten in Civic Center in front of the big screen when the Giants won the World Series. The people at Chariman Bao are great! How could one put together such odd ingredients together and make it a masterpiece? I don't know how, but whatever they're doing, it's working! My favorite is the Red Sesame Chicken with Scallions and Bok Choi. They are definitely killing the food truck and asian fusion food game. I can't wait till the next time I come across this Truck.

SIX STARS! ?TWENTY STARS! Oh. My. GOSH. ?I am still reveling in the steamed pork belly bun with pickled daikon. ? I arrived at Off the Grid @Fort Mason at around 5:30. ?As I scanned the trucks, I noticed a large crowd in a Disneylandesque rope line. ?Sure enough, the red truck was behind it. ?Without even waiting for my friend to arrive, I hopped in the line, craning my neck to see what they were offering. ?After about 40 minutes in line (and a couple tacos from The Taco Guys - YUM!), I sat down to sample the deliciousness. ? I literally started laughing when I took my first bite of the pork belly. ?Everything about it is perfection. ?The combination of textures and the balance of savory and sweet are incredible. ?I also ordered the braised pork with cabbage and mustard seeds. ?Very good but paled in comparison to the belly. ?I was hoping to try the duck with mango. ?Here's hoping they're serving it on Monday when I stalk them in Emeryville.

I first saw the Chairman Bao Bun Truck at Off the Grid at Fort Mason and I was wondering what that loonnnnngggggg line was for. After finding out what it was for, I yelped it and found what they were serving to be very interesting and was very happy to see that they make weekly visits to Emeryville I didn't pack a lunch today and finally had cash on me so I was able to venture out to finally try this ever so popular Chairman Baos. They do accept Visa and Mastercard by the way. I got to the spot around 12:10 and there was a wait for my buns. After about 25 minutes, I finally got my hands on three different buns and a drink. I was not disappointed by everything, but I was not impressed either. Strawberry Coconut Icy Drink - it was really good to have something cold today because it was sooo hot! Flavorwise, I did not taste the strawberry or the coconut. I felt like I was drinking a cup of water with a lot of crush ice and a very slighttt taste of sour strawberry. Crispy Tofu with Garlic Sauce and Mustard Greens bun - I love tofu, I love mustard greens, but I did NOT like this bun at all. The mustard greens were good, but the tofu was not crispy at all. In fact it was really mushy and did not go well with the soft steamed bun. I love anything with garlic, but this particular garlic sauce was sour and not pleasant to eat. Pork Belly with Pickled Daikon bun - I liked this one. The pork belly was very soft and well flavored and went well with the crunchy daikon. Spiced duck confit with mango and onion - This one was my favorite because it had the best combination of flavors, with the soft spiced shredded duck with the sweet mango and that little kick from the onion. It did not live up to the hype but I am still glad I tried it. The only food I have gotten from trucks before were just original Mexican taco trucks and I appreciate all the creatively people are having with food. It was an interesting experience but I don't think I would be waiting in line for these buns again.

I've been dying to try the buns forever. I finally got a chance to try them this past Saturday at Off the Grid. You have your choice of baked or steamed. Baked is your typical round bun with stuffing inside. Steamed buns are like the pancakes you get when you order Peking Duck. I personally prefer steamed, I just like the taste of the dough. It's like a chinese taco. :) My bf and I ordered 3 buns: braised pork with cabbage was so delicious, pork was juicy, tender, and savory cabage was good contrast to slight sweetness of braised meat. Tofu was a thick slice with greens, good flavor, they had run out of this one before we left. My other half liked the duck, I don't eat duck so can't say. I will definitely eat off this truck again. The steamed buns have become one of my favorite food truck items ever. And the logo is so cute. :)

Love their duck bao!! ?Though it totally just reminds me of the peking duck which I've eaten my fair share in my lifetime. ?Now for $6?? ?ummm...I don't think i am a stoopid chinamen. Just saying that a single peking duck with a bun isn't worth $6.00. ?I think you can get the entire peking duck with about 12 buns in a chinese restaurant for about $30?? ?So yeh...you do the math. ?Though this truck is thee only place I know where I can buy a single peking duck bun and it's quite tasty! ?So 3 stars for you and I will just maybe splurge $6 next time I am drunk and your truck is in front of that bar....unless Kung Fu Taco truck is parked next to you...

Chairman Bao in the East Bay! They stop in Emeryville at Hollis and 53rd almost every Monday during lunch (11:30-1:30ish). My favorite is the pork belly with pickled daikon baked bun. In the past I've also had the duck with mangoes and spicy sauce which was really yummy, too. I also recently tried the braised pork bun but it was a little on the dry side and needed some sort of sauce. ? Only problem is that the buns are pricey! $6.75 for a baked bun is too much for the portion. Still a nice treat to have one in awhile. Follow them on twitter/facebook to find out where the truck is =)

For someone use to growing up in the Richmond district and going to the local Chinese bakery for breakfast/char siu baos deliciousness, it was definitely a weird feeling going to Chairman Bao Bun Truck. It was like hmm...is this what people do when they become adults or young yuppies? My cheap Chinese sense of self felt offended by the price until I received my bun and started realizing this is not Chinese American food. This is Asian fusion food and realized that no part of my Chinese American self could really compare the two. Instead, it was time to say bye to my Chinese American cheapskate and for my foodie self to inhale...and enjoy. And enjoy, I did. The pork belly bun is like a Peking duck without the Peking duck, but the pork belly with its tenderness and savory sauces is a lovely substitute. I'm not sure if I would try some of their other combinations as one of the meat buns had mustard seeds in it, but this truck is definitely something worth checking out.

When I was in college, I went to a Mos Def concert on campus. Doors opened around 6 and, after the opening acts, it was finally time for Mos. Now, like a typical star, he didn't come out right when it was his turn to perform. Instead, he decided to take his sweet ass time and make the crowd wait... and wait... and wait... Things got so bad that the MCs had to resort to holding an impromptu freestyle rapping competition a la 8 Mile between guys who were convinced they could flow, but were in fact really terrible. But that's another story. Anyway, as the crowd got increasingly restless and began to throw things at the MCs on stage and started chanting "refund!" Mos finally came out and performed. The crowd went crazy and by the end of the show, all was forgiven and everyone left satisfied. Why do I tell you this story? Because that was basically my experience with Chairman Bao. Being one of the more well known food trucks in the Bay Area, Bao's reputation precedes itself. I first encountered Bao at SJ Eats aka "Let's Try and See How Many People We Can Cram Into One Condensed Area Before They Want To Kill Themselves." While all the other trucks had been open for a good 30 minutes, Bao was still not open, but a sizable line had formed. I decided to skip out on Bao that day, but we would meet again the next week at Off the Grid. Trucks began opening by 5pm, but Bao was again taking its time. A line again started to form in great anticipation and this time my gf and I got in it because when you see a line start to form, you naturally just get in it because you don't want to miss out, right? Anyway, after all the other trucks opened for business, an Off the Grid staff member knocked on the Bao door and told them to get moving and open up. They obliged.... kind of. They opened their windows, but still weren't actually taking orders yet. We could see the workers inside prepping food... and you knew they could see the line that was waiting on them as well. Finally, probably a good 20 minutes after they had been told to open up, they started taking orders. And, like my Mos Def experience, after you eat their buns, you sort of forget that they made you sit there and wait and wait and wait. After trying five or six different places that day, it was clear that Bao has something unique. A little pricey? Perhaps. But you really can't get their style of bun anywhere else. Anyway, let's recap. Chairman Bao: kind of a diva, but worth the price of admission.

I finally tracked tracked the ol' panda down... or rather, it tracked me down right after I ate a pizza earlier this afternoon. Being the good yelper that I am, I immediately mustered up the appetite for a second lunch. Bao! Unfortunately, I think its more of a novelty experience than good food. I *love* steamed buns, but the pork belly was so greasy that it covered the bun (and my hands) in oil - not so great. I dig the design, and the service was quite pleasant; everyone was super nice. Lastly, the pineapple shaved ice drink was way too sweet for my taste, but I do support all the fruit chunks! Worth a try, but not sure I'd be so pumped to see it parked nearby again...

I'm not sure if I thought this was just okay because I eat similar things all the time, or if it was overhyped.

We got: People's Buns, Steamed (Red sesame chicken with scallion and bok choy) - Got description online but ours had picked carrot topping. Way too much carrot, definitely not enough meat. Bun was really nice, soft, & fresh though. What meat there was, it had very generic flavor. Chairman's Buns, Steamed (Tender pork belly with pickled daikon) - Again, not enough meat! Pretty good tender pork, but way way too much daikon. Can you tell by my pics where you can't see the meat at all?? Overall thoughts.. This place is just overrated. My mom's homemade buns are always better.

i love (but also feel like i should be offended?) that this cart decided to name itself after the controversial crazed, sifilis-eroded communist dictator and then draw him as a smiling anthropomorphized panda. i'm certainly not offended enough to stop going here though. Chairman Bao is straight up delicious and worth another visit. $9 meals include either: 1) 2 steamed buns (served like large peking duck tacos) + shaved ice/fresh fruit/jelly combo drink or 2) 1 baked bun (cut in half and served sandwhich style) + shaved ice/fresh fruit/jelly combo drink A little on the pricy side, but the they serve high quality food, so not particularly unreasonable. Just don't go expecting regular lunch truck prices. tried: Pork belly + baked bun seems to be one of their specialties. half fat, half meat, is rich tasty and indulgent. duck confit with mango on steamed bun - really liked the spicy mayo/duck/mango combo taste but agreed with other reviews that the duck was a little dry. maybe they'll work that kink out as they get their rythem down. the ginger lychee drink my friend got was a little sweet for my taste. I liked my mango green tee drink a lot. i heard people really liked the pineapple salted caramel drink. they have little jelly/boba pieces in their drinks, so if you arent a fan of those then these drinks are not for you.

I thought I had written a review for Chairman Bao a while ago, but I guess not. Since I've been here before, I don't typically wait in line for them if it's too long. After a hiatus from CB, I had their buns again this past weekend. I'm not sure if their menus rotate depending on the events/location, but their menu was narrowed down to a few steamed buns and no specialty drinks. I was a bit disappointed at the selection. In the past I always get the Spiced Duck Confit with Mango Salad. The bun had a nice balance between the cool sweet mango slices and some spice from the duck confit. Another favorite was the Pork Belly with Pickled Daikon. A nice big chunk of seared pork belly with tangy pickled daikon, such a great combo. These are my top two buns. Of course you have to wash it down with a Pineapple Salted Caramel Shaved Ice.

On my most recent visit to the Chairman Bao truck I ordered a steamed bun with pork belly with pickled daikon, and not only was it delicious in terms of flavor, texture, and presentation, but for once I didn't have to wait in a ridiculously long line before ordering my food. ?The two biggest complaints about Chairman Bao seem to be the prices and waiting in long lines, one of which is valid. ? If you attend an Off The Grid event where the Chairman Bao truck is taking part, especially if it happens to be Off The Grid Fort Mason, then you will without a doubt find yourself waiting in a long line to place your order. ?Yes, it's in part due to the truck's trendiness among those who regularly attend Off The Grid and similar food truck events, and you can't dismiss the awesome design and paint job that adorn the truck itself, but the biggest reason for the long lines at the Chairman Bao bun truck is without a doubt the food. ?Buns, steamed or baked, filled with fresh, well prepared ingredients, and made to order. If you're looking for taco truck prices from a decade ago then Chairman Bao is probably not what you're looking for. ?Take into consideration the cost of food items at similar trucks currently operating all over the Bay Area, and Chairman Bao's prices are not out of line with that of their competition. ?If there was a negative side to the prices charged by trucks like Chairman Bao, it's that the old school taco trucks see this trend as a reason to jack up their own prices. ?A pork belly or duck confit steamed bun for $3.75 each from Chairman Bao makes more sense to me than a $7 or $8 breakfast burrito filled with chorizo, refried beans, rice, and guacamole (not even potatoes) from a taco truck.

I second (or third, or fourth) the recommendation for the pork belly bun. ?It's really good here. ?I also tried the red sesame chicken bun - which was spicier than I expected but still good. ?I got two steamed buns, which are smaller than the baked buns but it was filling enough for me for lunch. Pork Belly = $3.75 Red Sesame Chicken = $3.25 The most impressive part of the buns to my surprise were the pickles on top. ?Wow. ?Those pickles are really really good! ? Although I wouldn't eat here every day, it's a great way to treat yourself.

Had the chance to stop by here during Off the Grid. Got the steamed bun with tender pork belly and steamed bun with red sesame chicken. Both were delicious, but I find myself preferential to the tender pork belly. But holy crap, were they expensive! I paid a whopping $7 for two buns that were too small for what they were worth. I could get a more filling burrito with that money. The baked bun looked like a more satisfying alternative, but it's basically like paying $6-$7 for a burger... The buns were delicious, yes, but not special enough to warrant such a high price. I won't be coming back often.

I ran into the Chairman Bao truck at the Rockit Room on Clement last night at 1:45am. ?I heard about this truck just a few days ago and was really surprised I ran into it on my way to Quickly's down the street. There was no line, friendly service and a delicious sounding menu. ?I ended up getting the Red Sesame Chicken w/ Scallion and Bok Choy steamed bun. Took about 3 or 4 minutes to prep and then I dug right in. ?The bok choy was really, really, really (no, really) yummy. ?It had this pickled vegetable taste to it, which I loved. ?The bok choy had the right crunch and flavor. ?The red sesame chicken was a tad dry but had a very tiny spicy kick to it. ?Not sure if that was the scallions or actual hot sauce. The only reason I didn't rate this truck 5 stars is because of two things. 1) The steamed bun had a very hard edge to it. ?It almost tasted like the bun was either from frozen or steamed then re-steamed. ?I couldn't quite tell. 2) The baked bun price was a lot higher than I expected. ?$5.75 for a baked bun and $2.95 for a steamed bun. ?I opted for steamed because of the big price differential. Overall, I would definitely come back here and try the different buns. ?If you're looking for a traditional bao place, this isn't it. ?If you're looking for a tasty new take on bao...give this place a try, pronto! ?Now if I could only find them again as conveniently as I did last night... Menu: Buns - Baked ($5.75), Steamed ($2.95): Filling: -Tender Pork Belly with Pickled Daikons -Red Sesame Chicken with Scallion and Bok Choy -Lions Head Meatball with Fresh Kim Chee -Chinese Sausage and Egg Sandwich with Hoisin -Crispy Garlic Tofu with Miso Greens -Chinese Spiced Duck Confit with Fresh Mango Salad Bun Meals (Combo): -2 Steamed Buns and a Fresh Fruit Shaved Ice Drink - $9 -Baked Bun and a Fresh Fruit Shaved Ice Drink - $9 Fresh Fruit Shaved Ice Drinks - $3.50: -Pineapple Salted Caramel -Strawberry Coconut -Ginger Lychee -Mango Matcha Green Tea Other Beverages - $1.50 and up: -Iced Green Tea -Coconut Water

CASING THE JOINT... I rolled up on my scooter to Chairman Bao's in front of the Restaurant Fixtures shop at 1:40pm. The truck is colorful, red, modern, clean, sparkly, fun graphics. The cook said.. it's closed, apparently they're only open from 11:30AM-1:30PM for lunch! However, they had a few sandwiches left. Extras: Chairman Bao's has gotten a bad rap from Taiwanese bun maker of Baohaus for "stealing" his name for his top-selling bun, but in all honesty it doesn't bother me. The name was never trademarked to begin with. THE SCORE: I ordered a Baked (not Steamed, probably 2x size) Duck Confit with Mango Salad for $5.75. It looked delicious, with a bit of the yellow mango peeking from outside the bun, topping strips and chunks of succulent duck. Ooh baby this looked better than I imagined. I was starving hungry, and devoured the thing in multiple bites, sitting by the side of the truck. I didn't care I looked homeless as this Baked Bun was tender, flavorful, eye-opening flavor combo. Well-worth the jaunt down there to get this sandwich, and $5.75 for a pick-me-up and culinary inspiration was well worth it for me. I went home and this sando inspired me to make me a mango salsa for my pulled pork for a party I catered. THE GETAWAY: I'm excited to go back for the unusal boba tea flavors and for more samples of their meats. Will be back for a Steamed Pork Belly (smaller portions, I was told for the fatty nature of this delight). And for the Five Spiced Chicken. And the Duck Confit, of course. Food: 5 Stars Experience: 4 Stars, Multiple people turned away after 1:30PM, it's a shame they tried so hard to get their baos, and the truck was off-duty Will Return: Hell Yea Will Recommend: Already did Overall: 5, Baby

Hmmm Chairman Bao is now The Chairman Truck. Could it have anything to do with Eddie Huang (of Baohaus NY) threatening a lawsuit of copyright name infringement? Who knows. For now Eddie has rights to a Chairman Bao truck. And at least we know Eddie's Chairman Bao is based on his homeland's Taiwan style "hamburger" or gua bao, which got bastardized by David Chang and ended up making million$. But anyway for this Chairman, ?it is a good thing that "Bao" isn't in their name anymore. Phew. Because what I had off the Chairman Truck was an ab$$$$olute aBAOmination. Especially to real Chinese food. Perhaps I'm a traditionalist (re: a real a$$ $nob) at heart. I've had ?mantou before (plain steamed buns) from Northern to Shandong style in Taipei and Hong Kong, Shanghainese steamed bun version in Hong Kong (including the pan fried one), cha siu bao (been eating those mofo's since I was 2 or younger, no joke), and in the last 5 years have had Taiwanese version of Shen Jian Bao, xiao long bao, Northern style baozi (pork and cabbage steamed buns), as well as some of the very best Taiwanese gua bao in Taipei, that ruined me for life. For example, Lan Jia Gua Bao in Taipei, a relative newcomer competitor to Shih Jia Gua Bao (30++ year old shop near Tong Hua Street Night Market) that is one of the greats http://beefnoguy.blogspo¡­ And thus ruined me so much that no commie Panda on wheels, even if customized by a Japanese chef (gasp), could impre$$ me no more. If Chairman's steamed pork bellay bunz taste anything like NYC David Chang's MomoFuk-U's then no thank u. Ok so the Commie Panda on wheels the other night had: "Tender pork belly with pickled daikon" - was told the pork belly was braised then grilled or was it fried. A miniscule portion that I could hold with two fingers, pretty much gone with 3 medium sized bites. $3.75 poorer....$hit. Two flavor profiles....SALT and SOUR, not much going on there. This pork belly prep definitely caters to the American palette, but those who've had Cantonese, Taiwanese, Hangzhou style pork belly (in Asia and at the competent North American Chinese/Taiwanese restaurants) will find it on the dull side. Even a shio butabara (pork belly skewer) or tontoro (pork cheek) grilled skewer at a good yakitori joint executes the salted swine even better. Hell even Ramen Parlor's buta kakuni which I'm not a fan of has more flavor. As for charcoal grilled pork belly in a bun off a truck, guess this won't work, unless the truck itself is powered by charcoal....maybe on a choo choo? "Braised pork with savoy cabage and mustard green seeds" - similar thing, except it was tender lean meat...again two very similar flavor profiles, almost one dimensional. The cabbage and mustard green seeds was however a nice touch texture wise, but a lot more was missing to make this easier to swallow in terms of worthine$$. Spicy rooster sauce would not have made this any better. Another $3.75 gone. Oui oui je comprende....this is "food truck mania" and supposed to be trendy. And no, not everyone is a traditional$t $nob and if the real thing were offered by the Commie Panda at the same price at the same size, they would not like it. And plus most of you probably prefer CP over the rendition done by Joy in Foster City (that charges pretty much the same price for TWO similar sized items, but way more delicious and closer to the real deal than this trendy slider wackadoodle). And yes now I know why some Vietnamese expat yelpers (or those who know real Vietnamese food) look at Charles Phan's projects (or Chris Yeo's or basically most Asian fusion gone hip) and think he $old his $oul for rock & roll. But at least I have more respect for Charles Phan... than some fu$n simplified bao wannabe :-o I'm definitely not sold on this hype, sorry. A single Lan Jia Gua Bao is NT$50 or a shade near $1.60 for something that's completely amazing that has texture, multiple tastes, fragrance, and just visually impressive. $3.75 for something that's 1/3 of the size, more than x2 the price, that has ridiculously few condiments (I mean yeah Sriracha is there but WTF? No shaved peanut powder, no cilantro, no kimuchi, and the pork itself has little flavor other than salt or soy?) make this overrated and overpriced.

Chairman Bao Trucks is right outside our office at 7000 Sierra Point Parkway near the http://Walmart.com Building. It will be here every Tuesday! I have been waiting in anticipation and I was not disappointed. ? I sampled: The pork belly steamed bun with daikon and red onion = melt in your mouth delicious. The daikon added a nice crispness to the pork belly. The chicken with chinese spices, green onion and bok choy steamed bun was flavorful and had a nice contrast to the sweetness of the bun. The Strawberry Coconut Ice was refreshing even on a windy day. Overall, I really enjoyed my experience here. It was fast and friendly. ?The cuisine is unique and flavorful. ?Much better than your typical sandwhich and chips lunch. ?And at $3 a bun and $3.50 for a shaved ice, it won't break the bank. See you next Tuesday!

The lines wrap around Fort Mason for this take on the chinese "bao". ?Chairman Bao boasts a variety of gourmet buns from duck confit to pork belly. ?They serve it on your choice of the steamed buns or baked buns. I think the best (in my opinion) is the pork belly with pickled daikon radishes on a baked bun. ?The crisp yet tender cut of pork belly has a slightly salty flavor, mixed with the crispness and sourness of the pickled daikon, and the soft and slightly sweetness of the baked bun marries all the flavors well.

The power of the steamed bun once saved me from the middle school bully. Here was an eighth-grader so tough, she would steal lunches on the bus and spit gum in the back of your head in class. As fate would have it, she was my seat mate in choir and I only survived by crossing her palm daily with the red bean steamed buns my mom would send me to school with (damn asian funky ass lunches!). Turns out this raccoon eyed blondie of a bully took a yen to the sweet, foreign, taste of my "buns" and I was able to stay on her good side. Point of that lengthy exposition, is that steamed buns rock. They can save nerdy middle-schooler's lives, and they can also satisfy your hunger after ferocious work out. Found the Bao truck parked outside Crunch today on Polk St. and had the Sesame Chicken with Scallion & Bok Choy. For less than $3.00 it was a revelation. Piping hot, soft, chewy bun, and savory insides with the flavors of the chicken and vegi's really complementing each other. Turns out one wasn't enough, so I'll be following on Twitter to get my seconds!

Seriously?! It took me this long to try these gems? What is wrong with me? What is wrong with the world? I finally got the chance to try these when the gallery I intern for: Frey Norris Contemporary & Modern had their public grand opening and hired the Chairman Bao Bun Truck to come and give away 250 free buns to 125 people. It was only until closing did we interns get to try these delicious buns. There were three different varieties to chose from: Tendered pork belly with spiced daikon, crispy garlic tofu with miso greens, and red sesame chicken with scallions and bok choy. I chose the tofu bun and chicken bun. My favorite was hands down the tofu one. It was clean and flavorful without being overwhelming or too strong. Esp. with Asian flavors, it is easy to be too powerful. The chicken bun was pretty good, I loved the flavor but for some reason did not like the chicken. I had the bite of the pork belly and it was blah, too boring for me. It is alright, the two other buns made up for it.

This tiny red truck packs in a pretty solid punch. I have tried all their buns, my favorite ones are: Pulled Pork with Savoy Cabbage and Pickled Mustard Seeds on Steamed Bun - $2.95 Crispy Garlic Tofu with Miso Greens on Steamed Bun - $2.95 Tender Pork Belly with Pickled Daikon on Steamed Bun - $2.95 Which only leaves 2 other buns... which aren't far behind on my list. Bouncing around busy bars, events and locations in sf, this truck has really grown in popularity... and for a great reason. Great service, and amazing food! Perfect to grab 1-2 buns and enjoy them with a cold beer at a bar. I believe the truck is outside Bloodhound on Wednesdays... A great bar in SOMA... call and check first before you embark there, they may have changed day/hours. For a corporate event or a big party, book this truck to add some deliciousness to your event!

I stood in line for this truck at the kick off SJ Eats event - you know, the one where they tried to mash a billion people into one dinky parking lot - and waited 2 hours before being able to place my order. Then I waited another 30 minutes for my pork belly and daikon buns to be ready for noms. That 2.5 hour wait was so. effing. worth it. The pork belly was so tender, the bun was so fluffy, and the daikon was so crunchy... I was sitting and tearing my way through the saucy bun so quickly that the sauce was running all over my hands and even dripped onto my jeans :c I didn't care though! I fell asleep that night dreaming sweet dreams of Chairman Bao pork belly buns.

Great food, but probably not worth the hour+ wait. I personally waited 3 hours for my baos at the SactoMoFo festival. I wish I had gotten it before at other festivals when they weren't so crazy popular yet. =P Oh well. By the time you get to the front you want to order as much as possible after waiting so long, and they have a 6 bao limit. The long wait coupled with a maximum order is a great marketing strategy that makes almost everyone order the maximum amount. Smart! Seems they have different baos sometimes. I really liked the pork belly and tofu out of the ones I tried, but I'm reading about other baos in other people's reviews that weren't even on the menu when I went!

The pork belly here is really really good. Once in a while I get a craving for ?pork belly, and now I know where to go. The baked ones are better than the steamed ones imho. The baked ones are easier to get the whole thing into your hand and get all the flavors into your mouth at the same time. The steamed ones, the few ones I had the buns fell apart and I had to end up using a fork. Very. yummy. pork belly. The shaved ice drinks are also quite good, better than Verde. It's not nearly as sweet as Verde and definitely hits the spot. Try the pork belly!

Pork belly and pickled daikon, pulled pork and mustard greens + mustard seeds. Bun was correct, soft and structurally sound, dry and hand friendly.

The food: 1. Duck steamed bun: the duck was extremely dry and the sauce did not mesh well with the mango or duck. ? 2. Pork steamed bun: the fatty pork was delicious. ?The pickled daikon was slightly under flavored. 3. Strawberry shaved ice with coconut: it was refreshing and not overly sweet. ? The service: People working the truck were extremely friendly and service was quick considering the line. ? Cons: $9 for 2 taco sized buns and a drink is pretty pricey for "truck food". ?The "LA fad" of serving ethnic cuisine out of trucks loses its appeal when the food is priced like a sitdown restaurant.

We waited over 1/2 hour in line @ Off the Grid at Fort Mason, but it was worth the wait. ?Ordered all 4 steamed bun items off the tiny menu posted on the truck - the pork belly; braised pork shoulder; red sesame chicken; and the garlic tofu. ?Favorite hands down was the pork belly. The wait was tolerable since you can order and eat from the other food trucks while waiting in line. The steam buns are shaped the size of the buns served in Chinese restaurants when you order Peking duck. Didn't try the baked bun version but it's resembles a hamburger bun and double the size and double the price of the steamed version.

When I was a young'un I used to be a slave to ice cream trucks. When I'd hear their signature tune make its way into the house, I'd come running out, flailing my arms, telling them to waitwaitwait!! This was serious business. I even dragged out my bright blue Playskool safe just so I could crack that puppy open right on the spot and buy ice cream without being left in the dust. My friend and I also used to chase down the ice cream truck w/ our bicycles too. Oh the memories... Fast forward to today and you'll find me obsessing over the Chairman Bao Bun Truck, the adult version of my childhood ice cream truck. If that thing were on the run, I would gladly chase it down, arms a-flailin' and purse in tow. Luckily, I didn't have to do any chasing this past weekend. Thanks to Twitter, I was able to swoop in on a few of their tasty buns. The Tender Pork Belly w/ Pickled Daikon bun, plus the Chinese Spiced Duck Confit w/ Fresh Mango Salad bun, were both to die for! I love daikon and don't see it served very often, so it was a real treat seeing it incorporated into something that already sounded good on its own. Make a point to cross paths with this truck or you'll be sorry!

I've heard so many good things about this truck and their food, and there was a huge crowd in front so they must be good, right? I was excited to try a new twist on a classic Chinese favorite. I ordered their most popular bao bun, the Pork Belly with pickled daikons. I wasn't too impressed because what I had was really greasy and over seasoned. It was just WAY too salty! The pork AND pickled daikons were just overloaded with salt! The little bun wasn't big enough to balance out the saltiness of the meat and veggies. I found myself reaching for any sort of beverage that I could find because it was like consuming a spoonful of salt. Later on in the day, I realized that there has to be some MSG in the food because I was constantly thirsty for hours after I ate the bun. If the flavors were a little more muted, the food would be fine. If they could leave out the MSG, it would be a lot better. Overall, it wasn't horrible, but it's not something I would particularly look forward to consuming again.

I was a little disappointed in the food for such a long wait, but oh well. I got: Red chicken steamed bun: my favorite!! Loved the sauce in it! Pork belly steamed bun: Meh. not a huge fan. Tasted too fatty for me. Crispy tofu steamed bun: Yumm!!! The tofu was so good!! Wasn't overwhelmingly greasy, either. Even my friend, who's vegetarian & HATES Asian food enjoyed the tofu bun.

I have wanted to try this place since I heard about it over the summer, but I've always been too busy to make it to the OTG events. ?That is until last Thursday. ?First thing on my mind was to get one of the Pork Belly Buns I've heard so much about! ?I was concerned the line would be ridiculously long and that my belly would give in to one of the deceivingly attractive carts with shorter lines. ?So I started strategizing with my friends as to how to handle the lines, but hold up....as we approached the truck, the line was only 5 people deep! ? The whole ten minute wait left me starving for the two buns I ordered. ?I had the steamed buns but they also have a baked bun option. ?The baked bun is served more like a burger, and therefore it has more filling and is pricier. ? The buns were DE-LIC-OUS!!! ?The pork belly had the perfect consistency with the fat and bbq sauce forming a crispy coating over the juicy meat. ?Coupled with the softness of the steamed bun and crispness of the pickled radish, the overall sensation was that of a party in your mouth. ? No holding back, no letting go, just grab a bun and go to town! ? You might need at least four to make a meal out of it.

i had the baked bun with crispy miso cured tofu and overall, it was pretty good. the bao was huge, cut in half, and inserted with pan-fried tofu, baby bok choy, and seasoned with garlic tofu mayo. ?the combination was very savory and yummy. ?i did feel it was a bit too much bread, as i couldn't finish it (but i ate everything inside). at $6 for a vegetarian bao, it is a bit on the steep side. ?you can get the smaller version of this, steamed bun, which is a smaller piece of bread & half the filling, for $3.25.

Delicious! My friend got us some of the buns so I'm not exactly sure what I ate except that it was pork with some pickle looking thing on top. 2 thumbs up, now I just need to figure out where to find the truck...

$6.50 Pork Belly in BAKED buns = Happy asian guy! - Steam buns is okay, but so much less meat... - specials are a good gamble. - braised pork knocked out of greatness by silly pea leaves... just slaw it already. - even if you don't believe me, find them once, eat $6.50 Pork Belly in BAKED buns and tell me if you can hate...

I love Chairman Bao! ?I have never had anything short of delicious here. ?It's been piping hot and extremely satisfying every single time. To address a common concern... What do you mean "it's "too expensive"? ?This is San Francisco, and the gourmet ingredients we demand cost a lot. ?I would also argue that $6.25 for what is effectively a pretty big sandwich is normal here. ?And you'd be hard-pressed to find a business that will charge less than they can get. ?Look at the line--they can get big money, so they charge it! ?Not a shocker. ?It's one thing to stop going because of the price, but to buy their food again and again and then whine does not help matters. ?As long as you'll pay, they'll charge you. And why is that a bad thing? ?They get around $10, and you get a big delicious quality meal and a happy tummy. ?Sounds like a fair trade to me! ? One more thing: PORK BELLY!!!!!!!!

*~Update~* 6/24 ?4 Stars My friends and I came out to the SJ Eats/Moveable Feast event on 6/18. ?Everyone wanted to try Chairman Bao and I was ready to give them another chance. ?I tried the pork belly again in hopes it would live up to all the hype this time around... and it did!!! ?The pork belly was flavorful like last time and was juicy and moist as it should be. ?We hit up almost every truck at the event since there was 10 of us. ?I would have to say that Chairman Bao was the only truck that we came back a 2nd time for. ? Curt - If you are reading this, thank you for responding to my previous review. ? Whatever you communicated to your staff definitely worked. ?I can't wait to have Chairman Bao again. ?Keep up the good work! *~First Review~* 3 Stars I had very high hopes for Chairman Bao with all the reviews and appearing on Eat Street. ?I ordered the steamed pork belly bun, the tofu bun and the braised pork bun. ?The tofu was AMAZING!! ?Omg, the crispy goodness with the sauce and veggies were a perfect compliment. ?If you're wary of tofu this bun will make you a believer!! ?Now, to the pork belly bun, I loooooooove me some pork belly!! ?I think I may have hyped myself up too much for this bun. ?The meat had very good flavor but it was extremely chewy and dry. ?I'm not sure if the belly is fried after the braise it but it was hard on the outside. ?The braised pork was tasty and the meat was a little chewy as well but at least it wasn't hard as the pork belly. I will give Chairman Bao another chance and I hope I can update the review at that time...

I tried Bao's buns today for the first time. ?I ordered the pork belly and the duck confit steamed buns for $3.75 each. ?They were delicious! The spiced duck confit comes with a sauce which has a bit of a kick. ?I like spicy food, and this sauce definitely has a bite. ?So if you really do not like spice, this may not be the bun for you. ?Otherwise, the mango salad on top of the bun is refreshing and counters the spice nicely. The pork belly was heavenly. ?Yes, it is fattening, but it is also true that the pickled daikon helps add a nice crunch and flavor to the pork belly. ?If you think you're going to feel guilty ordering the pork belly because you worked out this morning, don't order it. ?But it is delicious... The portions of the steamed are small enough you could hold it with one hand and eat in a few bites. ?I ordered two and found myself satisfied. ?Not full to a point where I had stomach aches, but enough where I could probably eat one more and be done for lunch. ?I still have to try the baked buns, but I bet they will be just as delightful.

I was so excited when this truck came by for lunch, as I was starving and I love pork buns. The pork belly buns may as well be renamed pork fat buns. I understand that pork belly tends to be a fatty piece of meat, but it shouldn't be pure fat...and both of my buns contained pieces of all fat. ALL FAT! Gross.

Thanks to Off the Grid, I was able to finally experience the elusive Chairman Bao Bun Truck. I came right when it opened to so long lines. Of course I order what else... Pork Belly.... Get in my Belly... It definitely didn't disappoint :D I paired it with the sesame chicken, which was also very very decent. The only down side is that the snack size steamed bun was definitely a small snack. So 2 buns were like $7 buckaroos... Man if i was to get my grub on, I would be up to $30-35 bones... OUCH... So very tasty bun, but very expensive, which doesn't lead to cheap in cheerful in the pocket, but at least cheap and cheerful in the belly...

Chairman Bao, you never cease to amaze me. ?We were first introduced at the 2nd Haight St. Off the Grid where we had the option of the red chili chicken, crispy pork belly with daikon, or the tofu. ?We got one of each of the meat offerings and were impressed. Today, one of my co-workers alerted me that your truck was at pier 28 not too far from our office so we rush over there. ?I was so impressed with the steamed pork belly bun that I get one of them and decide to try the duck with mango and a ginger lychee drink. ?The duck was amazing. ?The combination of spicy, with sweet and succulent was to die for. ?I am sure I will be back to eventually try all of your many flavors.

My favorite truck at Off the Grid. ?the pork belly steamed bun was incredible, as was the spicy chicken.

Mind. Blown. I caught The Chairman (sporting its new name) today at SactoMoFo 5. Now, I haven't eaten a lot of pork belly, but I definitely know one thing. It's a damn good thing this is not a Sacramento-based truck. If it was, I would be getting a triple bypass within the next year or two. In addition to the pork belly steamed bun, (can't fathom tackling the slightly larger baked version...) I put away a tofu steamed bun. I guess it was my attempt to counteract the godlike, sweet, delicious fat with something I guesstimated to be healthier. While I'm not sure my health logic was at all sound, (the tofu is grilled to the level of awesome) the tofu is probably a dark horse, and I feel it needs some props. It's not your run-of-the-mill tofu, because this has had some serious make out action with a grill after getting itself all sauced up. If I was a vegetarian, I would eat these for breakfast. And possibly those other meals as well. The bok choy is delicious, and the combination of sauces create notes of umami that take my brain into sushi-esque territory. (I could envision myself grabbing some of these suckers paired with a bottle of sake cloaked in a paper bag, running through the streets of The Bay like some kind of crazy gourmet gutter punk.) So yeah, pork belly bun is deserving of all of its praise. It may *seem* a little dry at first, but the fact it's cloaked in heavenly fat is going to clear that right up. Get it on a steamed bun, as that will help also. Get several (they are cheap!) if you're going to gripe about size. But... I have a feeling that every single bun this place produces is extraordinarily good. Your preference is probably simply a trivial opinion. This is gourmet level stuff from a freaking truck. No dress code, no reservations, none of that. But this stuff is every bit as legit. Seriously.

I tried this truck at the first SJ Eats, after ~2 hours wait. In fact, the line started before the truck were even open. They definitely took their time as all other trucks opened at 5pm and this not until like 6 something. Good thing I was with friends and they were keeping me company. When it was finally my turn, they run out of chicken. I had 2 pork and 1 tofu on steamed buns. The pork almost melted in my mouth, as I bit into it. Tofu was beyond all my expectations (Ok, I never expected much from tofu): crispy panko coating and tender interior and what's more, it was flavourful! A friend got the baked bun, which I am personally not a fan of since it was just a standard Chinese bakery type bun.

First time I ate here, I can truly say the idea was original and the food was great even the tofu. This could also be due to the fact it was the Sactomofo event where we waited for three hours in the sun. In my previous review, I had a gripe about how the prices were more at the event after I noticed the price menu that was posted on yelp. I took back my words and apologized after a chairman bao rep wrote back and explained that the prices were old and that they were unable to take down posted pictures on yelp. Returning yesterday for the Sactomofo 4 event, I decided to show my support by starting my food truck tour with you first instead of the much talked about Nom Nom truck. After waiting a much appreciated one hour only in line, my mind was made up and determined to get one of those pink boxes displayed on the pickup window. When I asked the girl from the order window how many comes in the pink box, I was told it depends on how much I order. Because of her reply, I ordered one of everything baked and steamed and then asked if that was enough to get me the pink box. Ecstatic from her sales pitch, she proudly confirmed that I would be one of the few to be "looking cool" walking around with their exclusive box. However, my food were packed in three plain dull beige looking boxes. When asked why it's not packed in the pink designed box, I was told that they don't "give those away" and that it was "bolted down". Frustrated, I told him I would not have ordered that much if I wasn't able to get the box and that I was told by the cashier girl that I would. Without an apology, his only response to me was "you wanted the box"? Talking about customer service. I don't know you do it up there in s.f. but our local food trucks appreciate the businesses they receive here in Sac. Food trucks cannot legally operate in Sacramento but us foodies show full support to the food truck industry largely due to their food and their appreciation to us patrons. For someone who is well respected in the industry such as yourself, it is shameful that you are using sleezy sales pitch to get more orders in. I expect lies from salespeople, but never thought a food truck would operate in the same way. The food may have been good the first time around, but the tasteless way how you handled it this time around left a bad taste. I should've demanded a refund and not even accept the food but out of respect for the event I said my peace and angrily accepted it walked away. My face may be covered on yelp but I wasn't being anonymous when I was yelling about ur lies in front of everyone. No food is worth a bad unapologetic service, especially from a small business owner.

Heard the hype so I had to give it a try. Since I couldn't decide, I just got one baked and one steamed. For the baked ($6.75), I chose to have tender pork belly with pickled diakon. If you get the pork belly, just know what you're getting into. It's greasy and fattening which makes it so delicious and they give you giant, generous pieces. I'm still trying to decide if I liked the diakon in this bun, so I might have to give this another try before I come to the full conclusion of this bun. I did enjoy the bun itself. For the steamed ($3.75), I got it with pulled pork with savory cabbage and preserved mustard seeds. I liked the meat of the pulled pork - it flavorful and not dry. I liked the cabbage, but the mustard seeds were bitter so if I took a wrong bite I'd get a shooting splurge of bitterness. Next time I'd probably give their other buns a try before settling on a favorite. If you know where they are going to be and plan on going, I'd go early because the lines will start forming.

What is small, melts in your mouth, and full of flavor? M&Ms..........and The Chairman's pork belly steamed bun. ?This truck gives you the fattiest meat you will ever have in your life, depending on whether or not you live long enough before your arteries clog up. ?For something you can finish in two bites, I think 3.25$ is kinda expensive. ?However, the pork belly is good and definitely worth coming back for.

Braised meats with pickled vegetables, wrapped up in a white bread taco. Not remotely authentic bao, but I suppose this is fair enough from a San Francisco food truck. The mouthfeel was good, plenty of bright crunch with savory gooey-ness. Despite the taco presentation, they were difficult to eat on-the-run. I kept loosing my veggies. The flavor profiles were traditional, five spice-ish and salty. The pseudo-bao were seriously overpriced, and the people too cool for school. The guest list cutting the line at Off the Grid was pathetic.

I remember a Yelp reviewer saying the line was long but it'd be worth the wait. Well, imagine my disappointment when I thought Chairman Bao wasn't at last night's Off the Grid at Fort Mason. While scanning the other trucks to see which would make for a suitable choice, I heard a woman say, "Yeah, that's the bun line." It's clear what happens next, right? The line moved quite quickly. A friend and I split two steamed buns (had to save room for other fares, too!): the pork belly with daikon ($3.75) and red sesame chicken with carrots ($3.25). The pork belly bun was phenomenal and by far the best thing I had all night. Go. Go quickly. Wait patiently. Feel great afterward. Tip: Do not get coconut water as it is actually coconut juice with coconut pulp.

Sampled the Chairman's goodies at Off the Grid. The line was pretty long but the wait was worth it. I was famished so ordered two baked buns, one braised pork, one pork belly. In reality, it was a bit too much food. Will go with the smaller steamed bun versions next time. I preferred the pork belly bun, and not just because it was less messy to eat. The meat was tender, flavorful, but not oily tasting. The pickled onions and daikon added some sweetness and texture. I wolfed down that thing like I just walked out a prison camp. 4.5 stars The braised pork bun was good, but maybe due to the fact that I was almost full, wasn't as tasty as the pork belly. The texture of the meat was soft and not stringy, although I wouldn't say it was buttery/melt in your mouth goodness. The pickled cabbage added a punch. I felt like the sandwich lacked something and dipped it in some sriracha and it was an instant pick-me-up. Note to self, always dip the chairman in some spicy chili sauce. 4 stars All in all, I really like the offerings at Chairman Bao. Hopefully he'll call back and we'll have another date.

3.5 stars because I wouldn't say that I'm a "fan" (which is 4 stars) and it's better than "A-OK" (which is 3 stars). I could eat here again but I wouldn't crave it. And I think it's pricey. 6 buns max per person. If you're getting some for friends bring a bag just in case you can't hold it all by hand. I got the Baked Tender Pork Belly w/ Pickled Daikon $6.75 and Steamed Crispy Garlic Tofu with Miso Greens *Vegetarian* $3.25. http://www.yelp.com/biz_¡­ They were messy to eat but that could just be me. Given the price and other options for a $10 lunch around San Ramon, I would skip it but if my friends were already ordering from here next time, I want to try the Baked Braised Pork with Savoy Cabbage and Preserved Mustard Seeds $6.75. Truck Menu http://www.yelp.com/biz_¡­ Every Wednesday, there are 4 food trucks at Bishop Ranch 3 (San Ramon, CA). When we arrived today, the lines were long but Bao's wasn't too bad. My friend was going to this one already and we only had 30 mins so I ordered from here too. Baked buns appear to be the size of an average hamburger. Steamed buns appear to be the size of the buns you get when you order peking duck at a chinese restaurant. Don't forget to squeeze some sriracha in a cup to go with your buns while waiting for your order. Baked Tender Pork Belly w/ Pickled Daikon $6.75 (Steamed is $3.75) ? It was good but it would've tasted better if it was cheaper. Pork belly is fatty and I hate fat from any meat but since I was giving this a shot, I tried to forget that I was eating it and just enjoyed the flavors. They didn't skimp on the daikon and I think I had 3 pieces of pork. I wish I took a better picture of it. Steamed Crispy Garlic Tofu with Miso Greens *Vegetarian* $3.25 (Baked is $6.00) ?The rectangular tofu was a little thicker than half an inch. The tofu was good. I didn't really taste garlic and it wasn't that crispy. The miso greens were bitter so I would skip on this one next time. http://www.yelp.com/biz_¡­

Heard a lot of huff and puff bought these guys so I had to try it when they came to SJ EAT 2011 in DTSJ!! The SJ EATS is a whooooollllee 'nother story in itself.... "/ Aside from that crowded madness, this truck is typically in the SF area so my expectations and anticipation was HIGH! I had hopes to try everything on the menu except the tofu cause.. I EATS MEATS FOO!!! They had Char Siu, Spicy Garlic Chicken, and Crispy Tofu, however no Duck Confit which I was really hoping for :( Got both there Steamed and Baked Version of Char Siu and Garlic Chicken with a cost of about $20 in total. There is a large difference in price, but there is a REASON for it, the Baked ones are about 3X the size of the steamed; its like eating a larger sandwich/burger. The food was great, tasty buns and chewy buns, well seasoned/spiced chicken and char siu. The savory meat flavors went well with the soft dough and crunchy sourness from the pickled veggies stuffed inside (daikon/carrots/bok choy). Portions were decent, but being Chinese and knowing that SF Chinatown has the same stuff for a millions times cheaper holds me back. Its awkward to pay more than a $1 for a bun...seriously man, go eat some bomb dim sum. The only things that turned me off was that the truck/workers/foodboxes were just dingy and greasy at the time...like I don't want to wear white clothes and be near it greasy; however this was the SJ EATS shindig so the masses obviously wore them down.

BOMBAGE! It was worth the long wait for the scrumptious bite of crispy yet tender pork belly bun and the new red sesame chicken bun. Just a dash of Sriracha and those babies were dunzo! But that was a one-time deal folks. I wouldn't wait that long a second time. LOL! The steamed bun is definitely the way to go (and it's way cheaper - $3 versus $6 for the baked bun. Hailz No). Chairman Bao definitely wins the award for best-looking food truck though. Haha :)

I've been to Chairman Bao two times now--once at Off the Grid--Fort Mason, and again at Moveable Feast (formerly SJ Eats). I'd have to say this is probably one of the more tasty of these new food trucks. ?I've tried the Pork Belly, Braised Pork, and the new Sesame Chicken--all delicious, but the Pork Belly, hands down the best of the three. My only gripe is that the lines at these events for Chairman Bao can get kind of long, but once you get your order in, it doesn't take too long for them to call your name. Though compared to other trucks, it doesn't take the most out of your pocket, but $3.75 for steamed buns and around $6 for the baked buns (which I've yet to try) is a bit pricey for the size of the buns. ?But again, if you don't hit up these trucks too often, it's nice to spend a bit more for some tasty food. ? If you haven't it's definitely a must try. Follow them on twitter @chairmantruck to figure out where they've setup shop for the day.

I've been waiting for this moment for a really long time! When I can finally try Chairman Bao. I've been trying to track it down for a while with no luck. I finally figured out that it comes every other week to Civic Center. I had the chicken and the pork belly. Wow, the pork belly was sooo good!! It was crispy pork paired with yellow daikon radish. I'm not such a huge fan of daikon that is SO yellow.. seems quite unnatural. But it was crunchy and paired well with the fatty pork belly. The sesame chicken was okay... meat was tender, tasty, and all that, but nothing to write home about. Steamed buns are 3.25 or 3.75, depending on the filling. Kinda pricey, but not too bad for a food truck, and 2 are enough to fill you up for a meal. I want to try a baked bun next!

I've always caught the bun truck either at San Mateo, OtG Fort Mason or the Civic Center. I've tried the pork belly and the red sesame chicken buns (both steamed and baked) and ?O M G - their GOOD! I prefer the baked bun better than the steamed. The pork belly has a fresh, kinda salty but meaty taste to it and the chicken one is a bit spicy (which for me is perfect) they are GOOD! a bit pricey but I don't mind buying them, it's all about quality and flavor here!

I feel a little silly saying the name out loud, too, but it is delicious fare. Just joined the Oracle crowd (so, late-twenties-early-thirties mostly asian americans) here for lunch - I took a wrong turn after Oracle Parkway so I had to pull a U but was very amused at the crowd of folks swarming across that big grassy field to get to the truck. Luckily I was driving so I beat the crowd ;) $9 is a little stiff for lunch, and a light one at that: two steamed baos (like everyone else says, it's a street taco size) and a fresh fruit boba drink, but wow, they do what they give you right. I got the pork belly (savory, fatty, and delicious, although personally I'm not that into the pickled crunch of daikon and onions - do appreciate the effort for texture though) and crispy garlic tofu with miso greens, which was surprisingly tender for being fried, and the creamy sauce they use looks overwhelming but is actually really light. I'm as big a fan of meat as the next person but also love what people can do with soybeans and it shows versatility too! The highlight, though, was the pineapple salted caramel drink. mmm... tangy pineapple chunks with a creamy finish over crushed ice and good chewy boba. I actually let this creation melt a little bit halfway so I could get the full creamy effect. It was amazing, and a good size too, so on second thought I actually did end up being more satisfied with the meal portion. The other drink offerings sound tempting but I really don't think I want to try anything else anymore. :0) Thanks for coming out to the Peninsula! ps. looking up this truck's facebook fan page is kinda fun. Facebook asks every time, "Did you mean: 'carman bao'?" no, not really.

Chairman Bao showed up at the alley next to my work where all the food trucks chill. Id heard of them, seen the pictures, and was delighted to get a chance to try. Anticipating lines we stepped outside the office at 5pm and waited 15 mins to be first. I'm glad we did this because the line quickly grew to 15 people within 30 seconds. Word of Chairman Bao in the Tehama alley travels fast. Upon recommendation I got the Tender Pork Belly with Daikon and the Garlic Tofu with Miso Greens - both steamed. They. Were. Delicious. Light, tender and juicy - I am in love! Definitely worth trying! Chairman Bao, please bring your Bun Truck back to Tehama. I need to try your Duck, Sesame Chicken and Meatball buns.

Baked is $5.95. Steamed is 2.95. we got the steamed buns (white ones like the ones you get with peking duck), but now that i know, i wished i ordered the baked instead. the bun is bigger and looks super tender and i can only assume it means more filling too. next time, next time. the duck and chicken were good but nothing revolutionary. the surprise winner was actually the tofu and garlic.

I love the flavor combination and the little steamed buns are cute. I also tried the Red Sesame Chicken with Scallions and Bok Choy. Very tasty! Three buns filled me up, but I could have easily eaten four. $2.95 a pop, its not really cheap eats, but worth a try. I hope to see more food trucks in E-Ville.

I first tried them at Off the Grid. ?Oh wait, that's the only time I've tried them. ?I'd heard lots of good things and it had the longest line, so we got some tacos from Kung Fu Tacos and ate while we stood in line for Chairman Bao. ?It took maybe 10-15 minutes since we had gotten there fairly early. ?I ordered the Red Sesame Chicken w/ Scallion & Bok Choy steamed bao and the Duck Confit w/ Mango Salad steamed bao. ?I went for the steamed bao because it was cheaper than the baked bao at $2.75. ?I could get baos so much cheaper in Chinatown or Clement Street or on Irving Street. ?But I had to try these baos. ? My favorite was definitely the Red Sesame Chicken one. ?Oh so good! ?Not something I'd eat all the time because I'd go broke. ?You don't get filled up just ordering two baos, so you have to order more food and at those prices, it really adds up. Ending. ?Food good. ?Price not so good.

I was dying to try the Infamous Chairman Bao Bun Truck. First off, being a design major I LOVE the art on the truck. Definite cool points there and that's not just because I love pandas. Pork Belly Steamed Bun. With Pickled Daikons and Chives. YUMMY! I love fatty pork belly and the steamed bun was really good as well. The flavors mixed really well together, the tanginess of the daikon was subdued by the fat of the pork and the sweetness of the bun. I'm looking forward to eating their food again!

After missing OtG so many weeks in a row, I was ecstatic that CB would be coming to Palo Alto for Edgewood Eats. Then they postponed it by a week! So tonight, after much too long of a wait, I finally experienced the awesomeness that is the Bao. Because I'd waited so long, and because I didn't know when I'd get to try it again, I went a little overboard and got 3 steamed buns - pork belly, duck confit, and braised pork. The pork belly was by far the best, with the duck coming in a somewhat close 2nd. The braised pork, very meh. I mean it was good, but compared to the other 2 - I mean, there is no comparison. The bun isn't your typical pork belly bun that you'd get at a Chinese restaurant; it's more...fancy? Fusion? Something like that. Still VERY good, but if you're looking for a taste of Taiwan, this isn't it. $3 something per bun, and they accept credit cards! Yay.

I had a couple of baos at Edgewood Eats. ?They were both delicious. ?I can't remember the exact price, but I know they were around $3 for the steamed ones. ?The baked ones were more, but I did not have any of these. The two I had were the crispy garlic tofu with miso greens and the pork belly with pickled daikon. ?Both were good with the pork belly one winning. Naturally, the pork belly was very fatty, but the pickled daikon helped to cut it a bit, providing a nice balance. ?Make no mistake though, it was not diet food. ?But it was dee-lish. I thought the price was fair and service reasonably quick. ?I would get food from here again.

So I first went here without really knowing too much about it. I was a recent transplant from Portland, OR (where the foodcart reigns) and my friend dragged me here without too much of a fuss. I ordered the pork belly bao and nearly died -- could this be my San Francisco version of the Portland food carts? When I went back nearly a month later, I was bursting to the seams with anticipation -- I ordered every bao available after waiting in an insufferably long line at OTG Fort Mason. What followed was disaster: I was underwhelmed by the chicken, tofu, and duck bao. I thought the chicken was too spicy with not enough flavor, the tofu too soft and bland, and the duck was awkward with its sauce. The pork belly bao was still a real winner, but I was disappointed by the rest. So conclusion? Chairman Bao's real winner is their pork belly bao (this bao alone earned a star to itself -- otherwise I would have just given it a three). But a secret is to go on Wednesdays after work when they're parked by Bloodhound on Folsom in SOMA -- small line, usually little wait -- that's what really cemented their 4 star rating in my book. Otherwise, they're really not worth the long wait on their OTG days.

The steamed buns are like little tacos made out of steamed bun dough (or at least that's the type the husband and I tried)! ?I've never seen bao done this way so it was a bit novel for me. The food overall was pretty good, although I remember being a little disappointed it wasn't better (for example, I had really high hopes for the duck with mango and it was only OK). ? We tried a selection of everything on offer and my favorites were the tofu bun which had a great sauce on it (assuming that's the "miso greens" dressing) and the pork belly with pickled daikon which was really delicious. ?Both the hubs and I agreed that there should have been much more of the daikon, it was REALLY good. The husband's favorite was the red sesame chicken. ?For me it was too spicy, but he went back and got a couple more after we were finished. ?One, because that's how much he liked them, and two, because we weren't all that full after having two buns each and some of their fruit drinks (strawberry coconut, SO GOOD). Because the buns were small and thus weren't super filling, we ended up spending quite a bit of money here, which bummed us out. ?Part of the point of trucks (imo) is that you can get a really good product on the cheap (see: Jon's Street Eats, also not exactly cheap but some really high end stuff so it all evens out). ?The buns were tasty, but I'm not sure we would go out of our way again to get them because of the cost. ? (Although, I am curious to try the baked buns and see how they compare to the steamed variety so you never know).

I made the trek to try Chairman Bao's Bun truck at the Emeryville stop coming from San Jose; needless to say it was a tasty trip that was worth my time. As a pork bun fanatic, I've been itching to try this truck. ?I finally had the chance to grab a bite on my day off at work. I arrived early, about 11:45am, but apparently that wasnt early enough to snatch the highly sought after pork belly bun with daikon. ?The line was minimal and picked up by 12:15. I ended up getting two of each of the following steamed buns; Duck confit with mango slices, braised Berkshire pork with savoy cabbage and preserved mustard seed, and spicy sesame chicken with pickled carrots. ? All of them had a great balance between savory, and sour-y. My fav meat might have been the pork....it's oh so tender. The duck confit also had wonderful flavor. ?The chicken had a spicey kick but not to strong. ?The buns are soft, I'm not sure if they are house made or from a vendor but they taste authentic. I also ordered the pina colada matcha which was freakin sour! It doesn't pair to well with the buns imo. ?It's way to soury, the buns have enough acidity imo. Overall, I am very pleased and will try again so I can order a porky belly bun. ?Good stuff. also one of my fav artist, James Jean did the truck art. sweeet!

I have little to no experience with this type of cuisine, so find another review if you are looking for an "expert." ?That said, these are some tasty buns. I had the crispy garlic tofu with miso greens, and it was excellent on all fronts. The ingredients were fresh, well-prepared, and complement each quite well. I can't say I'd actively seek out Chairman Bao, but I'd be pleasantly surprised to run across him somewhere.

I just can't shake the fact that Chairman Bao Bun Truck is so pricey. Each small morsel will run you $3.75. It's kind of sad for me to take down my rating a star because of price since the product they sell is quite tasty. The reality is when it comes to rating a joint you got to take into account expense to taste ratio. 1st Bun (Steamed with pulled pork, savoy cabbage & preserved mustard seeds): Not sure if I was in love with it especially the topping combination, but I have to acknowledge the unique taste it had. The pulled pork was delicious. 2nd Bun (Steamed pork belly bao with pickled daikon): The pork belly was divine. mmmm I loved the texture and juiciness. Pork belly in MY BELLY. I'll fork up $3.75 for this, damn it. Not for the first bun tho. ? Overall I'll say it's solid and novel. You can probably head to china town and get something cheaper and lots of it, but the quality and flavor won't be nearly as good. The truck has a real cool design. The people are friendly. No reason not to try it. All about expectations I suppose.

I am a MAJOR fan of food trucks - doesn't matter what they serve, I am so there! ?The Chairman Bao Bun Truck does an interesting take on Chinese buns. ?It's more like a bun sammie than a bun, but that's okay. Bottom line: - interesting ingredients, with big slab of "meat" (duck or pork belly or tofu) or diced chicken -- the big slab is a bit off-putting for me and the bun cannot hold up next to the slab - interesting slaw toppers - totally prefer steamed buns over the baked buns - a bit pricey for what it is

Buns? Baked or steamed are fine with me! I was lucky enough to get my hands on these awesome buns at OTG Haight. I ended up getting the red sesame chicken with pickled sliced cucumber and carrot as well as the crispy garlic tofu with miso greens. Both baked "People's Buns" at $6 each. Steamed ones are $3.25. "Chairman's Buns" such as the pork belly are $3.75 steamed and $6.75 for baked. The red sesame chicken was my favorite! Really delicious! The chicken was tender and slightly spicy and the cucumbers and carrots were refreshing. The crispy tofu on the other hand, was lacking the garlic flavor I was looking for and the tofu could have been crispier. It was just alright. I gave this truck another go when they were parked in front of the Frey Norris Gallery opening a couple of weeks ago. Anyway, I got the red sesame chicken again, but this time steamed...and it was just as good! I also tried the Bao chips ($2.50), which were basically fried wonton chips with bits of nori and salt. They were a little too salty for my liking so I really wouldn't recommend them. To sum it up, I've had pretty good experiences with this truck and look forward to eating more buns from them. Sure they're a tad pricey, but IMO they're worth it. Also, if you see them at OTG make sure you stand in their line first before you decide to venture to another food truck because their line is always the longest!

Founds this place at Fort Mason on their Off the Grid route, and we've been on a quest to find this place to eat there since. Finally we saw them on Castro street at the Gas station spot they occupy during the week. The Pork Belly was our favorite. I could eat these buns for the rest of my life and never get sick of them. These guys are the best!

Pork Belly Bun, right? RIGHT?! That's what everyone's going to talk about. That's how I heard about it , actually! From everyone talking about it! Tried it yesterday at UpperHaight and it was tasty! It is oily but the oil is so yummy and tasty! Honestly though I somehow assumed the bun was going to be a little bigger for $3.50 but that's how street food is. You gotta expect it. The pickles on top compliment the pork belly very well! Not sticky like the pork belly your grandma might make at home

How can one imagine pork buns to be better than the authentic, traditional style? You'll just have to eat it to find out. Try the pork belly and the tofu. Eat the tofu first though 'cause you'll want the pork to be the last taste in your mouth. Ohhhh sooo good...

Unique truck. ?Usually bao or manapua (in Hawaii) comes steamed with filling inside the bun. Chairman Bao offers a unique spin on this by wrapping the bun round the filling (like a taco). The chicken was good, tender and delicious. The picked veggies on top were yummy. You need to order 2-3 to get full since each one is pretty small. Worth a try.

First time at Off the Grid in the Haight...got here around 4:45 on a Thursday and found parking about 2 blocks away...Yay! Tried the Chairman Bao Bun truck due to the reviews and suggestions...i was so looking forward to the duck bun but unfortunately, all they had was the pork belly! ?Bummer....if anything, this helped to moderate my food consumption because after eating one, i had to have another...even my friend went back and ordered 5 to go... Description of the pork belly bun: * pork belly juicy, tender with an outer crispness * the bun was the standard steamed pork bun (without the filling) * pickled thinly sliced yellow daikon Very simple ingredients but full of flavor. Note: ?as soon as you get there, reserve yourself some chairs to sit and eat...otherwise, you'll be eating standing up! not optimum

Tried them out at the Eat Real festival in Oakland. ?They had a super-long line for most of the day, but it quieted down later in the afternoon.

BOOM CHICKA BAO WOW. CHAIRMAN BAO- HES GOTS THE BAOS TO MAKE YOU GO TAH DAO. OH YAO. Funny thing was that there were no asians to be found in the crowd. Well they were stationed right outside Bloodhound on a Wednesday night in the middle of SOMA on Folsom and not Chinatown. And also because your buns are pretty darn expensive. Let me break it down: Peoples Buns: Baked $6.00 Steamed $3.25 Red sesame chicken with scallion and bok choy Crispy garlic tofu with miso greens (veggie) Chairmans Buns: Baked: $6.75 Steamed: $3.75 Chinese spiced Duck confit with fresh mango salad Tender pork belly with pickled daikon Pulled pork with savoy cabbage and preserved mustard seeds They ran out of the pork belly and pulled pork, so we shared a duck confit. The steamed bun was like a peking duck bun but not fluffy or pillowy. It was more flat and dense. It was flavorful and juicy, so much so there our lil taco was sitting on a pool of juicyness. You'd need a whole lot of steamed suckers to get you full, but this is more of a snack. And you won't necessarily find these guys at your friendly neighborhood Chinese joint. Their Mao Bao shirt with the Bao panda head and a Chairman Bao food truck logo on the back is $20. They will even wrap in an authentic pink plastic bag for you, like the ones you get grocery shopping on Irving, Clement, or Chinatown.

If they had this food in the south it would be mobbed. This so reminds me of southern barbecue. The sweet and savory tastes reminds me of barbecue and cole slaw. It is sinfully delicious. Loved the steamed and baked bun. The pork belly will literally kill you but you'd feel like you were in heaven. Needless to say you could try the sesame chicken or the coca cola braised pork to save some calories. This is not for the diet conscious.

Maybe because I was one of the stragglers banging on the food truck, at the close of the evening, when all the goods had already been pillaged, but my first experience at Chairman Truck left much to be desired. ?I tried the pork belly and the pulled pork creations, but my buns were assembled sloppy with a random assortment of ingredients because there was a shortage on supplies. ?The pork belly was tasty, but the salads that were thrown on top were conflicting to the palette. ?Maybe next time, the right layers of flavor will be assembled for a more accurate reflection, but until that time, I can only recall a tasty meat morsel on a soggy bun with sloppy veggies.

Umami! Oooh, mami! Sweet and flavorful and unexpected marriage of flavors and textures, in the charmingly post-apocalyptic industrial wasteland environment that only a randomly parked lunch truck can provide. The pork belly bun was phe-phrakin-nomenal. Tender, juicy, succulent. The sesame chicken bun was good but more ordinary. It met my expectations and pleased me but didn't provide any surprises. The fresh pineapple salted caramel slushie bubble tea was a delightful exclamation point to end the meal. The food was all rich, but the portions were small, so I felt fine eating everything. $9 for the whole shebang. Cute truck, too!

The walk (and the wait) was worth it! ?Finally the star aligned where I was free to make a decent walk for lunch and the Chairman was kind enough to post itself within striking distance. With a head full of anticipation and expectations, I walked nearly a mile and climbed a few steep blocks on California to reach Chairman Bao. ?I decided to gorge and go for the baked bun combo meal + an extra steamed bun for variety. ?This meant a baked bun with pork belly as well as a steamed bun with chicken. The pork belly sandwich was great. ?Keeping it simple, it went without any fancy sauce and stuck to the basics of pickled daikon along with fatty, yet flavorful slices of pork belly. ?Nomalicious to say the least. The red sesame chicken w/ scallion and bok choy can be likened to korean spicy chicken. ?It had a similar flavor and crunch from the greens and was smothered in spicy sauce. ? The buns in itself were good and of high quality, assuming they were bought from a legit Chinese bakery. ?To top it off, I had a lychee ginger shaved ice drink that was uber refreshing. ? 4 very solid stars and the only reason it doesn't get 5 is because, for some reason, I just wasn't blown away. ?This could be due to the high expectations or 2 months of anticipation, but it was simply very delicious, rather than amazing. ?Need to revisit to give the duck a try and maybe it'll bump it up.

They were off the grid in San Ramon today. Truly delicious. I would have to say that these are more like bao sandwiches than the bao i was picturing in my head, but nonetheless they were absolutely yummy. They don't get 5 stars simply because it takes FOREVER to get your order. I don't know if they were just overwhelmed with customers, but I had to wait about 15 minutes for my order. So just prepare to wait. They are quite good. The steamed versions cost around $3 and the baked ones are ?around $6. The steamed ones are in what look to me like peking duck buns filled with yummy savory goodness (pork belly with pickled daikon or duck confit with mango salsa or chicken with bok choy and scallions...). So they are considerably smaller than their baked counterparts. The baked ones are about the size of a hamburger bun sliced in half and filled with the filling of your choice. Not sure the steamed ones are worth it... The duck confit was moist and flavorful and perfectly matched with the mango salsa. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. I'm so glad I got another one to take home for dinner!! They also have specials where you can get a gourmet boba drink with your baked bao for $9 (flavors I saw were mango with matcha green tea, pineapple with salted caramel and strawberry coconut) - i didn't get one, but they looked pretty tasty and popular. I am hoping they will come back out the east-east bay again sometime soon!!

I biked over to their stop in SOMA at 1.39. Much to my chagrin, they had closed at 1.30 and were already packing up for their next location. When I approached the window to confirm my fears, Ray (one of the owners) came out and offered to make me a tofu bun because they hadn't put it away yet. It came out seconds later, yummy, drippy, and delicious. And when I offered to pay, he refused to take my money because he couldn't offer me a full choice of menu options. Loyalty for ever.

Growing up with authentic and tasty Chinese food in Hong Kong and Vancouver kinda ruined me for Chairman Bao. The first time I saw this truck I had no desire to try their buns, but after reading the great Yelp reviews--and in my effort to sample all the food trucks the Bay Area has to offer--I made it my first stop at a recent Off The Grid at Fort Mason. (It was a good thing I went there first as the lines were humongously long soon after!) I'd planned to try a steamed and a baked bun but changed my mind when I saw the prices (http://www.yelp.com/biz_¡­). $3.5 for a steamed bun was steep enough so there was no way I would pay $6 for a baked one. (Though I saw someone else eat one and they were the size of burgers--not exactly small eats. Still, you can get a baked bbq pork bun in Chinatown for 70 cents.) I got the red sesame chicken and braised pork steamed buns (http://www.yelp.com/biz_¡­). The chicken was flavourful but really really spicy; the bok choy helped and provided a nice crunch. I liked the braised pork better; it was flavourful but not as intense and very tender (kinda like pulled pork). I wasn't a fan of the steamed bun itself though. Chairman Bao doesn''t make them fresh so by the time you get them they're cold and stale. Steamed buns should really only be eaten fresh--while there's still steam coming off and the skin still slightly sticks to your fingers. Overall the buns were just meh and the inflated prices didn't help. I'd much rather have the authentic stuff for only a small fraction of the price.

Great idea, but still over-rated and over-priced. ?$3.xx for steamed buns and $6.xx for baked buns. ?Definitely overpriced for the baked, but apparently, people are still willing to pay a premium for a yuppie pork bun. ?Yes, the flavors are different, but you do get more bang for your buck paying $1 or $1.50 for a pork bun at your regular Chinese hole in the wall. ? I tried the pork belly (steamed) as it seemed to be the popular one. ?I had no idea what to expect as I imagined a chewy meat, as that's what pork belly usually is. ?It turned out different - it tasted like chicken, although it was a bit rough on the outsides like overcooked meat. ?It wasn't bad, but it wasn't super drool in your mouth good either. ? I think I'll go back to my old school pork buns. ?BTW, a lot of people aren't aware of baked pork buns (everyone knows of the steamed fluffy white version) - definitely try the baked ones the next time you're at a Chinese bakery.

The food: I ordered the lion's head and pork belly. ?The pork belly meat itself was good....everything else not. ?I was hungry so this should have made things taste better. ?The sauce was horrible. ?For all the fancy build charts they have, the actual construction of the food doesnt really work very well especially with the excess for crappy sauce. ?The lions head was not impressive at all.

I was pleasantly surprised to find one of SF's food trucks that I'd yet to track down parked a block away from my apartment this morning. I'll admit it wasn't the highest mobile cart on my (long) list because there are lots of stationary Chinese restaurants and Chairman Bao didn't sound too unique. I was wrong. As the name implies, Chairman Bao Bun Truck specializes in steamed and baked buns that are not your standard Chinese food fare. The steamed buns looked similar to the ones you might find at a Dim Sum place that I'd never been a big fan of, so I went with the Spicy Red Sesame Chicken baked bun with bok choy. It was delish! It was somewhat spicy (a good thing in my book) and the chicken was well spiced. I'm not a huge fan of bok choy but the chicken was dominant in the bun and the bok choy complemented it nicely. The baked bun is enough for a small lunch, I would add on a steamed bun (which is smaller and cheaper) to make a complete meal. I hope they have the duck confit bun next time!

Went to OTG at Fort Mason today. Since it was gloomy outside and looked like it was going to rain, the lines were short. We got the steamed bun with sesame chicken. It was good, but it was so small. I most likely wouldn't get it steamed unless I wanted to eat a small portion. Getting the steamed bun when you're hungry is such a tease to the tummy and the taste buds. So we decided to get the duck with baked buns. It made a huge difference, size wise too. It was very very good. Very flavorful, it had a hint of lemongrass and a good kick of spice. I love the mixture of the flavor, the mango salad and the sauce. Man, what a combination in flavors.

I had a missed opportunity last month when arriving to Off the Grid late and all the trucks closing up shop. 2 weeks ago I finally had a chance to get some Chairman Bao in Emeryville. I got myself the pulled pork steamed bun, my girlfriend got the same but with the baked bun. The steamed was a better deal, the pork was great, but for an extra $3 for the baked bun ($6.75), I'll go with the steamed for $3.75. I couldn't help but think of cooked duck with steam bun and hoisin sauce, something you can get from a restaurant. I think I must have hyped up Chairman Bao alittle too much because I ended up walking away telling myself that the price and experience could had been spent at another truck. I will have to give this another try, but not quite sure if I will make a special trip for it...

I love you all, I do. And I'm totally on the same page that for a bun this is a lot of cash to pay. But if I want a $.99 to $1.25 bun, I'll go to chinatown or Ranch99. Yes this is totally hypocritical, but for $7 I can get two buns that are absolutely filling for lunch on a Friday and still have $3 I woudln't have if I ate at other locals near Civic Center. Also, they are delicious and until I can make them at home I'll be okay paying this much every once in a while. Yes that is the rule of thumb, if I can't make it myself, I can't complain about a moderate to high price... just saying.

I had my gf wait in line here while I was getting other food at Edgewood Eats. ?She had to wait over 30 minutes which isn't really a problem since it's a decision she/we made. For one thing I think the price icons for this place needs to be raised. ?It's almost 3 dollars for a bun but the bun is smaller than a taco. ?I can literally eat one in two bites so it will definately take more than $10 to get me full. They have interesting twists on the buns but I could not believe how much sauce they put on each one. ?It is ridiculously drowned in sauce. ?It makes a mess and it makes it near impossible to actually taste what is in each bun... I had the chicken bun with carrots, shredded pork, ?and pickles and the veggie tofu bun.

The first time I had the steamed Chairman Bao pork belly, I died because it's greatness. The combination of the Japanese pickled radish (Takuan) went perfectly with the hoisin and rich pork meat. Everything was just awesome. The second time I went, I got the baked bun as well as the steamed one. The baked one was too sweet, and by the time I got to the steamed one, I was pork bellied out forever. The dish is great in small amounts. DO NOT get more than you can eat. The steamed one is the size of a burger. It was nice knowing you Chairman, perhaps we shall meat again.

One word. Addicted. I was introduced to the food truck phenomenon by a coworker and immediately though the idea of gourmet ?food trucks was brilliant. ?Why didn't I think of it?! Small menu, but that is perfect for this type of adventure. ?Can find them at Off the Grid events, which is nice to have that "schedule" or on their own around the Bay Area, including my workplace in Emeryville. Check their twitter to know where they are that day. Simple. Clean. Tasty. More. More. More. Red sesame chicken bun and pork belly bun are addictive. ?Just a warning.

Stopped by here during the Bayview Sunday Streets. I was craving some more local flavor, barbeque or something, but my companion was distracted by the freshly painted red van. He offered to pay, so I was down to try something new. I guess these little sandwiches are like the Chinese White Castle? The fillings were very tasty, but I would have needed a few of them to avoid being left hungry. At $5.75/each, that's not going to happen. Back to tacos for me!

Peking duck with scallions and hoisin sauce sandwiched in a palm size white bun is what love tastes like. ?T'was my favorite dish back when I was in China at the tender age of 12 years old. ? Chairman Bao comes pretty close, lemme tell ya. ?There they were, their grand truck in front of John Collins......and there I was: parked illegally in front of some garage with my mom waiting in the car. ? I ordered 4 little steamed buns since the white ones are my favorite. ?I think there was some kind of spicy pork thing going on in one of them. ?We also had fried tofu which had a tater tottish breading. ?My one and only beau: the chef, says that the sauce really makes the fried tofu bun. ? I found one of the buns to be a little dried out and that's a no-candoski baby doll. Tip of the day, Chairman, put the tapioca on top and pass me a spoon.

Baked is $5.95. Steamed is 2.95. We went for steamed for all of us. Got a whole bunch for a group of us, but I had: Duck Pork Belly Pulled pork Liked the last two. For me, the description for first one was getting a bun, adding some duck, and sauce from the fridge. Seemed very basic. Drink: Lychee ginger. I twas interesting...Was able to drink and it tasted more and more like lychee, since that was at the top and it slowly went toward the straw at the bottom. Light ginger flavor. At first tasted like one of those Chinese dried plums in a plastic wrapper, then paper wrapper.

They were parked outside Economy Restaurant Fixtures on 7th and Irwin. ?I got the $10 deal - 2 steamed buns and a drink. ? Bun #1: pulled pork , I think with some bok choy? Bun #2: red sesame chicken, I think with radish/ginger? Drink: ginger-lychee pearl ball tea Sorry, my memory is hazy cos I wolfed them down fast whilst sitting on the sidewalk flipping through a magazine. ?The overall impression they left was 'mmm simple comfort food.' I forget which toppings went on which but there was a bit of bok choy (?) on one and some radish/ginger on the other... at least I think. ?My memory of the buns is hazy -- mainly remember thinking 'mmm filling comfort food'.' ?These are certainly not the best buns ever-- the flavors were good but didn't completely come together-- and they're not cheap. ?But it's a great idea for a food truck and when combined with the nice graphic design of the truck itself the proposition becomes irresistible. ?Who could walk by this truck and not buy a bun?! ? You'd have to be a zombie or something... ?or maybe Robocop... I don't recommend the ginger-lychee tea. ?It was cloying sweet and I didn't finish it. Next time I'ma try the baked bun-- it costs twice as much and the lady told me it's much larger. Yay foodtrucks

The first time I had Chariman Bao was at the Superhero Street Fair last summer. With a cape on my back and several strong cocktails in my system, these yummy little bao-inspired tacos hit the spot in the best possible way. Did the memory hold up to my mid-week lunchtime experience a few months later? Yes and no. I had three of those little tacos -- and I say "tacos" because that's basically what they are, yummy fillings served on top a round piece of steamed bread, and "little" because for $3.50 and $3.75 a pop, they are easy to finish in three bites. Flavorful, but with sobriety, it just seems a little on the expensive side. The pork belly and daikon is a great flavor combination, but the pork belly was not as tender as I was expecting. The duck confit packed a lot of spicy heat, and the tender greasy meat paired well with the mango. The sesame chicken felt meaty and substantial and the sesame flavor mixed well with the sauteed greens on top. The next time I'm stumbling out of Bloodhound, I'll be happy to enjoy a bar-time snack with the Chairman.

Dear Chairman Bao, i love you, i love you, i love you!! I have been wanting to try you forever and there you were today at Civic Center-- just a 10 minute walk from my work. Your pork belly and duck steamed buns made both my mouth (teeth extractions have made stayed away from "hard foods") and tummy happy. Your mango matcha green tea slush was to die for.

I went to the Chairman for the first time last week when it was in SOMA. Being a Hong Kong native, I'm pretty picky about baos, and I was impressed! When I heard about Chairman Bao, I was a bit skeptical... It sounded like a novelty thing that couldn't possibly be enough to be a meal, but I was wrong! I thought that their menu always had everything on their facebook menu, so I really wanted to try the duck on steamed buns, but they didn't have it. I ended up sharing 3 steamed buns plus 1 baked one with my boy: Baked: Pulled Pork - This was so filling! I think we could have ordered just 1 baked + 2 steamed buns. The pork was tasty and tender. The huge mustard seeds were interesting... Steamed: Red Sesame Chicken - I loved it! The chicken was very flavorful and the chopped pieces of bok choy was a nice touch. Crispy Garlic Tofu - This was pretty good. Probably the most tasty tofu I've had in a while, but the texture was a bit too mushy for me. Also Pulled Pork I really enjoyed the buns and will come back for more! Looking forward to trying the duck confit in a steamed bun to see how they interpret the traditional combination.

I was riding my bike through Potrero today and lo and behold I spotted the red Chairman Bao Truck parked on Arkansas with NO LINES. ?I know there has been a lot of buzz about the Baos and the lines usually meander with hungry food truck foodies. ?So of course I had to stop and try the pork belly bao with pickled daikons. ?It was a bit pricey at $3.75 for a small steamed bao...but I must say it was mighty good and quite addictive. ?The pork belly was slow-cooked with a hint of hoisin sauce and the pickled daikon slices added a little crunch. ?I can see why people love them! This reminds me of the succulent Peking Duck at Hong Kong Lounge, which they serve with warm little bun pockets, scallions and hoisin sauce. ?You can stuff yourself silly with a whole plate of them buns!

I just can't get enough of their buns!!! My favorite has to be the pork, mustard seed, and cabbage bun. Incredible. Soft, chewy, crunchy. I wish I had it in front of me to further describe its tastiness! but anyway, thats the one I recommend. If you want something sweet, get the duck with the mango bun. I don't know if they have this all the time, but if its on the menu, get the butternut squash miso soup. I can't believe how perfect it was for a brisk cold sunny day (in Emeryville). That day, I ordered one pork bun, and I finished it, and thought that I needed another one. So I went back to teh truck but they ran out of the pork. instead, they told me they can put duck in there, and they did and HOLY mother it was pure perfection. They also have a convenient bottle of Sriracha sauce if you need some spicy to your bun. I do agree that it gets a bit pricey for their buns but after tasting them you won't care how much you pay. I wish they had more days in the East Bay, but one day is better than no days! hands down one of the best trucks in the Bay Area, and I feel that we are so lucky to have this truck..not only for their food, but for having a really unique graphic on their truck that really stands out (if you are at Off the Grid you know what I mean).

First time trying them via SJ Food Truck Fest, pretty pissed at the fact that after 3 hours of chilly wait in line, they ran out of almost everything except tofu. ?So we ordered both the bake bun and the steam bun. ?My sympathy to the other 30+ people lining behind us that was told nothing was left after waiting in line for however long. ?There were no warnings on what items ran out throughout either, you just got to see what you can choose when your turn comes. ?No star for service, the 4 star is just for food. The quality is pretty good! ?The baked bun is soft and fresh, the steam bun is also nice. ?The tofu steak inside was good in texture and nicely flavored with mayo and pickled daikon. ? Not overly cheap as a steamed one cost $3.5 and a baked one $6, but the baked bun is as big as a sandwich. ?I do hope I get to try other more popular flavors next time.

Next to Roli Roti, Chairman Bao is my favorite food truck in San Francisco. Just the thought of their pillowy steamed buns filled with fatty, savory pork belly and crunchy slices of pickled daikon makes me salivate. Their duck confit and mango salad bun should also not be missed. After waiting in line (this truck usually has the longest line), you should get your fill on both. **For my full review on foodtrucks around SF, visit my blog link under my profile. Enjoy!**

The foood was really tasty and flavorful, each flavor was distinct and added well to the bun. I had a steam bun with pork belly and marinated daikon. Pretty delicious.- cost ~3 bucks after tax. I also had the larger Baked Bun with Lionshead meatballs. That was tasty as well, but i definitely had better Lionshead Meatballs. They don't make their own bread though, they buy it from somewhere else. Overall- kinda pricy for what you get, but the flavors were exquisite.

Ahhh, the much-hyped Chairman Bao bun truck. After reading the reviews and braving the long line, I finally got my grubby hands on the pork belly with pickled daikon and lion's head meatball with kimchee steamed buns. The steamed buns are the same type you get when you order Peking duck at any Chinese restaurant. The pork belly bun came with two small pieces of tasty pork belly, topped with some pickled daikon. I thought the combination was interesting (in a good way). On the other hand, the "lion's head meatball" bun was a complete disappointment. The meatball sucked (do yourself a favor and try a lion's head meatball in any Beijing or Shanghai Chinese restaurant - even the mediocre ones we have in SF will give you a better idea of how a lion's head meatball SHOULD taste) and the bland cabbage they call "kimchee" is an insult to Koreans. I don't mind paying premium prices for premium products, but Chairman bao is not it. I think it's ridiculously overpriced for what you get.

This is the one food truck that always has the longest line. I'm pretty lazy when it comes to waiting in line for food or entertainment but finally got a chance to the tofu steamed bun with garlic at Off the Grid recently. I went to Chairman Bao at around 5pm and there was still a 45 minute wait to order. I sucked it up and stood there. My advice is to go with a few friends so everyone can take turns stepping out of line to check out the other trucks. Bao, your buns are pretty tasty but the hour long wait is a huge turn-off.

My friend Sing, Kevin and I enjoyed Chairman Bao for the first time at the Civic Center Off the Grid one misty Friday afternoon. Given the food is coming off a truck, this food is pretty yum. Service is good too. One lady walked up and down the line to make sure everyone knew what was on the menu, how to order and made sure everyone's questions were answered before getting to the front and creating a stand still. I had their Miso Tofu bun with their Mango Green Tea and I was definitely pleasantly pleased. The miso tofu wasn't fried too deep and the slightly pickled baby bak choi was the perfect filling for the perfectly steamed yummy gua bao. YUM. I *heart* gua bao. The only reason they aren't getting a perfect 5 is b/c I want more vegetarian options...otherwise, I'm happy and could live with this one Tofu option for a while longer. Can't wait for the next encounter with the Chairman. =0)

I've been dying to try the infamous "Chairman Bao Bun Truck" and unfortunately the hype probably created too high of standards for me. I've only tried the pork belly steamed and baked bun (boo they were all out of the duck when I went) and for the the size, the food was overpriced (let's not forget, it's a food truck and their overhead must be low). ? Don't get me wrong, the pork was well-seasoned and not too salty, and I loved the crunch and flavor the pickled daikon gave it, but it's still just meat fat on buns. ?The bao bun truck is generous on bun to meat/fat ratio, but at the end of the day that much fat shouldn't cost that much. What I found delicious though was the $3.50 mango matcha green tea drink. Not too sweet and full of different colors and textures. ?I highly recommend everyone to try these concoctions. I almost feel like these refreshments should be the truck's stronger selling point! That said, I'm glad I tried this truck and would probably eat the food again, minus having to wait the 20 minute for my pork fat on a bun combo.

Imagine my surprise when Chairman Bao was parked out in front of Munroe Motors this past Saturday. I had gone to MM to pick up some parts for my Triumph and the clerk was damn near inhaling his steamed bun. "Damn, that looks good," I said. He just looked at me with glazed eyes and nodded an emphatic yes. I picked up my parts and since we hadn't eaten we decided to go for it. Duck Confit Bao filled my peckish needs so well that I stood in line a second time to try other offerings. My girlfriend and I were craving burgers so we didn't fill up and as it turns out we should have. Because the burgers were lame (see the Bistro Burger review). I'm really digging the food truck craze that is sweeping the Bay Area (and the country). Chairman Bao truck is a winner.

Chairman Bao Bun Truck has some awesome Bao. They arent the bao your thinking of when you think of Chinese Baos. Its not like your typical BBQ Pork Bun. I ran into this truck at the Civic Center when they showed the Giants game clincher there. (AND THEY WON THE WORLD SERIES!) Anyways, I had the Spicy Pork and the Garlic Chicken bun (I think thats the name) on a steamed bun. Total came out to be $6.50. Pretty dang expensive. But it was GOOD and my mom loved it. Wasnt really filling but it was REALLY GOOD. Minus 1 star for the high prices! =(

I've heard so much about Chairman Bao and how their Baked Pork Belly Bun is to die for. ?Well, I finally got to try it for myself today. ?I went to Off the Grid Upper Haight with my coworker today and we shared two of the Chairman's Buns (the Pork Belly and the Duck Confit with Mango Salad). ?Perhaps the Chairman is trying to be a little healthier or I just got an odd one, but the pork belly bun wasn't as fatty and moist as what everyone claims. ?Even my coworker who tried it before admitted that. ?However, I did get a couple of bites where the meat was a little fattier and it was tasted sooo much better. However, I loved the Duck Confit with Mango Salad one. ?I loved the spicy sauce that came with it and the mango salad added the right about of acidity to it - yum! ?I will definitely be back to get more of these and perhaps try the pork belly one again and keep my fingers crossed for a fattier piece of meat, haha.

Argh. First saw the truck at Off the Grid, but the line was waaay too long. Glad to see them on the bill for Edgewood Eats. (Un)luckily 51st state sf was having issues (next time guys!) so I got three steamed buns - pork belly, red sesame chicken, and duck confit. Pork belly was my favorite. SO GOOD yum. Radish balanced the pork belly nicely. Meat was nice and fatty. Duck confit was pretty good, accompanying mango salad did not taste very mango-y though. Sesame chicken was my least favorite. If you can't take spicy, would not recommend this one. Chicken meat was flavorful, but not as moist as I would have liked. Would rather get 2 pork belly and maybe a duck confit for variety. Yes they take credit cards. Service is fast(ish) and friendly. Buns come in wrappers that make eating much much easier and neater. Only downside is the price. $10.25 for three buns, that don't even make you full. As tasty as the buns are, it's not worth the price. Maaybe every once in a while. Well maybe the pork belly buns more often...

This was everyones recommended truck at Off the Grid and the line was so long and we ordered both kinds of their buns....not at all that great. *Steamed buns: ?it's a smaller bun and it has a good sauce. ? *Baked buns: ?It's a much larger bun but it has a dry texture. ? Overall, not sure what the fuss was all about. ?They have a huge following which is great, but it's not worth the long line that they have. ?The line just seemed to be long because it takes a long time to make them!

Just a little FYI for the yelpers, the wait at this truck @Golden Gate is only 5 minutes right now. The baked pork bun (kind of sandwichy really) was delicious. Pork mustard cabbage awesomeness. The flavors were really well chosen to complement the meat and the bun, which was an excellent bun. Really this is one of the best food items you can find for $7.

This truck is the reason I started following food trucks. ?I love those steamy buns with pork belly, chicken, beef, whatever you wanna put on them! ?It is all sooo good! ?The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is the price. ?I think it's a little high for a food truck. ?Otherwise, any time I see this truck I will go straight there and order 3 or your steamed buns!

Oh those steamed pork buns! First of all, I know they smell great, and you've been standing in that long line, but TWO is all you really need. Secondly, the chicken bun is good, but do yourself a favor, if you get a chicken and a pork belly, EAT THE CHICKEN FIRST. ? The pork buns are so much better that you owe it to your mouth. Oh, and I saw that some people complain about the line, which has been about 15-deep when I get to them, What do you expect? ?They're not serving pre-made sandwiches, they're cooking delicious food. ?Be patient, it's worth the wait!

Party in your mouth! Chairman Bao's is delicious! My sister and I had the opportunity to try them while they were at SJEats. Since this truck is mainly an SF thing, we thought, why not? We ended up waiting 2 hours for the damn things...but I will say it was worth it! We both got one baked pork bun and one steamed pork bun. Both have essentially the same fillings: moist, tender pork, pickled veggies and a creamy (possibly mayo based?) sauce. It all sounds kind of whatevers...but everything together = party in my mouth. The steamed bun looks like a little taco. The "bun" is like a steamed piece of flat bread. Pretty good. I definitely enjoyed the baked bun more. It comes out looking like a giant hamburger. The bun/bread whatever it is is soo buttery and fluffy. And goes so well with the meat and veggies, absorbing all the juicy and saucy goodness. Hopefully, I'll get to try these again, just with a shorter wait! :D

I've been stalking The Chairman on Twitter for quite some time now waiting him to park somewhere near my office in the Financial District. Today was my lucky day. I trekked up California street to try these amazing buns I'd heard so much about. The choices: Steamed Bun Meal: 1 pulled pork, 1 red sesame chicken with a ginger lychee shaved ice drink for good measure. The pulled pork was good, but not amazing-oh-my-god-I-need-to-go-back. Then I tried the chicken. That sealed the deal! Perfect amount of spice and flavor. Combined with the cooling ginger and I was pretty much in heaven. In fact, it was so good, I'm considering the trek to Off The Grid tonight to have it again. Twice in one day. That should say enough.

More like a 4.5 but WHOA. THIS TRUCK IS DAAAANK (as in delicious)! So being quite acquainted with down-home Chinese food since I was little, I have some expectations for Chinese food. But these little baos of deliciousness are such a modern take on the Chinese classic steam baos! Usually a long wait, but I think it's worth it. My favorite is the pork belly with daikon! The pork belly is SO tasty and fatty and yummy and rich...perfect with the crunchy texture of the daikon! The duck confit with the slightly spicey mango sauce was good too but I can be a little wuss about spiciness (and it really wasn't all that spicey) so I think the pork belly one WINS! Next time I'll try the baked baos but apparently they're the size of the hamburger and whenever I eat these baos, I usually eat other stuff too. It's something you hafta try, whether you wanna or not!

Went here today for lunch because they had a special at Bishop Ranch in San Ramon....I was soo excited to try them I made my dad come with us so that I could have more variety :) We got all steamed baos; pork belly, chicken and 2 ducks. My co-workers got chicken and pulled pork. And OMG sooo good....the chicken and pulled pork are some what spicy, but soo tasty they said! Chicken had like kim-chee pickled veggies, the duck had a mango sauce and the pulled pork had pickled daikon. ALL were delcious, the only problem was that my dad was still hungry after we shared 4 of them. Haha, but he's a big eater. I wish there was a place like this around San Ramon, cuz' i would go there often! Ooh yea, each bao is around $3 each, so pretty reasonable. Plus we got a discount cuz we work in bishop ranch. Chairman Bao, come to San Ramon more often...but only during work week lunch hours please..haha

I had two of the steamed buns this evening.... Sliced pork belly with pickled Daikon... The pickled daikon was over powering the pork and would have been better off if it was cut julienne style rather than sliced up. Red Sesame chicken with scallions and bok choy.... Again the vegetables over powered. The scallions and bok choy gave it an odd taste, like the scallions and bok choy were over cooked. The flavors just don't jive quite right. I also had the pineapple and salted caramel shaved ice drink. Would have been better if you could taste the caramel and salt. I also don't understand why of all the food trucks at Off the Grid Fort Mason that Chairman Bao had a HUGE line...in fact the ONLY line. This was not really worth waiting almost 30 minutes for, especially considering that these guys opened up almost 20 minutes after Off the Grid officially started.

I've eaten at this truck a couple of times and really have no plans not to keep going back on a regular basis. This would be a 3.25 rating if possible Why the lower rating then? Only because some items miss the mark a bit due to just a bit too much grease and the drinks are a little too sweet for my taste. The baked buns are simply not worth the price and actually hurt the meal in my opinion. However some of the dishes, especially w/ the steamed buns are palette perfect! The combos complement each other really well. pork belly with pickled is good, but very greasy. The duck confit w/ mango is amazing! Stick with steamed buns, it's half the price and minus the serious grease intake.

This is hands down one of my favorite Food Trucks. Its fast, and tasty. Had the Pork Belly, Chicken, and Duck. The steam buns are like a soft taco and the baked buns are like a small burger.

I've been stopping by the Off The Grid Friday lunches at Civic Center the last 3 weeks and have tried food from at least 1 food truck each time and I have to say this is my favorite so far. ?As far as menu choices go, they have the least to offer yesterday. ?They have the pork belly or chicken served either on steamed or baked bun. ?I ended up ordering both the pork and chicken on baked bun, feeling somewhat foolish for paying $6 each for a bun. ?But when I got back to the office and saw how much food each order contained, I was somewhat mollified. ?One bite of the pork belly bun turned me around completely. ?Everything complemented one another: ?the perfectly shredded cabbage, the succulent pork, the magical sauce, the sturdy bun. ?I was stuffed after one bun so I had the chicken bun for dinner. ?Surprisingly, the bun did not become soggy as I have feared. ?The chicken was still delicious even after it's been sitting around for 6 hrs. ? I hope they are selected for "The Great Food Truck Race" that they are lobbying the network for. ?I know they will be tough to beat!

I had to go run some errands during lunch and as I was on the F-Trolley headed towards Van Ness I looked out and noticed the Off The Grid at UN Plaza. So after taking care of business I stopped back by and was faced with the arduous task of deciding which of the trucks I was going to try as everything looked appealing. I looked at the menu and saw two options that jumped out at me...the Steamed Pork Belly and the Braised Pork. Not wanting to have to decide between them I got both. They looked amazing when I open the little carton but when I tried them I was completely blown away! That had to be some the most amazing mixture of pork, spices, veggies and bread that I have put into my mouth. The pork was succulent (Yes, I actually used that word!) the combination of savory and sweet was just made to perfection. YES! I will return in a couple of days to make sure that it wasn't a one off. Stay tuned!

Hit up the Chairman Truck at Truck Stop on First & Mission for lunch yesterday with co-workers. ?Our group has the 7x7 100 Things to Eat for 2012 list up, and naturally, we went for the pork bell bao from the Chairman Truck. ?We had to get there at 11:30am to beat the line, and really glad that we did. ?We all tried the pork belly bao and one spicy chicken bao. ?Both of these were absolutely DELICIOUS. ?In my opinion, the pork belly was hands down the best out of the two. ?Not only was the pork cooked perfectly, there was a little bit of crisp on it that made it that much better. ?Also adding to the bao was the pickled radish. ?I'm usually not a big fan of takuan, but having it compliment the pork belly was absolutely delicious! ?The spicy chicken was also good, but was definitely second fiddle to the pork belly. ?And to be honest, the vegetables in this definitely made the bao. ?The spicy chicken was just spicy enough and the carrots in this were great. ?Overall, I don't want to get in the habit of eating these all the time, but they were certainly a delectable treat for lunch!

Fortunately for me I got to try the duck confit on the steam bun and pineapple drink. ? The duck confit is so flavorful and the mango salsa goes so well with the duck that my mouth is salivating thinking about it. ?Just delicious little bites of delectable goodness. ? Don't expect any typical about these baos (especially the price, $3 for tiny steam bun)! ?It is not what you would expect to find in a Chinese dim sum restaurant...and I love dim sum. ?The flavor combinations work so well that I have to ask why didn't anyone else think of this earlier. My suggestion is for Chairman Bao to have a physical location...but there is probably some nostalgia of a having it on a truck. ?An affordable pricing would be helpful -- maybe that's why they take credit cards. Pass on the pineapple drink, nothing really to rave about -- save your $$$ for another bao.

So I checked these guys out, and man are those buns delicous. Ive only had the steamed buns, but I tried the pork belly, pulled pork, duck and tofu. The Pork belly is king, with the duck as runner up. 4 buns is overkill, and 3 would have been enough, but I couldnt let any of them go to waste! The tofu was a little bland, but crispy. I only got it cuz I read good reviews about it, but I wouldnt order it again with such great choices as the pork belly. I plan on hitting this truck up again this week, I cant get the pork belly off my mind!

I first saw the Chairman Bao truck at the Eat Real festival in Oakland. The line was so long that I didn't get a chance to check it out but I made a mental note that I wanted to check them out. I then saw they were going to be near my work so i figured I would check them out. Once the truck got to the location they didn't open up right away so we waited and waited and waited. I think it took about 45-50 minutes for them to finally open up and start taking orders. Which knocked some points off there. I decided to have the Pork Belly Bun, Red Sesame Chicken and the Pineapple Salted Caramel drink. I must say the buns were quite tasty but the Pineapple drink just tasted like Pineapple. I didn't taste any salt or caramel. So overall it was an ok experience. I would try them again but I wasn't that impressed.

Fun fact: There never was a person called Chairman Bao. I've been to this food truck many times, both when it came to work and at Off the Grid at Fort Mason. This isn't your grandmother's bao, it's served more like a crazy little steamed burger. The fillings always seem to be changing, but all have been so delicious as to make me question democracy. For a while, they offered a combo of two buns and a delicious blended ice drink for $9. I'm not sure if they do this anymore, especially during winter. My only complaint is that the portions are small AND overpriced. This doesn't seem to be hurting their business much, but it is just high enough for me not to get in line when their truck rolls around.

Ate at this bun mobile two days in a row--first at the Willow Glen Moveable Feast (Curtner and Canoas Garden, Fridays 5-9 pm) and then the very next day I went to the Saratoga Ave. Moveable Feast (Saturdays 11-2, near Stevens Crk). I tried the pork belly in both the steamed bun and baked bun, and the coca cola braised pork in a steamed bun. The Pork belly is definitely delectable, and the neon yellow slices of pickled daikon provide a splash of color and cut some of the richness of the belly. The cola pork was just okay. I love Chinese steamed buns, but they're really best eaten right out of the bamboo steamer basket. They're like fluffy pillows when they're still warm. I'm not sure, but the texture and temperature of the Chairman's bao suggests to me the buns aren't being steamed on the truck, which is too bad or maybe that's good, cause otherwise I'd eat too many of them. The steamed bun costs $3.75 and is snack size. The baked bun is like a small sandwich and is $6.50. And this is the cutest truck and easy to spot--bright red with a panda.

So living in Dublin, it gets pretty hard to find food trucks in this area. That being said, when I heard Chairman Bao was going to be in San Ramon, I had to take the drive to see what the food truck hype is all about. After trying the red sesame chicken and pork belly steamed buns, I would say that it's pretty good. I think it's an experience to have, not sure that it's worth a two hour wait as some have said. I did also have a little sticker shock to the fact that it cost 7 bucks for two steamed buns. The quality is there, and the food is good. I was also disappointed in that they did run out of the baked buns, but then again that shouldn't be that surprising considering it is a food truck. Overall I enjoyed the food, was a little shocked by the price, and I'd give it another chance so that I can try their baked buns...

Actually 3.5 stars, but the awesome logo and truck design give this place that extra 0.5 star for these Yelp ratings. I stopped by here recently, and had the Pulled Pork on a steamed bun, the Duck Confit on a baked bun, with the Strawberry Coconut shaved ice drink. ? The Pulled Pork had too much sauce (although the pork itself was fine). ?Every bite needed some pork, otherwise the mouthful of sauce would've killed me. The Duck Confit, on the other hand, was amazing. ?Plenty of duck, not under-seasoned or overcooked, with the mango salad for a bit of a contrast (but there were only 3 slices of mango in my bun). ?It was well portioned too, comparable to the size of a small-medium sandwich. ? The Strawberry Coconut drink was good, not too sweet, but there was just too much. ?I got tired of it about 2/3 the way through, although by volume, it's worth the $3.50. ? Definitely worth checking out at least once--they do the whole "fusion" thing pretty well. ?The food is on the pricier side, but come on, it's called "Chairman Bao." ?You can't say that without a smirk.

My friends and I have gone to many food truck events and The Chairman is always our favorite. It's the 1st truck that we always stop at. Their baked pork belly bun is to die for. Sometimes my kids would crave it and I'd drive out and order 5 or 6 for our dinner. As for the price its $6.75 each. Good food is hard to come by, so you can't put a value on that.

Pork belly bun with pickled daikon = the most delicious thing I've had in a long time! ?The pork is melt-in-your-mouth, and the pickled daikon adds the right amount of acid to cut through the fat. ?I also tried the tofu with miso greens bun, which was pretty good but not anything close to the pork bun. ?The lines are super long, though, especially at Off the Grid! ?Come early or after the crowds have died down.

Chairman Bao runs a tight ship for a mobile food truck. ?I had visions of a long line, slow service and then learning that they ran out what I wanted just as I placed my order. ?The line moved quickly, a printed receipt was given at the order window and your number is called from the pick up window when the food is ready (the wait for the food and shaved ice wasn't long - 5 minutes?) ?I was still admiring Chairman Bao's red & black bun truck, wondering if they sold t-shirts and had stickers or pins, when my number was called. ?They had three people inside to take orders and payment and assemble orders. ?The truck had a few bottles of srichaca outside. ? The menu is short - 6 types of bun fillings that you can have on a baked bun ($5.75) or steamed bun ($2.75): pork belly, sesame chicken, lion's head meatball, Chinese sausage & egg, garlic tofu, duck confit. ?They also have four types of shaved ice. ?Meal deals are $9 + tax (one baked bun + shaved ice drink OR two steamed buns + shaved ice drink). * Ginger lychee shaved ice: Firm slivers of lychee jelly sit atop a mound of finely shaved ice and chewy tapioca pearls at the bottom. I enjoyed the various textures, the tartness, and the subtle ginger taste. ?I thought with all that ice, it would taste too watered down but that didn't happen. ? * Lion's head meatballs with fresh kimchee steamed bun: The steamed bun is folded over the filling, almost like a taco. ?The bun was fluffy, smooth and nice. ?The meatballs were tender and good but the napa cabbage kimchee wasn't crunchy at all (ick) and they added a salty brown sauce (hoisin?) that wasn't necessary or complementary. ?I wouldn't get it again unless they improve that soggy kimchee and remove that sauce. * Pork belly with pickled daikon steamed bun: Yummy, the same excellent steamed bun, a thick slab of luscious, moist five spice pork belly, thin, crunchy rounds of sweet yellow daikon and a bit of onion mixed in. ?The daikon was fine but not special. The buns are small but that pork belly bun is delicious and I'm also a fan of the shaved ice drinks. Cash only.

it is good! the pork bao is delicious! ?I'm glad I didn't have to line up to get it (but the folks who I had asked to line up for me waited a considerable time). ?A bit pricey ($3.75/bao, $3.25 for others) but.. WOW. ?so good. ?I suppose the high price ought to help me with portion control, but I couldn't help it and went down an hour later (not much of a line) and ordered another braised pork bao with the mustard seeds and cabbage and the spicy chicken with pickled carrots. ?MAN these BAOS are bout it bout it! =8)

The pork belly bun with pickled daikon is absolutely insane! I could have eaten 5 of those things. Only problem is, it would have cost me $19.75 to do so. These things are not big, and downing 4-5 would not seem gluttonous to me, but therein lies the problem, the price. I would easily rate this five stars if I could only afford to fill up on them.

Leave all your experiences of having bao at the curb. It's not like the traditional bao that you may have had growing up. It's not better but it's different. There are vague similarities to the ones I ate when I was a kid. The pickled radish with pork belly but they do it with a twist and I have to say I am definitely a fan. The pork shoulder with the mustard at first was not too tasting but as much as I didn't like the bitterness...there was something that made me what to take another bite. It's not because I was taught to not waste food but something about the mustard and the pork intrigued my taste buds to take a second chew. The pork belly was definitely yummy and the pickled daikon was a nice complement to the fattiness to the belly. The steamed bun has that hint of sweetness that gave you that nice ending as you swallow. I can see why there is always a line for this truck.

Even so close to bed time, I didn't stop me from eating 4 of their buns! Yes, I tried all of them and they we're all super delicious!! Braised pork with mustard seed: pretty good. The least flavorful out of all of them but at least the meat wasn't chewy! Garlic Tofu w/ Greens: As a meat person, this vegetarian option surprised me! I think partly why the tofu was so good was because it was fried but also with its flavors and the sesame oil bok choy, it was the perfect combination of crisp. Red Sesame Chicken: Wow, that was such a kick of flavor! Chicken was good and really spicy! But it wasn't overwhelming... just the right amount of flavor balanced with some leafy greens. Pork Belly with Pickled Daikon: the best one yet! Nice and tender and full of flavor with the slightest hint of spice. It was simply perfect. Even with all the juice, the bun still didn't get soggy! To top it off, the cutest Asian girl took my order! Will definitely have to check this truck out again.

Not just your average cult of personality, this Chairman is quite literally a revolution in steamed bun addictiveness. If you had to get just one, go with the pork belly.

I've always lusted after chairman bao's buns - they've looked so amazing when others got them! Today I tried the "new" flavor, red sesame chicken. It was just ok - it was supposed to be spicy but wasn't. The little chunks of chicken were good but not very flavorful, although I liked the pickled carrots on top.

Growing up and being native to San Francisco, we are fortunate enough to experience so many types of foods and my grandfather has been buying me steamed pork buns since I was in elementary school...anyway, I watch food network and I had heard of the food trucks in Civic Center and being that I worked near there I decided to walk over for lunch one day...GLAD I DID! I noticed the line for the Chairman Truck was longest so that is the way I decided where to go (follow the masses) and I was pleasantly surprised! ?I ordered the braised pork and the shredded chicken in the steamed buns and they were fantastic! ?I must say I liked the pork much better and I have been a fan ever since...I follow them on twitter and I have voted for them a few times as best food truck on http://foodnetwork.com!

Chairman Bao is possibly my favorite food truck. They're pork buns make me want to do backflips. For just a few bucks, they serve you a slice of the most tender, perfectly cooked pork belly in a bun, topped off with pickled daikon. It literally does not get any better than that. Once you add to that an amazingly friendly staff and a great truck design, you have a home run. Try this truck if it is the only food truck you ever sample. It will leave you craving more.

Worth. the. wait. I knew I would love the Chairman once I laid eyes on his panda face (Wow, sounds like the start to a bad romance novel). Anyway, I finallyyy came across the Chairman at Off the Grid in Upper Haight. Luckily we beat the crowd and I tried both the steamed buns with pork belly and braised pork. I'll be the first to admit that there is a lot of hype surrounding food trucks as a whole, but the first bite into the pork belly bun left a stupid, greasy smile on my face. It was melt-in-your-mouth tender and tasty. It matched perfectly with the fresh, fluffy bun and the crisp coleslaw/daikon. I didn't expect much as much for the braised pork, but it was equally as juicy and well-marinated. Pork is easily overcooked, but apparently the Chairman can avoid that. I was also very impressed that while both buns were similar in content, they were both very flavorful and different in their own way. You know that everything isn't just slathered on with the same sauce and thrown on the bun, but there is actual thought to the menu. Awesome. The biggest downfall is that they are pricey for what they are. $3.75 for the steamed bun (essentially the kind that looks like a taco that goes with peking duck) and $6.00 for the baked bun (resembles a giant cha siu bao, I presume). But believe the hype and try it.

Cute concept. I've been wanting to try this for awhile. There's really nothing at all remotely Chinese about the food. Everything was too salty. There was way too much sauce and it looked like a mayonnaise base. Chinese don't do mayonnaise (with the exception of Honey Walnut Prawns.) I had the duck with mango and the crispy tofu. The mango topping was good. I wished the duck had more five spice. There may have been a little but it was barely detectable. I am glad to have tried it but it was a novelty I wouldn't bother to do again.

I haven't had Chairman Bao in awhile but my nephew loves them and had a craving for their bao. ?After todays experience, we can safely say he hates them now. ?Why? They've raised their prices and rid themselves of the combo meals. Nearly $4 for steam bao now?! ?$7 for a baked bao?! ?Outrageous. They no longer make my favourite and the good tea drinks are gone. The small containers for hot sauce doesn't even have the correct size lid, you'd think that they should have noticed that when they bought it but nope. They have a special soup for the holidays and it is terrible. ?It's a spicy butternut miso soup. ?If you have an honest hate and rage towards someone, give them the soup. ?It's a sure way to let them know how much you hate them with this disgusting goop they call a soup. ?The smell of it still haunts me.

Went to Off the grid the other day and was able to give the bao truck a second try. I was excited to try the pork belly bao since it has been the talk of the town for quite some time now. Let me just say this... it is freaking DELICIOUS.. yes the meat is fat but helloooo it's pork belly.. it's suppose to be fatty. Yum the daikon and onions went extremely well with it too. It is overpriced but it's a food truck what do you expect?

Wow! ?This funky truck churns out some fabulous chinese street food, and I happened to stroll by. ?The wait was quite long, as this was only their fourth day of operation and they are still working out the undoubtedly dubious details of managing four busy servers in a small truck. ?However, my pork belly sandwich (I guess it's called Gua Bao) and sesame chicken dim-sum "taco", were delicious! ?The pork featured very complex and subtle flavors and generous garnish of pickled daikon. ?The Sesame Chicken was equally flavorful and had a fried green onion garnish. ?The buns, both baked and steamed, were exquisitely fresh and tasty. ?Expect a long line and a long wait (at least until they streamline their operations) I only wish they could park downtown by my office! ?=:(

We had the Chairman Bao truck at work for dinner this week, and it was pretty tasty. I ordered 2-each of the meat baos, so 6 in total. Work paid for them, but I would probably be appalled if I had to shell out the $20+ for those. The fried pork belly is the best one, and from what other people were saying, I should have gotten the tofu one as well. There's always next time.

Their pork belly steamed bun with daikon is really good, not filling at all. But for $3 in downtown SF, you don't expect it to be. I have to say I've had better crispy garlic tofu and will probably never get that again. I do plan on trying their braised pork in a baked bun which I have heard is delicious. And I can only hope that they will offer their duck confit in downtown SF in the food truck alley. Who knows, maybe that'll bump them up a star!

Well, what else is there to say that hasn't already been said? Chairman Bao's buns are the real deal. Go for the steamed tender pork belly with pickled daikon. You will not be disappointed. The pork belly is bold and flavorful, yet super tender. It is topped with the perfect amount of pickled daikon, which provides contrast in taste and texture and sandwiched between a warm pillowy steamed bun. It rivals the pork belly bun from Momofuku Milk Bar and is more tender than the one from Ippudo, both in New York City.

tofu bun and pork belly bun.....oh how u always satisfy me! just damn good! The best thing bout Chairman Bao is that they really listen to their customers. I joined Twitter just to follow the food trucks and some celebs. I never tweet, but one day I was bored and I saw Chairman Bao tweet that they tried to go to Daly City, but something happened and they couldn't make it. So just for fun I told them you should come to Sales Force/Capcom in San Mateo because a few other food trucks go there too. They actually tweeted me back to say they were interested. (I thought it was all talk) After some tweets and trying to find some info for them of how to go to Capcom, just 2 weeks later they showed up by my work!!! HOW AWESOME!!! U GUYS ROCK! COME BACK AGAIN!!!

I was skeptical about this truck... all the hype and hoo-ra about it... until I tried the buns! ?It seems like it would be ultra oily and fatty like most people have been saying about pork belly, however, I did not find this to be true. ?IN fact, I find this less fatty/oily than a regular hamburger or a bbq pork bun from dim sum place. The meat they use in the buns is actually quite lean and good quality pork/chicken. ?I had the pleasure of trying the pork belly, cocacola braised pork and spicy chicken. ?I have to say the spicy chicken was actually my favorite one! ?I loved all the sauces and pickles they added to the bun, made all the flavors mash together well. ?The tofu (though onlyhad a small taste was good as well but not crunchy enough for me. ?Three small steamed buns is enough for lunch.. the baked a little large to me and also more expensive.. not really worth the almost $6 per bun in my opinion.

Pork Belly Bao with pickeled daikon: 4 stars. Their most popular bun but I wasn't much of a fan. But then I'm not a fan of pork belly in general. The meat is really fatty and it tastes like I'm eating a stick of butter. Spicy Chicken Bun: 5 stars. I LOVE LOVE LOVE. Probably one of the best spicy chicken's I've had yet. Perfect combination with the pickeled veggies. Miso-cured tofu with chinese greens: 4 stars. Tofu is very meaty and flavorful. Good but nothing special. Buns are soft and fluffy, better than some of the chinese restaurants I've been to. Overall, really good food and good price too.

While the steamed bun is not such a good value for $3.75, the baked bun at $6.75 was totally worth it, spilling over with perfectly cooked pork belly and crunchy daikon on top. ?The pork belly managed to be slightly crispy on the outside and not too fatty on the inside, just right...

I checked these guys out at off the grid. For like $3 and some change you get a steamed or baked ..taco? It's weird. Instead of the bun being stuffed and solidified, its sort of pre-steamed and wrapped. It's really good though. I sort of want to return just to try the baked variety. I had the pork belly and it's a taste of pure heaven. Now if only this truck would make it closer to work. ?They seem to be located way way down Townsend as I usually see them when I am coming into the city on the train :( Oh well maybe more Off the Grid outings for me.

Chairman Bao Pork Belly bun is amazing. ?The layers of pork and fat are balanced, juicy, fatty, and delicious. ?I love that the edges are slightly crunchy. ?It adds more texture to the bun. ?I don't care for the daikon... it actually kind of overpowers the meat. ?I've been craving for NYC Ippudo or Momofuku pork belly buns for some time. ?This did the trick. ?It's not as good as nyc pork buns but this is the best i can find in SF and i'm more than thrilled!

It pains me to give Chairman Bao one star. ?After trying the bao at Momofuku and Baohaus in New York, the SF versions are falling flat. ?First of all, the steamed buns are store bought. ?Secondly, the fillings are not flavorful. ?The pork belly was just unappetizing thin, chewy, gray slices of smoked bacon. ?The egg and sausage, lions head meatballs, duck confit were just bad. ?Especially the confit - the duck was bone dry and lacked any gamey flavor. ?The only reason I am giving the Chairman a star is because the chicken bun with spinach and kim chee was tasty.

It was aite. I mean, I didn't expect real chinese buns or anything like that, but I thought it would be more interesting and a lot more flavorful. Maybe the tastes just didn't suit me. The pork and duck which I both tried tasted the same and the stuff that came with it like lettuce with mustard seeds or the red pickled onions were alright. I doused my buns with sriracha. It's definitely fusion and far from being anything Chinese. I knew it was fusion but I thought it would be an enhancement to the Chinese dish with more flavor but keeping close to the real thing. ?All those korean bbq trucks are bomb because its based with good korean bbq just with an extra unique taste. These were totally off the wall combinations that almost tasted American just with Chinese meats. They weren't that tender either which I'd at least expect.

Chairman Bao Bun Truck - Chairman Mao would be rolling over in his grave now if he knew that capitalism has won out and the likeness of his 'name' is being used for such a purpose as a food truck. With a budget of $10.00 in mind for my Food Truck adventure, I only had $4 remaining to spend after buying a BBQ Spicy Pork Rice Plate (w/ White Rice) from Seoul on Wheels for the bargain price of $6.00. Now what can I do with $4?!?! I could donate it to charity. I could buy 4 cans of soda. I could have gotten a side of kim-chee to go with my rice plate at Seoul on Wheels. But then I saw the big panda bear and decided to take a look at the menu, and I saw the bargain price of $3.75 for a pork belly taco! Within 2 minutes, I was served with a piping hot and tender pork belly, wedged between a bun with pickled daikon on top. The daikon gives a crunch that contrasts with the tenderness of the pork belly. Did I mention how tender the pork belly meat was? On the other hand, the bun was so small. It was probably half the size of a BBQ Pork bun you'd get at a Chinese dim sum place. Yes, yes I know, this is NOT a dim sum spot and we are NOT in Chinatown, but with a truck that clearly reminds you of China (red colors, a panda, a name resembling Mao Zedong) we cannot help but think we'd get some "Chinese" out of this joint i.e. cheap prices and big portions. Was it good? You betcha. Was it expensive? Although on a Yelping price range you would give it a single dollar sign ($), if I was to have a full lunch out of Chairman Bao's menu selection, I would probably be dropping at least $15. Mind you this is a food truck! But based on the quality ingredients and the taste/flavor, it is definitely worth a try. It was a great "snack" while I was waiting for my BBQ Rice Plate from the other truck. (I am going to stop plugging for that aforementioned food truck, if you want to learn more, type them into the yelp search box above). In any event, based on the quick and friendly service (+1 star), delicious food (+1 star), use of a panda as your logo (+1 star), and most importantly the funky ass name of "Chairman Bao" (+2 stars!!!), I would have given you a 5-star rating. But alas the small portion for my bun for the slightly premium price makes me have to deduct one star (-1 star). Therefore if my math is correct, that gives Chairman Bao a 4-star rating and I am pretty sure I will be back for more of that delicious pork belly.

I feel bad for giving CMB three stars, but it was just okay for me. I think people hype this up to be too much. First off, I thought it'd be an actually bao, like the regular pork buns you get at dim sum places. They instead use the buns you wrap duck with at fancy Chinese banquets. The pork belly was good ... I'm just not sure if it'd be my first food truck choice.

Thank you thank you thank you Chairman Bao for delighting my taste buds with my first ever steamed bun. Came by for OTG: Upper Haight and knew I had to get my hands on one of the crispy garlic tofu buns. This sucker was huge! It could have put some tacos to shame with the magnitude of the tofu filling. The bun itself was small and dainty but the crispy garlic-infused tofu cutlet was the size of a cell phone! It came loaded on top with fresh (collard?)greens that had been tossed in a miso dressing. The best part was the greens included the leaves AND the stems. It was messy to eat and I probably looked totally awesome wiping miso off my face after stuffing it with tofu, but it was so worth it. My only criticism is that there is only 1 veg bun, however when its that good I might be able to overlook the lack of options.

I've only ever had the crispy garlic tofu with miso greens bun, but if the rest of Chairman Bao's buns are that good, I think I could live on these buns for the rest of my life and die happy. I've had the tofu bun both in the baked and steamed form, and I can't decide which one I like better - the recommendation from the folks at the truck is to get at least 3 steamed for a meal and 1 baked bun is considered equivalent to 2 or 3 steamed buns. I had one baked and one steamed and was very satisfied with the quantity. Does it get pricey? A little depending on how much food you want, but it's completely worth it. This is some of the best food I've had, and it would take a lot for me to skip out on this truck.

Chairman Bao I had seen at a couple stops and frankly I had no desire to taste it since I get pork buns usually for like a buck or two. What could be the difference?

I heard about this place from some co-workers and so during lunch one day I walked over to check it out. I was definitely unimpressed. The steamed buns are tiny and over priced.

tried chairman bao at off the grid. i was initially intimidated by the line but rest assured, it moves quickly. each bun here will set you back $3-$6, which i think is kind of ridiculous since it is just a bun with meat. but i figured, when the hell am i at off the grid? and there must be something to it, otherwise there wouldn't be a line. we ordered three buns: pork belly, duck confit and sesame chicken, all of them steamed (why is baked twice the price, btw?). my favorite was the pork belly because it was so tender and had a nice melt in your mouth quality. it was also really well seasoned and marinated which gave it great flavor. the other two guys were somewhat forgettable for me. the duck was by far most disappointing, especially having been raised eating at traditional chinese restaurants with the real deal. having said all this, i do think chairman bao was the best truck at otg. they are worth the wait but only once. i can't say i'll get them again, despite the pork belly being so damn tasty. they're just too pricy and small.

Had the Duck and Pork belly buns. Both were just ok for me. The duck was a little to spicy for my. It was just ok . The pork had a nice buttery and crunch to it. I enjoyed it very much. The price is the killer here though. They should serve 2 for the price they sell it for. Still a nice flavor and product they are send out.

I tried their baos during the Sacramento Mobile Food festival and the line was over 2 hours long (by far the longest food truck line @ the festival). The baos are so unique-I had the pork belly and the sesame chicken. One of them had pickled radishes on it and I must say, they were very delectable.

Who knew you could get such amazing deliciousness from a food truck. ?I get alerts when they are in my neighborhood and try to get there before the crowds. ?They park in out of the way spots so dont count on just running into them. ? My favorite (currently) is the spicy chicken that is a little like a soft taco filled with chicken and spicy Asian sesame flavors and (I think ) sweet daikon.

Had the pork belly. Not a big fan of the over stuffed "taco" shape. Really good flavor unctuous pork belly, and flavorful pickled veges overpowered the very ordinary bun that was steamed slightly too long. Would go again to try the baked options, all sold out when I got there.

Chairman Bao-wow wow. There was barely a line for the truck when it parked near the http://Walmart.com building where I happened to be at for a clinic. I've always been curious since the lines for it at Off the Grid were like that of a Vegas club. People would be standing out there long before their windows would open. You know it was getting serious once they put up their "velvet ropes" of caution tape around it. The steamed pork belly bun was awfully tasty. Yes, pork belly is the epitome of fatty goodness that you can get out of a pig, and it's pretty greasy. Food coma is highly expected, especially if you order more than one for yourself. I'm a bit hesitant to have another stab at the Bao unless I happen to see them again around South City.

3 1/2 stars folks first appearance here at Genentech tag team with Seoul on Wheels. the food that Chairman provided I have to say I would go back for the pork belly steamed bun.. price is not not to bad for steamed buns are $3.75 baked $6.75 tried two of the buns they offered the duck confit with mango slices sorry folks I don't know if it is the one I got in general but it was super salty the mango slices could not cure the extent of saltiness provided on this steamed bun. straight beer face, the kind of face you get when your drinking a pale ale haha the pork belly with pickled cucumbers and fresh cut onions was delish got this one steamed also, the portion is small but the taste was all there, being filipino didnt mind adding some mang tomas(sauce based for lechon (roasted pig)) on the pork belly to give it a homey feel the price again lil high but it is a truck so what you get is what you pay for again definitely will hit this truck up again for there pork belly steamed bun food *** 1/2 ?4 stars for the porkbelly steamed 2 for the duck confit super salty price $$ tad pricey but so are most specialty type taco trucks service ***** quick, friendly ambiance **** they set out some tables for standing dining but for the most part depending on weather good quick eat.

Spicy, a little sour and some sweetness and overall, makes the sandwich delicious. ?The buns come in steam or baked. ?I prefer the steam but the bake is not bad. ?Base on this one dish, it is awesome! ?That's it for now until I try other dishes from Chairman.

Good things come to those who wait. ?I had been to Off the Grid - Fort Mason about a month ago and the wait for Chairman Bao was 1 hr :20min. ?Needless to say, we didn't wait. ?However, when I heard that they were coming to Off the Grid - Civic Center, I was determined to to try it this time around. ?I had heard positive reviews about the duck bao, but unfortunately they didn't offer it on their 1st appearance at civic center, so I opted for the steamed pork belly. ?Scrumptious!

I ordered the pork belly pickled daikon baked bun. POPPIN! for 7 bucks i was expected a lot smaller sandwich but it was huge!! i know people are huge fans of taking pictures of their food before eating it, but i wasted no time and dug right in. the daikons were definitely necessary and the sandwich lasted me just long enough before i was at the front of another line

Tried the braised pork and red sesame chicken steamed buns at a corporate event. ?The pork was tender and juicy and the sweet sauce complimented it well. ?The chicken was a bit dry and I didn't care for the marinade, which was spicy and overpowering.

My mom and I shared a baked braised pork bun and a steamed pork belly bun. ?Honestly, for the price of a baked bun, I'd be better off getting six regular baked BBQ pork buns from Clement Restaurant (http://www.yelp.com/biz/¡­). ?But, the pork belly bun with the pickled daikon was pretty tasty, and if I were in the mood for shelling out $4 for a taco-sized steamed bun again, that would be the one.

i think my expectations were much too high before experiencing this bao. waited in an amazingly long line. got the steamed braised pork belly. paid over 3 dollars. stared at the little bun. and ate it in a few bites. the meat was slightly dry and flavors didn't mix together too well. the sauce overpowered everything and there was too much shredded lettuce. maybe the baked buns are more worth it? but at $7 i feel like i can get a lot more food for that amount. overall not wowed. boo i wanted to like the asiany truck

We tried a bunch of things at the Chairman Bao truck at Edgewood Eats in Palo Alto last week. ?I didn't see the duck bun on the menu. Otherwise we tried almost all of the other bao offerings. -pork belly on steamed bun- good, melts in your mouth, great with the radish garnish -pulled pork with cabbage on steamed bun was really good. The meat was flavorful even without the veg. ?My son doesn't like veg so I ordered one without but the meat itself was still quite tasty. -red sesame chicken on baked bun- a bit spicy for my taste but the meat was flavorful -crispy garlic tofu on steamed bun- I actually Really enjoyed this one. the tofu had a really nice garlic flavor and I liked the firm, chewy texture of the tofu inside the bun. The greens added a nice crispy contrast. Overall, I was happy with everything we had. Go again? Definitely would go again. I prefer the steamed buns so would probably just order all steamed next time.

ever since coming to SF, been trying to get a taste of you guys, but the lines were crazy. ?what I have come to learn about the bay area, is that there are lines everywhere, but not because the food is necessarily the best but because food options are spread out!! suffice to say, NYC has so many better bao places, but I must be fair and rate SF against SF standards. ? pork belly was good, nice big pieces.....not much trimmings on these baos.....either simple daikon or kale. ? the steam bun however is not good, they were not fluffy like little pillows as they should be. with that said, it's a passable bao for a street truck, I won't be hunting them down anymore though.

The steamed buns remind me of Peking duck style buns from Chinese banquet dinners - buns with meat with some veggie dressings and sauce. ?Maybe I've been spoiled by having Peking duck for as long as I can remember (Imagine: little Chinese boy with a big smile eating buns with both hands and getting sauce all over his face and clothes), but Chairman Bao's buns just aren't that special. ?And at $3+ a pop, they're comparable (if not higher) in price to the Peking duck at Chinese banquet dinners. ?The baked buns with fillings can be had for much cheaper at Chinese bakeries scattered throughout S.F. ?Just gotta know where to find them.

Chairman Bao is one of the main trucks I look forward to whenever I attend Off the Grid. The only downfall is how long the line always is, but believe me, it is worth the wait! I would recommend going with a few friends. One person can fall in this line, while everyone else gets food from different vendors, then they can all fall back in the bun line and eat while waiting. I can't get enough of the pork belly buns. They're so good! Soft, fluffy bun with a perfectly marinated hunk of fatty pork and tangy daikon radish = perfection :)

I dunno -- aside from the trendy-cool factor, which is already starting to wear thin, they're good but not worth a special trip, which involves checking Twitter or Facebook to see where they happened to be parked that day, and then (if going by car) trying to find anywhere to park nearby. ?Aside from that, three main things to bear in mind, I think: ?1) they're sorta expensive; 2) if they happen to be nearby and not the subject of a special trip, definitely worth trying; and 3) they are nothing like authentic bao -- more like a foodie's conceit. ?But that's ok, I like Taco Bell tacos.

I'm a bao lover. ?I've been loving them since I had my first one in Asia 10 years ago. ?I've been dying to go to this truck ever since I'd heard of it. ?I love street food, and I especially LOVE food from trucks (I am from NJ!) ? I was kinda disappointed. ?These bao were ok, but way overpriced for what you get. ?How can something the size of a street taco, with much less meat be $3? ?I didn't notice if it was organic or something, but maybe that's why. ?Maybe they were having an off day? ?I had the pork belly, and all it had was a chintzy thin piece of pork belly overwhelmed by the puffy bun. ?I felt deeply unsatisfied. ?It should have been a thick, unguent, succulent piece of pork belly. ?If you want to try what I am thinking of, go to one of the Momofukus in NYC and try theirs. ?That's what I'm talking about. I guess I'll give it one more try, but I think I'll also stalk the various Chinatowns in the region to see what they have to offer. ?Thanks, Chairman Bao, for making me crave bao, and not delivering!

Since my first trek to the Chairman Bao truck, I came back to bring some friends from Sacto to try it. Since in all fairness, I think the concept of a 'gourmet bao truck' is pretty unique. My buddies LOVED their duck bao (the only I think is worthy of tasting). I still think I can get much better baos at a dim sum house but I can respect what their trying to do especially since they're driving all the way out to Sacramento to help promote cart food out here! So I upgraded their stars because of this.

I was lucky enough to catch them while they were by my work in San Mateo. ?I was a first timer, so I tried the pork belly w/ pickled daikon (steamed). ?SOOO YUMMY! ?Good thing I ordered 2 =) ?Can't wait till they're in San Mateo again! ?Maybe I'll get 4 next time!

I ?always wanted to try the Chairman truck and one day after coming home I went on one of my many social networks (twitter, duh) and they had tweeted that they were right in front of Crunch on Polk which is RIGHT by my house. I was thinking about going to exercise that day but decided that I'd rather eat, so I walked to the truck. Compared to when they're at Off The Grid they had absolutely no line, which is a plus and the head chef was even outside talking to people who had questions. I ordered the tender pork belly bun with daikon (regular not baked) and walked back home. It was FANTASTIC, it was so good that when my BF got home I took him BACK and he got the baked duck bun and the chicken. I got another bun (this time a baked duck bun) and a lychee/green tea slush and that was tasty as well. The drink is something I would recommend for those of you who don't like to drink things that are too sweet, ?and are healthy. I now eat this at Off The Grid when I get the chance (when I have time to stand in line or I get their early ). As far as service, my first experience was great and when I have to go to Off The Grid or popular locations, I know that we have to wait since everyone loves this place and that's just the reality of a successful food truck- CUSTOMERS.

Tried this today at off the grid because it had a long line. It's okay. I got the duck with mango. The flavors went really well together but the duck was a bit too salty for my liking. I liked the spicy-ness and the mango together as well. Also tried the mango match green tea drink. Very interesting combination, wasn't my cup of tea though.

I had Chairman Bao at the Eat Real Festival in Oakland a while back. I think the prices have gone up and it feels like the food has shrunk. Steamed buns used to be $2.95, now they are between $3.50 and $3.75. Baked buns are about half the price. I spent $11.25 to get 3 steamed buns with pork belly. They were tiny. The buns (mantou) were not plump looking. I wondered whether they were freshly made. Sure, they were good. But if you have to spend $11.25 to get 3 buns to get full, not including any drink or side, I think there are cheaper and tastier things to eat out there.

strolled on by in emeryville about 10 mins before the truck was to close down and they kindly took my order even though you know most places are rushing you off by this time. honestly i ended up here because ms. wally's cafe had a sign on their door last week that left customers out due to a family emergency/car accident. ?i remembered that chairman bao does it's mondays in eville so i quickly yelped and twittered and saw that they were in fact stationed in eville about 7 blocks away. ?i then set my sights on these mysterious baos that my friend has been telling me about. i wanted to sample the pork belly and duck confit but they ran out of the pork belly so i had the duck confit on a steamed bun, also because they ran out of the baked buns [understandable since i showed up way past opening]. ?i also ordered a pineapple slush. ?the total for 2 duck confit buns and the pineapple slush were about $9 + $1 tip. ?not too shabby for a quick lunch. the baos are slider size so for a big eater, you may need 4-5 in order for your stomach to agree that it's happy. ?i really liked the sauce that they drizzled all over the bao and i know this because it got all over my dress while i was scarfing these buns down in my car [i couldn't wait to get back to my office]. ?the pineapple slush was definitely refreshing and tasty although i'm not sure if it'll be something i'll order regularly. the woman i took the order from was also very helpful and kind. ?once i try some of the other baos, i'll be back for an updated review. ps - you can't miss the chairman bao truck - it's like a big red short bus :]

Short and to the point: I tried the pork belly with pickled daikon in a steamed bun. I was concerned that when I bit into the bun, the pork would all come out in one piece. I was mistaken. It was so tender that I had no issue achieving a clean bite. Add to that the freshness of the pickled daikon, made for a really good experience at Chairman Bao. It's not a surprise that this truck always has long lines wherever its parked.

At first I was really excited to try Chairman Bao, the presentation was nice but the taste did not meet my expectations. I really wish I could like this place better but I felt it was a little overpriced AND the buns are store bought. I tried the pork belly and duck confit. I personally liked the pork belly better because the duck had this weird mayo sauce, I think it would have been MUCH better with Hoisin sauce. The only really terrific thing they had was GINGER LYCHEE SHAVED ICE!! DELICIOUS and highly recommended!!!

Again was dragged out here by co-workers. The line was short when we got there because we got there 5 minutes after 11am. I didn't know what to get so I went with the safe choices sesame chicken and lion heads meatball with kim chee. I got the steamed bun and it's nothing exciting or special for me. I spent $5 for 2 buns which is more like a snack. I'm glad I brought my lunch. The buns are small and the filling is not very much either. For the price you pay and what you actually get - I'd rather get something else. But it's good just to try it once and have the experience of waiting in a long line in the cold and getting an expensive snack.

I just had these buns for lunch today and they were mad good. I got the tender pork belly with daikon, red sesame chicken with scallion and bok choy, and the chinese spiced duck confit with fresh mango scallion. Three buns filled me up and it came in one tiny box! I have to say that this does serve a tasty meal when you have nothing else better around you in Brisbane. I also can't tell which bun is the best. I suggest you try them all out and see which one you like. I think the Pork Belly with daikon was pretty spicy!

i've noticed this truck for the past week or so but didn't realize it was open for business until i happened to be walking down 7th street today and saw the large crowd of people. ordered the two steamed buns & drink combo ($9). there is only one veggie option, fried tofu with miso greens, but it was quite tasty. however, my beverage, a ginger lychee shave ice boba, was way too sweet and not gingery enough. it also took over 20 minutes between waiting in line to order and then for the food to come out which seems like a long time for a food truck. i would definitely come back to have the tofu bao again but would try another drink and stop by before the lunch rush begins. it would also be great if they added another veggie option to their menu.

After following on Twitter and Recommendations from my Fellow SF peeps in the Financial District, I decided to try it out. Pork Belly Steamed is killer...loved it and wish I ordered more than one. Along with my first meal, I ordered the Chicken Baked Bun and liked it, but not as much as the steamed bun. Lunch was gone in about 30 seconds (gave half of my baked bun to my coworker). Delicious food for a truck and will try something new next time around. Portions are small for Steamed and massive for Baked...price should have warned me. Anyhow, great place, good food so far.

Yes, these are not your traditional bao. I know that a "baked" bao is a contradiction. However, I prefer their pork belly or sesame chikcen baked bao over any examples of the traditional style ?- and I've eaten many a bao/manapua in my time. I'd always thought something more could be done with them and along came Chairman Bao (I know, they are not the first.) to deliciously reinterpret the bao. The pork belly was succulent; the sesame chicken was a savory bundle of joy; and the condiments were ?yummy complements to the main ingredient of each sandwich. The $6 price for a good-sized hot sandwich-style lunch was not too high. I'm ashamed to say that I get cranky when they skip a week in my neighborhood.

Tried Bao's at Off the Grid at Fort Mason last night. I ordered the Garlic Tofu baked bun and my friend ordered the Sesame Chicken, Scallion, and Bok Choy baked bun. I opened my box and was very disappointed to see mayo on my tofu. I'm allergic to mayo (and it wasn't listed on the menu), so I was bummed, but my friend was sweet and traded his chicken for my tofu. He really enjoyed it! The chicken was very good also, although it was a tad spicy. I liked the crunchiness of the bok choy.

Thanks to Chairman Bao Bun Truck for supporting Sunday Streets volunteers - and thus giving me access to their little bundles of pillowy, juicy, sweet and salty heaven. The staff people were really friendly, and the food was ready really fast - within a minute or two of ordering. I had two steamed buns - "crispy garlic tofu" ?and "tender pork belly with pickled daikon." I didn't have to pay for them and wasn't even thinking about what they should cost - but they were really, really good. Instead of the buns (bao) you'd get at dim sum, that have the filling cooked into the middle, these buns are folded over the fillings, like a puffy white taco or a sandwich. I assume this is what makes it possible to have them be both freshly cooked and fast. So, maybe not the traditional presentation, but the ingredients seemed similar (higher quality meat than most of what I've had in restaurant or store-bought buns), and the texture of the bun seemed identical to the traditional ones. The buns themselves were perfect - tender and pillowy, a little bit sweet, and the right size to hold the filling. I was pretty hungry, so I was eating fast and taking big bites - I think it took me 6-8 bites to finish each one, plus the scooping up of fallen ingredients, and the satisfied licking of fingers. The crispy garlic tofu was as advertised - crispy (but not swimming in oil), with plenty of sauteed greens (bok choy maybe?) and a very tasty, garlicky sauce that was the consistency of creamy salad dressing. I could taste the greens and the tofu and the bun, so the sauce wasn't overpowering; the overall combination was a nice blend of flavors and textures. Not particularly spicy, and the garlic flavor is not strong until you're done eating. The tender pork belly with pickled daikon was also good, though a bit more prone to falling out of the bun as one eats (perhaps I was chowing down too fast, though). The pork belly was tasty and went really well with the pickled daikon; together they were more sweet than salty/savory, and yes, tender and juicy.

YUM! Caught them at the "off the grid" civic center and had the pork belly/daikon baked bun. Such an awesome combo of flavours! sampled a bite of the S.O.'s chicken-- too spicy for my taste but still delish. We shared the tofu--not as good as the other two, but still worth while!

Definitely the least friendly food truck in Emeryville. Was really hungry so I showed up a bit early. The place was sealed up like a drum. Even when they got out of the truck, and I was standing right there, they wouldn't speak to me even or answer any questions. Then when they finally opened (almost fifteen minutes later than they were scheduled) they were all "Hi, so glad to see you". Nothing like fake sincerity to make you want to frequent local businesses. Fortunately the food is good or I would stop going altogether, but I will certainly be cutting back.

i was surprised at the price--$5.75 for baked then i saw $2.95 steamed, and tried 2 which made for a decent appetizer. ?still quite expensive when you can get a tasty cha siu bao for much cheaper *tender pork belly with pickled daikon -- excellent, esp. for a mobile truck thus the high rating. ?moist bun, 2 large succulent pork belly strips complemented with daikon chunks verdict: tasty. ?closest thing to momofuku chinese sausage with egg sandwich was too salty, hoisin a little overpowering chinese spiced duck with fresh mango worked well red sesame chicken with scallion was heavy red chili based i think they should be one of the more successful trucks up here, though baked bun price may be pushing it... ate here again, this time pork belly bun with yellow daikon slices -- still good this time also tried Crispy Garlic Tofu with miso greens: not worth the price but ingredients fresh they had a new item, Pulled Pork with Savoy Cabbage and Pickled Mustard Seeds (chopped up cabbage) -- tasted good. this is my favorite bay area truck prices have goneup -- steamed pork bun now 3.75 but still with the nice crisper edges and kakuni like stewed flavor.

before trying their steamed bun with duck and mango i couldn't understand the hype. long lines for something similar to peking duck? now i LOVE me some peking duck, so i figured a truck couldn't beat the real deal. but boy was i wrong. the succulent smoky duck amidst a soft airy bun with a hint of refreshing mango is why you will now see me waiting in line for more and increasing the hype. plus...there's a giant panda on the truck. i'm all about chasing the panda!

I really liked the food here. There is just one catch. After eating here, I got hives all over my stomach and back and it lasted for 2 weeks. I am allergic to MSG, so we asked the next time we saw the truck if they used MSG. They said no, it is just in the sauce (so, um, that's a "yes"). There you go.

I'm right in the middle for CBBT. ?I was pretty excited to see them at OTG: ?Upper Haight last Thursday after having missed them right outside my office at lunch time. ?And so I didn't mind having to wait in line for the 15 or so minutes for the 2 buns I ordered. ?But just like how some of their reviews are great and some are not, that's exactly what I experienced. ?First off, I got a pork belly bun cuz my coworker said it was DEE-LICIOUS...and you know, it was pretty good. ?It had lots of flavor and the toppings complimented each other. ?The second bun I got was their St. Paddy's Day special made with pork shoulder. ?I gotta say, I wasn't impressed. ?In fact, I had buyer's remorse. ?Haha. ?Unlike the pork belly, the pork shoulder was dry and bland and was a poor comparison to the other I just had. ? ?So yeah, take what you will from this review. ?There's obviously other items on their menu, but in a situation like Off The Grid where there's a lot of people and several other choices and trucks to eat from, I doubt I'd line up again just for the one bao and I'd be wary of trying anything else unless I read a really good review about it.

After hearing so many good things about this food cart and seeing all the scrumptious pictures of their peking duck-like buns on steriods, i decided enough was enough...i was going to check this place out for myself! After ordering the pork belly and sesame chicken steamed buns from the girl in the truck, i stood aside with all the other hungry patrons and patiently waited for my buns. When they finally called my order number, I almost jumped for joy. Opening the paper tray, I knew I was in for a treat! The aroma of the fatty pork belly along with the spices of the chicken was so mind numbingly good that I wanted drop my bags and sit on the sidewalk with everyone else and wolf them down. Of course my bf wanted to wait till we got home first so I reluctantly agreed(he drove). 30 mins later and 10x hungrier I finally got to take my first bite, and I swear I heard my taste buds sing, or dance, or both. Not only was it absolutely delicious, but the bun held its form and texture. Translation: They were NOT soggy! So fluffy and soft, like a cloud. Not a rain cloud, but a happy one on a sunny day. I downed my buns in what seemed like mere seconds, drank some water, and know that I will look back on today and think "that was a goooood day".

Pork Belly steamed bun had me craving to stand in line again but I fought the temptation. Seeing Chairman Bao Bun truck at the Government Center got me hungry without realizing I was. Price is reasonable but be sure to get at least 2, 1 does not satisfy, even if you're only a little hungry.

although i'd seen the bao truck several times at the civic center OTG, i'd never tried them until today. ?even though the day was chilly, there were still long lines at all the trucks. ?i ordered the pork belly and red sesame chicken (or something like that) both on steamed buns - they were out of baked, but i guess from the reviews, steamed is the way to go. ?i was surprised that they were so tiny...the description said "taco size". ?these were more "bite size". ?i liked both very much, especially the pork belly one which was juicy and full of flavor but at $3.75 a pop, these little buns are quite expensive for not very much food.

i LOVE food trucks. and i love buns. i've always wondered why buns haven't taken off, and with the rise of food trucks, i wanted (fantasied about) my own buns truck. of course, someone beat me to it. food out of this truck is quite expensive. buns is something that can be eaten as a snack, part of a whole meal, or as a meal. aside from the small steamed soupy buns or buns with fancy ingredients, buns are in general supposed to be inexpensive. these buns are ~3 bucks for steamed and almost 6 bucks for baked. these are also not the whole buns steamed/baked with fillings; they're cut open with stuff put in. this seems to be the predominant style of buns in non-chinese chinese food culture right now, which really annoys me 'cuz while that's a real style of buns, most buns eaten by chinese people are filled. anyway, the style and price were disappointing, and i had to stand in like for maybe an hour to get them (at fort mason). when i got them tho, they really were quite tasty. they may not be the most authentically chinese buns, but they're at least chinese food-inspired, seems to be made of high quality ingredients, and tastes really good they also have iced drinks, which are really good as well. if you can get over the price, the wait, and the style, this truck is excellent. i LOVE food trucks, and this is a good one

I had the crispy garlic tofu steamed bun today and was less than impressed. ?There was nothing wrong with the bun, taste wise, but it wasn't anything special either. ?Luckily, I had no wait, so perhaps that's why there's two stars in my review rather than one. ?The big problem with the bun was the price. ?$3.25 for what was a two bite snack is nuts. ?At $1.50, I'd probably give the bun a 3 or 4 star, so this rating is really more about the value than the quality of the food. ?Also, perhaps the meat buns are better/worth the price. ?So for an expensive snack that was just average in taste, I can't do better than two stars.

I was excited to try this truck because I heard so many great reviews. It was a windy and rainy day at the Spice of Life Festival but it didn't matter, I was determined to try their buns. We paid about 10 dollars for 2 buns, one baked and one steamed. I thought the wait in the rain was going to be worth it but man was I disappointed. The food was not what I expected it to be. There was no heat, literally ice cold, to any of the food. The topping to the teeny tiny steamed "bun" (more like a taco) was overwhelming and made the pork belly disappear under the pickled mustard. The portion size for the baked bun was nice but it was hardly a bun and more like a hamburger. Disappointing. It too was ice cold and whatever heat was left from the pork had disappeared along with my excitement. The daikon overwhelmed the pork and it seemed just A OK. Would I try it another day? Sure, why not. Would I recommend it? Probably not.

Good, but are you worth the wait? Probably not - but if you have a short line I'll eat you. Don't waste your time on the other buns, my favorite is the pork belly - sure I'm a pork belly fanatic so I'm a little swayed there, but any bite of any crispy pork belly in a bun had me at "hello". Either their pricing is inconsistent or their pricing has gone up, sigh...to add on evil to more evil.

This is probably the best food truck I have tasted so far. ?I went to the 5th & Minna Off the Grid and tried it for the first time. ?I got the pork belly and the sesame chicken steamed buns. ?The pork belly was tender and flavorful and the pickled radish that came with it made for a perfect combination. ?The chicken sesame was tangy with crunchy carrots and greens. ?They were both delicious. ?The only thing docking a star is the prices. ?It was $7 for two tiny buns. I am going to have to have an afternoon snack. To be full, I think I need 4 of those steamed buns. ?Maybe next time, I will try the baked buns and hopefully I will be filled up much better.

Was disappointed that I didn't get to try their duck bao, but I did try 4 of their steamed baos and I have to say, THEY ARE MIGHTY DELISH! 5 STARS for the Bao, 3 Stars for the price. At about $3.25-$3.75 and $6-7 for the baked, I rather get my money's worth and just try 1 of each. The Pork Belly steamed bao was my favorite. Fatty, salty, with the nice warm bao definitely gives you a jolt with the first bite. I am a fan!

Dude..this truck is awesome..I'm not a fan of these food trucks because they all seem to just take some ethnic food and wrap it in a tortilla. That's where chairman bao differs.

pretty sure i've tried all their bao meats whether in a steamed or baked bun. while the baos themselves are tasty, the price for what you get plus the wait bring down my rating. seriously, you could have a whole peking duck (with the steamed buns) for 20-30 bucks and here they charge like 3.50-4 for just one bao. i was embarrassed when i was waiting for my order when the truck was parked on clement st and some chinese ppl walked by and were like, "dang, four bucks for a bao?" not a deal. and not worth revisiting. come on, there are no chinese ppl running the truck. that should tell you something. =P

Came across this place as my friends and I stumbled out of John Collins last night. Even though I'd suggested trying some buns on the way into the bar, and at least three times on the way out, one of my friends (possibly more stumbly than the rest) had a sudden and urgent epiphany that she was starving and we absolutely HAD to get some food there, just as we were starting to walk away. There were four of us total, in various states of inebriation, so actually reading the menu wasn't working out for us and I finally made the call to just order two of everything. For that reason I'm not exactly sure WHAT we ate, but I know that it was all amazing. And probably would have been just as amazing had we been sober. Somewhere in the commotion of all of us realizing we needed one more trip to the bar's bathroom before hailing a cab, the stumbliest friend dropped one of the four boxes of baos she'd been trying to balance. As we promised at the time, I just want to give a shout out to Chairman Bao employee Guillermo (hope I spelled your name right...) for noticing what happened and replacing our fallen food for free. Loved the food either way, but probably wouldn't have written the review if not for that.
